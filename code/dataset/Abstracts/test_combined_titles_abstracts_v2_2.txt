Abstract2class: Biosynthetic potential-based strain prioritization for natural product discovery: a showcase for diterpenoid-producing actinomycetes Abstract: Natural products remain the best sources of drugs and drug leads and serve as outstanding small-molecule probes to dissect fundamental biological processes. A great challenge for the natural product community is to discover novel natural products efficiently and cost effectively. Here we report the development of a practical method to survey biosynthetic potential in microorganisms, thereby identifying the most promising strains and prioritizing them for natural product discovery. Central to our approach is the innovative preparation, by a two-tiered PCR method, of a pool of pathway-specific probes, thereby allowing the survey of all variants of the biosynthetic machineries for the targeted class of natural products. The utility of the method was demonstrated by surveying 100 strains, randomly selected from our actinomycete collection, for their biosynthetic potential of four classes of natural products, aromatic polyketides, reduced polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and diterpenoids, identifying 16 talented strains. One of the talented strains, Streptomyces griseus CB00830, was finally chosen to showcase the discovery of the targeted classes of natural products, resulting in the isolation of three diterpenoids, six nonribosomal peptides and related metabolites, and three polyketides. Variations of this method should be applicable to the discovery of other classes of natural products.	0
Abstract2class: Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714 Abstract: In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Abstract2class: Improved method for polynucleotide probe-based cell sorting, using DNA-coated microplates Abstract: We developed an improved method for cultivation-independent sorting of bacterial cells. The technique is based on labeling the target cells by in situ hybridization with polynucleotide transcript probes. Due to the probes' length, part of the probe remains outside the cell and can subsequently be used to capture the cells. Target cells are immobilized during a second hybridization step in microplates that are coated with DNA that is complementary to the probe sequence. The method was applied successfully to artificial mixtures of cells with polynucleotide probes targeting either rRNA, a plasmid-borne beta-lactamase gene, or a chromosome-borne glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Cells could be separated based on phylogenetic parameters (using rRNA-targeted probes) as well as on other DNA-encoded traits.	0
Abstract2class: Lasso Peptide Benenodin-1 Is a Thermally Actuated [1]Rotaxane Switch Abstract: Mechanically interlocked molecules that change their conformation in response to stimuli have been developed by synthetic chemists as building blocks for molecular machines. Here we describe a natural product, the lasso peptide benenodin-1, which exhibits conformational switching between two distinct threaded conformers upon actuation by heat. We have determined the structures of both conformers and have characterized the kinetics and energetics of the conformational switch. Single amino acid substitutions to benenodin-1 generate peptides that are biased to a single conformer, showing that the switching behavior is potentially an evolvable trait in these peptides. Lasso peptides such as benenodin-1 can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes called lasso peptide isopeptidases. We show that only the native conformer of benenodin-1 is cleaved by its cognate isopeptidase. Thus, thermally induced conformational switching of benenodin-1 may also be relevant to the biological function of these molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Vitamin B12 partners the CarH repressor to downregulate a photoinducible promoter in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: A light-inducible promoter, P(B), drives expression of the carB operon in Myxococcus xanthus. Repressed by CarA in the dark, P(B) is activated when CarS, produced in the light, sequesters CarA to prevent operator-CarA binding. The MerR-type, N-terminal domain of CarA, which mediates interactions with both operator and CarS, is linked to a C-terminal oligomerization module with a predicted cobalamin-binding motif. Here, we show that although CarA does bind vitamin B12, mutating the motif involved has no effect on its ability to repress P(B). Intriguingly, P(B) could be repressed in the dark even with no CarA, so long as B12 and an intact CarA operator were present. We have discovered that this effect of B12 depends on the gene immediately downstream of carA. Its product, CarH, also consists of a MerR-type, N-terminal domain that specifically recognizes the CarA operator and CarS, linked to a predicted B12-binding C-terminal oligomerization module. The B12-mediated repression of P(B) in the dark is relieved by deleting carH, by mutating the DNA- or B12-binding residues of CarH, or by illumination. Our findings unveil parallel regulatory circuits that control a light-inducible promoter using a transcriptional factor repertoire that includes a paralogous gene pair and vitamin B12.	1
Abstract2class: A chelator-free multifunctional [64Cu]CuS nanoparticle platform for simultaneous micro-PET/CT imaging and photothermal ablation therapy Abstract: We synthesized and evaluated a novel class of chelator-free [(64)Cu]CuS nanoparticles (NPs) suitable both for PET imaging and as photothermal coupling agents for photothermal ablation. These [(64)Cu]CuS NPs are simple to make, possess excellent stability, and allow robust noninvasive micro-PET imaging. Furthermore, the CuS NPs display strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region (peak at 930 nm); passive targeting prefers the tumor site, and mediated ablation of U87 tumor cells occurs upon exposure to NIR light both in vitro and in vivo after either intratumoral or intravenous injection. The combination of small diameter (∼11 nm), strong NIR absorption, and integration of (64)Cu as a structural component makes these [(64)Cu]CuS NPs ideally suited for multifunctional molecular imaging and therapy.	0
Abstract2class: Farnesides A and B, sesquiterpenoid nucleoside ethers from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372 from Fiji Abstract: Farnesides A and B (1, 2), linear sesquiterpenoids connected by ether links to a ribose dihydrouracil nucleoside, were isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372, grown in saline liquid culture. The structures of the new compounds were assigned by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis primarily involving 1D and 2D NMR analysis and by comparison of spectroscopic data to the recently reported ribose nucleoside JBIR-68 (3). The farnesides are only the second example of this exceedingly rare class of microbial terpenoid nucleoside metabolites. Farneside A (1) was found to have modest antimalarial activity against the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.	0
Abstract2class: Atlas of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthetic pathways reveals common occurrence of nonmodular enzymes Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are a diverse group of natural products with complex chemical structures and enormous pharmaceutical potential. They are synthesized on modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme complexes by a conserved thiotemplate mechanism. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of NRPS and PKS genetic machinery across the three domains of life with the discovery of 3,339 gene clusters from 991 organisms, by examining a total of 2,699 genomes. These gene clusters display extraordinarily diverse organizations, and a total of 1,147 hybrid NRPS/PKS clusters were found. Surprisingly, 10% of bacterial gene clusters lacked modular organization, and instead catalytic domains were mostly encoded as separate proteins. The finding of common occurrence of nonmodular NRPS differs substantially from the current classification. Sequence analysis indicates that the evolution of NRPS machineries was driven by a combination of common descent and horizontal gene transfer. We identified related siderophore NRPS gene clusters that encoded modular and nonmodular NRPS enzymes organized in a gradient. A higher frequency of the NRPS and PKS gene clusters was detected from bacteria compared with archaea or eukarya. They commonly occurred in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria in bacteria and the phylum of Ascomycota in fungi. The majority of these NRPS and PKS gene clusters have unknown end products highlighting the power of genome mining in identifying novel genetic machinery for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Reconstitution of functional mycobacterial arabinosyltransferase AftC proteoliposome and assessment of decaprenylphosphorylarabinose analogues as arabinofuranosyl donors Abstract: Arabinosyltransferases are a family of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the arabinan segment of two key glycoconjugates, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, in the mycobacterial cell wall. All arabinosyltransferases identified have been found to be essential for the growth of Mycobcterium tuberculosis and are potential targets for developing new antituberculosis drugs. Technical bottlenecks in designing enzyme assays for screening for inhibitors of these enzymes are (1) the enzymes are membrane proteins and refractory to isolation; and (2) the sole arabinose donor, decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinofuranose is sparingly produced and difficult to isolate, and commercial substrates are not available. In this study, we have synthesized several analogues of decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinofuranose by varying the chain length and investigated their arabinofuranose (Araf) donating capacity. In parallel, an essential arabinosyltransferase (AftC), an enzyme that introduces α-(1→3) branch points in the internal arabinan domain in both arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan synthesis, has been expressed, solubilized, and purified for the first time. More importantly, it has been shown that the AftC is active only when reconstituted in a proteoliposome using mycobacterial phospholipids and has a preference for diacylated phosphatidylinositoldimannoside (Ac(2)PIM(2)), a major cell wall associated glycolipid. α-(1→3) branched arabinans were generated when AftC-liposome complex was used in assays with the (Z,Z)-farnesylphosphoryl d-arabinose and linear α-d-Araf-(1→5)(3-5) oligosaccharide acceptors and not with the acceptor that had a α-(1→3) branch point preintroduced.	0
Abstract2class: Highly thermostable endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (laminarinase) LamA from Thermotoga neapolitana: nucleotide sequence of the gene and characterization of the recombinant gene product Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of clone pTT26 (3786 bp), containing the gene for 1,3-beta-glucanase LamA (laminarinase) from Thermotoga neapolitana, was determined. It contains an ORF encoding a protein of 646 aa (73328 Da). The central part of the protein is homologous to the complete catalytic domain of bacterial and some eukaryotic endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanases and belongs to family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases. This domain is flanked on both sides by one copy on each side of a substrate binding domain homologue (family II). The recombinant laminarinase protein was purified from Escherichia coli host cells in two forms, a 73 kDa and a processed 52 kDa protein, both having high specific activity towards laminarin (3100 and 2600 U mg-1, respectively) and K(m) values of 2.8 and 2.2 mg ml-1, respectively. Limited activity on 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan (lichenan) was detected (90 U mg-1). Laminarin was degraded in an endoglucanase modus, yielding glucose, laminaribiose and -triose as end products. Thus LamA classifies as an endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6). The optimum temperature of the enzymes was 95 degrees C (73 kDa) and 85 degrees C (52 kDa) at an optimum pH of 6.2. The superior thermostability of the 73 kDa enzyme is demonstrated by incubation without substrate at 100 degrees C, where 57% of the initial activity remained after 30 min (82% at 95 degrees C). Thus, LamA is the most thermostable 1,3-beta-glucanase described to date.	0
Abstract2class: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. II. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of 3-alkoxycarbonylmethoxy-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)-acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: The synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats of 3-alkoxycarbonyl-methoxy-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins (1) are described. In this cephalosporin series, 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(carboxy-methoxyimino)acetamid o] cephalosporins (1b, 1i and 1j) with a lower alkoxycarbonylmethoxy group at the C-3 position of a cephem nucleus exhibited not only potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria but also good oral absorption in rats. Structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Abstract2class: Evolution of siderophore pathways in human pathogenic bacteria Abstract: Ornibactin and malleobactin are hydroxamate siderophores employed by human pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. Similarities in their structures and corresponding biosynthesis gene clusters strongly suggest an evolutionary relationship. Through gene coexpression and targeted gene manipulations, the malleobactin pathway was successfully morphed into an ornibactin assembly line. Such an evolutionary-guided approach has been unprecedented for nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Furthermore, the timing of amino acid acylation before peptide assembly, the absolute configuration of the ornibactin side chain, and the function of the acyl transferase were elucidated. Beyond providing a proof of principle for the rational design of siderophore pathways, a compelling model for the evolution of virulence traits is presented.	1
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the biosynthesis of the methane catalyst coenzyme F430 Abstract: Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.	1
Abstract2class: Bioinformatic Expansion and Discovery of Thiopeptide Antibiotics Abstract: Thiopeptides are members of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide family of natural products. Most characterized thiopeptides display nanomolar potency toward Gram-positive bacteria by blocking protein translation with several being produced at the industrial scale for veterinary and livestock applications. Employing our custom bioinformatics program, RODEO, we expand the thiopeptide family of natural products by a factor of four. This effort revealed many new thiopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters with products predicted to be distinct from characterized thiopeptides and identified gene clusters for previously characterized molecules of unknown biosynthetic origin. To further validate our data set of predicted thiopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters, we isolated and characterized a structurally unique thiopeptide featuring a central piperidine and rare thioamide moiety. Termed saalfelduracin, this thiopeptide displayed potent antibiotic activity toward several drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. A combination of whole-genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and heterologous expression experiments confirmed that the thioamide moiety of saalfelduracin is installed post-translationally by the joint action of two proteins, TfuA and YcaO. These results reconcile the previously unknown origin of the thioamide in two long-known thiopeptides, thiopeptin and Sch 18640. Armed with these new insights into thiopeptide chemical-genomic space, we provide a roadmap for the discovery of additional members of this natural product family.	1
Abstract2class: Lacticin 481 synthetase as a general serine/threonine kinase Abstract: Methods that introduce posttranslational modifications in a general, mild, and non-sequence-specific manner using biologically produced peptides have great utility for investigation of the functions of these modifications. In this study, the substrate promiscuity of a lantibiotic synthetase was exploited for the preparation of phosphopeptides, glycopeptides, and peptides containing analogs of methylated or acetylated lysine residues. Peptides attached to the C-terminus of the leader peptide of the lacticin 481 precursor peptide were phosphorylated on serine residues in a wide variety of sequence contexts by the R399M and T405A mutants of lacticin 481 synthetase (LctM). Serine residues located as many as 30 amino acids C-terminal to the leader peptide were phosphorylated. Wild-type LctM was shown to dehydrate these peptides to generate dehydroalanine-containing products that can be conveniently modified with external nucleophiles including thiosaccharides, 2-(dimethylamino)ethanethiol, and N-acetyl cysteamine, resulting in mimics of O-linked glycopeptides and acetylated and methylated lysines.	0
Abstract2class: A theoretical study of the structure of parathyroid hormone Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the tertiary and secondary structure of parathyroid hormone was conducted. By combining interpretations from this analysis with chemical data available in the literature, certain structural features of the hormone are consistently predicted. The proposed model for the hormone contains two domains dominated by hydrophobic clustering of critical residues within each domain and separated by an exposed linker region. In the prediction of two domains with a linker region, the model is similar to that proposed by Fiskin et al. [Fiskin, A.M., Cohn, D.M. & Peterson, G.S. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8261-8268], but it differs significantly in other respects. The proposed structural features are apparent in the bovine, human, and porcine species of hormone.	0

Abstract2class: Two-Step Synthesis of Heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6 .03,13 .04,11 .05,9 .010,14 ] tetradecane from Norbornadiene: Mechanism of the Cage Assembly and Post-synthetic Functionalization Abstract: A selective and scalable two-step approach to the dimerization of norbornadiene (NBD) into its thermodynamically most stable dimer, heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6 .03,13 .04,11 .05,9 .010,14 ] tetradecane, (HCTD) is reported. Calculations indicate that the reaction starts with the Rh-catalyzed stepwise homo Diels-Alder cyclisation of NBD into its exo-cis-endo dimer. Treatment of this compound with acid promotes its evolution to HCTD via a [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The assemblies of 7,12-disubstituted cages from 7-(alkyl/aryl) NBDs, as well as the selective post-synthetic C-H functionalization of the core HCTD scaffold at position C1, or positions C1 and C4 are described.	0
Abstract2class: Evaluation of Virulence Factors In vitro, Resistance to Osmotic Stress and Antifungal Susceptibility of Candida tropicalis Isolated from the Coastal Environment of Northeast Brazil Abstract: Several studies have been developed regarding human health risks associated with the recreational use of beaches contaminated with domestic sewage. These wastes contain various micro-organisms, including Candida tropicalis. In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize C. tropicalis isolates from the sandy beach of Ponta Negra, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, regarding the expression of in vitro virulence factors, adaptation to osmotic stress and susceptibility to antifungal drugs. We analyzed 62 environmental isolates and observed a great variation among them for the various virulence factors evaluated. In general, environmental isolates were more adherent to human buccal epithelial cells (HBEC) than C. tropicalis ATCC13803 reference strain, and they also showed increased biofilm production. Most of the isolates presented wrinkled phenotypes on Spider medium (34 isolates, 54.8%). The majority of the isolates also showed higher proteinase production than control strains, but low phospholipase activity. In addition, 35 isolates (56.4%) had high hemolytic activity (hemolysis index > 0.55). With regard to C. tropicalis resistance to osmotic stress, 85.4% of the isolates were able to grow in a liquid medium containing 15% sodium chloride. The strains were highly resistant to the azoles tested (fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole). Fifteen strains were resistant to the three azoles tested (24.2%). Some strains were also resistant to amphotericin B (14 isolates; 22.6%), while all of them were susceptible for the echinocandins tested, except for a single strain of intermediate susceptibility to micafungin. Our results demonstrate that C. tropicalis isolated from the sand can fully express virulence attributes and showed a high persistence capacity on the coastal environment; in addition of showing high minimal inhibitory concentrations to several antifungal drugs used in current clinical practice, demonstrating that environmental isolates may have pathogenic potential.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and Heterologous Production of Vioprolides: Rational Biosynthetic Engineering and Unprecedented 4-Methylazetidinecarboxylic Acid Formation Abstract: Vioprolides are a promising class of anticancer and antifungal lead compounds produced by the myxobacterium Cystobacter violaceus Cb vi35. Previously nothing had been reported about their biosynthesis, including the origin of the unusual 4-methylazetidinecarboxylic acid (MAZ) moiety. We describe the vioprolide biosynthetic gene cluster and solve the production obstacle by expression in three heterologous hosts. Starting from unstable production in the wild type at the single-digit mg L-1 scale, we developed a stable host that eventually allowed for yields of up to half a gram per liter in fermenters. Gene inactivations coupled with isotope feeding studies identified an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme and a methyltransferase as being responsible for the generation of the MAZ building block by a proposed mechanism unprecedented in bacteria. Furthermore, nonnatural vioprolide derivatives were generated via rational genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. Discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. As a unique class II lantibiotic, bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. By using its precursor BovA as a drive sequence, 16 BovA-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. From them, three representative novel lan loci from Clostridium perfringens D str. JGS1721, Bacillus cereus As 1.348 and B. thuringiensis As 1.013 were identified by PCR screening. The corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. Further analysis indicated that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin HJ50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. This study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: p63(+)Krt5(+) distal airway stem cells are essential for lung regeneration Abstract: Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis involve the progressive and inexorable destruction of oxygen exchange surfaces and airways, and have emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide. Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden, massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome often recover full pulmonary function within six months. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process. Here we show that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation of a new antibacterial peptide actinokineosin from Actinokineospora spheciospongiae based on genome mining Abstract: Based on genome mining, a new antibacterial peptide named actinokineosin was isolated from a rare actinomycete Actinokineospora spheciospongiae. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminus of actinokineosin was established by TOF-MS/MS experiments. The amino acid sequence in the macrolactam ring was determined by TOF-MS/MS analyses after cleavage with BNPS-skatole and successive trypsin treatment. As a result of an antibacterial assay using a paper disk, actinokineosin showed antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus at a dosage of 50 μg per disk. From the genome sequence data of A. spheciospongiae, the biosynthetic gene cluster of actinokineosin was found and was indicated to consist of 10 genes. Among the genes, the gene aknA encoded the precursor of actinokineosin and the genes including aknC, aknB1 and aknB2 were proposed as modification enzymes to give mature actinokineosin.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Genome mining is a powerful tool to find new bioactive compounds from the genome database. In this report, we succeeded in isolation and structure determination of a new antibacterial peptide named actinokineosin based on genome mining.	1

The gene cluster for quinolidomicin was cloned and heterologously expressed. Confirmation of the product led to a structural revision, in which the hydroxy group in the chromophore moiety of the reported structure was replaced by an amine group.	1
Abstract2class: Validating fragment-based drug discovery for biological RNAs: lead fragments bind and remodel the TPP riboswitch specifically Abstract: Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitches regulate essential genes in bacteria by changing conformation upon binding intracellular TPP. Previous studies using fragment-based approaches identified small molecule "fragments" that bind this gene-regulatory mRNA domain. Crystallographic studies now show that, despite having micromolar Kds, four different fragments bind the TPP riboswitch site-specifically, occupying the pocket that recognizes the aminopyrimidine of TPP. Unexpectedly, the unoccupied site that would recognize the pyrophosphate of TPP rearranges into a structure distinct from that of the cognate complex. This idiosyncratic fragment-induced conformation, also characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering and chemical probing, represents a possible mechanism for adventitious ligand discrimination by the riboswitch, and suggests that off-pathway conformations of RNAs can be targeted for drug development. Our structures, together with previous screening studies, demonstrate the feasibility of fragment-based drug discovery against RNA targets.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of envelope polypeptides by Haemophilus influenzae during development of competence for genetic transformation Abstract: Six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 95,000, 90,000, 80,000, 67,000, 64,000, and 43,000 were found to be characteristic of the cell envelopes of competent Haemophilus influenzae, and were synthesized entirely during the period of competence development. Two polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 58,500 and 40,500 were synthesized during growth as well as during competence development, but were only associated with the envelope fraction of cells that had developed competence. The kinetics of synthesis of the competence-related envelope polypeptides showed a lag period of approximately 20 min. The observation of this lag period raises the question as to whether some of these competence-related polypeptides might be involved in the process of deoxyribonucleic acid uptake, since the development of this property also exhibits a sigmoid time course during competence development.	0
Abstract2class: Overview of genomic and bioinformatic resources for Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: Zymoseptoria tritici (syn. Mycosphaerella graminicola, Septoria tritici) is a haploid fungus belonging to the class Dothideomycetes. It is the causal agent of septoria leaf blotch - one of the world's most significant diseases of wheat. Here we review the genomic and bioinformatic resources that have been generated for Z. tritici. These include the whole-genome reference assembly for isolate IPO323, genome resequencing of alternate isolates, mitochondrial genome sequences, transcriptome sequences and expression data, and annotations of gene structure and function. We also highlight important advances in our fundamental knowledge of genome evolution and its effects on adaptation and pathogenicity in Z. tritici that have been facilitated by these resources.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and functional analysis of a marine bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster and astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway proposed at the gene level Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of astaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Agrobacterium aurantiacum. This cluster contained five carotenogenic genes with the same orientation, which were designated crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, and crtB. The stop codons of individual crt genes except for crtB overlapped the start codons of the following crt genes. Escherichia coli transformants carrying the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthesis genes provide suitable substrates for carotenoid biosynthesis. The functions of the five crt genes of A. aurantiacum were determined through chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses of the pigments accumulated in some E. coli transformants carrying various combinations of the E. uredovora and A. aurantiacum carotenogenic genes. As a result, the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the first time at the level of the biosynthesis genes. The crtW and crtZ gene products, which mediated the oxygenation reactions from beta-carotene to astaxanthin, were found to have low substrate specificity. This allowed the production of many presumed intermediates of astaxanthin, i.e., adonixanthin, phoenicoxanthin (adonirubin), canthaxanthin, 3'-hydroxyechinenone, and 3-hydroxyechinenone.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and heterologous expression of the cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster afford a diterpene cyclase and two p450 hydroxylases Abstract: Cyclooctatin, a diterpene characterized by a 5-8-5 fused ring system, is a potent inhibitor of lysophospholipase. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces melanosporofaciens MI614-43F2 and heterologous production of cyclooctatin in S. albus. Sequence analysis coupled with subcloning and gene deletion revealed that the minimal cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster consists of four genes, cotB1 to cotB4, encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthase, terpene cyclase (CotB2), and two cytochromes P450, respectively. Incubation of the recombinant CotB2 with GGDP resulted in the formation of cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol, an unprecedented tricyclic diterpene alcohol. The present study establishes the complete biosynthetic pathway of cyclooctatin and provides insights into both the stereospecific diterpene cyclization mechanism of the GGDP cyclase and the molecular bases for the stereospecific and regiospecific hydroxylation.	1
Abstract2class: Reconstitution of F factor DNA replication in vitro with purified proteins Abstract: Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin pioneered the development of the F plasmid as a model system to study replication control, and these investigations led to the development of the "replicon model" (Jacob, F., Brenner, S., and Cuzin, F. (1964) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 28, 329-348). To elucidate further the mechanism of initiation of replication of this plasmid and its control, we have reconstituted its replication in vitro with 21 purified host-encoded proteins and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The replication in vitro was specifically initiated at the F ori (oriV) and required both the bacterial initiator protein DnaA and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The wild type dimeric RepE was inactive in catalyzing replication, whereas a monomeric mutant form called RepE(*) (R118P) was capable of catalyzing vigorous replication. The replication topology was mostly of the Cairns form, and the fork movement was unidirectional and mostly from right to left. The replication was dependent on the HU protein, and the structurally and functionally related DNA bending protein IHF could not efficiently substitute for HU. The priming was dependent on DnaG primase. Many of the characteristics of the in vitro replication closely mimicked those of in vivo replication. We believe that the in vitro system should be very useful in unraveling the mechanism of replication initiation and its control.	0
Abstract2class: Estimation of the available free energy in a LOV2-J alpha photoswitch Abstract: Protein photosensors are versatile tools for studying ligand-regulated allostery and signaling. Fundamental to these processes is the amount of energy that can be provided by a photosensor to control downstream signaling events. Such regulation is exemplified by the phototropins--plant serine/threonine kinases that are activated by blue light via conserved LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domains. The core photosensor of oat phototropin 1 is a LOV domain that interacts in a light-dependent fashion with an adjacent alpha-helix (J alpha) to control kinase activity. We used solution NMR measurements to quantify the free energy of the LOV domain-J alpha-helix binding equilibrium in the dark and lit states. These data indicate that light shifts this equilibrium by approximately 3.8 kcal mol(-1), thus quantifying the energy available through LOV-J alpha for light-driven allosteric regulation. This study provides insight into the energetics of light sensing by phototropins and benchmark values for engineering photoswitchable systems based on the LOV-J alpha interaction.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of a C-methyltransferase gene (aviG1) involved in avilamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and complementation of a Saccharopolyspora erythraea eryBIII mutant by aviG1 Abstract: Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the principal producer of avilamycin A. aviG1, a putative methyltransferase gene, was detected in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. To determine the function of aviG1, a targeted gene inactivation experiment was performed. The resulting chromosomal mutant, carrying an in-frame deletion in aviG1, was deficient in avilamycin production. aviG1 was used to complement an eryBIII mutant of the erythromycin A producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea [Gaisser, S., Bohm, G. A., Doumith, M., Raynal, M. C., Dhillon, N., Cortes, J. & Leadlay, P. F. (1998). Mol Gen Genet 258, 78-88]. The presence of erythromycin A in the culture supernatant of the complemented mutant indicated that L-mycarose biosynthesis could be restored and that AviG1 could take over the function of the C-methyltransferase EryBIII.	1
Abstract2class: Co-Occurrence of Listeria spp. and Spoilage Associated Microbiota During Meat Processing Due to Cross-Contamination Events Abstract: A large part of foodborne outbreaks related to Listeria monocytogenes are linked to meat and meat products. Especially, recontamination of meat products and deli-meat during slicing, packaging, and repackaging is in the focus of food authorities. In that regard, L. monocytogenes persistence in multi-species biofilms is one major issue, since they survive elaborate cleaning and disinfection measures. Here, we analyzed the microbial community structure throughout a meat processing facility using a combination of high-throughput full-length 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and traditional microbiological methods. Samples were taken at different stages during meat cutting as well as from multiple sites throughout the facility environment to capture the product and the environmental associated microbiota co-occurring with Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. The listeria testing revealed a widely disseminated contamination (50%; 88 of 176 samples were positive for Listeria spp. and 13.6%; 24 of 176 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes). The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing evidenced 14 heterogeneous L. monocytogenes profiles with PCR-serogroup 1/2a, 3a as most dominant. PFGE type MA3-17 contributed to the resilient microbiota of the facility environment and was related to environmental persistence. The core in-house microbiota consisted mainly of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter (Proteobacteria), Anaerobacillus, Bacillus (Firmicutes), and Chryseobacterium (Bacteroidota). While the overall microbial community structure clearly differed between product and environmental samples, we were able to discern correlation patterns regarding the presence/absence of Listeria spp. in both sample groups. Specifically, our longitudinal analysis revealed association of Listeria spp. with known biofilm-producing Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Janthinobacterium species on the meat samples. Similar patterns were also observed on the surface, indicating dispersal of microorganisms from this multispecies biofilm. Our data provided a better understanding of the built environment microbiome in the meat processing context and promoted more effective options for targeted disinfection in the analyzed facility.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular Genetic Characterization of an Anthrabenzoxocinones Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Sp. FJS31-2 for the Biosynthesis of BE-24566B and Zunyimycin Ale Abstract: Genome mining is an effective tool used to discover novel natural products from actinomycetes. Genome sequence analysis of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 revealed the presence of one putative type II polyketide gene cluster (ABX), which may correspond to type II polyketide products including BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives. The addition of natural humus acid successfully activated the biosynthsis of the abx gene cluster. BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives, named zunyimycin A, were also detected. The targeted deletion of the polyketide skeleton synthesis genes such as abxp, abxk, and abxs was performed in the wild strain to identify the gene cluster for BE-24566B biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. VI. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral efficacy in mice of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)-acetamido]-3- (substituted alkylthio)cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted alkylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephem nucleus were prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats. Of these, the cephalosporin with a cyanomethylthio group (1a) showed the greatest activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Its pivaloyloxymethyl ester (6a), a representative prodrug, exhibited good in vivo efficacy in mice by oral administration. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Abstract2class: DNA damage recognition of mutated forms of UvrB proteins in nucleotide excision repair Abstract: The DNA repair protein UvrB plays an indispensable role in the stepwise and sequential damage recognition of nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli. Our previous studies suggested that UvrB is responsible for the chemical damage recognition only upon a strand opening mediated by UvrA. Difficulties were encountered in studying the direct interaction of UvrB with adducts due to the presence of UvrA. We report herein that a single point mutation of Y95W in which a tyrosine is replaced by a tryptophan results in an UvrB mutant that is capable of efficiently binding to structure-specific DNA adducts even in the absence of UvrA. This mutant is fully functional in the UvrABC incisions. The dissociation constant for the mutant-DNA adduct interaction was less than 100 nM at physiological temperatures as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. In contrast, similar substitutions at other residues in the beta-hairpin with tryptophan or phenylalanine do not confer UvrB such binding ability. Homology modeling of the structure of E. coli UvrB shows that the aromatic ring of residue Y95 and only Y95 directly points into the DNA binding cleft. We have also examined UvrB recognition of both "normal" bulky BPDE-DNA and protein-cross-linked DNA (DPC) adducts and the roles of aromatic residues of the beta-hairpin in the recognition of these lesions. A mutation of Y92W resulted in an obvious decrease in the efficiency of UvrABC incisions of normal adducts, while the incision of the DPC adduct is dramatically increased. Our results suggest that Y92 may function differently with these two types of adducts, while the Y95 residue plays an unique role in stabilizing the interaction of UvrB with DNA damage, most likely by a hydrophobic stacking.	0
Abstract2class: Repurposing the Pummerer Rearrangement: Determination of Methionine Sulfoxides in Peptides Abstract: The reversible oxidation of methionine residues in proteins has emerged as a biologically important post-translational modification. However, detection and quantitation of methionine sulfoxide in proteins is difficult. Our aim is to develop a method for specifically derivatizing methionine sulfoxide residues. We report a Pummerer rearrangement of methionine sulfoxide treated sequentially with trimethylsilyl chloride and then 2-mercaptoimidazole or pyridine-2-thiol to produce a dithioacetal product. This derivative is stable to standard mass spectrometry conditions, and its formation identified oxidized methionine residues. The scope and requirements of dithioacetal formation are reported for methionine sulfoxide and model substrates. The reaction intermediates have been investigated by computational techniques and by 13 C NMR spectroscopy. These provide evidence for an α-chlorinated intermediate. The derivatization allows for detection and quantitation of methionine sulfoxide in proteins by mass spectrometry and potentially by immunochemical methods.	0
Abstract2class: Effects of methanogenic inhibitors on methane production and abundances of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria in in vitro ruminal cultures Abstract: The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of select antimethanogen compounds on methane production, feed digestion and fermentation, and populations of ruminal bacteria and methanogens using in vitro cultures. Seven compounds, including 2-bromoethanesulphonate (BES), propynoic acid (PA), nitroethane (NE), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (ETB), 2-nitroethanol (2NEOH), sodium nitrate (SN), and ethyl-2-butynote (EB), were tested at a final concentration of 12 mM. Ground alfalfa hay was included as the only substrate to simulate daily forage intake. Compared to no-inhibitor controls, PA, 2NEOH, and SN greatly reduced the production of methane (70 to 99%), volatile fatty acids (VFAs; 46 to 66%), acetate (30 to 60%), and propionate (79 to 82%), with 2NEOH reducing the most. EB reduced methane production by 23% without a significant effect on total VFAs, acetate, or propionate. BES significantly reduced the propionate concentration but not the production of methane, total VFAs, or acetate. ETB or NE had no significant effect on any of the above-mentioned measurements. Specific quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assays showed that none of the inhibitors significantly affected total bacterial populations but that they did reduce the Fibrobacter succinogenes population. SN reduced the Ruminococcus albus population, while PA and 2NEOH increased the populations of both R. albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Archaeon-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that all the inhibitors affected the methanogen population structure, while archaeon-specific qPCR revealed a significant decrease in methanogen population in all treatments. These results showed that EB, ETB, NE, and BES can effectively reduce the total population of methanogens but that they reduce methane production to a lesser extent. The results may guide future in vivo studies to develop effective mitigation of methane emission from ruminants.	0
Abstract2class: Metagenomic natural product discovery in lichen provides evidence for a family of biosynthetic pathways in diverse symbioses Abstract: Bacteria are a major source of natural products that provide rich opportunities for both chemical and biological investigation. Although the vast majority of known bacterial metabolites derive from free-living organisms, increasing evidence supports the widespread existence of chemically prolific bacteria living in symbioses. A strategy based on bioinformatic prediction, symbiont cultivation, isotopic enrichment, and advanced analytics was used to characterize a unique polyketide, nosperin, from a lichen-associated Nostoc sp. cyanobacterium. The biosynthetic gene cluster and the structure of nosperin, determined from 30 μg of compound, are related to those of the pederin group previously known only from nonphotosynthetic bacteria associated with beetles and marine sponges. The presence of this natural product family in such highly dissimilar associations suggests that some bacterial metabolites may be specific to symbioses with eukaryotes and encourages exploration of other symbioses for drug discovery and better understanding of ecological interactions mediated by complex bacterial metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Colibrimycins, Novel Halogenated Hybrid Polyketide Synthase-Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase (PKS-NRPS) Compounds Produced by Streptomyces sp. Strain CS147 Abstract: The improvement of genome sequencing techniques has brought to light the biosynthetic potential of actinomycetes due to the large number of gene clusters they present compared to the number of known compounds. Genome mining is a recent strategy in the search for novel bioactive compounds, which involves the analysis of sequenced genomes to identify uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, many of which are cryptic or silent under laboratory conditions, and to develop experimental approaches to identify their products. Owing to the importance of halogenation in terms of structural diversity, bioavailability, and bioactivity, searching for new halogenated bioactive compounds has become an interesting issue in the field of natural product discovery. Following this purpose, a screening for halogenase coding genes was performed on 12 Streptomyces strains isolated from fungus-growing ants of the Attini tribe. Using the bioinformatics tools antiSMASH and BLAST, six halogenase coding genes were identified. Some of these genes were located within biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which were studied by construction of several mutants for the identification of the putative halogenated compounds produced. The comparison of the metabolite production profile of wild-type strains and their corresponding mutants by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-UV and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed us the identification of a novel family of halogenated compounds in Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, designated colibrimycins. IMPORTANCE Genome mining has proven its usefulness in the search for novel bioactive compounds produced by microorganisms, and halogenases comprise an interesting starting point. In this work, we have identified a new halogenase coding gene that led to the discovery of novel lipopetide nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS)-derived natural products, the colibrimycins, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, isolated from the Attini ant niche. Some colibrimycins display an unusual α-ketoamide moiety in the peptide structure. Although its biosynthetic origin remains unknown, its presence might be related to a hypothetical inhibition of virus proteases, and, together with the presence of the halogenase, it represents a feature to be incorporated in the arsenal of structural modifications available for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and heterologous expression of the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster from penicillum chrysogenum Abstract: A cosmid clone containing the putative penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium chrysogenum was used to transform the related filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus niger, which do not produce beta-lactam antibiotics. Both of the transformed hosts contained intact P. chrysogenum DNA derived from the cosmid clone and produced authentic penicillin V. Assays of penicillin biosynthetic enzyme activity additionally demonstrated that they possessed delta-(L-alpha-amino-adipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS), isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) and acyl coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase (ACT) activity. The data suggests that genes encoding all the enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of penicillin from amino acid precursors are closely linked in P. chrysogenum and constitute a gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Thiopeptide biosynthesis featuring ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides and conserved posttranslational modifications Abstract: Thiopeptides, with potent activity against various drug-resistant pathogens, contain a characteristic macrocyclic core consisting of multiple thiazoles, dehydroamino acids, and a 6-membered nitrogen heterocycle. Their biosynthetic pathways remain elusive, in spite of great efforts by in vivo feeding experiments. Here, cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the thiostrepton and siomycin A gene clusters unveiled a biosynthetic paradigm for the thiopeptide specific core formation, featuring ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides and conserved posttranslational modifications. The paradigm generality for thiopeptide biosynthesis was supported by genome mining and ultimate confirmation of the thiocillin I production in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, a strain that was previously unknown as a thiopeptide producer. These findings set the stage to accelerate the discovery of thiopeptides by prediction at the genetic level and to generate structural diversity by applying combinatorial biosynthesis methods.	1

Abstract2class: N-Carboxyanhydride Polymerization of Glycopolypeptides That Activate Antigen-Presenting Cells through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 Abstract: The C-type lectins dectin-1 and dectin-2 contribute to innate immunity against microbial pathogens by recognizing their foreign glycan structures. These receptors are promising targets for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy. However, currently available agonists are heterogeneous glycoconjugates and polysaccharides from natural sources. Herein, we designed and synthesized the first chemically defined ligands for dectin-1 and dectin-2. They comprised glycopolypeptides bearing mono-, di-, and trisaccharides and were built through polymerization of glycosylated N-carboxyanhydrides. Through this approach, we achieved glycopolypeptides with high molecular weights and low dispersities. We identified structures that elicit a pro-inflammatory response through dectin-1 or dectin-2 in antigen-presenting cells. With their native proteinaceous backbones and natural glycosidic linkages, these agonists are attractive for translational applications.	0
Abstract2class: (9βH)-Pimaranes and Derivatives from the Tuber of Icacina trichantha Abstract: New 17-nor-pimaranes (1, 2), (9βH)-pimaranes (3, 4), and 17-nor-(9βH)-pimarane (5) were isolated from the tuber of Icacina trichantha. The structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic and HRMS data. The absolute configurations of 3 and 5 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 5 possesses a unique 19,20-δ-lactone moiety. Compound 3 showed cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma cancer) cells with an IC50 value of 7.04 μM. A plausible biogenetic pathway for compounds 1-5 is proposed.	0
Abstract2class: Critical role of calcium- dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation in PC12 cell membrane depolarization and bradykinin signaling Abstract: PC12 cells respond to a variety of external stimuli such as growth factors, neurotransmitters, and membrane depolarization by activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Here we demonstrate that both depolarization-induced calcium influx and treatment with bradykinin stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Using a tetracycline-controlled expression system in conjunction with a dominant-negative EGFR mutant, we demonstrate that depolarization and bradykinin triggered signals involve EGFR function upstream of SHC and MAP kinase. Furthermore, bradykinin-stimulated EGFR transactivation is critically dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, and when triggered by ionophore treatment, calcium influx is already sufficient to induce EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, our results establish calcium-dependent EGFR transactivation as a signaling mechanism mediating activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in neuronal cell types.	0
Abstract2class: Catalytic Enantioselective Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation: Phosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzylic Ethers via the Oxidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds Abstract: Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, γ-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of the PR-toxin gene cluster in Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium chrysogenum: cross talk of secondary metabolite pathways Abstract: The PR-toxin is a potent mycotoxin produced by Penicillium roqueforti in moulded grains and grass silages and may contaminate blue-veined cheese. The PR-toxin derives from the 15 carbon atoms sesquiterpene aristolochene formed by the aristolochene synthase (encoded by ari1). We have cloned and sequenced a four gene cluster that includes the ari1 gene from P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of the four genes (named prx1 to prx4) resulted in a reduction of 65-75% in the production of PR-toxin indicating that the four genes encode enzymes involved in PR-toxin biosynthesis. Interestingly the four silenced mutants overproduce large amounts of mycophenolic acid, an antitumor compound formed by an unrelated pathway suggesting a cross-talk of PR-toxin and mycophenolic acid production. An eleven gene cluster that includes the above mentioned four prx genes and a 14-TMS drug/H(+) antiporter was found in the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum. This eleven gene cluster has been reported to be very poorly expressed in a transcriptomic study of P. chrysogenum genes under conditions of penicillin production (strongly aerated cultures). We found that this apparently silent gene cluster is able to produce PR-toxin in P. chrysogenum under static culture conditions on hydrated rice medium. Noteworthily, the production of PR-toxin was 2.6-fold higher in P. chrysogenum npe10, a strain deleted in the 56.8kb amplifiable region containing the pen gene cluster, than in the parental strain Wisconsin 54-1255 providing another example of cross-talk between secondary metabolite pathways in this fungus. A detailed PR-toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on all available evidence.	1
Abstract2class: A cluster of structural and regulatory genes for light-induced carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: In the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, several genes for carotenoid synthesis lie together at the carA-carB chromosomal locus and are co-ordinately activated by blue light. A 12-kb DNA stretch from wild-type M. xanthus has been sequenced that includes the entire carA-carB gene cluster. According to sequence analysis, the cluster contains 11 different genes. Intergenic distances are very short or nil (implying translational coupling), giving further support to previous evidence indicating that most (or all) of the genes in the cluster form a single operon. At the promoter region, a potential -35 site for the binding of sigma factors is found. However, the -10 region shows little similarity with analogous sites in other bacterial promoters. Five (possibly six) genes in the carA-carB operon code for enzymes acting on early or late steps of the pathway for carotenoid synthesis. Other genes in the operon show no overall similarity with previously known genes. However, peptide stretches in the predicted products of two genes exhibit strong similarity with the DNA binding domain of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators. At least one of the predicted DNA-binding domains is altered in a mutant strain affected in light-regulation of the car genes.	1
Abstract2class: Lantibiotics from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans Abstract: The lantibiotic nisin has been used as an effective food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens for over 40 y. Despite this successful use, nisin's stability at pH 7 is limited. Herein, we describe a nisin analog encoded on the genome of the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2. This analog termed geobacillin I was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification. Extensive NMR characterization demonstrated that geobacillin I contains seven thioether cross-links, two more than the five cross-links found in nisin and the most cross-links found in any lantibiotic to date. The antimicrobial spectrum of geobacillin I was generally similar to that of nisin A, with increased activity against Streptococcus dysgalactiae, one of the causative agents of bovine mastitis. Geobacillin I demonstrated increased stability compared to nisin A. In addition to geobacillin I, the genome of G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 also contains a class II lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster. The corresponding compound was produced in E. coli, and has a ring topology different than that of any known lantibiotic as determined by tandem mass spectrometry. Interestingly, geobacillin II only demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Bacillus strains. Seven Geobacillus strains were screened for production of the geobacillins using whole-cell MALDI-MS and five were shown to produce geobacillin I, but none produced geobacillin II.	1
Abstract2class: Ruthenium-Catalyzed Reductive Cleavage of Unstrained Aryl-Aryl Bonds: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Study Abstract: Cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds has been found in some important industrial processes, for example, petroleum cracking, and has inspired development of numerous synthetic methods. However, nonpolar unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds remain one of the toughest bonds to be activated. As a detailed study of a fundamental reaction mode, here a full story is described about our development of a Ru-catalyzed reductive cleavage of unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds. A wide range of biaryl compounds that contain directing groups (DGs) at 2,2' positions can serve as effective substrates. Various heterocycles, such as pyridine, quinoline, pyrimidine, and pyrazole, can be employed as DGs. Besides hydrogen gas, other reagents, such as Hantzsch ester, silanes, and alcohols, can be employed as terminal reductants. The reaction is pH neutral and free of oxidants; thus a number of functional groups are tolerated. Notably, a one-pot C-C activation/C-C coupling has been realized. Computational and experimental mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a ruthenium(II) monohydride-mediated C(aryl)-C(aryl) activation and the resting state of the catalyst is a η4-coordinated ruthenium(II) dichloride complex, which could inspire development of other transformations based on this reaction mode.	0
Abstract2class: A putative ABC transporter is involved in negative regulation of biofilm formation by Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes may persist for long periods in food processing environments. In some instances, this may be due to aggregation or biofilm formation. To investigate the mechanism controlling biofilm formation in the food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes, we characterized LM-49, a mutant with enhanced ability of biofilm formation generated via transposon Tn917 mutagenesis of L. monocytogenes 4b G. In this mutant, a Tn917 insertion has disrupted the coding region of the gene encoding a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter permease identical to Lmof2365_1771 (a putative ABC transporter permease) presented in the sequenced strain L. monocytogenes strain 4b F2365. This disrupted gene, denoted lm.G_1771, encoded a protein with 10 transmembrane helices. The revertant, LM-49RE, was obtained by replacing lm.G_1771::Tn917 with lm.G_1771 via homologous recombination. We found that LM-49RE formed the same amount of biofilm biomass as the wild-type strain. Furthermore, transcription of the downstream lm.G_1770 gene was not influenced by the upstream Tn917 insertion, and the presence of Tn917 has no effect on biofilm formation. These results suggest that lm.G_1771 was solely responsible for the negative regulation of biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes 4b G. The immediate gene upstream of lm.G_1771 encoded an ATP-binding protein. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that these two genes were organized into an operon and that their proteins formed an export ABC transporter. Here, we report the characterization of the mutant and identification of a novel ABC transporter that functions in negative regulation of biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes.	0
Abstract2class: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae does not require urease activity to produce acute swine pleuropneumonia Abstract: The role in virulence of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae urease activity was investigated. A urease-negative mutant was isolated following transposon mutagenesis with a mini-Tn10 derivative. Both the parent strain and the urease-negative mutant exhibited identical LD50 values in a murine infection model. Pig challenge confirmed that the urease-negative mutant was fully virulent, since experimental inoculation with 5 x 10(7) colony forming units resulted in an acute disease indistinguishable from that produced by the wild-type strain at the same dose. Our results demonstrate that urease activity is not required for the development of acute pleuropneumonia.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery and Elucidation of the Biosynthesis of Aspernidgulenes: Novel Polyenes from Aspergillus Nidulans by Using Serial Promoter Replacement Abstract: Through serial promoter exchanges, we isolated several novel polyenes, the aspernidgulenes, from Aspergillus nidulans and uncovered their succinct biosynthetic pathway involving only four enzymes. An enoyl reductase (ER)-less highly reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) putatively produces a 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone polyene, which undergoes bisepoxidation, epoxide ring opening, cyclization, and hydrolytic cleavage by three tailoring enzymes to generate aspernidgulene A1 and A2. Our findings demonstrate the prowess of fungal-tailoring enzymes to transform a polyketide scaffold concisely and efficiently into complex structures. Moreover, comparison with citreoviridin and aurovertin biosynthesis suggests that methylation of the α-pyrone hydroxy group by methyltransferase (CtvB or AurB) is the branching point at which the biosynthesis of these two classes of compounds diverge. Therefore, scanning for the presence or absence of the gatekeeping α-pyrone methyltransferase gene in homologous clusters might be a potential way to classify the product bioinformatically as belonging to methylated α-pyrone polyenes or polyenes containing rings derived from the cyclization of the unmethylated 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone, such as 2,3-dimethyl-γ-lactone and oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the gene cluster encoding arthrofactin synthetase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 Abstract: Arthrofactin is a potent cyclic lipopeptide-type biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas sp. MIS38. In this work, an arthrofactin synthetase gene cluster (arf) spanning 38.7 kb was cloned and characterized. Three genes termed arfA, arfB, and arfC encode ArfA, ArfB, and ArfC, containing two, four, and five functional modules, respectively. Each module bears condensation, adenylation, and thiolation domains, like other nonribosomal peptide synthetases. However, unlike most of them, none of the 11 modules possess the epimerization domain responsible for the conversion of amino acid residues from L to D form. Possible L- and D-Leu adenylation domains specifically recognized only L-Leu. Moreover, two thioesterase domains are tandemly located at the C-terminal end of ArfC. These results suggest that ArfA, ArfB, and ArfC assemble to form a unique structure. Gene disruption of arfB impaired arthrofactin production, reduced swarming activity, and enhanced biofilm formation.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation and Characterization of a Thermophilic Strain of Methanosarcina Unable to Use H(2)-CO(2) for Methanogenesis Abstract: A thermophilic strain of Methanosarcina, designated Methanosarcina strain TM-1, was isolated from a laboratory-scale 55 degrees C anaerobic sludge digestor by the Hungate roll-tube technique. Penicillin and d-cycloserine, inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis, were used as selective agents to eliminate contaminating non-methanogens. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 had a temperature optimum for methanogenesis near 50 degrees C and grew at 55 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. Substrates used for methanogenesis and growth by Methanosarcina strain TM-1 were acetate (12-h doubling time), methanol (7- to 10-h doubling time), methanol-acetate mixtures (5-h doubling time), methylamine, and trimethylamine. When radioactively labeled acetate was the sole methanogenic substrate added to the growth medium, it was predominantly split to methane and carbon dioxide. When methanol was also present in the medium, the metabolism of acetate shifted to its oxidation and incorporation into cell material. Electrons derived from acetate oxidation apparently were used to reduce methanol. H(2)-CO(2) was not used for growth and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina strain TM-1. When presented with both H(2)-CO(2) and methanol, Methanosarcina strain TM-1 was capable of limited hydrogen metabolism during growth on methanol, but hydrogen metabolism ceased once the methanol was depleted. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 required a growth factor (or growth factors) present in the supernatant of anaerobic digestor sludge. Growth factor requirements and the inability to use H(2)-CO(2) are characteristics not found in other described Methanosarcina strains. The high numbers of Methanosarcina-like clumps in sludges from thermophilic digestors and the fast generation times reported here for Methanosarcina TM-1 indicate that Methanosarcina may play an important role in thermophilic methanogenesis.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a single gene cluster responsible for methylpendolmycin and pendolmycin biosynthesis in the deep sea bacterium Marinactinospora thermotolerans Abstract: The nine-membered indolactam antibiotics belong to a small group of antibiotics showing broad biological activities. However, the in vivo genetic engineering of compounds of this type has not been performed. Here we report the identification of a single gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of methylpendolmycin and pendolmycin, two members of this family of antibiotics, from the deep sea bacterium Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652. Bioinformatics analysis and gene inactivation, coupled with metabolite characterization, reveal that MpnB, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, MpnC, a cytochrome P450, and MpnD, a prenyltransferase, are sufficient to catalyze the biosynthesis of the two antibiotics from L-Ile (or L-Val), L-Trp, and methionine. MpnD is the first identified enzyme that transfers a C5 prenyl unit in a reverse manner to the C-7 position of a Trp-derived natural product.	1
Abstract2class: De novo generation of singlet oxygen and ammine ligands by photoactivation of a platinum anticancer complex Abstract: Worth the excitement: Highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are generated by photoactivation of the anticancer platinum(IV) complex trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3 )2 (OH)2 (MA)(Py)] (MA=methylamine, Py=pyridine). Singlet oxygen is formed from the hydroxido ligands and not from dissolved oxygen, and ammine ligands are products from the conversion of azido ligands to nitrenes. Both processes can induce oxidation of guanine.	0
Abstract2class: Clavulanic acid biosynthesis and genetic manipulation for its overproduction Abstract: Clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor, is used together with β-lactam antibiotics to create drug mixtures possessing potent antimicrobial activity. In view of the clinical and industrial importance of clavulanic acid, identification of the clavulanic acid biosynthetic pathway and the associated gene cluster(s) in the main producer species, Streptomyces clavuligerus, has been an intriguing research question. Clavulanic acid biosynthesis was revealed to involve an interesting mechanism common to all of the clavam metabolites produced by the organism, but different from that of other β-lactam compounds. Gene clusters involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus occupy large regions of nucleotide sequence in three loci of its genome. In this review, clavulanic acid biosynthesis and the associated gene clusters are discussed, and clavulanic acid improvement through genetic manipulation is explained.	1
Abstract2class: Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type II Polyketide Synthases Abstract: Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large-scale analysis of type II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type II polyketide synthase-derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Reconstitution of Low-Density Lipoproteins with Fatty Acids for the Targeted Delivery of Drugs into Cancer Cells Abstract: Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are a class of nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of therapeutics into aberrant cells that overexpress the LDL receptor. A facile procedure is used for reconstituting the hydrophobic core of LDLs with a binary fatty acid mixture. Facilitated by the tumor targeting capability of the apolipoprotein, the reconstituted, drug-loaded LDLs can effectively target cancer cells that overexpress the LDL receptor while showing minor adverse impact on normal fibroblasts. According to a hypothesized mechanism, the reconstituted LDLs can also enable metabolism-triggered drug release while preventing the payloads from lysosomal degradation. This study demonstrates that LDLs reconstructed with fatty acids hold great promise to serve as effective and versatile nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy.	0
Abstract2class: A Genetically Encoded FRET Sensor for Hypoxia and Prolyl Hydroxylases Abstract: Oxygen is vital for all aerobic life forms. Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) is an important step for controlling the expression of oxygen-regulated genes in metazoan species, thereby constituting a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing and response. Herein, we report a genetically encoded dual-emission ratiometric fluorescent sensor, ProCY, which responds to PHD activities in vitro and in live cells. We demonstrated that ProCY could monitor hypoxia in mammalian cells. By targeting this novel genetically encoded biosensor to the cell nucleus and cytosol, we determined that, under normoxic conditions, the HIF-prolyl hydroxylase activity was mainly confined to the cytosol of HEK 293T cells. The results collectively suggest broad applications of ProCY on the evaluation of hypoxia and PHD activities and understanding of pathways for the control of hypoxic responses.	0
Abstract2class: Stereospecific Cross Couplings To Set Benzylic, All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters in High Enantiopurity Abstract: Asymmetric preparation of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is an important goal. Despite advances in formation of highly enantioenriched products with quaternary stereocenters proximal to a functional group, methods to install quaternary stereocenters isolated from functional groups are limited. Transition metal catalysis offers a potential solution, but prior cross couplings are limited to allylic substrates or deliver little to no enantiomeric enrichment. We report a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura arylation of tertiary benzylic acetates to deliver products with diaryl and triaryl quaternary stereocenters in high yields and ee's. This reaction employs an inexpensive, air-stable Ni(II) salt and commercially available phosphine ligand to transform tertiary alcohol derivatives, which are easily available in exceptional ee, into valuable products with stereoretention.	0
Abstract2class: First Report on Chitin in a Non-Verongiid Marine Demosponge: The Mycale euplectellioides Case Abstract: Sponges (Porifera) are recognized as aquatic multicellular organisms which developed an effective biochemical pathway over millions of years of evolution to produce both biologically active secondary metabolites and biopolymer-based skeletal structures. Among marine demosponges, only representatives of the Verongiida order are known to synthetize biologically active substances as well as skeletons made of structural polysaccharide chitin. The unique three-dimensional (3D) architecture of such chitinous skeletons opens the widow for their recent applications as adsorbents, as well as scaffolds for tissue engineering and biomimetics. This study has the ambitious goal of monitoring other orders beyond Verongiida demosponges and finding alternative sources of naturally prestructured chitinous scaffolds; especially in those demosponge species which can be cultivated at large scales using marine farming conditions. Special attention has been paid to the demosponge Mycale euplectellioides(Heteroscleromorpha: Poecilosclerida: Mycalidae) collected in the Red Sea. For the first time, we present here a detailed study of the isolation of chitin from the skeleton of this sponge, as well as its identification using diverse bioanalytical tools. Calcofluor white staining, Fourier-transform Infrared Spcetcroscopy (FTIR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence microscopy, as well as a chitinase digestion assay were applied in order to confirm with strong evidence the finding of a-chitin in the skeleton of M. euplectellioides. We suggest that the discovery of chitin within representatives of the Mycale genus is a promising step in their evaluation of these globally distributed sponges as new renewable sources for both biologically active metabolites and chitin, which are of prospective use for pharmacology and biomaterials oriented biomedicine, respectively.	0
Abstract2class: Stable benzotriazole esters as mechanism-based inactivators of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CL protease Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.	0
Abstract2class: Entianin, a novel subtilin-like lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029T with high antimicrobial activity Abstract: Lantibiotics, such as nisin and subtilin, are lanthionine-containing peptides that exhibit antimicrobial as well as pheromone-like autoinducing activity. Autoinduction is specific for each lantibiotic, and reporter systems for nisin and subtilin autoinduction are available. In this report, we used the previously reported subtilin autoinduction bioassay in combination with mass spectrometric analyses to identify the novel subtilin-like lantibiotic entianin from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029(T). Linearization of entianin using Raney nickel-catalyzed reductive cleavage enabled, for the first time, the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and efficient determination of an entire lantibiotic primary structure, including posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequence determined was verified by DNA sequencing of the etnS structural gene, which confirmed that entianin differs from subtilin at 3 amino acid positions. In contrast to B. subtilis ATCC 6633, which produces only small amounts of unsuccinylated subtilin, B. subtilis DSM 15029(T) secretes considerable amounts of unsuccinylated entianin. Entianin was very active against several Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The growth-inhibiting activity of succinylated entianin (S-entianin) was much lower than that of unsuccinylated entianin: a 40-fold higher concentration was required for inhibition. For succinylated subtilin (S-subtilin), a concentration 100-fold higher than that of unsuccinylated entianin was required to inhibit the growth of a B. subtilis test strain. This finding was in accordance with a strongly reduced sensing of cellular envelope stress provided by S-entianin relative to that of entianin. Remarkably, S-entianin and S-subtilin showed considerable autoinduction activity, clearly demonstrating that autoinduction and antibiotic activity underlie different molecular mechanisms.	1
Abstract2class: TLN-05220, TLN-05223, new Echinosporamicin-type antibiotics, and proposed revision of the structure of bravomicins(*) Abstract: The deposited strain of the hazimicin producer, Micromonospora echinospora ssp. challisensis NRRL 12255 has considerable biosynthetic capabilities as revealed by genome scanning. Among these is a locus containing both type I and type II PKS genes. The presumed products of this locus, TLN-05220 (1) and TLN-05223 (2), bear a core backbone composed of six fused rings starting with a 2-pyridone moiety. The structures were confirmed by conventional spectral analyses including MS, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Comparison of both the 1H and 13C NMR data of the newly isolated compound with those of echinosporamicin and bravomicin A led us to propose a revision of the structure of the latter to include a 2-pyridone instead of the pyran originally postulated. Both compounds (1 and 2) possessed strong antibacterial activity against a series of gram-positive pathogens including several strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and cytotoxic activities against several human tumor cell lines. The TLN compounds are the first of this group with reported anticancer activity.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of oxalamides by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and amines and the reverse hydrogenation catalyzed by ruthenium Abstract: A sustainable, new synthesis of oxalamides, by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol with amines, generating H2, homogeneously catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex, is presented. The reverse hydrogenation reaction is also accomplished using the same catalyst. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric reactions, NMR studies, X-ray crystallography as well as observation of plausible intermediates.	0
Abstract2class: Modeling of bacterial growth as a function of temperature Abstract: The temperature of chilled foods is a very important variable for microbial safety in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time.	0
Abstract2class: Canthaxanthin biosynthesis by the conversion of methylene to keto groups in a hydrocarbon beta-carotene by a single gene Abstract: Compounds that include (a) keto group(s) in a molecule are ubiquitous natural components. A novel gene involved in ketocompound biosynthesis, designated crtW, was isolated from the marine bacteria Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes PC-1 that produce ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin. When this gene was introduced into Escherichia coli that accumulated beta-carotene due to the Erwinia carotenogenic genes, the E. coli transformants synthesized canthaxanthin, one of ketocarotenoids, which was identified after purification by its visible, FD-MS and 1H-NMR spectral analysis. It has been demonstrated for the first time that one gene encodes an enzyme "ketolase" that catalyzes the conversion of methylene groups of a hydrocarbon beta-carotene to keto groups for synthesizing canthaxanthin via echinenone.	1
Abstract2class: An Expedient Synthesis of Flexible Nucleosides through Enzymatic Glycosylation of Proximal and Distal Fleximer Bases Abstract: The structurally unique "fleximer" nucleosides were originally designed to investigate how flexibility in a nucleobase could potentially affect receptor-ligand recognition and function. Recently they have been shown to have low-to-sub-micromolar levels of activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. However, the synthesis of distal fleximers in particular has thus far been quite tedious and low yielding. As a potential solution to this issue, a series of proximal fleximer bases (flex-bases) has been successfully coupled to both ribose and 2'-deoxyribose sugars by using the N-deoxyribosyltransferase II of Lactobacillus leichmannii (LlNDT) and Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). To explore the range of this facile approach, transglycosylation experiments on a thieno-expanded tricyclic heterocyclic base, as well as several distal and proximal flex-bases were performed to determine whether the corresponding fleximer nucleosides could be obtained in this fashion, thus potentially significantly shortening the route to these biologically significant compounds. The results of those studies are reported herein.	0
Abstract2class: Functional cloning and characterization of antibiotic resistance genes from the chicken gut microbiome Abstract: Culture-independent sampling in conjunction with a functional cloning approach identified diverse antibiotic resistance genes for different classes of antibiotics in gut microbiomes from both conventionally raised and free-range chickens. Many of the genes are phylogenetically distant from known resistance genes. Two unique genes that conferred ampicillin and spectinomycin resistance were also functional in Campylobacter, a distant relative of the Escherichia coli host used to generate the genomic libraries.	0
Abstract2class: New WS9326A Derivatives and One New Annimycin Derivative with Antimalarial Activity are Produced by Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 and Its Mutant Abstract: In this study, we report that Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 is a producer of new molecules related to the nonribosomal cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A and the polyketide annimycin. S. asterosporus DSM 41452 is shown to produce six cyclodepsipeptides and peptides, WS9326A to G. Notably, the compounds WS9326F and WS9326G have not been described before. The genome of S. asterosporus DSM 41452 was sequenced, and a putative WS9326A gene cluster was identified. Gene-deletion experiments confirmed that this cluster was responsible for the biosynthesis of WS9326A to G. Additionally, a gene-deletion experiment demonstrated that sas16 encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the synthesis of the novel (E)-2,3-dehydrotyrosine residue found in WS9326A and its derivatives. An insertion mutation within the putative annimycin gene cluster led to the production of a new annimycin derivative, annimycin B, which exhibited modest inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum.	0
Abstract2class: How Phosphorylation and ATPase Activity Regulate Anion Flux though the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR, ABCC7), mutations of which cause cystic fibrosis, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and works as a channel for small anions, such as chloride and bicarbonate. Anion channel activity is known to depend on phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and CFTR-ATPase activity. Whereas anion channel activity has been extensively investigated, phosphorylation and CFTR-ATPase activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the two processes can be measured in a label-free and non-invasive manner in real time in live cells, stably transfected with CFTR. This study reveals three key findings. (i) The major contribution (≥90%) to the total CFTR-related ATP hydrolysis rate is due to phosphorylation by PKA and the minor contribution (≤10%) to CFTR-ATPase activity. (ii) The mutant CFTR-E1371S that is still conductive, but defective in ATP hydrolysis, is not phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation requires a functional nucleotide binding domain and occurs in the post-hydrolysis transition state. (iii) CFTR-ATPase activity is inversely related to CFTR anion flux. The present data are consistent with a model in which CFTR is in a closed conformation with two ATPs bound. The open conformation is induced by ATP hydrolysis and corresponds to the post-hydrolysis transition state that is stabilized by phosphorylation and binding of chloride channel potentiators.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and structure determination of new siderophore albachelin from Amycolatopsis alba Abstract: A new siderophore named albachelin was isolated from iron deficient culture of Amycolatopsis alba. The planar structure of albachelin was elucidated by the combination of ESI-MS/MS experiment and NMR spectroscopic analyses of the gallium (III) complex. The structure of albachelin was determined to be a linear peptide consisting of 6 mol of amino acids including 3 mol of serine, one mol each of N-α-acethyl-N-δ-hydroxy-N-δ-formylornithine, N-α-methyl-N-δ-hydroxyornithine, and cyclic N-hydroxyornithine. The stereochemistries of amino acids constituting albachelin were analyzed by applying modified Marfey method to the hydrolysate of albachelin. Based on bioinformatics, we deduced and discussed the possible biosynthetic gene cluster involved in albachelin biosynthesis from the genome sequence of A. alba. By prediction of substrates for adenylation domains, a non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetase gene (AMYAL_RS0130210) was proposed to be the main biosynthetic gene for albachelin biosynthesis. The related genes including transporter for siderophore were found near the NRPS gene as a gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus salivarius Abstract: Salivaricin 9 (Sal9) is a 2560 Da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the Streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic SA-FF22. The Sal9 locus (designated siv) in Streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin A4. The entire locus was fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of S. salivarius strain JIM8780 and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivK, sensor kinase; sivR, response regulator; sivA, Sal9 precursor peptide; sivM, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivT, ABC transporter involved in the export of Sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivFEG, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. Intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain JIM8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in S. salivarius. Sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain JIM8780, indicating that Sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. Screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (S. salivarius, S. pyogenes and S. mitis) for sivA indicated that it was present only in S. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested S. salivarius positive. Since Sal9 was inhibitory to all tested S. pyogenes strains it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of S. salivarius probiotics intended to control S. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular Basis for Spirocycle Formation in the Paraherquamide Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: The paraherquamides are potent anthelmintic natural products with complex heptacyclic scaffolds. One key feature of these molecules is the spiro-oxindole moiety that lends a strained three-dimensional architecture to these structures. The flavin monooxygenase PhqK was found to catalyze spirocycle formation through two parallel pathways in the biosynthesis of paraherquamides A and G. Two new paraherquamides (K and L) were isolated from a ΔphqK strain of Penicillium simplicissimum, and subsequent enzymatic reactions with these compounds generated two additional metabolites, paraherquamides M and N. Crystal structures of PhqK in complex with various substrates provided a foundation for mechanistic analyses and computational studies. While it is evident that PhqK can react with various substrates, reaction kinetics and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the dioxepin-containing paraherquamide L is the favored substrate. Through this effort, we have elucidated a key step in the biosynthesis of the paraherquamides and provided a rationale for the selective spirocyclization of these powerful anthelmintic agents.	1
Abstract2class: Chiral gold nanowires with Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal structure Abstract: A Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal (BCB) helix is made of linearly stacked regular tetrahedra (tetrahelix). As such, it is chiral without nontrivial translational or rotational symmetries. We demonstrate here an example of the chiral BCB structure made of totally symmetrical gold atoms, created in nanowires by direct chemical synthesis. Detailed study by high-resolution electron microscopy illustrates their elegant chiral structure and the unique one-dimensional "pseudo-periodicity". The BCB-type atomic packing mode is proposed to be a result of the competition and compromise between the lattice and surface energy.	0
Abstract2class: The E1 functional epitope of the human interferon gamma is a nuclear targeting signal-like element. Mapping of the E1 epitope Abstract: Eight neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the human interferon gamma (HuIFN-gamma) that were classified in the E1 epitope group were mapped by the synthetic peptide approach. A set of 136 octapeptide homologs of the 143-residue primary sequence of the HuIFN-gamma, each one with a 7-residue sequence overlap with successive peptide, was synthesized. Based on the similar reactivity patterns of all the mAbs with this set of synthetic peptides, the E1 functional epitope was localized to residues 84-94 on the HuIFN-gamma. The epitope sequence is: Ser-Asn-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Asp-Asp-Phe-Gln-Lys. The fact that eight independently isolated mAbs binding to the same domain can neutralize the HuIFN-gamma activity suggests that the E1 domain must be at or adjacent to a functional site. Within this domain is a sequence element, Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg, that resembles the nuclear location signals known to effect the intracellular transportation of a number of nuclear proteins, such as the large tumor antigen (T antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus and steroid hormone receptors. This observation suggests that the HuIFN-gamma molecule and/or its complex with the receptor must function in the nucleus to effect transcription regulation that results in the various biological activities. The signal for that intracellular transportation must be provided by the HuIFN-gamma molecule.	0
Abstract2class: Sorting signals, N-terminal modifications and abundance of the chloroplast proteome Abstract: Characterization of the chloroplast proteome is needed to understand the essential contribution of the chloroplast to plant growth and development. Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86% had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that 'spectral counting' can provide large scale protein quantification for Arabidopsis. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction. No evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system. This study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded Plant Proteome Database (PPDB) in which all MS data are projected on identified gene models.	0
Abstract2class: Complete biosynthetic pathways of ascofuranone and ascochlorin in Acremonium egyptiacum Abstract: Ascofuranone (AF) and ascochlorin (AC) are meroterpenoids produced by various filamentous fungi, including Acremonium egyptiacum (synonym: Acremonium sclerotigenum), and exhibit diverse physiological activities. In particular, AF is a promising drug candidate against African trypanosomiasis and a potential anticancer lead compound. These compounds are supposedly biosynthesized through farnesylation of orsellinic acid, but the details have not been established. In this study, we present all of the reactions and responsible genes for AF and AC biosyntheses in A. egyptiacum, identified by heterologous expression, in vitro reconstruction, and gene deletion experiments with the aid of a genome-wide differential expression analysis. Both pathways share the common precursor, ilicicolin A epoxide, which is processed by the membrane-bound terpene cyclase (TPC) AscF in AC biosynthesis. AF biosynthesis branches from the precursor by hydroxylation at C-16 by the P450 monooxygenase AscH, followed by cyclization by a membrane-bound TPC AscI. All genes required for AC biosynthesis (ascABCDEFG) and a transcriptional factor (ascR) form a functional gene cluster, whereas those involved in the late steps of AF biosynthesis (ascHIJ) are present in another distantly located cluster. AF is therefore a rare example of fungal secondary metabolites requiring multilocus biosynthetic clusters, which are likely to be controlled by the single regulator, AscR. Finally, we achieved the selective production of AF in A. egyptiacum by genetically blocking the AC biosynthetic pathway; further manipulation of the strain will lead to the cost-effective mass production required for the clinical use of AF.	1
Abstract2class: Sequence analysis and heterologous expression of the lincomycin biosynthetic cluster of the type strain Streptomyces lincolnensis ATCC 25466 Abstract: A cosmid bearing an insert of 38 217 bp covering the gene cluster and its flanking regions of type strain Streptomyces lincolnensis ATCC 25466 was sequenced. Two relatively extensive sequence changes and several hundred point mutations were identified if compared with the previously published sequence of the lincomycin (Lin) industrial strain S. lincolnensis 78-11. Analysis of the cluster-flanking regions revealed its localization within the genome of the ATCC 25466 strain. The cluster-bearing cosmid was integrated into the chromosome of Lin non-producing strains S. coelicolor CH 999 and S. coelicolor M 145. The modified strains heterologously produced Lin but the level dropped to approximately 1-3% of the production in the ATCC 25466 strain.	1
Abstract2class: A Novel Type Pathway-Specific Regulator and Dynamic Genome Environments of a Solanapyrone Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in the Fungus Ascochyta rabiei Abstract: Secondary metabolite genes are often clustered together and situated in particular genomic regions, like the subtelomere, that can facilitate niche adaptation in fungi. Solanapyrones are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi occupying different ecological niches. Full-genome sequencing of the ascomycete Ascochyta rabiei revealed a solanapyrone biosynthesis gene cluster embedded in an AT-rich region proximal to a telomere end and surrounded by Tc1/Mariner-type transposable elements. The highly AT-rich environment of the solanapyrone cluster is likely the product of repeat-induced point mutations. Several secondary metabolism-related genes were found in the flanking regions of the solanapyrone cluster. Although the solanapyrone cluster appears to be resistant to repeat-induced point mutations, a P450 monooxygenase gene adjacent to the cluster has been degraded by such mutations. Among the six solanapyrone cluster genes (sol1 to sol6), sol4 encodes a novel type of Zn(II)2Cys6 zinc cluster transcription factor. Deletion of sol4 resulted in the complete loss of solanapyrone production but did not compromise growth, sporulation, or virulence. Gene expression studies with the sol4 deletion and sol4-overexpressing mutants delimited the boundaries of the solanapyrone gene cluster and revealed that sol4 is likely a specific regulator of solanapyrone biosynthesis and appears to be necessary and sufficient for induction of the solanapyrone cluster genes. Despite the dynamic surrounding genomic regions, the solanapyrone gene cluster has maintained its integrity, suggesting important roles of solanapyrones in fungal biology.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of the 5'-Se-thymidine phosphoramidite and convenient labeling of DNA oligonucleotide Abstract: The synthesis of the 5'-Se-derivatized thymidine and phosphoramidite is reported, and the Se-phosphoramidite was incorporated into DNA. Because of its high nucleophilicity, this 5'-Se-moiety permits convenient postsynthetic modification of oligonucleotides. The proof of principle was successfully demonstrated by incorporating fluorescein into DNA. It was also found that the 5'-dye-labeled Se-DNA can be recognized by DNA polymerase as an efficient primer. This novel strategy opens a new avenue for nucleic acid probe preparation and detection.	0
Abstract2class: Investigation on the Evolution of Shiga Toxin-Converting Phages Based on Whole Genome Sequencing Abstract: Bacteriophages are pivotal elements in the dissemination of virulence genes. The main virulence determinants of Shiga Toxin producing E. coli, Shiga Toxins (Stx), are encoded by genes localized in the genome of lambdoid bacteriophages. Stx comprise two antigenically different types, Stx1 and Stx2, further divided into subtypes. Among these, certain Stx2 subtypes appear to be more commonly occurring in the most severe forms of the STEC disease, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study aimed at obtaining insights on the evolution of Stx2 bacteriophages, due to their relevance in public health, and we report here on the analysis of the genomic structure of Stx2 converting phages in relation with the known reservoir of the E. coli strains harboring them. Stx2-converting phages conveying the genes encoding different stx2 subtypes have been isolated from STEC strains and their whole genomes have been sequenced, analyzed and compared to those of other Stx2 phages available in the public domain. The phages' regions containing the stx2 genes have been analyzed in depth allowing to make inference on the possible mechanisms of selection and maintenance of certain Stx2 phages in the reservoir. The "stx regions" of different stx2 gene subtypes grouped into three different evolutionary lines in the comparative analysis, reflecting the frequency with which these subtypes are found in different animal niches, suggesting that the colonization of specific reservoir by STEC strains could be influenced by the Stx phage that they carry. Noteworthy, we could identify the presence of nanS-p gene exclusively in the "stx regions" of the phages identified in STEC strains commonly found in cattle. As a matter of fact, this gene encodes an esterase capable of metabolizing sialic acids produced by submaxillary glands of bovines and present in great quantities in their gastrointestinal tract.	0
Abstract2class: Non-traditional roles of G protein-coupled receptors in basic cell biology Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key signaling proteins that regulate how cells interact with their environment. Traditional signaling cascades involving GPCRs have been well described and are well established and very important clinical targets. With the development of more recent technologies, hints about the involvement of GPCRs in fundamental cell biological processes are beginning to emerge. In this review, we give a basic introduction to GPCR signaling and highlight some less well described roles of GPCRs, including in cell division and membrane trafficking, which may occur through canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways.	0
Abstract2class: Simocyclinones, novel cytostatic angucyclinone antibiotics produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040 II. Structure elucidation and biosynthesis Abstract: The simocyclinones D4 (1) and D8 (2), members of a novel class of antibiotics, were isolated from the mycelial extract of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040 and consist of angucyclinone, deoxysugar, octatetraene dicarboxylate and aminocoumarin structural elements. The structure elucidation was done by one and two dimensional NMR experiments, and other spectroscopic methods in combination with incorporation experiments using 13C labelled precursors.	1
Abstract2class: Differential modulation of avian β-defensin and Toll-like receptor expression in chickens infected with infectious bronchitis virus Abstract: The host innate immune response either clears invading viruses or allows the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response. In this study, both pathogenic (passage 3, P3) and attenuated (P110) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were used to study the immune responses of chicken to IBV infection. Expression of avian β-defensins (AvBDs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in 16 tissues of chicken were compared at 7 days PI. The results showed that P3 infection upregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12, while P110 infection downregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 in most tissues. Meanwhile, the expression level of several TLRs showed a general trend of upregulation in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, while they were downregulated in the tissues of P110-infected chickens. The result suggested that compared with the P110 strain, the P3 strain induced a more pronounced host innate immune response. Furthermore, we observed that recombinant AvBDs (including 2, 6, and 12) demonstrated obvious anti-viral activity against IBV in vitro. Our findings contribute to the proposal that IBV infection induces an increase in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of some AvBDs and TLRs, which suggests that AvBDs may play significant roles in the resistance of chickens to IBV replication.	0
Abstract2class: Structure of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome Abstract: The cryptochrome/photolyase (CRY/PL) family of photoreceptors mediates adaptive responses to ultraviolet and blue light exposure in all kingdoms of life. Whereas PLs function predominantly in DNA repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photolesions caused by ultraviolet radiation, CRYs transduce signals important for growth, development, magnetosensitivity and circadian clocks. Despite these diverse functions, PLs/CRYs preserve a common structural fold, a dependence on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and an internal photoactivation mechanism. However, members of the CRY/PL family differ in the substrates recognized (protein or DNA), photochemical reactions catalysed and involvement of an antenna cofactor. It is largely unknown how the animal CRYs that regulate circadian rhythms act on their substrates. CRYs contain a variable carboxy-terminal tail that appends the conserved PL homology domain (PHD) and is important for function. Here, we report a 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of Drosophila CRY with an intact C terminus. The C-terminal helix docks in the analogous groove that binds DNA substrates in PLs. Conserved Trp 536 juts into the CRY catalytic centre to mimic PL recognition of DNA photolesions. The FAD anionic semiquinone found in the crystals assumes a conformation to facilitate restructuring of the tail helix. These results help reconcile the diverse functions of the CRY/PL family by demonstrating how conserved protein architecture and photochemistry can be elaborated into a range of light-driven functions.	0
Abstract2class: Photoaffinity probes for nematode pheromone receptor identification Abstract: Identification of pheromone receptors plays a central role for uncovering signaling pathways that underlie chemical communication in animals. Here, we describe the synthesis and bioactivity of photoaffinity probes for the ascaroside ascr#8, a sex-pheromone of the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Structure-activity studies guided incorporation of alkyne- and diazirine-moieties and revealed that addition of functionality in the sidechain of ascr#8 was well tolerated, whereas modifications to the ascarylose moiety resulted in loss of biological activity. Our study will guide future probe design and provides a basis for pheromone receptor identification via photoaffinity labeling in C. elegans.	0
Abstract2class: Light activation of the LOV protein vivid generates a rapidly exchanging dimer Abstract: The fungal photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) plays an important role in the adaptation of blue-light responses in Neurospora crassa. VVD, an FAD-binding LOV (light, oxygen, voltage) protein, couples light-induced cysteinyl adduct formation at the flavin ring to conformational changes in the N-terminal cap (Ncap) of the VVD PAS domain. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and static and dynamic light scattering show that these conformational changes generate a rapidly exchanging VVD dimer, with an expanded hydrodynamic radius. A three-residue N-terminal beta-turn that assumes two different conformations in a crystal structure of a VVD C71V variant is essential for light-state dimerization. Residue substitutions at a critical hinge between the Ncap and PAS core can inhibit or enhance dimerization, whereas a Tyr to Trp substitution at the Ncap-PAS interface stabilizes the light-state dimer. Cross-linking through engineered disulfides indicates that the light-state dimer differs considerably from the dark-state dimer found in VVD crystal structures. These results verify the role of Ncap conformational changes in gating the photic response of N. crassa and indicate that LOV-LOV homo- or heterodimerization may be a mechanism for regulating light-activated gene expression.	0
Abstract2class: A cold oceanographic regime with high exploitation rates in the Northeast Pacific forecasts a collapse of the sardine stock Abstract: The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.	0
Abstract2class: A gene cluster for biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Streptomyces avermitilis, an industrial organism responsible for the production of the anthelminthic avermectins, harbors a 13.4 kb gene cluster containing 13 unidirectionally transcribed open reading frames corresponding to the apparent biosynthetic operon for the sesquiterpene antibiotic pentalenolactone. The advanced intermediate pentalenolactone F, along with the shunt metabolite pentalenic acid, could be isolated from cultures of S. avermitilis, thereby establishing that the pentalenolactone biosynthetic pathway is functional in S. avermitilis. Deletion of the entire 13.4 kb cluster from S. avermitilis abolished formation of pentalenolactone metabolites, while transfer of the intact cluster to the pentalenolactone nonproducer Streptomyces lividans 1326 resulted in production of pentalenic acid. Direct evidence for the biochemical function of the individual biosynthetic genes came from expression of the ptlA gene (SAV2998) in Escherichia coli. Assay of the resultant protein established that PtlA is a pentalenene synthase, catalyzing the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to pentalenene, the parent hydrocarbon of the pentalenolactone family of metabolites. The most upstream gene in the cluster, gap1 (SAV2990), was shown to correspond to the pentalenolactone resistance gene, based on expression in E. coli and demonstration that the resulting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the normal target of pentalenolactone, was insensitive to the antibiotic. Furthermore, a second GAPDH isozyme (gap2, SAV6296) has been expressed in E. coli and shown to be inactivated by pentalenolactone.	1
Abstract2class: The complete genome sequence of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the Gram-positive bacteria. Its genome of 4,214,810 base pairs comprises 4,100 protein-coding genes. Of these protein-coding genes, 53% are represented once, while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication, the largest family containing 77 putative ATP-binding transport proteins. In addition, a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources, including many plant-derived molecules. The identification of five signal peptidase genes, as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus, is important given the capacity of Bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes. Many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, that are more typically associated with Streptomyces species. The genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages, indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer, in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis.	1
Abstract2class: Extracellular signalling, translational control, two repressors and an activator all contribute to the regulation of methylenomycin production in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Bioinformatic analysis of the plasmid-linked gene cluster associated with biosynthesis of methylenomycin (Mm) suggested that part of the cluster directs synthesis of a gamma-butyrolactone-like autoregulator. Autoregulator activity could be extracted from culture fluids, but differed from gamma-butyrolactones in being alkali resistant. The activity has recently been shown to comprise a series of novel autoregulator molecules, the methylenomycin furans (termed MMF). MMF autoregulator activity is shown to account for the ability of certain Mm non-producing mutants to act as 'secretors' in cosynthesis with other 'convertor' mutants. Three genes implicated in MMF biosynthesis are flanked by two regulatory genes, which are related to genes for gamma-butyrolactone-binding proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that these two genes encode components of a hetero-oligomeric repressor of MMF and Mm biosynthesis. The Mm biosynthetic genes themselves depend on the activator gene mmyB, which appears to be repressed by the putative MmyR/MmfR complex until enough MMF accumulates to release repression. The presence of TTA codons in mmyB and the main MMF biosynthetic gene causes Mm production to be dependent on the pleiotropically acting bldA gene, which encodes the tRNA for the rarely used UUA codon.	1
Abstract2class: Antiviral compounds discovered by virtual screening of small-molecule libraries against dengue virus E protein Abstract: Infection by the mosquito-borne dengue virus causes dengue fever and the sometimes fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. The increasing number of dengue infections per year suggests that the virus is becoming more virulent and its transmission is expanding. Nevertheless, no effective treatment for dengue infection currently exists. In a search for antiviral agents effective against dengue virus, we investigated the potential of targeting a structural protein site rather than an enzymatic one. Using this approach, we now report the discovery of a small molecule ligand that inhibits viral growth. Our results also provide the first evidence that the binding site, a pocket located at the hinge between domains 1 and 2 of the envelope protein (E protein) on the virus surface, is a valid target for antiviral therapy. Ligand candidates were identified from libraries of approximately 142,000 compounds using a computational high-throughput screening protocol targeting this pocket of the E protein. Cell-based assays were conducted on 23 top-ranked compounds. Among four with good antiviral activity profiles, the compound P02 was found to inhibit viral reproduction at micromolar concentrations. Using saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy, we also show that the compound binds virus and competes for binding E protein with the known ligand N-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. Together, the results are consistent with an inhibition mechanism against maturation or host-cell entry mediated by ligand binding to the E-protein pocket. P02 is a promising lead compound for future development of an effective treatment against dengue virus and related flaviviruses.	0
Abstract2class: [Identification of 3-demethylchuangxinmycin from Actinoplanes tsinanensis CPCC 200056] Abstract: Chuangxinmycin (CM) from Actinoplanes tsinanensis was an antibiotic discovered by Chinese scientists about 40 years ago. It contains a new heterocyclic system of indole fused with dihydrothiopyran, whose biosynthetic mechanism remains unclear. CM is used as an oral medicine in the treatment of bacterial infections in China. The simple structure makes CM as an attractive candidate of structure modification for improvement of antibacterial activity. Recently, we analyzed the secondary metabolites of Actinoplanes tsinanensis CPCC 200056, a CM producing strain, as a natural CM analogue. We discovered the first natural CM analogue 3-demethylchuangxinmycin (DCM) as a new natural product. Compared to CM, DCM exhibited a much weaker activity in the inhibition of the bacterial strains tested. The finding provides valuable information for the structure-activity relationship in the biosynthesis of CM.	1
Abstract2class: Natural products from environmental DNA hosted in Ralstonia metallidurans Abstract: Metagenomic studies designed to access new small molecules from the heterologous expression of environmental DNA have focused on the use of two model systems, Escherichia coli and Streptomyces spp., as heterologous hosts. Accessing the biosynthetic potential of DNA extracted from the bacteria present in environmental samples will require the development of a more diverse collection of model bacterial hosts that can be used for screening environmental DNA libraries. In this study the bacterium Ralstonia metallidurans was explored as a heterologous host. Here we report the isolation and characterization of both novel and known metabolites from pigmented and antibacterially active clones found in R. metallidurans based environmental DNA libraries. The clones found in this study do not confer the production of clone-specific metabolites to E. coli, validating R. metallidurans as an orthogonal expression host that can be used to expand the number of metabolites found in future metagenomic discovery efforts.	1
Abstract2class: Ketosynthase III as a gateway to engineering the biosynthesis of antitumoral benastatin derivatives Abstract: Benastatins are aromatic polyketides from Streptomyces spp. that efficiently inhibit glutathione-S-transferases and induce apoptosis. Their biosynthesis involves a type II polyketide synthase, and a ketoacyl synthase (KAS) III component (BenQ) similar to FabH that is crucial for providing and selecting the rare hexanoate PKS starter unit. The function of BenQ as a KAS III was experimentally proven by point mutation of the active site cysteine. In the mutant several novel short chain fatty acid derived penta- and hexacyclic benastatin derivatives with antiprolieferative activities are formed. Strategies for engineering benastatin biosynthesis were attempted. Synthetic starter units surrogates were not incorporated by block mutants, which suggests that the primer needs to be enzyme-bound. Thus, on the basis of KAS III crystal structures the three-dimensional structure of BenQ was modeled and the predicted substrate-binding tunnel was altered by individual mutations of potential gatekeeping residues (H95A and M99A). However, no significant changes in substrate specificity were observed, indicating that there are other or additional gatekeeping amino acid residues in BenQ or secondary factors including likely protein-protein interactions between BenQ and the PKS complex, and possible conformational changes in BenQ. Finally, a benQ null mutant was complemented with butyrate starter unit biosynthesis genes from the alnumycin biosynthesis gene cluster, which resulted in a great (10x) enhancement in the production of butyrate-primed hexacyclic benastatin derivatives. The successful generation of an alnumycin-benastatin FAS-PKS hybrid pathway highlights the potential of metabolic pathways, which may lead to novel potential therapeutics and increased yields of desired natural products.	1
Abstract2class: The role of the G2 box, a conserved motif in the histidine kinase superfamily, in modulating the function of EnvZ Abstract: Histidine kinase EnvZ, a transmembrane osmotic sensor for Escherichia coli, is a bifunctional enzyme having OmpR (its cognate response regulator) kinase and phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) phosphatase activities. Its cytoplasmic domain consists of domain A responsible for dimerization of EnvZ, histidine phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities, and domain B responsible for ATP binding. Here, we have constructed a number of substitution mutations at the G2 box, one of the conserved motifs in domain B, and demonstrated that they influence the phosphatase activity of EnvZ over a wide range. The effects of ADP, a cofactor for the phosphatase activity, were found to be substantially different depending upon the mutations. The effects of these mutations were also examined in vivo using a chimeric Tar-EnvZ construct (Taz1-1), and the results agreed with the in vitro data for the phosphatase and kinase activities for all mutations. Using Taz1-1 carrying the T402A mutation, three independent intragenic suppressor mutations (T235M, S269L and E276K) were isolated, and all were found in domain A. Together, the present results demonstrate for the first time that domain A and domain B are functionally co-ordinated and topologically arranged in a specific manner. The G2 box may modulate the interaction between these two domains in response to extracellular osmolarity.	0
Abstract2class: Total biosynthesis of antitumor nonribosomal peptides in Escherichia coli Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are a class of microbial secondary metabolites that have a wide variety of medicinally important biological activities, such as antibiotic (vancomycin), immunosuppressive (cyclosporin A), antiviral (luzopeptin A) and antitumor (echinomycin and triostin A) activities. However, many microbes are not amenable to cultivation and require time-consuming empirical optimization of incubation conditions for mass production of desired secondary metabolites for clinical and commercial use. Therefore, a fast, simple system for heterologous production of natural products is much desired. Here we show the first example of the de novo total biosynthesis of biologically active forms of heterologous NRPs in Escherichia coli. Our system can serve not only as an effective and flexible platform for large-scale preparation of natural products from simple carbon and nitrogen sources, but also as a general tool for detailed characterizations and rapid engineering of biosynthetic pathways for microbial syntheses of novel compounds and their analogs.	1
Abstract2class: Moving posttranslational modifications forward to biosynthesize the glycosylated thiopeptide nocathiacin I in Nocardia sp. ATCC202099 Abstract: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of glycosylated antibiotic nocathiacin I (NOC-I) here adds new insights to thiopeptide biosynthesis, showing the NOC-specific tailoring and unusual sugar formation. NOC-I biosynthesis shares the paradigm for forming a common thiopeptide core and the generality for converting to an e series member, as that of the parent compound nosiheptide (NOS). This may permit the production of NOC-I in the genetically amenable, NOS-producing strain by building NOC-specific genes for pathway engineering.	1
Abstract2class: A gene cluster for prenylated naphthoquinone and prenylated phenazine biosynthesis in Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 Abstract: Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 produces two classes of secondary metabolites of mixed isoprenoid/nonisoprenoid origin: the polyketide-isoprenoid compound furanonaphthoquinone I (FNQ I) and several prenylated phenazines, predominantly endophenazine A. We now report the cloning and sequence analysis of a 55 kb gene cluster required for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Several inactivation experiments confirmed the involvement of this gene cluster in the biosynthesis of FNQ I and endophenazine A. The six identified genes for endophenazine biosynthesis showed close similarity to phenazine biosynthetic genes from Pseudomonas. Of the 28 open reading frames identified in the adjacent FNQ I cluster, 13 showed close similarity to genes contained in the cluster for furaquinocin-a structurally similar metabolite from another Streptomyces strain. These genes included a type III polyketide synthase sequence, a momA-like monooxygenase gene, and two cloQ-like prenyltransferase genes designated fnq26 and fnq28. Inactivation experiments confirmed the involvement of fnq26 in FNQ I biosynthesis, whereas no change in secondary-metabolite formation was observed after fnq28 inactivation. The FNQ I cluster contains a contiguous group of five genes, which together encode all the enzymatic functions required for the recycling of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Two SAM-dependent methyltransferases are encoded within the cluster. Inactivation experiments showed that fnq9 is responsible for the 7-O-methylation and fnq27 for the 6-C-methylation reaction in FNQ I biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of the Showdomycin Gene Cluster from Streptomyces showdoensis ATCC 15227 Yields Insight into the Biosynthetic Logic of C-Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Nucleoside antibiotics are a large class of pharmaceutically relevant chemical entities, which exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. Most nucleosides belong to the canonical N-nucleoside family, where the heterocyclic unit is connected to the carbohydrate through a carbon-nitrogen bond. However, atypical C-nucleosides were isolated from Streptomyces bacteria over 50 years ago, but the molecular basis for formation of these metabolites has been unknown. Here, we have sequenced the genome of S. showdoensis ATCC 15227 and identified the gene cluster responsible for showdomycin production. Key to the detection was the presence of sdmA, encoding an enzyme of the pseudouridine monophosphate glycosidase family, which could catalyze formation of the C-glycosidic bond. Sequence analysis revealed an unusual combination of biosynthetic genes, while inactivation and subsequent complementation of sdmA confirmed the involvement of the locus in showdomycin formation. The study provides the first steps toward generation of novel C-nucleosides by pathway engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Enzyme-Instructed Self-Assembly of Small D-Peptides as a Multiple-Step Process for Selectively Killing Cancer Cells Abstract: Selective inhibition of cancer cells remains a challenge in chemotherapy. Here we report the molecular and cellular validation of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) as a multiple step process for selectively killing cancer cells that overexpress alkaline phosphatases (ALPs). We design and synthesize two kinds of D-tetrapeptide containing one or two phosphotyrosine residues and with the N-terminal capped by a naphthyl group. Upon enzymatic dephosphorylation, these D-tetrapeptides turn into self-assembling molecules to form nanofibers in water. Incubating these D-tetrapeptides with several cancer cell lines and one normal cell line, the unphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides are innocuous to all the cell lines, the mono- and diphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides selectively inhibit the cancer cells, but not the normal cell. The monophosphorylated D-tetrapeptides exhibit more potent inhibitory activity than the diphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides do; the cancer cell lines express higher level of ALPs are more susceptible to inhibition by the phosphorylated D-tetrapeptides; the precursors of D-tetrapeptides that possess higher self-assembling abilities exhibit higher inhibitory activities. These results confirm the important role of enzymatic reaction and self-assembly. Using uncompetitive inhibitors of ALPs and fluorescent D-tetrapeptides, we delineate that the enzyme catalyzed dephosphorylation and the self-assembly steps, together, result in the localization of the nanofibers of D-tetrapeptides for killing the cancer cells. We find that the cell death modality likely associates with the cell type and prove the interactions between nanofibers and the death receptors. This work illustrates a paradigm-shifting and biomimetic approach and contributes useful molecular insights for the development of spatiotemporal defined supramolecular processes/assemblies as potential anticancer therapeutics.	0
Abstract2class: Insights into polyether biosynthesis from analysis of the nigericin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. DSM4137 Abstract: Nigericin was among the first polyether ionophores to be discovered, but its biosynthesis remains obscure. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nigericin has been serendipitously cloned from Streptomyces sp. DSM4137, and deletion of this gene cluster abolished the production of both nigericin and the closely related metabolite abierixin. Detailed comparison of the nigericin biosynthetic genes with their counterparts in the biosynthetic clusters for other polyketides has prompted a significant revision of the proposed common pathway for polyether biosynthesis. In particular, we present evidence that in nigericin, nanchangmycin, and monensin, an unusual ketosynthase-like protein, KSX, transfers the initially formed linear polyketide chain to a discrete acyl carrier protein, ACPX, for oxidative cyclization. Consistent with this, deletion of either monACPX or monKSX from the monensin gene cluster effectively abolished monensin A biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Bifunctional TaqII restriction endonuclease: redefining the prototype DNA recognition site and establishing the Fidelity Index for partial cleaving Abstract: Background:                       The TaqII enzyme is a member of the Thermus sp. enzyme family that we propounded previously within Type IIS restriction endonucleases, containing related thermophilic bifunctional endonucleases-methyltransferases from various Thermus sp.: TaqII, Tth111II, TthHB27I, TspGWI, TspDTI and TsoI. These enzymes show significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities, a rare phenomenon among restriction endonucleases, along with similarities in biochemical properties, molecular size, DNA recognition sequences and cleavage sites. They also feature some characteristics of Types I and III.                  Results:                       Barker et al. reported the Type IIS/IIC restriction endonuclease TaqII as recognizing two distinct cognate site variants (5'-GACCGA-3' and 5'-CACCCA-3') while cleaving 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We used four independent methods, namely, shotgun cloning and sequencing, restriction pattern analysis, digestion of particular custom substrates and GeneScan analysis, to demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme recognizes only 5'-GACCGA-3' sites and cleaves 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We did not observe any 5'-CACCCA-3' cleavage under a variety of conditions and site arrangements tested. We also characterized the enzyme biochemically and established new digestion conditions optimal for practical enzyme applications. Finally, we developed and propose a new version of the Fidelity Index - the Fidelity Index for Partial Cleavage (FI-PC).                  Conclusions:                       The DNA recognition sequence of the bifunctional prototype TaqII endonuclease-methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus has been redefined as recognizing only 5'-GACCGA-3' cognate sites. The reaction conditions (pH and salt concentrations) were designed either to minimize (pH = 8.0 and 10 mM ammonium sulphate) or to enhance star activity (pH = 6.0 and no salt). Redefinition of the recognition site and reaction conditions makes this prototype endonuclease a useful tool for DNA manipulation; as yet, this enzyme has no practical applications. The extension of the Fidelity Index will be helpful for DNA manipulation with enzymes only partially cleaving DNA.	0
Abstract2class: Genomics-driven discovery of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster in the fungus Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Background:                       The antifungal therapy caspofungin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, a lipohexapeptide produced by the fungus Glarea lozoyensis, and was the first member of the echinocandin class approved for human therapy. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthases (PKS) gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis from G. lozoyensis has not been elucidated to date. In this study, we report the elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the G. lozoyensis wild-type strain ATCC 20868.                  Results:                       The pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster contains a NRPS (GLNRPS4) and a PKS (GLPKS4) arranged in tandem, two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, seven other modifying enzymes, and genes for L-homotyrosine biosynthesis, a component of the peptide core. Thus, the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster is significantly more autonomous and organized than that of the recently characterized echinocandin B gene cluster. Disruption mutants of GLNRPS4 and GLPKS4 no longer produced the pneumocandins (A0 and B0), and the Δglnrps4 and Δglpks4 mutants lost antifungal activity against the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. In addition to pneumocandins, the G. lozoyensis genome encodes a rich repertoire of natural product-encoding genes including 24 PKSs, six NRPSs, five PKS-NRPS hybrids, two dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, and 14 terpene synthases.                  Conclusions:                       Characterization of the gene cluster provides a blueprint for engineering new pneumocandin derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. Whole genome estimation of the secondary metabolite-encoding genes from G. lozoyensis provides yet another example of the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products from the fungal kingdom.	1
Abstract2class: The impact of Paenibacillus polymyxa HY96-2 luxS on biofilm formation and control of tomato bacterial wilt Abstract: The focus of this study was to investigate the effects of luxS, a key regulatory gene of the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing (QS) system, on the biofilm formation and biocontrol efficacy against Ralstonia solanacearum by Paenibacillus polymyxa HY96-2. luxS mutants were constructed and assayed for biofilm formation of the wild-type (WT) strain and luxS mutants of P. polymyxa HY96-2 in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that luxS positively regulated the biofilm formation of HY96-2. Greenhouse experiments of tomato bacterial wilt found that from the early stage to late stage postinoculation, the biocontrol efficacy of the luxS deletion strain was the lowest with 50.70 ± 1.39% in the late stage. However, the luxS overexpression strain had the highest biocontrol efficacy with 75.66 ± 1.94% in the late stage. The complementation of luxS could restore the biocontrol efficacy of the luxS deletion strain with 69.84 ± 1.09% in the late stage, which was higher than that of the WT strain with 65.94 ± 2.73%. Therefore, we deduced that luxS could promote the biofilm formation of P. polymyxa HY96-2 and further promoted its biocontrol efficacy against R. solanacearum.	0
Abstract2class: Crystallisation and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of cyclophilin-tetrapeptide and cyclophilin-cyclosporin complexes Abstract: Recombinant human cyclophilin has been co-crystallised with a number of peptides to give crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The crystal complexes for which heavy-atom derivatives have been prepared and X-ray data collected are: cyclophilin with N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-amidomethyl-coumarin (I) which crystallises in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 108.2, b = 123.0, c = 35.8 A, and cyclophilin with cyclosporin (II) which crystallises as tetragonal plates in space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with a = b = 94.98, c = 278.55 A.	0
Abstract2class: Cohesin and CTCF differentially affect chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells Abstract: Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.	0
Abstract2class: Collaborative Biosynthesis of a Class of Bioactive Azaphilones by Two Separate Gene Clusters Containing Four PKS/NRPSs with Transcriptional Crosstalk in Fungi Abstract: Azaphilones are a family of fungal polyketide metabolites with diverse chemical structures and biological activities with a highly oxygenated pyranoquinone bicyclic core. Here, a class of azaphilones possessing a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic ring system was identified in Aspergillus terreus, and exhibited potential anticancer activities. The gene deletions and biochemical investigations demonstrated that these azaphilones were collaboratively synthesized by two separate clusters containing four core-enzymes, two nonreducing PKSs, one highly reducing PKS, and one NRPS-like. More interestingly, we found that the biosynthesis is coordinately regulated by a crosstalk mechanism between these two gene clusters based on three transcriptional factors. This is a meaningful mechanism of fungal secondary metabolism, which allows fungi to synthesize more complex compounds and gain new physiological functions. The results provide a new insight into fungal natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Nutrient-regulated transcriptional responses in the brown tide-forming alga Aureococcus anophagefferens Abstract: Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) was used to profile the transcriptome of the brown tide-forming alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, under nutrient replete (control), and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiency to understand how this organism responds at the transcriptional level to varying nutrient conditions. This approach has aided A. anophagefferens genome annotation efforts and identified a suite of genes upregulated by N and P deficiency, some of which have known roles in nutrient metabolism. Genes upregulated under N deficiency include an ammonium transporter, an acetamidase/formamidase and two peptidases. This suggests an ability to utilize reduced N compounds and dissolved organic nitrogen, supporting the hypothesized importance of these N sources in A. anophagefferens bloom formation. There are also a broad suite of P-regulated genes, including an alkaline phosphatase, and two 5'-nucleotidases, suggesting A. anophagefferens may use dissolved organic phosphorus under low phosphate conditions. These N- and P-regulated genes may be important targets for exploring nutrient controls on bloom formation in field populations.	0
Abstract2class: A Crh-specific function in carbon catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Carbon catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by phosphorylation of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system intermediate HPr at a serine residue catalyzed by HPr kinase. The orthologous protein Crh functions in a similar way, but, unlike HPr, it is not functional in carbohydrate uptake. A specific function for Crh is not known. The role of HPr and Crh in repressing the citM gene encoding the Mg(2+)-citrate transporter was investigated during growth of B. subtilis on different carbon sources. In glucose minimal medium, full repression was supported by both HPr and Crh. Strains deficient in Crh or the regulatory function of HPr revealed the same repression as the wild-type strain. In contrast, in a medium containing succinate and glutamate, repression was specifically mediated via Crh. Repression was relieved in the Crh-deficient strain, but still present in the HPr mutant strain. The data are the first demonstration of a Crh-specific function in B. subtilis and suggest a role for Crh in regulation of expression during growth on substrates other than carbohydrates.	0
Abstract2class: The spa-box for transcriptional activation of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The subtilin gene cluster (spa) of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 is organized in transcriptional units spaBTC, spaS, spaIFEG and spaRK. Specific binding of the response regulator protein SpaR to spaB, spaS and spaI DNA promoter fragments was shown by means of electromobility shift assays. A repeated pentanucleotide sequence spaced by six nucleotides was identified as SpaR binding motif (spa-box). Saturating mutational analysis of the spa-box by single- and multiple-base-pair substitutions revealed the consensus motif (A/T)TGAT for optimal SpaR binding with the second, third and fifth position being absolutely conservative. Variations in the spacer size between the two pentanucleotide repeats revealed a strong conservation of their relative location. Only DNA with a proximal arrangement of two pentanucleotide repeats showed affinity to SpaR. A 2:1 stoichiometry between SpaR and DNA was obtained by optical biosensor analyses, which corresponds to the binding of two SpaR proteins per spa-box.	1
Abstract2class: Himalaquinones A-G, Angucyclinone-Derived Metabolites Produced by the Himalayan Isolate Streptomyces sp. PU-MM59 Abstract: Himalaquinones A-G, seven new anthraquinone-derived metabolites, were obtained from the Himalayan-based Streptomyces sp. PU-MM59. The chemical structures of the new compounds were identified based on cumulative analyses of HRESIMS and NMR spectra. Himalaquinones A-F were determined to be unique anthraquinones that contained unusual C-4a 3-methylbut-3-enoic acid aromatic substitutions, while himalaquinone G was identified as a new 5,6-dihydrodiol-bearing angucyclinone. Comparative bioactivity assessment (antimicrobial, cancer cell line cytotoxicity, impact on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and effect on axolotl embryo tail regeneration) revealed cytotoxic landomycin and saquayamycin analogues to inhibit 4E-BP1p and inhibit regeneration. In contrast, himalaquinone G, while also cytotoxic and a regeneration inhibitor, did not affect 4E-BP1p status at the doses tested. As such, this work implicates a unique mechanism for himalaquinone G and possibly other 5,6-dihydrodiol-bearing angucyclinones.	0
Abstract2class: Stereoselective synthesis of F-ring saturated estrone-derived inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling based on cyclopamine Abstract: Previous work in this laboratory established that the readily available F-ring aromatic analog of cyclopamine is a highly potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The synthesis and biological evaluation of two F-ring saturated analogs that are more potent than the F-ring aromatic structure are reported.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthetic assembly of cupriachelin, a photoreactive siderophore from the bioplastic producer Cupriavidus necator H16 Abstract: The bacterium Cupriavidus necator H16 produces a family of linear lipopeptides when grown under low iron conditions. The structural composition of these molecules, exemplified by the main metabolite cupriachelin, is reminiscent of siderophores that are excreted by marine bacteria. Comparable to marine siderophores, the ferric form of cupriachelin exhibits photoreactive properties. Exposure to UV light induces an oxidation of its peptidic backbone and a concomitant reduction of the coordinated Fe(III). Here, we report the genomics-inspired isolation and structural characterization of cupriachelin as well as its encoding gene cluster, which was identified by insertional mutagenesis. Based upon the functional characterization of adenylation domain specificity, a model for cupriachelin biosynthesis is proposed.	1
Abstract2class: A Thioacetal Photocage Designed for Dual Release: Application in the Quantitation of Therapeutic Release by Synchronous Reporter Decaging Abstract: Despite the immense potential of existing photocaging technology, its application is limited by the paucity of advanced caging tools. Here, we report on the design of a novel thioacetal ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde (TNB) dual arm photocage that enabled control of the simultaneous release of two payloads linked to a single TNB unit. By using this cage, which was prepared in a single step from commercial 6-nitroverataldehyde, three drug-fluorophore conjugates were synthesized: Taxol-TNB-fluorescein, Taxol-TNB-coumarin, and doxorubicin-TNB-coumarin, and long-wavelength UVA light-triggered release experiments demonstrated that dual payload release occurred with rapid decay kinetics for each conjugate. In cell-based assays performed in vitro, dual release could also be controlled by UV exposure, resulting in increased cellular fluorescence and cytotoxicity with potency equal to that of unmodified drug towards the KB carcinoma cell line. The extent of such dual release was quantifiable by reporter fluorescence measured in situ and was found to correlate with the extent of cytotoxicity. Thus, this novel dual arm cage strategy provides a valuable tool that enables both active control and real-time monitoring of drug activation at the delivery site.	0
Abstract2class: Production of volatile sulfur compounds during the decomposition of algal mats Abstract: Blue-green algal mats incubated anaerobically rapidly produce large amounts of volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide. The major organic sulfur compound is methyl mercaptan, in contrast to previous results with marine eucaryotic algae. Light inhibited production of volatile sulfur compounds, apparently because the algae then produced O2, rendering the system aerobic.	0
Abstract2class: Effect of mixing on rifampin bactericidal activity against staphylococci Abstract: Minimal bactericidal concentrations of rifampin were significantly increased, and serum bactericidal activity from volunteers receiving this drug was significantly decreased by vigorous mixing of microtiter plates before sampling when tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 10(5) and 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. These results suggest that microtiter estimates of the bactericidal activity of rifampin against staphylococci should be performed after vigorous shaking.	0
Abstract2class: Aza-Rubottom Oxidation: Synthetic Access to Primary α-Aminoketones Abstract: An aza analogue of the Rubottom oxidation is reported. This facile transformation takes place at ambient temperature and directly converts silyl enol ethers to the corresponding primary α-aminoketones. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent is essential for the success of this reaction. Overall this process is well-suited for the aza-functionalization and derivatization of complex organic molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Dual catalysis. Merging photoredox with nickel catalysis: coupling of α-carboxyl sp³-carbons with aryl halides Abstract: Over the past 40 years, transition metal catalysis has enabled bond formation between aryl and olefinic (sp(2)) carbons in a selective and predictable manner with high functional group tolerance. Couplings involving alkyl (sp(3)) carbons have proven more challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of photoredox catalysis and nickel catalysis provides an alternative cross-coupling paradigm, in which simple and readily available organic molecules can be systematically used as coupling partners. By using this photoredox-metal catalysis approach, we have achieved a direct decarboxylative sp(3)-sp(2) cross-coupling of amino acids, as well as α-O- or phenyl-substituted carboxylic acids, with aryl halides. Moreover, this mode of catalysis can be applied to direct cross-coupling of C(sp³)-H in dimethylaniline with aryl halides via C-H functionalization.	0
Abstract2class: Adhesion and aggregation properties of Lactobacillaceae strains as protection ways against enteropathogenic bacteria Abstract: The adhesion and aggregation are characteristic attributes of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillaceae genus. Due to these properties the host organisms can avoid colonisation of the intestinal tract by enteropathogenic bacteria. The presented research includes a comparison of the properties of various strains belonging to different Lactobacillaceae species and isolated from different sources The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. ultunensis) from probiotic products and clinical specimens to direct and competitive adherence to Caco-2 and HT-29 cell lines. Furthermore, the ability of lactobacilli and enteropathogenic bacteria, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. Typhimurium, to auto- and co-aggregation was also investigated.The results showed that all tested strains adhered to Caco-2 and HT-29 cell lines. Though, the factor of adhesion depended on the species and origin of the strain. L. rhamnosus strains showed a lowest degree of adherence as compared to L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sp. strains. On the other side both, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus strains reduced the pathogenic bacteria in competition adherence test most effectively. All tested lactobacilli strains were characterised by auto- and co-aggregation abilities, to various degrees. The properties of Lactobacillaceae strains analysed in this study, like adhesion abilities, competitive adherence, auto- and co-aggregation, may affect the prevention of colonisation and elimination of pathogenic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract.	0
Abstract2class: The dnaK protein of Escherichia coli possesses an ATPase and autophosphorylating activity and is essential in an in vitro DNA replication system Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaK gene product, originally defined by mutations that blocked lambda phage DNA replication, is known to be necessary for E. coli viability. We have purified dnaK protein to homogeneity and have demonstrated that it possesses a weak DNA-independent ATPase activity, which results in the production of ADP and Pi. The proof that this ATPase activity is encoded by the dnaK+ gene relies primarily on the fact that the dnaK756 mutation results in the production of an ATPase activity with altered physical properties. The dnaK protein is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo, probably as a result of an autophosphorylation reaction. The lambda O and P replication proteins were shown to interact in vitro with the dnaK protein. The ATPase activity of the dnaK protein was inhibited by purified lambda P protein and stimulated by purified lambda O protein. Moreover, the dnaK protein participates in the initiation of DNA synthesis in an in vitro DNA replication system that is dependent on the O and P proteins. Anti-dnaK protein immunoglobulin specifically inhibited DNA synthesis in this system.	0
Abstract2class: An antifungal polyketide associated with horizontally acquired genes supports symbiont-mediated defense in Lagria villosa beetles Abstract: Microbial symbionts are often a source of chemical novelty and can contribute to host defense against antagonists. However, the ecological relevance of chemical mediators remains unclear for most systems. Lagria beetles live in symbiosis with multiple strains of Burkholderia bacteria that protect their offspring against pathogens. Here, we describe the antifungal polyketide lagriamide, and provide evidence supporting that it is produced by an uncultured symbiont, Burkholderia gladioli Lv-StB, which is dominant in field-collected Lagria villosa. Interestingly, lagriamide is structurally similar to bistramides, defensive compounds found in marine tunicates. We identify a gene cluster that is probably involved in lagriamide biosynthesis, provide evidence for horizontal acquisition of these genes, and show that the naturally occurring symbiont strains on the egg are protective in the soil environment. Our findings highlight the potential of microbial symbionts and horizontal gene transfer as influential sources of ecological innovation.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a DNA element in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 (thi3) promoter involved in thiamine-regulated gene expression Abstract: To define DNA elements involved in thiamine-regulated transcription of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene nmt1 (thi3), we analyzed several nmt1 promoter constructs. We detected a DNA element which is required for promoter activation in the absence of thiamine. It is located 54 to 62 bp upstream of the TATA box and matches the consensus sequence of the binding site for the mammalian transcription factor C/EBP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein). We show that the element specifically binds proteins.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic organization of chromosomal S-layer glycan biosynthesis loci of Bacillaceae Abstract: S-layer glycoproteins are cell surface glycoconjugates that have been identified in archaea and in bacteria. Usually, S-layer glycoproteins assemble into regular, crystalline arrays covering the entire bacterium. Our research focuses on thermophilic Bacillaceae, which are considered a suitable model system for studying bacterial glycosylation. During the past decade, investigations of S-layer glycoproteins dealt with the elucidation of the highly variable glycan structures by a combination of chemical degradation methods and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was only recently that the molecular characterization of the genes governing the formation of the S-layer glycoprotein glycan chains has been initiated. The S-layer glycosylation (slg) gene clusters of four of the 11 known S-layer glycan structures from members of the Bacillaceae have now been studied. The clusters are approximately 16 to approximately 25 kb in size and transcribed as polycistronic units. They include nucleotide sugar pathway genes that are arranged as operons, sugar transferase genes, glycan processing genes, and transporter genes. So far, the biochemical functions only of the genes required for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis have been demonstrated experimentally. The presence of insertion sequences and the decrease of the G + C content at the slg locus suggest that the investigated organisms have acquired their specific S-layer glycosylation potential by lateral gene transfer. In addition, S-layer protein glycosylation requires the participation of housekeeping genes that map outside the cluster. The gene encoding the respective S-layer target protein is transcribed monocistronically and independently of the slg cluster genes. Its chromosomal location is not necessarily in close vicinity to the slg gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Cyanobacterial polyketide synthase docking domains: a tool for engineering natural product biosynthesis Abstract: Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are versatile biosynthetic systems that initiate, successively elongate, and modify acyl chains. Intermediate transfer between modules is mediated via docking domains, which are attractive targets for PKS pathway engineering to produce natural product analogs. We identified a class 2 docking domain in cyanobacterial PKSs and determined crystal structures for two docking domain pairs, revealing a distinct class 2 docking strategy for promoting intermediate transfer. The selectivity of class 2 docking interactions, demonstrated in binding and biochemical assays, could be altered by mutagenesis. We determined the ideal fusion location for exchanging class 1 and class 2 docking domains and demonstrated effective polyketide chain transfer in heterologous modules. Thus, class 2 docking domains are tools for rational bioengineering of a broad range of PKSs containing either class 1 or 2 docking domains.	0
Abstract2class: Production of eight different hydride complexes and nitrite release from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Yarrowia lipolytica Abstract: 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) transformation by the yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15 was shown to occur via two different pathways. Direct aromatic ring reduction was the predominant mechanism of TNT transformation, while nitro group reduction was observed to be a minor pathway. Although growth of Y. lipolytica AN-L15 was inhibited initially in the presence of TNT, TNT transformation was observed, indicating that the enzymes necessary for TNT reduction were present initially. Aromatic ring reduction resulted in the transient accumulation of eight different TNT-hydride complexes, which were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography, UV-visible diode array detection, and negative-mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). APCI-MS analysis revealed three different groups of TNT-hydride complexes with molecular ions at m/z 227, 228, and 230, which correspond to TNT-mono- and dihydride complexes and protonated dihydride isomers, respectively. One of the three protonated dihydride complex isomers detected appears to release nitrite in the presence of strain AN-L15. This release of nitrite is of particular interest since it can provide a pathway towards complete degradation and detoxification of TNT.	0
Abstract2class: Modulating the electron-transfer properties of a mixed-valence system through host-guest chemistry Abstract: Metal directed self-assembly has become a much-studied route towards complex molecular architectures. Although studies on mixed valence, MV, systems accessible through this approach are almost non-existent, the potential applications of such systems are very exciting as MV states provide the basis of a number of molecular-scale devices, including single electron wires and switches. Furthermore, while many novel hosts for guest ions and molecules have been developed through metal directed self-assembly, as these products tend to be kinetically labile, very few electrochemical studies have been reported. Herein, we report that the interplay between the binding properties and redox activity of a self-assembled trinuclear RuII macrocycle leads to an hitherto unreported phenomenon, in which access to specific MV states can be gated by host-guest chemistry. Thus, this system is the first in which MV states and the extent of electron delocalisation are switched by an ion without any change in electrochemical potential.	0
Abstract2class: Trichloroethylene degradation by Escherichia coli containing the cloned Pseudomonas putida F1 toluene dioxygenase genes Abstract: Toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 has been implicated as an enzyme capable of degrading trichloroethylene. This has now been confirmed with Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601) that contains the structural genes (todC1C2BA) of toluene dioxygenase under the control of the tac promoter. The extent of trichloroethylene degradation by the recombinant organism depended on the cell concentration and the concentration of trichloroethylene. A linear rate of trichloroethylene degradation was observed with the E. coli recombinant strain. In contrast, P. putida F39/D, a mutant strain of P. putida F1 that does not contain cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, showed a much faster initial rate of trichloroethylene degradation which decreased over time.	0
Abstract2class: Adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) is recruited by the HEATR5 protein Laa1 and its co-factor Laa2 in yeast Abstract: Cellular membrane trafficking mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) is important for the proper composition and function of organelles of the endolysosomal system. Normal AP-1 function requires proteins of the HEAT repeat-containing 5 (HEATR5) family. Although HEATR5 proteins were first identified based on their ability to interact with AP-1, the functional significance of this interaction was unknown. We used bioinformatics-based phenotypic profiling and information from genome-wide fluorescence microscopy studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify a protein, Laa2, that mediates the interaction between AP-1 and the yeast HEATR5 protein Laa1. Further characterization of Laa2 revealed that it binds to both Laa1 and AP-1. Laa2 contains a motif similar to the characterized γ-ear-binding sites found in other AP-1-binding proteins. This motif in Laa2 is essential for the Laa1-AP-1 interaction. Moreover, mutation of this motif disrupted AP-1 localization and function and caused effects similar to mutations that remove the γ-ear of AP-1. These results indicate that Laa2 mediates the interaction between Laa1 and AP-1 and reveal that this interaction promotes the stable association of AP-1 with membranes in yeast.	0
Abstract2class: Structural insights into enzymatic [4+2] aza-cycloaddition in thiopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is an enabling transformation in modern synthetic organic chemistry, but there are only limited examples of dedicated natural enzymes that can catalyze this transformation. Thiopeptides (or more formally thiazolyl peptides) are a class of thiazole-containing, highly modified, macrocyclic secondary metabolites made from ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides. The characteristic feature of these natural products is a six-membered nitrogenous heterocycle that is assembled via a formal [4+2] cycloaddition between two dehydroalanine (Dha) residues. This heteroannulation is entirely contingent on enzyme activity, although the mechanism of the requisite pyridine/dehydropiperidine synthase remains to be elucidated. The unusual aza-cylic product is distinct from the more common carbocyclic products of synthetic and biosynthetic [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. To elucidate the mechanism of cycloaddition, we have determined atomic resolution structures of the pyridine synthases involved in the biosynthesis of the thiopeptides thiomuracin (TbtD) and GE2270A (PbtD), in complex with substrates and product analogs. Structure-guided biochemical, mutational, computational, and binding studies elucidate active-site features that explain how orthologs can generate rigid macrocyclic scaffolds of different sizes. Notably, the pyridine synthases show structural similarity to the elimination domain of lanthipeptide dehydratases, wherein insertions of secondary structural elements result in the formation of a distinct active site that catalyzes different chemistry. Comparative analysis identifies other catalysts that contain a shared core protein fold but whose active sites are located in entirely different regions, illustrating a principle predicted from efforts in de novo protein design.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of phenylnannolone A, a multidrug resistance reversal agent from the halotolerant myxobacterium Nannocystis pusilla B150 Abstract: The myxobacterial strain Nannocystis pusilla B150 synthesizes the structurally new polyketides phenylnannolone A–C. Apart from some common volatiles and siderophores, these are the first natural products from the genus Nannocystis. Phenylnannolone A shows inhibitory activity towards the ABCB1 gene product P-glycoprotein and reverses daunorubicin resistance in cancer cells. To decipher the biochemical reactions leading to the formation of phenylnannolone A, the putative biosynthetic genes were identified (phn1, phn2). Phn2 is a polyketide synthase (PKS) with an NRPS-like loading module, and its domain order is consistent with the phenylnannolone A structure. The functionality and substrate selectivity of the loading module were determined by means of a γ-18O4-ATP pyrophosphate exchange and a phosphopantetheine ejection assay. A specific activation of cinnamic acid by the AMP-ligase was detected. Phn1 is a putative butyryl-CoA carboxylase (BCC), providing ethylmalonyl-CoA for the formation of the ethyl-substituted part of phenylnannolone A. Phn1 is the first BCC found in biosynthetic genes for an ethyl-substituted natural compound. Biosynthesis of phenylnannolone A, putatively encoded by phn1 and phn2, thus utilizes the first biosynthetic machinery in which both a BCC and a PKS are involved.	1
Abstract2class: Sequential action of two flavoenzymes, PgaE and PgaM, in angucycline biosynthesis: chemoenzymatic synthesis of gaudimycin C Abstract: Tailoring steps in aromatic polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis are an important source of structural diversity and, consequently, an intriguing focal point for enzymological studies. PgaE and PgaM from Streptomyces sp. PGA64 are representatives of flavoenzymes catalyzing early post-PKS reactions in angucycline biosynthesis. This in vitro study illustrates that the chemoenzymatic conversion of UWM6 into the metabolite, gaudimycin C, requires multiple closely coupled reactions to prevent intermediate degradation. The NMR structure of gaudimycin C confirms that the reaction cascade involves C12- and C12b-hydroxylation, C2,3-dehydration, and stereospecific ketoreduction at C6. Enzymatic 18O incorporation studies verify that the oxygens at C12 and C12b derive from O2 and H2O, respectively. The results indicate that PgaM deviates mechanistically from flavoprotein monooxygenases, and suggest an alternative catalytic mechanism involving a quinone methide intermediate.	1
Abstract2class: Pseudomonas sp. COW3 Produces New Bananamide-Type Cyclic Lipopeptides with Antimicrobial Activity against Pythium myriotylum and Pyricularia oryzae Abstract: Pseudomonas species are metabolically robust, with capacity to produce secondary metabolites including cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs). Herein we conducted a chemical analysis of a crude CLP extract from the cocoyam rhizosphere-derived biocontrol strain Pseudomonas sp. COW3. We performed in silico analyses on its whole genome, and conducted in vitro antagonistic assay using the strain and purified CLPs. Via LC-MS and NMR, we elucidated the structures of four novel members of the bananamide group, named bananamides D-G. Besides variability in fatty acid length, bananamides D-G differ from previously described bananamides A-C and MD-0066 by the presence of a serine and aspartic acid at position 6 and 2, respectively. In addition, bananamide G has valine instead of isoleucine at position 8. Kendrick mass defect (KMD) allowed the assignment of molecular formulae to bananamides D and E. We unraveled a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase cluster banA, banB and banC which encodes the novel bananamide derivatives. Furthermore, COW3 displayed antagonistic activity and mycophagy against Pythium myriotylum, while it mainly showed mycophagy on Pyricularia oryzae. Purified bananamides D-G inhibited the growth of P. myriotylum and P. oryzae and caused hyphal distortion. Our study shows the complementarity of chemical analyses and genome mining in the discovery and elucidation of novel CLPs. In addition, structurally diverse bananamides differ in their antimicrobial activity.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous expression of the msp2 gene from Marasmius scorodonius Abstract: For the heterologous expression of the msp2 gene from the edible mushroom Marasmius scorodonius in Escherichia coli the cDNA encoding the extracellular Msp2 peroxidase was cloned into the pBAD III expression plasmid. Expression of the protein with or without signal peptide was investigated in E. coli strains TOP10 and LMG194. Different PCR products were amplified for expression of the native target protein or a protein with a signal peptide. Omitting the native stop codon and adding six His-residues resulted in a fusion protein amenable to immune detection and purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography. In E. coli the recombinant protein was produced in high yield as insoluble inclusion bodies. The influence of different parameters on MsP2 refolding was investigated. Active enzyme was obtained by glutathione-mediated oxidation in a medium containing urea, Ca(2+), and hemin.	0
Abstract2class: The puzzle of RNAs that target gene promoters Abstract: Setting the right target: Most researchers who use small RNAs in mammalian cells assume that mRNA will be the target. Recent studies suggest that small RNAs can also target chromosomal DNA. Few discoveries have had the impact of RNAi. Most researchers who use small RNAs to control gene expression in mammalian cells assume that mRNA will be the target. Recent studies, however, have suggested that small RNAs can also target chromosomal DNA.	0
Abstract2class: Comparison of design strategies for promotion of beta-peptide 14-helix stability in water Abstract: Many short beta-peptides adopt well-defined conformations in organic solvents, but specialized stabilizing elements are required for folding to occur in aqueous solution. Several different strategies to stabilize the 14-helical secondary structure in water have been developed, and here we provide a direct comparison of three such strategies. We have synthesized and characterized beta-peptide heptamers in which variously a salt bridge between side chains, a covalent link between side chains, or two cyclically constrained residues have been incorporated to promote 14-helicity. The incorporation of a salt bridge does not generate significant 14-helicity in water, according to CD and 2D NMR data. In contrast, incorporation either of a lactam bridge between side chains or of cyclic residues results in stable 14-helices in water. The beta-peptides featuring trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues show the highest 14-helical backbone stability, with hardly any sensitivity to pH or ionic strength. The beta-peptides featuring side-chain-to-side-chain cyclization show lower 14-helical backbone stability and higher sensitivity to pH and ionic strength, but increased order between the side chains because of the cyclization.	0
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli membrane protein gene Lxx18460 (anti-sigma K) Abstract: Background:                       Sugarcane is an important sugar and economic crop in the world. Ratoon stunting Disease (RSD) of sugarcane, caused by Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli, is widespread in countries and regions where sugarcane is grown and also limited to sugarcane productivity. Although the whole genome sequencing of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli was completed, progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of the disease has been slow because it is difficult to grow in culture.                  Results:                       The Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli membrane protein gene Lxx18460 (anti-sigma K) was cloned from the Lxx-infected sugarcane cultivar GT11 at the mature stage using RT-PCR technique, and the gene structure and expression in infected sugarcane were analyzed. The Lxx18460 gene was transformed into Nicotiana tabacum by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediation. The transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing Lxx18460 had lower levels in plant height, leaf area, net photosynthetic rate and endogenous hormones of IAA, ABA and GA3, as well as lower activities of three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than the wild type (WT) tobacco. With the plant growth, the expression of Lxx18460 gene and protein was increased. To better understand the regulation of Lxx18460 expression, transcriptome analysis of leaves from transgenic and wild type tobacco was performed. A total of 60,222 all-unigenes were obtained through BGISEQ-500 sequencing. Compared the transgenic plants with the WT plants, 11,696 upregulated and 5949 downregulated genes were identified. These differentially expressed genes involved in many metabolic pathways including signal transduction, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and so on. Though the data presented here are from a heterologous system, Lxx 18460 has an adverse impact on the growth of tobacco; it reduces the photosynthesis of tobacco, destroys the activity of defense enzymes, and affects the levels of endogenous hormones, which indicate that Lxx18460 may act important roles in the course of infection in sugarcane.                  Conclusions:                       This is the first study on analyzing the function of the membrane protein gene Lxx18460 of anti-sigma K (σK) factor in Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli. Our findings will improve the understanding of the interaction between the RSD pathogen Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli and sugarcane. The output of this study will also be helpful to explore the pathogenesis of RSD.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of an amsacrine-resistant line of human leukemia cells. Evidence for a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II Abstract: HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 100 times more resistant to the cytotoxic actions of the antineoplastic, topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating acridine derivative amsacrine (m-AMSA) than is its parent HL-60 line. HL-60/AMSA cells are minimally resistant to etoposide, a topoisomerase II-reactive drug that does not intercalate. Previously we showed that HL-60 topoisomerase II activity in cells, nuclei, or nuclear extracts was sensitive to m-AMSA and etoposide, while HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II was resistant to m-AMSA but sensitive to etoposide. Now we show that purified topoisomerase II from the two cell lines exhibits the same drug sensitivity or resistance as that in the nuclear extracts although the magnitude of the m-AMSA resistance of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II in vitro is not as great as the resistance of the intact HL-60/AMSA cells. In addition HL-60/AMSA cells are cross-resistant to topoisomerase II-reactive intercalators from the anthracycline and ellipticine families and the pattern of sensitivity or resistance to the cytotoxic actions of the various topoisomerase II-reactive drugs is paralleled by topoisomerase II-reactive drug-induced DNA cleavage and protein cross-link production in cells and the production of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and protein cross-linking in isolated biochemical systems. In addition to its lowered sensitivity to intercalators, HL-60/AMSA differed from HL-60 in 1) the susceptibility of its topoisomerase II to stimulation of DNA topoisomerase II complex formation by ATP, 2) the catalytic activity of its topoisomerase II in an ionic environment chosen to reproduce the environment found within the living cell, and 3) the observed restriction enzyme pattern on a Southern blot probed with a cDNA for human topoisomerase II. These data indicate that an m-AMSA-resistant form of topoisomerase II contributes to the resistance of HL-60/AMSA to m-AMSA and to other topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating agents. The drug resistance is associated with additional biochemical and molecular alterations that may be important determinants of cellular sensitivity or resistance to topoisomerase II-reactive drugs.	0
Abstract2class: Functional replacement of the Escherichia coli D-(-)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) with the L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) from Pediococcus acidilactici Abstract: The microbial production of L-(+)-lactic acid is rapidly expanding to allow increased production of polylactic acid (PLA), a renewable, biodegradable plastic. The physical properties of PLA can be tailored for specific applications by controlling the ratio of L-(+) and D-(-) isomers. For most uses of PLA, the L-(+) isomer is more abundant. As an approach to reduce costs associated with biocatalysis (complex nutrients, antibiotics, aeration, product purification, and waste disposal), a recombinant derivative of Escherichia coli W3110 was developed that contains five chromosomal deletions (focA-pflB frdBC adhE ackA ldhA). This strain was constructed from a D-(-)-lactic acid-producing strain, SZ63 (focA-pflB frdBC adhE ackA), by replacing part of the chromosomal ldhA coding region with Pediococcus acidilactici ldhL encoding an L-lactate dehydrogenase. Although the initial strain (SZ79) grew and fermented poorly, a mutant (SZ85) was readily isolated by selecting for improved growth. SZ85 exhibited a 30-fold increase in L-lactate dehydrogenase activity in comparison to SZ79, functionally replacing the native D-lactate dehydrogenase activity. Sequencing revealed mutations in the upstream, coding, and terminator regions of ldhL in SZ85, which are presumed to be responsible for increased L-lactate dehydrogenase activity. SZ85 produced L-lactic acid in M9 mineral salts medium containing glucose or xylose with a yield of 93 to 95%, a purity of 98% (based on total fermentation products), and an optical purity greater than 99%. Unlike other recombinant biocatalysts for L-lactic acid, SZ85 remained prototrophic and is devoid of plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes.	0

Abstract2class: Structural studies of an A2-type modular polyketide synthase ketoreductase reveal features controlling α-substituent stereochemistry Abstract: Modular polyketide synthase ketoreductases often set two stereocenters when reducing intermediates in the biosynthesis of a complex polyketide. Here we report the 2.55-Å resolution structure of an A2-type ketoreductase from the 11th module of the amphotericin polyketide synthase that sets a combination of l-α-methyl and l-β-hydroxyl stereochemistries and represents the final catalytically competent ketoreductase type to be structurally elucidated. Through structure-guided mutagenesis a double mutant of an A1-type ketoreductase was generated that functions as an A2-type ketoreductase on a diketide substrate analogue, setting an α-alkyl substituent in an l-orientation rather than in the d-orientation set by the unmutated ketoreductase. When the activity of the double mutant was examined in the context of an engineered triketide lactone synthase, the anticipated triketide lactone was not produced even though the ketoreductase-containing module still reduced the diketide substrate analogue as expected. These findings suggest that re-engineered ketoreductases may be catalytically outcompeted within engineered polyketide synthase assembly lines.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of Thiotetronic Acid Antibiotic Biosynthetic Pathways by Target-directed Genome Mining Abstract: Recent genome sequencing efforts have led to the rapid accumulation of uncharacterized or "orphaned" secondary metabolic biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in public databases. This increase in DNA-sequenced big data has given rise to significant challenges in the applied field of natural product genome mining, including (i) how to prioritize the characterization of orphan BGCs and (ii) how to rapidly connect genes to biosynthesized small molecules. Here, we show that by correlating putative antibiotic resistance genes that encode target-modified proteins with orphan BGCs, we predict the biological function of pathway specific small molecules before they have been revealed in a process we call target-directed genome mining. By querying the pan-genome of 86 Salinispora bacterial genomes for duplicated house-keeping genes colocalized with natural product BGCs, we prioritized an orphan polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid BGC (tlm) with a putative fatty acid synthase resistance gene. We employed a new synthetic double-stranded DNA-mediated cloning strategy based on transformation-associated recombination to efficiently capture tlm and the related ttm BGCs directly from genomic DNA and to heterologously express them in Streptomyces hosts. We show the production of a group of unusual thiotetronic acid natural products, including the well-known fatty acid synthase inhibitor thiolactomycin that was first described over 30 years ago, yet never at the genetic level in regards to biosynthesis and autoresistance. This finding not only validates the target-directed genome mining strategy for the discovery of antibiotic producing gene clusters without a priori knowledge of the molecule synthesized but also paves the way for the investigation of novel enzymology involved in thiotetronic acid natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Streptomyces clavuligerus has a second copy of the proclavaminate amidinohydrolase gene Abstract: Past genetic studies have indicated that the genes encoding early enzymes of clavulanic acid biosynthesis may be duplicated in Streptomyces clavuligerus. We observed cross-hybridizing bands upon Southern analyses of proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah)-defective mutant strains of S. clavuligerus screened with a pah-specific probe. The DNA fragment responsible for this cross hybridization was cloned and sequenced and shown to encode a second copy of the pah gene. The new pah gene (pah1) was 1,056 bp in length, and its sequence was 72% identical to that of the original pah gene (pah2). Disruption mutants with defects in pah1 showed no significant effects on production of clavulanic acid or any of the clavam metabolites with stereochemistries opposite that of clavulanic acid (5S clavams) produced by S. clavuligerus when they were grown on starch asparagine or soy medium. However, double mutants with defects in both pah1 and pah2 were defective in the production of both clavulanic acid and all of the 5S clavam metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: HEx: A heterologous expression platform for the discovery of fungal natural products Abstract: For decades, fungi have been a source of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved natural products such as penicillin, cyclosporine, and the statins. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing suggest that millions of fungal species exist on Earth, with each genome encoding pathways capable of generating as many as dozens of natural products. However, the majority of encoded molecules are difficult or impossible to access because the organisms are uncultivable or the genes are transcriptionally silent. To overcome this bottleneck in natural product discovery, we developed the HEx (Heterologous EXpression) synthetic biology platform for rapid, scalable expression of fungal biosynthetic genes and their encoded metabolites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied this platform to 41 fungal biosynthetic gene clusters from diverse fungal species from around the world, 22 of which produced detectable compounds. These included novel compounds with unexpected biosynthetic origins, particularly from poorly studied species. This result establishes the HEx platform for rapid discovery of natural products from any fungal species, even those that are uncultivable, and opens the door to discovery of the next generation of natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Long-chain N-acyltyrosine synthases from environmental DNA Abstract: The heterologous expression of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples (environmental DNA [eDNA]) in easily cultured hosts provides access to natural products produced by previously inaccessible microorganisms. When eDNA cosmid libraries were screened in Escherichia coli for antibacterially active clones, long-chain N-acyltyrosine-producing clones were found in every eDNA library. These apparently common natural products have not been previously described from screening extracts of cultured bacteria for biologically active natural products. Of the 11 long-chain N-acyl amino acid synthases (NASs) that were characterized, 10 are unique sequences. A predicted protein of previously unknown function from Nitrosomonas europaea, a gram-negative nitrifying beta-proteobacterium, is 14 to 37% identical to eDNA NASs. When cloned into E. coli, this open reading frame confers the production of long-chain N-acyltyrosines to the host and is therefore the first NAS from a cultured bacterium to be functionally characterized. Understanding the role that long-chain N-acyl amino acids play in soil microbial communities should now be feasible with the identification of a cultured organism that has the genetic capacity to produce these compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Mutational analysis of a phenazine biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces anulatus 9663 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for endophenazines, i.e., prenylated phenazines from Streptomyces anulatus 9663, was heterologously expressed in several engineered host strains derived from Streptomyces coelicolor M145. The highest production levels were obtained in strain M512. Mutations in the rpoB and rpsL genes of the host, which result in increased production of other secondary metabolites, had no beneficial effect on the production of phenazines. The heterologous expression strains produced, besides the known phenazine compounds, a new prenylated phenazine, termed endophenazine E. The structure of endophenazine E was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. It represented a conjugate of endophenazine A (9-dimethylallylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid) and L-glutamine (L-Gln), with the carboxyl group of endophenazine A forming an amide bond to the α-amino group of L-Gln. Gene inactivation experiments in the gene cluster proved that ppzM codes for a phenazine N-methyltransferase. The gene ppzV apparently represents a new type of TetR-family regulator, specifically controlling the prenylation in endophenazine biosynthesis. The gene ppzY codes for a LysR-type regulator and most likely controls the biosynthesis of the phenazine core. A further putative transcriptional regulator is located in the vicinity of the cluster, but was found not to be required for phenazine or endophenazine formation. This is the first investigation of the regulatory genes of phenazine biosynthesis in Streptomyces.	1
Abstract2class: Zwittermicin A resistance gene from Bacillus cereus Abstract: Zwittermicin A is a novel aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus that is active against diverse bacteria and lower eukaryotes (L.A. Silo-Suh, B.J. Lethbridge, S.J. Raffel, H. He, J. Clardy, and J. Handelsman, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2023-2030, 1994). To identify a determinant for resistance to zwittermicin A, we constructed a genomic library from B. cereus UW85, which produces zwittermicin A, and screened transformants of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, which is sensitive to zwittermicin A, for resistance to zwittermicin A. Subcloning and mutagenesis defined a genetic locus, designated zmaR, on a 1.2-kb fragment of DNA that conferred zwittermicin A resistance on E. coli. A DNA fragment containing zmaR hybridized to a corresponding fragment of genomic DNA from B. cereus UW85. Corresponding fragments were not detected in mutants of B. cereus UW85 that were sensitive to zwittermicin A, and the plasmids carrying zmaR restored resistance to the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants, indicating that zmaR was deleted in the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants and that zmaR is functional in B. cereus. Sequencing of the 1.2-kb fragment of DNA defined an open reading frame, designated ZmaR. Neither the nucleotide sequence nor the predicted protein sequence had significant similarity to sequences in existing databases. Cell extracts from an E. coli strain carrying zmaR contained a 43.5-kDa protein whose molecular mass and N-terminal sequence matched those of the protein predicted by the zmaR sequence. The results demonstrate that we have isolated a gene, zmaR, that encodes a zwIttermicin A resistance determinant that is functional in both B. cereus and E. coli.	1
Abstract2class: Atolypenes, Tricyclic Bacterial Sesterterpenes Discovered Using a Multiplexed In Vitro Cas9-TAR Gene Cluster Refactoring Approach Abstract: Most natural product biosynthetic gene clusters identified in bacterial genomic and metagenomic sequencing efforts are silent under laboratory growth conditions. Here, we describe a scalable biosynthetic gene cluster activation method wherein the gene clusters are disassembled at interoperonic regions in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 and then reassembled with PCR-amplified, short DNAs, carrying synthetic promoters, using transformation assisted recombination (TAR) in yeast. This simple, cost-effective, and scalable method allows for the simultaneous generation of combinatorial libraries of refactored gene clusters, eliminating the need to understand the transcriptional hierarchy of the silent genes. In two test cases, this in vitro disassembly-TAR reassembly method was used to create collections of promoter-replaced gene clusters that were tested in parallel to identify versions that enabled secondary metabolite production. Activation of the atolypene ( ato) gene cluster led to the characterization of two unprecedented bacterial cyclic sesterterpenes, atolypene A (1) and B (2), which are moderately cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines. This streamlined in vitro disassembly- in vivo reassembly method offers a simplified approach for silent gene cluster refactoring that should facilitate the discovery of natural products from silent gene clusters cloned from either metagenomes or cultured bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Exogenous isoleucine and fatty acid shortening ensure the high content of anteiso-C15:0 fatty acid required for low-temperature growth of Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that the branched-chain fatty acid anteiso-C15:0 plays a critical role in the growth of Listeria monocytogenes at low temperatures by ensuring sufficient membrane fluidity. Studies utilizing a chemically defined minimal medium revealed that the anteiso fatty acid precursor isoleucine largely determined the fatty acid profile and fatty acid response of the organism to lowered growth temperature. When isoleucine was sufficient, the fatty acid profile was very uniform, with anteiso fatty acids comprising up to 95% of total fatty acid, and the major fatty acid adjustment to low temperature was fatty acid chain shortening, which resulted in an increase of anteiso-C15:0 solely at the expense of anteiso-C17:0. When isoleucine was not supplied, the fatty acid profile became more complex and was readily modified by leucine, which resulted in a significant increase of corresponding iso fatty acids and an inability to grow at 10 degrees C. Under this condition, the increase of anteiso-C15:0 at low temperature resulted from the combined effect of increasing the anteiso:iso ratio and chain shortening. A branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase-defective strain largely lost the ability to increase the anteiso:iso ratio. Cerulenin, an inhibitor of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (FabF), induced a similar fatty acid chain shortening as low temperature did. We propose that the anteiso precursor preferences of enzymes in the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ensure a high production of anteiso fatty acids, and cold-regulated chain shortening results in a further increase of anteiso-C15:0 at the expense of anteiso-C17:0.	0
Abstract2class: Chromosomal replication origin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi functions in Escherichia coli: oriC consensus sequence Abstract: The chromosomal replication origin (oriC) of Vibrio harveyi has been isolated on a plasmid and shown to function as an origin in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the V. harveyi oriC was determined. From a comparison of this sequence with oriC sequences of five enteric bacteria, we derived a consensus sequence of bacterial origins that function in E. coli. This consensus sequence identifies 122 positions within oriC where nucleotide substitutions can occur without loss of origin function. These positions are clustered rather than scattered. Four interrelated nine-base-pair repeats and eight of the dam methylation G-A-T-C sites are conserved in the consensus sequence. Very few relative insertion-deletion changes occur, and these are localized to one region of oriC. The genes for three polypeptides linked to the V. harveyi oriC were identified by using in vitro protein synthesis directed by deletion derivative plasmid templates. One of these genes, coding for a 58,000 Mr polypeptide and located 3.0 kilobase pairs from the V. harveyi oriC region, is lethal to E. coli when many copies (approximately 40 per cell) are present (high copy lethal or HCL gene). In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that a different gene, the gid gene to the left of oriC, is highly conserved between E. coli and V. harveyi, whereas the coding region to the right of oriC is much less conserved.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of Novel Gymnodimines and Spirolides from the Marine Dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii Abstract: Cyclic imine toxins are neurotoxic, macrocyclic compounds produced by marine dinoflagellates. Mass spectrometric screenings of extracts from natural plankton assemblages revealed a high chemical diversity among this toxin class, yet only few toxins are structurally known. Here we report the structural characterization of four novel cyclic-imine toxins (two gymnodimines (GYMs) and two spirolides (SPXs)) from cultures of Alexandrium ostenfeldii. A GYM with m/z 510 (1) was identified as 16-desmethylGYM D. A GYM with m/z 526 was identified as the hydroxylated degradation product of (1) with an exocyclic methylene at C-17 and an allylic hydroxyl group at C-18. This compound was named GYM E (2). We further identified a SPX with m/z 694 as 20-hydroxy-13,19-didesmethylSPX C (10) and a SPX with m/z 696 as 20-hydroxy-13,19-didesmethylSPX D (11). This is the first report of GYMs without a methyl group at ring D and SPXs with hydroxyl groups at position C-20. These compounds can be conceived as derivatives of the same nascent polyketide chain, supporting the hypothesis that GYMs and SPXs are produced through common biosynthetic genes. Both novel GYMs 1 and 2 were detected in significant amounts in extracts from natural plankton assemblages (1: 447 pg; 2: 1250 pg; 11: 40 pg per mL filtered seawater respectively).	0
Abstract2class: The diffusible factor synthase XanB2 is a bifunctional chorismatase that links the shikimate pathway to ubiquinone and xanthomonadins biosynthetic pathways Abstract: The diffusible factor synthase XanB2, originally identified in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is highly conserved across a wide range of bacterial species, but its substrate and catalytic mechanism have not yet been investigated. Here, we show that XanB2 is a unique bifunctional chorismatase that hydrolyses chorismate, the end-product of the shikimate pathway, to produce 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA) and 4-HBA. 3-HBA and 4-HBA are respectively associated with the yellow pigment xanthomonadin biosynthesis and antioxidant activity in Xcc. We further demonstrate that XanB2 is a structurally novel enzyme with three putative domains. It catalyses 3-HBA and 4-HBA biosynthesis via a unique mechanism with the C-terminal YjgF-like domain conferring activity for 3-HBA biosynthesis and the N-terminal FGFG motif-containing domain responsible for 4-HBA biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that Xcc produces coenzyme Q8 (CoQ8) via a new biosynthetic pathway independent of the key chorismate-pyruvate lyase UbiC. XanB2 is the alternative source of 4-HBA for CoQ8 biosynthesis. The similar CoQ8 biosynthetic pathway, xanthomonadin biosynthetic gene cluster and XanB2 homologues are well conserved in the bacterial species within Xanthomonas, Xylella, Xylophilus, Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhodanobacter, Frateuria, Herminiimonas and Variovorax, suggesting that XanB2 may be a conserved metabolic link between the shikimate pathway, ubiquinone and xanthomonadin biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Structures of OA-6129D and E, new carbapenam antibiotics Abstract: The structures and stereochemistry of OA- 6129D and E, new carbapenam compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. OA-6129, were determined by spectroscopic analysis and chemical transformation.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the genes involved in the secretion and self-immunity of lacticin Q, an unmodified leaderless bacteriocin from Lactococcus lactis QU 5 Abstract: Lacticin Q (LnqQ) produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 5 is an unmodified linear bacteriocin, which is synthesized without an N-terminal leader peptide. In vitro synthesis and in vivo expression of LnqQ have revealed the intracellular toxicity of this leaderless peptide, as well as the necessity of a dedicated secretion and self-immunity system of producer cells. Further DNA sequencing and analysis have discovered 11 putative orf genes at the LnqQ locus. None of the orf genes showed similarities to any of the bacteriocin biosynthetic genes characterized to date; however, six orf genes (orf2q-7q), not including the structural gene (lnqQ), were highly conserved at the lacticin Z locus (orf2z-7z), which is a LnqQ homologue produced by L. lactis QU 14. ORF2q (ORF2z), the gene of which is located upstream of the structural gene, is a putative transcriptional regulator, whereas ORF6q and ORF7q (ORF6z and ORF7z) form a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter. The ORF3q-5q (ORF3z-5z) are all predicted to be membrane proteins with no clear functions. Co-expression of LnqQ and ORF3q-7q in a heterologous host allowed the extracellular production of LnqQ; additionally, the expression of ORF3q-7q rendered the host cells immune to LnqQ. This self-immunity was facilitated possibly by two means; firstly, by secreting the active LnqQ peptides, thus reducing the intracellular toxicity, and secondly, by protecting the host cells from extracellularly released LnqQ. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that describes intracellular toxicity of a leaderless bacteriocin and provides a rare example of biosynthetic genes that are required for bacteriocin secretion and immunity.	1
Abstract2class: Correlational networking guides the discovery of unclustered lanthipeptide protease-encoding genes Abstract: Bacterial natural product biosynthetic genes, canonically clustered, have been increasingly found to rely on hidden enzymes encoded elsewhere in the genome for completion of biosynthesis. The study and application of lanthipeptides are frequently hindered by unclustered protease genes required for final maturation. Here, we establish a global correlation network bridging the gap between lanthipeptide precursors and hidden proteases. Applying our analysis to 161,954 bacterial genomes, we establish 5209 correlations between precursors and hidden proteases, with 91 prioritized. We use network predictions and co-expression analysis to reveal a previously missing protease for the maturation of class I lanthipeptide paenilan. We further discover widely distributed bacterial M16B metallopeptidases of previously unclear biological function as a new family of lanthipeptide proteases. We show the involvement of a pair of bifunctional M16B proteases in the production of previously unreported class III lanthipeptides with high substrate specificity. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our correlational networking approach to the discovery of hidden lanthipeptide proteases and potentially other missing enzymes for natural products biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic studies and genetic engineering of pactamycin analogs with improved selectivity toward malarial parasites Abstract: Pactamycin, one of the most densely functionalized aminocyclitol antibiotics, has pronounced antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, and antiplasmodial activities, but its development as a clinical drug was hampered by its broad cytotoxicity. Efforts to modulate the biological activity by structural modifications using synthetic organic chemistry have been difficult because of the complexity of its chemical structure. However, through extensive biosynthetic studies and genetic engineering, we were able to produce analogs of pactamycin that show potent antimalarial activity, but lack significant antibacterial activity, and are about 10-30 times less toxic than pactamycin toward mammalian cells. The results suggest that distinct ribosomal binding selectivity or new mechanism(s) of action may be involved in their plasmodial growth inhibition, which may lead to the discovery of new antimalarial drugs and identification of new molecular targets within malarial parasites.	1
Abstract2class: Solution structures of spinach acyl carrier protein with decanoate and stearate Abstract: Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a cofactor in a variety of biosynthetic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism. Thus, it is of interest to determine structures of physiologically relevant ACP-fatty acid complexes. We report here the NMR solution structures of spinach ACP with decanoate (10:0-ACP) and stearate (18:0-ACP) attached to the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. The protein in the fatty acid complexes adopts a single conformer, unlike apo- and holo-ACP, which interconvert in solution between two major conformers. The protein component of both 10:0- and 18:0-ACP adopts the four-helix bundle topology characteristic of ACP, and a fatty acid binding cavity was identified in both structures. Portions of the protein close in space to the fatty acid and the 4'-phosphopantetheine were identified using filtered/edited NOESY experiments. A docking protocol was used to generate protein structures containing bound fatty acid for 10:0- and 18:0-ACP. In both cases, the predominant structure contained fatty acid bound down the center of the helical bundle, in agreement with the location of the fatty acid binding pockets. These structures demonstrate the conformational flexibility of spinach ACP and suggest how the protein changes to accommodate its myriad binding partners.	0
Abstract2class: Hapalindole/Ambiguine Biogenesis Is Mediated by a Cope Rearrangement, C-C Bond-Forming Cascade Abstract: Hapalindoles are bioactive indole alkaloids with fascinating polycyclic ring systems whose biosynthetic assembly mechanism has remained unknown since their initial discovery in the 1980s. In this study, we describe the fam gene cluster from the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua UTEX 1903 encoding hapalindole and ambiguine biosynthesis along with the characterization of two aromatic prenyltransferases, FamD1 and FamD2, and a previously undescribed cyclase, FamC1. These studies demonstrate that FamD2 and FamC1 act in concert to form the tetracyclic core ring system of the hapalindoles from cis-indole isonitrile and geranyl pyrophosphate through a presumed biosynthetic Cope rearrangement and subsequent 6-exo-trig cyclization/electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.	1
Abstract2class: Experimental and Computational Analysis of Protein Stabilization by Gly-to-d-Ala Substitution: A Convolution of Native State and Unfolded State Effects Abstract: The rational and predictable enhancement of protein stability is an important goal in protein design. Most efforts target the folded state, however stability is the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states thus both are suitable targets. Strategies directed at the unfolded state usually seek to decrease chain entropy by introducing cross-links or by replacing glycines. Cross-linking has led to mixed results. Replacement of glycine with an l-amino acid, while reducing the entropy of the unfolded state, can introduce unfavorable steric interactions in the folded state, since glycine is often found in conformations that require a positive φ angle such as helical C-capping motifs or type I' and II″ β-turns. l-Amino acids are strongly disfavored in these conformations, but d-amino acids are not. However, there are few reported examples and conflicting results have been obtained when glycines are replaced with d-Ala. We critically examine the effect of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions on protein stability using experimental approaches together with molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. The data, together with a survey of high resolution structures, show that the vast majority of proteins can be stabilized by substitution of C-capping glycines with d-Ala. Sites suitable for substitutions can be identified via sequence alignment with a high degree of success. Steric clashes in the native state due to the new side chain are rarely observed, but are likely responsible for the destabilizing or null effect observed for the small subset of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions which are not stabilizing. Changes in backbone solvation play less of a role. Favorable candidates for d-Ala substitution can be identified using a rapid algorithm based on molecular mechanics.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of ALS5 and ALS6 allelic variability in a geographically diverse collection of Candida albicans isolates Abstract: The Candida albicans ALS (agglutinin-like sequence) gene family encodes eight cell-surface glycoproteins, some of which function in adhesion to host surfaces. ALS genes have a central tandem repeat-encoding domain comprised entirely of head-to-tail copies of a conserved 108-bp sequence. The number of copies of the tandemly repeated sequence varies between C. albicans strains and often between alleles within the same strain. Because ALS alleles can encode different-sized proteins that may have different functional characteristics, defining the range of allelic variability is important. Genomic DNA from C. albicans strains representing the major genetic clades was PCR amplified to determine the number of tandemly repeated sequence copies within the ALS5 and ALS6 central domain. ALS5 alleles had 2-10 tandem repeat sequence copies (mean=4.82 copies) while ALS6 alleles had 2-8 copies (mean=4.00 copies). Despite this variability, tandem repeat copy number was stable in C. albicans strains passaged for 3000 generations. Prevalent alleles and allelic distributions varied among the clades for ALS5 and ALS6. Overall, ALS6 exhibited less variability than ALS5. ALS5 deletions can occur naturally in C. albicans via direct repeats flanking the ALS5 locus. Deletion of both ALS5 alleles was associated particularly with clades III and SA. ALS5 exhibited allelic polymorphisms in the coding region 5' of the tandem repeats; some alleles resembled ALS1, suggesting recombination between these contiguous loci. Natural deletion of ALS5 and the sequence variation within its coding region suggest relaxed selective pressure on this locus, and that Als5p function may be dispensable in C. albicans or redundant within the Als family.	0
Abstract2class: Seeing for speaking: Semantic and lexical information provided by briefly presented, naturalistic action scenes Abstract: At the interface between scene perception and speech production, we investigated how rapidly action scenes can activate semantic and lexical information. Experiment 1 examined how complex action-scene primes, presented for 150 ms, 100 ms, or 50 ms and subsequently masked, influenced the speed with which immediately following action-picture targets are named. Prime and target actions were either identical, showed the same action with different actors and environments, or were unrelated. Relative to unrelated primes, identical and same-action primes facilitated naming the target action, even when presented for 50 ms. In Experiment 2, neutral primes assessed the direction of effects. Identical and same-action scenes induced facilitation but unrelated actions induced interference. In Experiment 3, written verbs were used as targets for naming, preceded by action primes. When target verbs denoted the prime action, clear facilitation was obtained. In contrast, interference was observed when target verbs were phonologically similar, but otherwise unrelated, to the names of prime actions. This is clear evidence for word-form activation by masked action scenes. Masked action pictures thus provide conceptual information that is detailed enough to facilitate apprehension and naming of immediately following scenes. Masked actions even activate their word-form information-as is evident when targets are words. We thus show how language production can be primed with briefly flashed masked action scenes, in answer to long-standing questions in scene processing.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of the antibiotic bottromycin D Abstract: Drug resistant infectious diseases are quickly becoming a global health crisis. While Streptomyces spp. have been a major source of antibiotics over the past 50 years, efficient methods are needed to identify new antibiotics and greatly improve the rate of discovery. LCMS-based metabolomics were applied to analyze extracts of 50 Streptomyes spp. Using this methodology, we discovered bottromycin D and used whole genome sequencing to determine its biosynthesis by a ribosomal pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of coral settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole in marine bacteria by a uniquely adapted brominase-thioesterase enzyme pair Abstract: Halogenated pyrroles (halopyrroles) are common chemical moieties found in bioactive bacterial natural products. The halopyrrole moieties of mono- and dihalopyrrole-containing compounds arise from a conserved mechanism in which a proline-derived pyrrolyl group bound to a carrier protein is first halogenated and then elaborated by peptidic or polyketide extensions. This paradigm is broken during the marine pseudoalteromonad bacterial biosynthesis of the coral larval settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole (1), which arises from the substitution of the proline-derived carboxylate by a bromine atom. To understand the molecular basis for decarboxylative bromination in the biosynthesis of 1, we sequenced two Pseudoalteromonas genomes and identified a conserved four-gene locus encoding the enzymes involved in its complete biosynthesis. Through total in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of 1 using purified enzymes and biochemical interrogation of individual biochemical steps, we show that all four bromine atoms in 1 are installed by the action of a single flavin-dependent halogenase: Bmp2. Tetrabromination of the pyrrole induces a thioesterase-mediated offloading reaction from the carrier protein and activates the biosynthetic intermediate for decarboxylation. Insights into the tetrabrominating activity of Bmp2 were obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of the halogenase contrasted against structurally homologous halogenase Mpy16 that forms only a dihalogenated pyrrole in marinopyrrole biosynthesis. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the proposed substrate-binding pocket of Bmp2 led to a reduction in the degree of halogenation catalyzed. Our study provides a biogenetic basis for the biosynthesis of 1 and sets a firm foundation for querying the biosynthetic potential for the production of 1 in marine (meta)genomes.	1
Abstract2class: In vitro synergism of FR-31564, a new phosphonic acid antibiotic Abstract: Against most test strains of Gram-negative bacilli, the in vitro effect of FR-31564 together with beta-lactam antibiotics or trimethoprim was strongly synergistic; with tetracycline and nalidixic acid the effect was additive; and with gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole the effect was additive or antagonistic. FR-31564 was markedly synergistic with beta-lactam antibiotics against beta-lactam antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The combination of FR-31564 with beta-lactam antibiotics effected a reduction of MICs against most of the test strains to clinically achievable concentrations in human serum.	0
Abstract2class: A chain initiation factor common to both modular and aromatic polyketide synthases Abstract: Antibiotic-producing polyketide synthases (PKSs) are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis in Streptomyces and related filamentous bacteria of a remarkably broad range of bioactive metabolites, including antitumour aromatic compounds such as mithramycin and macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin. The molecular basis for the selection of the starter unit on aromatic PKSs is unknown. Here we show that a component of aromatic PKS, previously named 'chain-length factor', is a factor required for polyketide chain initiation and that this factor has decarboxylase activity towards malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein). We have re-examined the mechanism of initiation on modular PKSs and have identified as a specific initiation factor a domain of previously unknown function named KSQ, which operates like chain-length factor. Both KSQ and chain-length factor are similar to the ketosynthase domains that catalyse polyketide chain extension in modular multifunctional PKSs and in aromatic PKSs, respectively, except that the ketosynthase domain active-site cysteine residue is replaced by a highly conserved glutamine in KSQ and in chain-length factor. The glutamine residue is important both for decarboxylase activity and for polyketide synthesis.	1
Abstract2class: The human alpha 2 integrin gene promoter. Identification of positive and negative regulatory elements important for cell-type and developmentally restricted gene expression Abstract: The alpha 2 beta 1 serves as a collagen receptor or a collagen/laminin receptor, depending upon cell type. Expression of the integrin is regulated during normal cellular differentiation and is altered during carcinogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that increased expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin during megakaryocytic differentiation is a consequence of increased alpha 2 mRNA due to transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 integrin gene and that the decreased expression of the integrin in breast adenocarcinoma is due to decreased steady-state levels of alpha 2 mRNA. We now report the identification and characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the alpha 2 integrin gene. The 5'-untranslated region of the alpha 2 mRNA extends 129 base pairs 5' to the site of translation initiation. The promoter region lacks TATA and CAAT boxes but contains an abbreviated initiator sequence and six Sp1 binding sites. Consensus binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 complexes, a GATA box, a Pu.1 box, and two palindromic motifs with potential to bind the estrogen receptor are also present. A 961-base pair fragment of the 5'-flanking region directs both cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of a reporter gene in T47-D epithelial cells and in pluripotent hematopoietic K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation.	0
Abstract2class: Recombinant Protein Stability in Cyanobacteria Abstract: The living cell possesses extraordinary molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which to recognize and efficiently remove foreign, damaged, or denatured proteins. This essential function has been a barrier to the overexpression of recombinant proteins in most expression systems. A notable exception is the overexpression in E. coli of recombinant proteins, most of which, however, end-up as "inclusion bodies", i.e., cytoplasmic aggregates of proteins that are inaccessible to the cell's proteasome. "Fusion constructs as protein overexpression vectors" proved to be unparalleled in their ability to cause substantial accumulation of recombinant proteins from plants, animals, and bacteria, as soluble proteins in unicellular cyanobacteria. Recombinant protein levels in the range of 10-20% of the total cellular protein can be achieved. The present work investigated this unique property in the context of recombinant protein stability in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by developing and applying an in vivo cellular tobacco etch virus cleavage system with the objective of separating the target heterologous proteins from their fusion leader sequences. The work provides new insights about the overexpression, cellular stability, and exploitation of transgenes with commercial interest, highly expressed in a cyanobacterial biofactory. The results support the notion that eukaryotic plant- and animal-origin recombinant proteins are unstable, when free in the cyanobacterial cytosol but stable when in a fusion configuration with a highly expressed cyanobacterial native or heterologous protein. Included in this analysis are recombinant proteins of the plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (isoprene synthase, β-phellandrene synthase, geranyl diphosphate synthase), the human interferon protein, as well as prokaryotic proteins (tetanus toxin fragment C and the antibiotic resistance genes kanamycin and chloramphenicol). The future success of synthetic biology approaches with cyanobacteria and other systems would require overexpression of pathway enzymes to attain product volume, and the work reported in this paper sets the foundation for such recombinant pathway enzyme overexpression.	0
Abstract2class: The mitochondrion as janus bifrons Abstract: The signaling function of mitochondria is considered with a special emphasis on their role in the regulation of redox status of the cell, possibly determining a number of pathologies including cancer and aging. The review summarizes the transport role of mitochondria in energy supply to all cellular compartments (mitochondria as an electric cable in the cell), the role of mitochondria in plastic metabolism of the cell including synthesis of heme, steroids, iron-sulfur clusters, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Mitochondria also play an important role in the Ca(2+)-signaling and the regulation of apoptotic cell death. Knowledge of mechanisms responsible for apoptotic cell death is important for the strategy for prevention of unwanted degradation of postmitotic cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons.	0

Abstract2class: Genotyping-Guided Discovery of Persiamycin A From Sponge-Associated Halophilic Streptomonospora sp. PA3 Abstract: Microbial natural products have been a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical industry, but the supply of novel bioactive secondary metabolites has diminished due to extensive exploration of the most easily accessible sources, namely terrestrial Streptomyces species. The Persian Gulf is a unique habitat for marine sponges, which contain diverse communities of microorganisms including marine Actinobacteria. These exotic ecosystems may cradle rare actinomycetes with high potential to produce novel secondary metabolites. In this study, we harvested 12 different species of sponges from two locations in the Persian Gulf and isolated 45 symbiotic actinomycetes to assess their biodiversity and sponge-microbe relationships. The isolates were classified into Nocardiopsis (24 isolates), Streptomyces (17 isolates) and rare genera (4 isolates) by 16S rRNA sequencing. Antibiotic activity tests revealed that culture extracts from half of the isolates displayed growth inhibitory effects against seven pathogenic bacteria. Next, we identified five strains with the genetic potential to produce aromatic polyketides by genotyping ketosynthase genes responsible for synthesis of carbon scaffolds. The combined data led us to focus on Streptomonospora sp. PA3, since the genus has rarely been examined for its capacity to produce secondary metabolites. Analysis of culture extracts led to the discovery of a new bioactive aromatic polyketide denoted persiamycin A and 1-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-naphthoic acid. The genome harbored seven gene clusters involved in secondary metabolism, including a tetracenomycin-type polyketide synthase pathway likely involved in persiamycin formation. The work demonstrates the use of multivariate data and underexplored ecological niches to guide the drug discovery process for antibiotics and anticancer agents.	1
Abstract2class: Camporidines A and B: Antimetastatic and Anti-inflammatory Polyketide Alkaloids from a Gut Bacterium of Camponotus kiusiuensis Abstract: Chemical studies of gut bacteria of the carpenter ant Camponotus kiusiuensis led to the discovery of two new alkaloids, camporidines A and B (1 and 2), from Streptomyces sp. STA1. The structures of 1 and 2 were established as new polyketide alkaloids bearing a piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic system based on NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analysis. The relative configurations of the camporidines were determined by their 1H-1H NOESY/ROESY and 1D NOE NMR correlations. The experimental ECD spectra of 1 and 2 were compared with their calculated ECD spectra to assign their absolute configurations. Camporidine A (1) displayed antimetastatic activity by suppression of cell invasion against the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and showed an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the camporidines was identified, and the biosynthetic pathway of the camporidines was proposed based on bioinformatic analysis of the full genome of Streptomyces sp. STA1. Camporidines A and B (1 and 2) could be biosynthesized by a modular type I PKS containing an acyl transferase domain that accepts an unusual extender unit, which becomes the (C1'-C6') hexyl side chain. The post-PKS modification enzymes were predicted to perform an amination and an oxidation along with spontaneous Schiff base formation and generate the unique piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic framework.	1
Abstract2class: The gene cluster for fluorometabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces cattleya: a thioesterase confers resistance to fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A Abstract: A genomic library of Streptomyces cattleya was screened to isolate a gene cluster encoding enzymes responsible for the production of fluorine-containing metabolites. In addition to the previously described fluorinase FlA which catalyzes the formation of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine from S-adenosylmethionine and fluoride, 11 other putative open reading frames have been identified. Three of the proteins encoded by these genes have been characterized. FlB was determined to be the second enzyme in the pathway, catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine to produce 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate. The enzyme FlI was found to be an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which may act to relieve S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the fluorinase. Finally, flK encodes a thioesterase which catalyzes the selective breakdown of fluoroacetyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA, suggesting that it provides the producing strain with a mechanism for resistance to fluoroacetate.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Kendomycin B Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399 Abstract: Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399, a rare marine-derived actinomycete, produces a set of ansamycin-like polyketides kendomycin B-D (1-3) which possess potent antibacterial activities and moderate tumor cytotoxicity. Structurally, kendomycin B-D contain a unique aliphatic macrocyclic ansa scaffold in which the highly substituted pyran ring is connected to the quinone moiety. In this work, a type I/type III polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster coding for assembly of kendomycin B (kmy), and covering 33 open reading frames, was identified from Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399. The kmy cluster was found to be essential for kendomycin B biosynthesis as verified by gene disruption and heterologous expression. Correspondingly, a biosynthetic pathway was proposed based on bioinformatics, cluster alignments, and previous research. Additionally, the role of type III PKS for generating the precursor unit 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) was demonstrated by chemical complementation, and type I PKS executed the polyketide chain elongation. The kmy cluster was found to contain a positive regulatory gene kmy4 whose regulatory effect was identified using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). These advances shed important new insights into kendomycin B biosynthesis and help to set the foundation for further research aimed at understanding and exploiting the carbacylic ansa scaffold.	1

Abstract2class: Lactic acid bacteria--20 years exploring their potential as live vectors for mucosal vaccination Abstract: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a diverse group of Gram-positive, nonsporulating, low G + C content bacteria. Many of them have been given generally regarded as safe status. Over the past two decades, intensive genetic and molecular research carried out on LAB, mainly Lactococcus lactis and some species of the Lactobacillus genus, has revealed new, potential biomedical LAB applications, including the use of LAB as adjuvants, immunostimulators, or therapeutic drug delivery systems, or as factories to produce therapeutic molecules. LAB enable immunization via the mucosal route, which increases effectiveness against pathogens that use the mucosa as the major route of entry into the human body. In this review, we concentrate on the encouraging application of Lactococcus and Lactobacillus genera for the development of live mucosal vaccines. First, we present the progress that has recently been made in the field of developing tools for LAB genetic manipulations, which has resulted in the successful expression of many bacterial, parasitic, and viral antigens in LAB strains. Next, we discuss the factors influencing the efficacy of the constructed vaccine prototypes that have been tested in various animal models. Apart from the research focused on an application of live LABs as carriers of foreign antigens, a lot of work has been recently done on the potential usage of nonliving, nonrecombinant L. lactis designated as Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM), as a delivery system for mucosal vaccination. The advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are also presented.	0

This result suggests that His-157 plays an essential role in the K+ transport activity of the transporter system.	0
Abstract2class: Ni- and Pd-catalyzed synthesis of substituted and functionalized allylic boronates Abstract: Two highly efficient and convenient methods for the synthesis of functionalized and substituted allylic boronates are described. In one procedure, readily available allylic acetates are converted to allylic boronates catalyzed by Ni/PCy(3) or Ni/PPh(3) complexes with high levels of stereoselectivity and in good yields. Alternatively, the borylation can be accomplished with commercially available Pd catalysts [e.g., Pd(2)(dba)(3), PdCl(2), Pd/C], starting with easily accessed allylic halides.	0
Abstract2class: Production of a Dibrominated Aromatic Secondary Metabolite by a Planctomycete Implies Complex Interaction with a Macroalgal Host Abstract: The roles of the majority of bacterial secondary metabolites, especially those from uncommon sources, are still elusive even though many of these compounds show striking biological activities. To further investigate the secondary metabolite repertoire of underexploited bacterial families, we chose to analyze a novel representative of the yet untapped bacterial phylum Planctomycetes for the production of secondary metabolites under laboratory culture conditions. Development of a planctomycetal high density cultivation technique in combination with high resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed Planctomycetales strain 10988 to produce the plant toxin 3,5-dibromo-p-anisic acid. This molecule represents the first secondary metabolite reported from any planctomycete. Genome mining revealed the biosynthetic origin of this doubly brominated secondary metabolite, and a biosynthesis model for the compound was devised. Comparison of the biosynthetic route to biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for formation of polybrominated small aromatic compounds reveals evidence of an evolutionary link, while the compound's herbicidal activity points toward a complex interaction of planctomycetes with their macroalgal host.	1
Abstract2class: Genome Mining of Marine-Derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 Leads to Cytotoxic New Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactams Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) biosynthetic gene cluster are widely distributed in different bacterial types, especially in Streptomyces species. The mining of the genomic data of marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 reveals the presence of a putative PTM-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster (ptm' BGC) that features a genetic organization for potentially producing 5/5/6 type of carbocyclic ring-containing PTMs. A fermentation of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 led to the isolation and characterization of six new PTMs 1-6. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis assigned their planar structures and relative configurations, and their absolute configurations were deduced by comparing the experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with the reported spectra of the known PTMs. Intriguingly, compounds 1-6 were determined to have a trans-orientation of H-10/H-11 at the first 5-membered ring, being distinct from the cis-orientation in their known PTM congeners. PTMs 1-5 displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines, with IC50 values that ranged from 2.47 to 17.68 µM.	1
Abstract2class: Enzymatic reconstitution of ribosomal peptide backbone thioamidation Abstract: Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is an essential enzyme found strictly in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea. MCR catalyzes a reversible reaction involved in the production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α-subunit of this enzyme (McrA) contains several unusual posttranslational modifications, including the only known naturally occurring example of protein thioamidation. We have recently demonstrated by genetic deletion and mass spectrometry that the tfuA and ycaO genes of Methanosarcina acetivorans are involved in thioamidation of Gly465 in the MCR active site. Modification to thioGly has been postulated to stabilize the active site structure of MCR. Herein, we report the in vitro reconstitution of ribosomal peptide thioamidation using heterologously expressed and purified YcaO and TfuA proteins from M. acetivorans Like other reported YcaO proteins, this reaction is ATP-dependent but requires an external sulfide source. We also reconstitute the thioamidation activity of two TfuA-independent YcaOs from the hyperthermophilic methanogenic archaea Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Using these proteins, we demonstrate the basis for substrate recognition and regioselectivity of thioamide formation based on extensive mutagenesis, biochemical, and binding studies. Finally, we report nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound crystal structures for the YcaO proteins from M. kandleri Sequence and structure-guided mutagenesis with subsequent biochemical evaluation have allowed us to assign roles for residues involved in thioamidation and confirm that the reaction proceeds via backbone O-phosphorylation. These data assign a new biochemical reaction to the YcaO superfamily and paves the way for further characterization of additional peptide backbone posttranslational modifications.	1
Abstract2class: Hyperreactivity of Blood Leukocytes in Patients with NAFLD to Ex Vivo Lipopolysaccharide Treatment Is Modulated by Metformin and Phosphatidylcholine but Not by Alpha Ketoglutarate Abstract: Introduction and aims:                       Toll-like receptor 4 and proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We investigated IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα production and toll-like receptor 4 in both--obese and lean patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who met different sets of metabolic syndrome criteria and linked the results with the disease burden.                  Materials and methods:                       95 subjects were divided into four groups depending on the following criteria: presence or absence of metabolic syndrome and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, glucose tolerance (prediabetes or normoglycemia) and BMI value (obese or lean). We determined the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and monocyte toll-like receptor 4 expression in fresh blood as well as in blood cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide with or without metformin, alphaketoglutarate or phosphatidylcholine supplementation.                  Results:                       The blood leukocytes of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide treatment and produce elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to ex vivo treatment with lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, they overexpress toll-like receptor-4. Hyperreactivity was typical mainly for obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease together with metabolic syndrome and decreased with the severity of disease. Metformin was the most effective in attenuation of hyperreactivity in all groups of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but in obese patients the effectiveness of metformin was weaker than in lean. The reduction of cytokine level by metformin was accompanied by the decrease in toll-like receptor-4 expression. phosphatidylcholine also attenuated hyperreactivity to lipopolysaccharide but mainly in obese patients. Alpha ketoglutarate did not modulate cytokines' level and toll-like receptor 4 expression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients.                  Conclusions:                       Metformin and phosphatidylcholine attenuated lipopolysaccharide induced toll-like receptor 4 overexpression and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines; however, their efficacy depended on combined presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome and obesity.	0
Abstract2class: Two different polyketide synthase genes are required for synthesis of zearalenone in Gibberella zeae Abstract: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a polyketide mycotoxin produced by some species of Gibberella/Fusarium and causes hyperestrogenic syndrome in animals. ZEA occurs naturally in cereals infected by Gibberella zeae in temperate regions and threatens animal health. In this study, we report on a set of genes that participate in the biosynthesis of ZEA in G. zeae. Focusing on the non-reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) genes of the G. zeae genome, we demonstrated that PKS13 is required for ZEA production. Subsequent analyses revealed that a continuous, 50 kb segment of DNA carrying PKS13 consisted of three additional open reading frames that were coexpressed as a cluster during the condition for ZEA biosynthesis. These genes, in addition to PKS13, were essential for the ZEA biosynthesis. They include another PKS gene (PKS4) encoding a fungal reducing PKS; zearalenone biosynthesis gene 1 (ZEB1), which shows a high similarity to putative isoamyl alcohol oxidase genes; and ZEB2 whose deduced product carries a conserved, basic-region leucine zipper domain. ZEB1 is responsible for the chemical conversion of beta-zearalenonol (beta-ZOL) to ZEA in the biosynthetic pathway, and ZEB2 controls transcription of the cluster members. Transcription of these genes was strongly influenced by different culture conditions such as nutrient starvations and ambient pH. Furthermore, the same set of genes regulated by ZEB2 was dramatically repressed in the transgenic G. zeae strain with the deletion of PKS13 or PKS4 but not in the ZEB1 deletion strain, suggesting that ZEA or beta-ZOL may be involved in transcriptional activation of the gene cluster required for ZEA biosynthesis in G. zeae. This is the first published report on the molecular characterization of genes required for ZEA biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: S-MART, a software toolbox to aid RNA-Seq data analysis Abstract: High-throughput sequencing is now routinely performed in many experiments. But the analysis of the millions of sequences generated, is often beyond the expertise of the wet labs who have no personnel specializing in bioinformatics. Whereas several tools are now available to map high-throughput sequencing data on a genome, few of these can extract biological knowledge from the mapped reads. We have developed a toolbox called S-MART, which handles mapped RNA-Seq data. S-MART is an intuitive and lightweight tool which performs many of the tasks usually required for the analysis of mapped RNA-Seq reads. S-MART does not require any computer science background and thus can be used by all of the biologist community through a graphical interface. S-MART can run on any personal computer, yielding results within an hour even for Gb of data for most queries. S-MART may perform the entire analysis of the mapped reads, without any need for other ad hoc scripts. With this tool, biologists can easily perform most of the analyses on their computer for their RNA-Seq data, from the mapped data to the discovery of important loci.	0
Abstract2class: Brucella abortus strain 2308 produces brucebactin, a highly efficient catecholic siderophore Abstract: Brucella abortus is known to produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHBA) and to use this catechol as a siderophore to grow under iron-limited conditions. In this study a mutant (BAM41) is described that is deficient in siderophore production by insertion of Tn5 in the virulent B. abortus strain 2308. This mutant was unable to grow on iron-deprived medium and its growth could not be restored by addition of 2,3-DHBA. Production of catecholic compounds by both the Brucella mutant and parental strains under iron-deprivation conditions was assayed by TLC. Two catecholic substances were identified in the supernatant of the parental strain 2308. The faster migrating spot showed the same retention factor (R(f)) as that of purified 2,3-DHBA. The mutant BAM41 overproduced 2,3-DHBA, but failed to form the slower migrating catechol. This defect could only be complemented by the addition of the slow-migrating catechol from strain 2308. The genomic region containing Tn5 in BAM41 was cloned and the position of the transposon was determined by nucleotide sequencing. The sequence revealed that the insertion had occurred at a gene with homology to Escherichia coli entF, a locus involved in the late steps of the biosynthesis of the complex catecholic siderophore enterobactin. Intracellular survival and growth rates of the B. abortus wild-type and entF mutant strains in mouse-derived J774 macrophages were similar, indicating that production of this siderophore was not essential in this model of infection. It is concluded that B. abortus synthesizes a previously unknown and highly efficient catecholic siderophore, different from 2,3-DHBA, for which the name brucebactin is proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of steroidal antibiotic fusidanes: functional analysis of oxidosqualene cyclase and subsequent tailoring enzymes from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Three putative oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes exist in the genome of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that produces a steroidal antibiotic, helvolic acid. One of these genes, Afu4g14770, designated AfuOSC3, is clustered with genes of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), and acyltransferases, which presumably function in triterpene tailoring steps, suggesting that this gene cluster codes for helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuOSC3 was PCR amplified from A. fumigatus IFO8866 genomic DNA and expressed in yeast. The yeast transformant accumulated protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol, an established precursor for helvolic acid. Its structural isomer, (20R)-protosta-13(17),24-dien-3beta-ol, was also isolated from the transformed yeast. To further identify the function of triterpene tailoring enzymes, four P450 genes (CYP5081A1-D1) and a SDR gene (AfuSDR1) in the cluster were each coexpressed with AfuOSC3 in yeast. As a result, coexpression of AfuSDR1 gave a 3-keto derivative of protostadienol. On the other hand, coexpression with CYP5081A1 gave protosta-17(20)Z,24-diene-3beta,29-diol and protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol-29-oic acid. These metabolites are in well accord with the oxidative modification involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuSDR1 and CYP5081A1 presumably function together to catalyze demethylation of C-29 methyl group. These results provided a firm ground for identification of the present gene cluster to be involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Dendritic growth gated by a steroid hormone receptor underlies increases in activity in the developing Drosophila locomotor system Abstract: As animals grow, their nervous systems also increase in size. How growth in the central nervous system is regulated and its functional consequences are incompletely understood. We explored these questions, using the larval Drosophila locomotor system as a model. In the periphery, at neuromuscular junctions, motoneurons are known to enlarge their presynaptic axon terminals in size and strength, thereby compensating for reductions in muscle excitability that are associated with increases in muscle size. Here, we studied how motoneurons change in the central nervous system during periods of animal growth. We find that within the central nervous system motoneurons also enlarge their postsynaptic dendritic arbors, by the net addition of branches, and that these scale with overall animal size. This dendritic growth is gated on a cell-by-cell basis by a specific isoform of the steroid hormone receptor ecdysone receptor-B2, for which functions have thus far remained elusive. The dendritic growth is accompanied by synaptic strengthening and results in increased neuronal activity. Electrical properties of these neurons, however, are independent of ecdysone receptor-B2 regulation. We propose that these structural dendritic changes in the central nervous system, which regulate neuronal activity, constitute an additional part of the adaptive response of the locomotor system to increases in body and muscle size as the animal grows.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and functional analysis of brassicicene C biosynthetic gene cluster in Alternaria brassicicola Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of brassicicene C was identified in Alternaria brassicicola strain ATCC 96836 from genome database search. In vivo and in vitro study clearly revealed the function of Orf8 and Orf6 as a fusicoccadiene synthase and methyltransferase, respectively. The understanding toward the biosynthetic pathway promises construction of this type of diterpene compounds with genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Production of biologically active human myelocytokines in plants Abstract: An effective system for expression of human granulocyte and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factors (hG-CSF and hGM-CSF) in Nicotiana benthamiana plants was developed using viral vector based on tobacco mosaic virus infecting cruciferous plants. The genes of target proteins were cloned into the viral vector driven by actin promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression vectors were delivered into plant cells by agroinjection. Maximal synthesis rate was detected 5 days after injection and was up to 500 and 300 mg per kg of fresh leaves for hG-CSF and hGM-CSF, respectively. The yield of purified hG-CSF and hGM-CSF was 100 and 50 mg/kg of fresh leaves, respectively. Recombinant plant-made hG-CSF and hGM-CSF stimulated proliferation of murine bone marrow and human erythroleucosis TF-1 cells, respectively, at the same rate as the commercial drugs.	0
Abstract2class: From genetic diversity to metabolic unity: studies on the biosynthesis of aurafurones and aurafuron-like structures in myxobacteria and streptomycetes Abstract: The myxobacterial polyketide secondary metabolites aurafuron A and B were identified by genome mining in the myxobacterial strain Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1. The compounds contain an unusual furanone moiety and resemble metabolites isolated from soil-dwelling and marine actinobacteria, a fungus and mollusks. We describe here the cloning and functional analysis of the aurafuron biosynthetic gene cluster, including site-directed mutagenesis and feeding studies using labeled precursors. The polyketide core of the aurafurones is assembled by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS). As with many such systems described from myxobacteria, the aurafuron PKS exhibits a number of unusual features, including the apparent iterative use of a module, redundant modules and domains, a trans acting dehydratase and the absence of a terminal thioesterase domain. Four oxidoreductases are encoded within the gene locus, some of which likely participate in formation of the furanone moiety via a Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation. Indeed, inactivation of a gene encoding a cytochrome P(450) monooxygenase completely abolished production of both compounds. We also compare the complete gene locus to biosynthetic gene clusters from two Streptomyces sp., which produce close structural analogues of the aurafurones. A portion of the post-PKS biosynthetic machinery is strikingly similar in all three cases, in contrast to the PKS genes, which are highly divergent. Phylogenetic analysis of the ketosynthase domains further indicates that the PKSs have developed independently (polyphyletically) during evolution. These findings point to a currently unknown but important biological function of aurafuron-like compounds for the producing organisms.	1
Abstract2class: Natural product diversity associated with the nematode symbionts Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus Abstract: Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus species dedicate a large amount of resources to the production of specialized metabolites derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or polyketide synthase (PKS). Both bacteria undergo symbiosis with nematodes, which is followed by an insect pathogenic phase. So far, the molecular basis of this tripartite relationship and the exact roles that individual metabolites and metabolic pathways play have not been well understood. To close this gap, we have significantly expanded the database for comparative genomics studies in these bacteria. Clustering the genes encoded in the individual genomes into hierarchical orthologous groups reveals a high-resolution picture of functional evolution in this clade. It identifies groups of genes-many of which are involved in secondary metabolite production-that may account for the niche specificity of these bacteria. Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus appear very similar at the DNA sequence level, which indicates their close evolutionary relationship. Yet, high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses reveal a huge chemical diversity in the two taxa. Molecular network reconstruction identified a large number of previously unidentified metabolite classes, including the xefoampeptides and tilivalline. Here, we apply genomic and metabolomic methods in a complementary manner to identify and elucidate additional classes of natural products. We also highlight the ability to rapidly and simultaneously identify potentially interesting bioactive products from NRPSs and PKSs, thereby augmenting the contribution of molecular biology techniques to the acceleration of natural product discovery.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the earthy odorant geosmin by a bifunctional Streptomyces coelicolor enzyme Abstract: Geosmin is responsible for the characteristic odor of moist soil, as well as off-flavors in drinking water and foodstuffs. Geosmin is generated from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, 2) by an enzyme that is encoded by the SCO6073 gene in the soil organism Streptomyces coelicolor A32 (ref. 3). We have now shown that the recombinant N-terminal half of this protein catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent cyclization of FPP to germacradienol and germacrene D, while the highly homologous C-terminal domain, previously thought to be catalytically silent, catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent conversion of germacradienol to geosmin. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the N- and C-terminal domains each harbor a distinct, independently functioning active site. A mutation in the N-terminal domain of germacradienol-geosmin synthase of a catalytically essential serine to alanine results in the conversion of FPP to a mixture of sesquiterpenes that includes an aberrant product identified as isolepidozene, which was previously suggested to be an enzyme-bound intermediate in the cyclization of FPP to germacradienol.	1
Abstract2class: Effects of deletions of mbtH-like genes on clorobiocin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: In the biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, the small ORF cloY encodes a 71 aa protein which shows significant sequence similarity to mbtH from the mycobactin biosynthetic gene cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. mbtH-like genes are frequently found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of peptide antibiotics and siderophores, but their function has remained enigmatic. In a recent publication it has been suggested that these genes may have no function for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. An in-frame deletion of cloY in the clorobiocin cluster has now been carried out. When the modified cluster was expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512, clorobiocin was still formed. However, when the two further mbtH-like genes from elsewhere in the host genome were inactivated as well, clorobiocin formation was reduced dramatically. Complementation with cloY or with any of three other mbtH-like genes restored clorobiocin formation. This is the first report proving the requirement of an mbtH-like gene for secondary metabolite formation, and the first proof that different mbtH-like genes can functionally replace each other. Feeding of an mbtH-defective triple mutant strain with an intact 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-coumarin moiety restored antibiotic production, showing that cloY is specifically required for the formation of this moiety of the clorobiocin molecule.	1
Abstract2class: T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through the regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity Abstract: Protein kinases are potential targets for the prevention and control of UV-induced skin cancer. T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly expressed in skin cancer cells, but its specific function is still unknown. We investigated the role of TOPK in UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins that bind with TOPK. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry were used to assess the effect of UVB on TOPK, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), and apoptosis in RPMI7951 cells. TOPK binds with Prx1 and its phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 is important for regulation of H(2)O(2)-mediated signal transduction. Analysis of the CD spectra of Prx1 and mutant Prx1 (S32A) proteins showed that the secondary structure of Prx1 was significantly altered by phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32. UVB irradiation induced phosphorylation of TOPK in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells and phosphorylated TOPK co-localized with Prx1 in the nucleus. UVB induced the peroxidase activity of Prx1 in vitro and ex vivo. Following treatment with UVB, H(2)O(2) levels and apoptosis were increased in RPMI7951 cells stably expressing TOPK siRNA or stably mutant Prx1 (S32A). Phosphorylation of Prx1 (Ser-32) by TOPK prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity and blockade of intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation.	0
Abstract2class: Multi-energy metabolic mechanisms of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum in low oxygen environments Abstract: The fungus Fusarium oxysporum produces energy under hypoxic and anoxic conditions by denitrification (nitrate respiration) and ammonia fermentation respectively. Here we found that glucose repressed both of these metabolisms, whereas it supported another anoxic metabolism, hetero-lactic acid fermentation. Ammonia fermentation occurred only after the glucose present in the medium was metabolized to ethanol via alcohol fermentation. During this transition, clear diauxic growth was observed. Glucose regulated the activity of the enzymes involved in ammonia fermentation, hetero-lactic acid fermentation, and denitrification. Highest cell growth was supported by hetero-lactic acid fermentation, followed by denitrification and ammonia fermentation. These results indicate that the energy metabolisms of F. oxysporum are dependent not only on environmental O(2) tension but also on the carbon source, and that ammonia fermentation is an adaptative mechanism acting physiologically as a secondary fermentative mechanism replacing the primary hetero-lactic acid fermentation.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of substrate specificities of decorating enzymes involved in mannosylerythritol lipid production by cross-species complementation Abstract: Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are surface active molecules produced by many basidiomycetous fungi. MELs consist of a mannosylerythritol disaccharide, which is acylated with short and medium chain fatty acids at the mannosyl moiety. A gene cluster composed of five genes is required for MEL biosynthesis. Here we show that the plant pathogenic fungus Ustilago hordei secretes these glycolipids under nitrogen starvation conditions. In contrast to MELs produced by the closely related fungus Ustilago maydis those secreted by U. hordei are mostly mono-acetylated and contain a different mixture of acyl groups. Cross-species complementation between these fungi revealed that these differences result from different catalytic activities of the acetyltransferase Mat1 and the acyltransferases Mac1 and Mac2. U. maydis mat1 mutants expressing the homologous mat1 gene from U. hordei produced mostly mono-acetylated variants and lack di-acetylated MELs normally produced by U. maydis. Furthermore, we determined that the acyltransferase Mac1 acylates the mannosylerythritol moiety at position C2 while Mac2 acylates C3. The identification of decorating enzymes with different substrate specificities will allow the tailor-made production of novel subsets of MELs.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene cluster encoding meilingmycin biosynthesis among multiple polyketide synthase contigs isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 Abstract: A cluster encoding genes for the biosynthesis of meilingmycin, a macrolide antibiotic structurally similar to avermectin and milbemycin alpha11, was identified among seven uncharacterized polyketide synthase gene clusters isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 by hybridization with PCR products using primers derived from the sequences of aveE, aveF and a thioesterase domain of the avermectin biosynthetic gene cluster. Introduction of a 24.1-kb deletion by targeted gene replacement resulted in a loss of meilingmycin production, confirming that the gene cluster encodes biosynthesis of this important anthelminthic antibiotic compound. A sequenced 8.6-kb fragment had aveC and aveE homologues ( meiC and meiE) linked together, as in the avermectin gene cluster, but the arrangement of aveF ( meiF) and the thioesterase homologues differed. The results should pave the way to producing novel insecticidal compounds by generating hybrids between the two pathways.	1
Abstract2class: FL-120A-D', new products related to kinamycin from Streptomyces chattanoogensis subsp. taitungensis subsp. nov. II. Isolation and structure determination Abstract: Six new kinamycin antibiotics have been isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces chattanoogensis. The structures of six related components were determined employing 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These structures represent the first reported epoxide kinamycin (2, 3) and propionyl derivative of kinamycin (5), and new isobutyryl derivatives of kinamycin (1, 4, 6).	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptional analysis of the titin cap gene Abstract: Mutations in titin cap (Tcap), also known as telethonin, cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G). Tcap is one of the titin interacting Z-disc proteins involved in the regulation and development of normal sarcomeric structure. Given the essential role of Tcap in establishing and maintaining normal skeletal muscle architecture, we were interested in determining the regulatory elements required for expression of this gene in myoblasts. We have defined a highly conserved 421 bp promoter proximal promoter fragment that contains two E boxes and multiple putative Mef2 binding sequences. This promoter can be activated by MyoD and myogenin in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, and maintains the differentiated cell-specific expression pattern of the endogenous Tcap in C2C12 cells. We find that while both E boxes are required for full activation by MyoD or myogenin in NIH3T3 cells, the promoter proximal E box has a greater contribution to activation of this promoter in C2C12 cells and to activation by MyoD in NIH3T3 cells. Together, the data suggest an important role for MyoD in activating Tcap expression through the promoter proximal E box. We also show that myogenin is required for normal expression in vivo and physically binds to the Tcap promoter during embryogenesis.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ATPase) inhibitor bongkrekic acid in Burkholderia gladioli Abstract: Biosynthetic studies with (13)C-labelled acetates and methionine revealed that the infamous, food-related toxin bongkrekic acid from Burkholderia gladioli is a polyketide with acetate-derived beta-branches and a carboxylate terminus derived from the methyl group of an acetate.	1
Abstract2class: Role of siderophore biosynthesis in virulence of Staphylococcus aureus: identification and characterization of genes involved in production of a siderophore Abstract: Molecular determinants underlying the production of siderophores in the human and animal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and the contribution of siderophore production to the virulence of this bacterium have, until now, remained undefined. Here, we show that S. aureus strains RN6390 and Newman produce siderophore when the cells are starved for iron. We further identified and characterized a nine-gene, iron-regulated operon, designated sbn and situated between sirABC and galE on the S. aureus chromosome, that is involved in the production of a siderophore. Mutation of the sbnE gene, in both RN6390 and Newman, eliminates the ability of these strains to produce a siderophore under iron-limited growth conditions, while introduction of multicopy sbnE into sbnE mutants complemented the inability of the mutants to produce the siderophore. sbnE mutants, in both the RN6390 and Newman backgrounds, displayed a drastic growth deficiency, compared to the wild type, in iron-restricted growth medium, whereas no such deficiency was observed during growth in iron-replete medium. Complemented mutants showed a restored ability to grow under iron restriction. We further showed that an sbnE mutant was compromised in a murine kidney abscess model of S. aureus infection, illustrating the importance of siderophore production to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. sbn genes were present in all S. aureus strains tested (and all S. aureus genome sequences) but were undetectable in any of the 13 coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, including Staphylococcus epidermidis.	1
Abstract2class: Effect of isotopically sensitive branching on product distribution for pentalenene synthase: support for a mechanism predicted by quantum chemistry Abstract: Mechanistic proposals for the carbocation cascade reaction leading to the tricyclic sesquiterpene pentalenene are assessed in light of the results of isotopically sensitive branching experiments with the H309A mutant of pentalenene synthase. These experimental results support a mechanism for pentalenene formation involving a 7-protoilludyl cation whose intermediacy was first predicted using quantum-chemical calculations.	0
Abstract2class: Wild-type Escherichia coli producing microcins B17, D93, J25, and L; cloning of genes for microcin L production and immunity Abstract: For the first time, an Escherichia coli strain producing four microcins (Mcc), B17, D93, J25, and L, and showing immunity to Mcc V was isolated and characterized. Each of the gene clusters encoding the production of Mcc B17, D93, and L was cloned separately. The gene cluster for Mcc L was cloned within a 13.5-kb HindIII-SalI fragment, which includes the Mcc V immunity gene, cvi.	1
Abstract2class: Going forward laterally: transmembrane passage of hydrophobic molecules through protein channel walls Abstract: Regular phospholipid bilayers do not pose efficient barriers for the transport of hydrophobic molecules. The outer membrane (OM) surrounding Gram-negative bacteria is a nontypical, asymmetric bilayer with an outer layer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The sugar molecules of the LPS layer prevent spontaneous diffusion of hydrophobic molecules across the OM. As regular OM channels such as porins do not allow passage of hydrophobic molecules, specialized OM transport proteins are required for their uptake. Such proteins, exemplified by channels of the FadL family, transport their substrates according to a lateral diffusion mechanism. Here, substrates diffuse from the lumen of the beta-barrel laterally into the OM, through a stable opening in the wall of the barrel. In this way, the lipopolysaccharide barrier is bypassed and, by depositing the substrates into the OM, a driving force for uptake is provided. Lateral diffusion through protein channel walls also occurs in alpha-helical inner membrane proteins, and could represent a widespread mechanism for proteins that transport and interact with hydrophobic substrates.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acid F Abstract: Nodulisporic acids comprise a group of valuable indole diterpenes that exhibit potent insecticidal activities. We report the identification of a gene cluster in the genome of the filamentous fungus Hypoxylon pulicicidum (Nodulisporium sp.) that contains genes responsible for the biosynthesis of nodulisporic acids. Using Penicillium paxilli as a heterologous host, and through pathway reconstitution experiments, we identified the function of four genes involved in the biosynthesis of the nodulisporic acid core compound, nodulisporic acid F (NAF). Two of these genes (nodM and nodW) are especially significant as they encode enzymes with previously unreported functionality: nodM encodes a 3-geranylgeranylindole epoxidase capable of catalyzing only a single epoxidation step to prime formation of the distinctive ring structure of nodulisporic acids, and nodW encodes the first reported gene product capable of introducing a carboxylic acid moiety to an indole diterpene core structure that acts as a reactive handle for further modification. Here, we present the enzymatic basis for the biosynthetic branch point that gives rise to nodulisporic acids.	1
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of the ferroxidase, permease high-affinity iron transport complex from Candida albicans Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two proteins that together support high-affinity Fe-uptake. These are a multicopper oxidase, Fet3p, with specificity towards Fe²⁺ and a ferric iron permease, Ftr1p, which supports Fe-accumulation. Homologues of the genes encoding these two proteins are found in all fungal genomes including those for the pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. At least one of these loci represents a virulence factor for each pathogen suggesting that this complex would be an appropriate pharmacologic target. However, the mechanism by which this protein pair supports Fe-uptake in any fungal pathogen has not been elucidated. Taking advantage of the robust molecular genetics available in S. cerevisiae, we identify the two of five candidate ferroxidases likely involved in high-affinity Fe-uptake in C. albicans, Fet31 and Fet34. Both localize to the yeast plasma membrane and both support Fe-uptake along with an Ftr1 protein, either from C. albicans or from S. cerevisiae. We express and characterize Fet34, demonstrating that it is functionally homologous to ScFet3p. Using S. cerevisiae as host for the functional expression of the C. albicans Fe-uptake proteins, we demonstrate that they support a mechanism of Fe-trafficking that involves channelling of the CaFet34-generated Fe³⁺ directly to CaFtr1 for transport into the cytoplasm.	0
Abstract2class: Deoxysugar transfer during chromomycin A3 biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus: new derivatives with antitumor activity Abstract: Chromomycin A3 is an antitumor drug produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus. It consists of a tricyclic aglycone with two aliphatic side chains and two O-glycosidically linked saccharide chains, a disaccharide of 4-O-acetyl-D-oliose (sugar A) and 4-O-methyl-D-oliose (sugar B), and a trisaccharide of D-olivose (sugar C), D-olivose (sugar D), and 4-O-acetyl-L-chromose B (sugar E). The chromomycin gene cluster contains four glycosyltransferase genes (cmmGI, cmmGII, cmmGIII, and cmmGIV), which were independently inactivated through gene replacement, generating mutants C60GI, C10GII, C10GIII, and C10GIV. Mutants C10GIV and C10GIII produced the known compounds premithramycinone and premithramycin A1, respectively, indicating the involvement of CmmGIV and CmmGIII in the sequential transfer of sugars C and D and possibly also of sugar E of the trisaccharide chain, to the 12a position of the tetracyclic intermediate premithramycinone. Mutant C10GII produced two new tetracyclic compounds lacking the disaccharide chain at the 8 position, named prechromomycin A3 and prechromomycin A2. All three compounds accumulated by mutant C60GI were tricyclic and lacked sugar B of the disaccharide chain, and they were named prechromomycin A4, 4A-O-deacetyl-3A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A4, and 3A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A4. CmmGII and CmmGI are therefore responsible for the formation of the disaccharide chain by incorporating, in a sequential manner, two D-oliosyl residues to the 8 position of the biosynthetic intermediate prechromomycin A3. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the glycosylation events in chromomycin A3 biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Insight into the haem d1 biosynthesis pathway in heliobacteria through bioinformatics analysis Abstract: Haem d(1) is a unique tetrapyrrole molecule that serves as a prosthetic group of cytochrome cd(1), which reduces nitrite to nitric oxide during the process of denitrification. Very little information is available regarding the biosynthesis of haem d(1). The extreme difficulty in studying the haem d(1) biosynthetic pathway can be partly attributed to the lack of a theoretical basis for experimental investigation. We report here a gene cluster encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of haem d(1) in two heliobacterial species, Heliobacillus mobilis and Heliophilum fasciatum. The gene organization of the cluster is conserved between the two species, and contains a complete set of genes that lead to the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III and genes thought to be involved in the late steps of haem d(1) biosynthesis. Detailed bioinformatics analysis of some of the proteins encoded in the gene cluster revealed important clues to the precise biochemical roles of the proteins in the biosynthesis of haem d(1), as well as the membrane transport and insertion of haem d(1) into an apocytochrome during the maturation of cytochrome cd(1).	1
Abstract2class: Receptor-Type Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase ζ and Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor in the Intestine: Cellular Expression and Cytokine- and Chemokine Responses by Interleukin-34 and Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Abstract: Differential intestinal expression of the macrophage growth factors colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), interleukin (IL)-34, and their shared CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown. Diverse expression between CSF-1 and IL-34, suggest that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. Receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTPRZ1, RPTP-ζ), an additional IL-34 receptor, was recently identified. Here, we aimed to assess PTPRZ1 expression in IBD and non-IBD intestinal biopsies. Further, we aimed to investigate cellular PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R expression, and cytokine- and chemokine responses by IL-34 and CSF-1. The expression of PTPRZ1 was higher in non-IBD colon compared to ileum. PTPRZ1 expression was not altered with inflammation in IBD, however, correlated to IL34, CSF1, and CSF1R. The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line. PBMCs and monocytes of the same donors responded differently to IL-34 and CSF-1 with altered expression of tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-13, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. This study shows that PTPRZ1 was expressed in bowel tissue. Furthermore, CSF-1R protein was detected in an intestinal epithelial cell line and donor dependently in primary PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages, and first hints also suggest an expression in these cells for PTPRZ1, which may mediate IL-34 and CSF-1 actions.	0
Abstract2class: Genes from a Dietzia sp. for synthesis of C40 and C50 beta-cyclic carotenoids Abstract: Dietzia sp. CQ4 accumulated the C(40) beta-cyclic carotenoids (canthaxanthin and echinenone) and the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid (C.p.450 monoglucoside). A plant-type lycopene beta-cyclase gene crtL was identified for beta-cyclization of the C(40) carotenoids. A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster was identified away from the crtL gene, which contained the crtEBI genes for the synthesis of lycopene followed by the lbtABC genes for lycopene elongation and beta-cyclization of the C(50) carotenoids. This C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid synthesis gene cluster from Dietzia sp. CQ4 showed high homology with the gene clusters for synthesizing the C(50) epsilon-cyclic carotenoids (decaprenoxanthin and glucosides) from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Agromyces mediolanus. One unique feature of the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid synthesis genes in Dietzia sp. CQ4 was that the gene encoding a C(50) carotenoid beta-cyclase subunit and the gene encoding the lycopene elongase appeared to be fused as a single gene (lbtBC). Expression of the gene (lbtA) encoding another subunit of the C(50) carotenoid beta-cyclase and the lbtBC gene in lycopene-accumulating Escherichia coli produced almost exclusively the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid C.p.450. One gene (crtX) with high homology to glycosyl transferases was transcribed in the opposite orientation downstream of the lbtBC gene. The crtX gene was likely involved in C.p.450 glucosylation in Dietzia sp. CQ4. The pathway analogous to the synthesis of the C(50) epsilon-cyclic carotenoids was proposed for the synthesis of the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoids.	1
Abstract2class: In vivo manipulation of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 revealing new insights into its biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Bleomycin (BLM), an important clinically used antitumor compound, and its analogs are challenging to prepare by chemical synthesis. Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Pseudomonas corrugata crpCDE is part of the cyclic lipopeptide corpeptin biosynthetic gene cluster and is involved in bacterial virulence in tomato and in hypersensitive response in Nicotiana benthamiana Abstract: Pseudomonas corrugata CFBP 5454 produces two kinds of cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs), cormycin A and corpeptins, both of which possess surfactant, antimicrobial and phytotoxic activities. In this study, we identified genes coding for a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and an ABC-type transport system involved in corpeptin production. These genes belong to the same transcriptional unit, designated crpCDE. The genetic organization of this locus is highly similar to other Pseudomonas CLP biosynthetic clusters. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis revealed that transporter and synthetase genomic knock-out mutants were unable to produce corpeptins, but continued to produce cormycin A. This suggests that CrpCDE is the only system involved in corpeptin production in P. corrugata CFBP 5454. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CrpE ABC transporter clustered with the transporters of CLPs with a long peptide chain. Strains depleted in corpeptin production were significantly less virulent than the wild-type strain when inoculated in tomato plants and induced only chlorosis when infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Thus, corpeptins are important effectors of P. corrugata interaction with plants. Expression analysis revealed that crpC transcription occurs at high cell density. Two LuxR transcriptional regulators, PcoR and RfiA, have a pivotal role in crpC expression and thus in corpeptin production.	1
Abstract2class: Transcriptional organization and regulation of an antibiotic export complex in the producing Streptomyces culture Abstract: Three open reading frames (ORFs) in the actII region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), which are involved in the export of the antibiotic are carried on two divergent transcripts. A monocistronic transcript carries actII-ORF1, encoding a putative repressor protein, and a bicistronic transcript codes for actII-ORF2 and -ORF3, whose products have been postulated to form an antibiotic export complex. The actII-ORF1 and actII-ORF2/3 transcripts each have a single promoter and the promoters for the two transcripts overlap. Both promoters are most active in cultures that have developed to the stage of actinorhodin production. The promoters resemble consensus promoters of the vegetative class in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces. We also demonstrate that these promoters are expressed in E. coli and use this finding to reveal a regulatory role for the repressor, using the xylE reporter gene on promoter-probe shuttle vectors and regulated expression of the actII-ORF1 gene under control of Plac. The actII-ORF2/3 promoter is strongly repressed by the ORF1 product and the ORF1 product also represses its own promoter. The finding that the operator/promoter arrangement, and regulatory interconnection, of an antibiotic export/repressor gene pair in Streptomyces strikingly resemble those for tetracycline resistance in bacteria of clinical importance supports the hypothesis of an evolutionary origin of such genes in an ancestral actinomycete.	1
Abstract2class: Automated genome mining of ribosomal peptide natural products Abstract: Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), especially from microbial sources, are a large group of bioactive natural products that are a promising source of new (bio)chemistry and bioactivity.1 In light of exponentially increasing microbial genome databases and improved mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic platforms, there is a need for computational tools that connect natural product genotypes predicted from microbial genome sequences with their corresponding chemotypes from metabolomic data sets. Here, we introduce RiPPquest, a tandem mass spectrometry database search tool for identification of microbial RiPPs, and apply it to lanthipeptide discovery. RiPPquest uses genomics to limit search space to the vicinity of RiPP biosynthetic genes and proteomics to analyze extensive peptide modifications and compute p-values of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). We highlight RiPPquest by connecting multiple RiPPs from extracts of Streptomyces to their gene clusters and by the discovery of a new class III lanthipeptide, informatipeptin, from Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736 to reflect that it is a natural product that was discovered by mass spectrometry based genome mining using algorithmic tools rather than manual inspection of mass spectrometry data and genetic information.

Abstract2class: Noncanonical self-assembly of multifunctional DNA nanoflowers for biomedical applications Abstract: DNA nanotechnology has been extensively explored to assemble various functional nanostructures for versatile applications. Mediated by Watson-Crick base-pairing, these DNA nanostructures have been conventionally assembled through hybridization of many short DNA building blocks. Here we report the noncanonical self-assembly of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, termed as nanoflowers (NFs), and the versatile biomedical applications. These NFs were assembled from long DNA building blocks generated via rolling circle replication (RCR) of a designer template. NF assembly was driven by liquid crystallization and dense packaging of building blocks, without relying on Watson-Crick base-pairing between DNA strands, thereby avoiding the otherwise conventional complicated DNA sequence design. NF sizes were readily tunable in a wide range, by simply adjusting such parameters as assembly time and template sequences. NFs were exceptionally resistant to nuclease degradation, denaturation, or dissociation at extremely low concentration, presumably resulting from the dense DNA packaging in NFs. The exceptional biostability is critical for biomedical applications. By rational design, NFs can be readily incorporated with myriad functional moieties. All these properties make NFs promising for versatile applications. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, in this study, NFs were integrated with aptamers, bioimaging agents, and drug loading sites, and the resultant multifunctional NFs were demonstrated for selective cancer cell recognition, bioimaging, and targeted anticancer drug delivery.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic analysis of microcin H47 immunity Abstract: Microcin H47 is a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a natural Escherichia coli isolate. The genetic system encoding microcin production and immunity consists of at least seven clustered genes. Four of these are devoted to microcin biosynthesis and two genes are required for its secretion into the extracellular medium. The product of the seventh gene, mchI, determines the cell's self-immunity. This gene was shown to encode a highly hydrophobic 69-residue peptide. Analysis of the MchI amino acid sequence, as well as the characterization of MchI-PhoA hybrid proteins, indicated that the microcin immunity product is probably exported out of the cytoplasm and remains an integral membrane peptide. This localization of the immunity peptide points to the cellular membrane as the site of action of microcin H47.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Unusual Biaryl Polyketides by Activation of a Silent Streptomyces venezuelae Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Comparative transcriptional profiling of a ΔbldM mutant of Streptomyces venezuelae with its unmodified progenitor revealed that the expression of a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster containing both type I and type III polyketide synthase genes is activated in the mutant. The 29.5 kb gene cluster, which was predicted to encode an unusual biaryl metabolite, which we named venemycin, and potentially halogenated derivatives, contains 16 genes including one-vemR-that encodes a transcriptional activator of the large ATP-binding LuxR-like (LAL) family. Constitutive expression of vemR in the ΔbldM mutant led to the production of sufficient venemycin for structural characterisation, confirming its unusual biaryl structure. Co-expression of the venemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and vemR in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor also resulted in venemycin production. Although the gene cluster encodes two halogenases and a flavin reductase, constitutive expression of all three genes led to the accumulation only of a monohalogenated venemycin derivative, both in the native producer and the heterologous host. A competition experiment in which equimolar quantities of sodium chloride and sodium bromide were fed to the venemycin-producing strains resulted in the preferential incorporation of bromine, thus suggesting that bromide is the preferred substrate for one or both halogenases.	1
Abstract2class: The same mutation in Gsalpha and transducin alpha reveals behavioral differences between these highly homologous G protein alpha-subunits Abstract: Mutating Arg-238 to Glu (R238E) in the switch 3 region of a transducin alpha (*Talpha) in which 27 aa of the GTPase domain have been replaced with those of the alpha-subunit of the inhibitory G protein 1 (Gi1alpha), was reported to create an alpha-subunit that is resistant to activation by GTPgammaS, is devoid of resident nucleotide, and has dominant negative (DN) properties. In an attempt to create a DN stimultory G protein alpha (Gsalpha) with a single mutation we created Gsalpha-R265E, equivalent to *Talpha-R238E. Gsalpha-R265E has facilitated activation by GTPgammaS, a slightly facilitated activation by GTP but much reduced receptor plus GTP stimulated activation, and an apparently unaltered ability to interact with receptor as seen in ligand binding studies. Further, the activity profile of Gsalpha-R265E is that of an alpha-subunit with unaltered or increased GTPase activity. The only change in Gsalpha that is similar to that in *Talpha is that the apparent affinity for guanine nucleotides is decreased in both proteins. The molecular basis of the changed properties are discussed based on the known crystal structure of Gsalpha and the changes introduced by the same mutation in a *Talpha (Gtalpha*) with only 23 aa from Gi1alpha. Gtalpha*-R238E, with four fewer mutations in switch 3, was reported to show no evidence of DN properties, is activated by GTPgammaS, and has reduced GTPase activity. The data highlight a critical role for the switch 3 region in setting overall properties of signal-transducing GTPases.	0
Abstract2class: The chejuenolide biosynthetic gene cluster harboring an iterative trans-AT PKS system in Hahella chejuensis strain MB-1084 Abstract: Hahella chejuensis MB-1084 is a Gram-negative marine bacterial strain that produces unusual 17-membered carbocyclic tetraenes, chejuenolide A and B. Two fosmid clones responsible for chejuenolide production were identified from the genomic DNA library of the MB-1084 strain. Systematic inactivation of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the sequenced region defines the boundaries of the chejuenolide (che) biosynthetic gene cluster (24.9 kbp) that encodes one non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid protein, three modular PKSs, two PKS domains, and an amine oxidase homolog. Based on the results, we found that the che PKSs have non-canonical features such as trans-AT system and insufficient number of KS domains (five KS domains) for chejuenolide production (requires eight rounds of Claisen condensation reaction). Heterologous expression of the che PKSs in the E. coli BAP1 strain provides strong evidence of the iterative characteristic of the modular PKSs. Additionally, the phylogenetic relatedness of the KS domains of che PKSs and other trans-AT PKSs was analyzed to propose a possible pathway for chejuenolide biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular genetic analysis reveals that a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene in Aspergillus nidulans is responsible for microperfuranone biosynthesis Abstract: Genome sequencing of Aspergillus species including Aspergillus nidulans has revealed that there are far more secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters than secondary metabolites isolated from these organisms. This implies that these organisms can produce additional secondary metabolites, which have not yet been elucidated. The A. nidulans genome contains 12 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), one hybrid polyketide synthase/NRPS, and 14 NRPS-like genes. The only NRPS-like gene in A. nidulans with a known product is tdiA, which is involved in terrequinone A biosynthesis. To attempt to identify the products of these NRPS-like genes, we replaced the native promoters of the NRPS-like genes with the inducible alcohol dehydrogenase (alcA) promoter. Our results demonstrated that induction of the single NRPS-like gene AN3396.4 led to the enhanced production of microperfuranone. Furthermore, heterologous expression of AN3396.4 in Aspergillus niger confirmed that only one NRPS-like gene, AN3396.4, is necessary for the production of microperfuranone.	1
Abstract2class: Sequencing and mutagenesis of genes from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea that are involved in L-mycarose and D-desosamine production Abstract: The nucleotide sequence on both sides of the eryA polyketide synthase genes of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea reveals the presence of ten genes that are involved in L-mycarose (eryB) and D-desosamine (eryC) biosynthesis or attachment. Mutant strains carrying targeted lesions in eight of these genes indicate that three (eryBIV, eryBV and eryBVI) act in L-mycarose biosynthesis or attachment, while the other five (eryCII, eryCIII, eryCIV, eryCV and eryCVI) are devoted to D-desosamine biosynthesis or attachment. The remaining two genes (eryBII and eryBVII) appear to function in L-mycarose biosynthesis based on computer analysis and earlier genetic data. Three of these genes, eryBII, eryCIII and eryCII, lie between the eryAIII and eryG genes on one side of the polyketide synthase genes, while the remaining seven, eryBIV, eryBV, eryCVI, eryBVI, eryCIV, eryCV and eryBVII lie upstream of the eryAI gene on the other side of the gene cluster. The deduced products of these genes show similarities to: aldohexose 4-ketoreductases (eryBIV), aldoketo reductases (eryBII), aldohexose 5-epimerases (eryBVII), the dnmT gene of the daunomycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces peucetius (eryBVI), glycosyltransferases (eryBV and eryCIII), the AscC 3,4-dehydratase from the ascarylose biosynthetic pathway of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (eryCIV), and mammalian N-methyltransferases (eryCVI). The eryCII gene resembles a cytochrome P450, but lacks the conserved cysteine residue responsible for coordination of the haem iron, while the eryCV gene displays no meaningful similarity to other known sequences. From the predicted function of these and other known eryB and eryC genes, pathways for the biosynthesis of L-mycarose and D-desosamine have been deduced.	1
Abstract2class: Two related pyrrolidinedione synthetase loci in Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349 produce divergent metabolites Abstract: Equisetin synthetase (EqiS), from the filamentous fungus Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349, was initially assigned on the basis of genetic knockout and expression analysis. Increasing inconsistencies in experimental results led us to question this assignment. Here, we sequenced the F. heterosporum genome, revealing two hybrid polyketide-peptide proteins that were candidates for the equisetin synthetase. The surrounding genes in both clusters had the needed auxiliary genes that might be responsible for producing equisetin. Genetic mutation, biochemical analysis, and recombinant expression in the fungus enabled us to show that the initially assigned EqiS does not produce equisetin but instead produces a related 2,4-pyrrolidinedione, fusaridione A, that was previously unknown. Fusaridione A is methylated in the 3-position of the pyrrolidinedione, which has not otherwise been found in natural products, leading to spontaneous reverse-Dieckmann reactions. A newly described gene cluster, eqx, is responsible for producing equisetin.	1
Abstract2class: Rational design of matrix metalloproteinase-13 activatable probes for enhanced specificity Abstract: Because of the important roles that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play in tumor invasion and metastasis, various activatable optical probes have been developed to visualize MMP activities in vitro and in vivo. Our recently developed MMP-13 activatable probe, l-MMP-P12, has been successfully applied to image the expression and inhibition of MMPs in a xenografted tumor model [Zhu, L., et al. (2011) Theranostics 1, 18-27]. In this study, to further optimize the in vivo behavior of the proteinase activatable probe, we tracked and profiled the metabolites by a high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system. Two major metabolites that contributed to the fluorescence recovery were identified. One was specifically cleaved between glycine (G(4)) and valine (V(5)) by MMP, while the other one was generated by nonspecific cleavage between glycine (G(7)) and lysine (K(8)). To visualize the MMP activity more accurately and specifically, a new probe, D-MMP-P12, was designed by replacing the l-lysine with d-lysine in the MMP substrate sequence. The metabolic profile of the new probe, D-MMP-P12, was further characterized by in vitro enzymatic assay, and no nonspecific metabolite was found by LC-MS. Our in vivo optical imaging also demonstrated that D-MMP-P12 had a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR, 5.55 ± 0.75) significantly higher than that of L-MMP-P12 (3.73 ± 0.31) 2 h postinjection. The improved MMP activatable probe may have the potential for drug screening, tumor diagnosis, and therapy response monitoring. Moreover, our research strategy can be further extended to study other protease activatable probes.	0
Abstract2class: Comparative analysis of cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics Abstract: The advances in bioorthogonal ligation methods have provided new opportunities for proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins, posttranslational modifications, and specific enzyme families using azide/alkyne-functionalized chemical reporters and activity-based probes. Efficient enrichment and elution of azide/alkyne-labeled proteins with selectively cleavable affinity tags are essential for protein identification and quantification applications. Here, we report the synthesis and comparative analysis of Na₂S₂O₄-cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics. We demonstrated that ortho-hydroxyl substituent is required for efficient azobenzene-bond cleavage and show that these cleavable affinity tags can be used to identify newly synthesized proteins in bacteria targeted by amino acid chemical reporters as well as their sites of modification on endogenously expressed proteins. The azobenzene-based affinity tags are compatible with in-gel, in-solution, and on-bead enrichment strategies and should afford useful tools for diverse bioorthogonal proteomic applications.	0
Abstract2class: Pseurotin A and its analogues as inhibitors of immunoglobulin E [correction of immunoglobuline E] production Abstract: A natural product, pseurotin A inhibits IgE production in vitro. Wide variety of chemical modification of pseurotin A was performed. Structure-activity relationship studies of pseurotin analogues elucidated that 10-deoxypseurotin A strongly inhibits IgE production with IC(50) of 0.066 microM. An immunosuppressive activity of another natural product, synerazol was also found.	1
Abstract2class: An asparagine oxygenase (AsnO) and a 3-hydroxyasparaginyl phosphotransferase (HasP) are involved in the biosynthesis of calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides contain a wide range of unusual non-proteinogenic amino acid residues. As a result, these complex natural products are amongst the most structurally diverse secondary metabolites in nature, and possess a broad spectrum of biological activities. beta-Hydroxylation of amino acid precursors or peptidyl residues and their subsequent processing by downstream tailoring enzymes are some of the most common themes in the biosynthetic diversification of these therapeutically important peptides. Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic intermediates and enzymes involved in these processes are thus pivotal in understanding nonribosomal peptide assembly and modification. To this end, the putative asparaginyl oxygenase- and 3-hydroxyasparaginyl phosphotransferase-encoding genes hasP and asnO were separately deleted from the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor. Whilst the parent strains produce a number of 3-hydroxyasparagine- and 3-phosphohydroxyasparagine-containing CDAs, the DeltahasP mutants produce exclusively non-phosphorylated CDAs. On the other hand, DeltaasnO mutants produce several new Asn-containing CDAs not present in the wild-type, which retain calcium-dependent antimicrobial activity. This confirms that AsnO and HasP are required for the beta-hydroxylation and phosphorylation of the Asn residue within CDA.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning of separate meilingmycin biosynthesis gene clusters by use of acyltransferase-ketoreductase didomain PCR amplification Abstract: Five meilingmycins, A to E, with A as the major component, were isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization, meilingmycins A to E proved to be identical to reported milbemycins alpha11, alpha13, alpha14, beta1, and beta9, respectively. Sequencing of a previously cloned 103-kb region identified three modular type I polyketide synthase genes putatively encoding the last 11 elongation steps, three modification proteins, and one transcriptional regulatory protein for meilingmycin biosynthesis. However, the expected loading module and the first two elongation modules were missing. In meilingmycin, the presence of a methyl group at C-24 and a hydroxyl group at C-25 suggests that the elongation module 1 contains a methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-specific acyltransferase (ATp) domain and a ketoreductase (KR) domain. Based on the conserved motifs of the ATp and KR domains, a pair of primers was designed for PCR amplification, and a 1.40-kb expected fragment was amplified, whose sequence shows significant homology with the elongation module 1 of the aveA1-encoded enzyme AVES1. A polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one loading and two elongation modules, with a downstream C-5-O-methyltransferase gene, meiD, was subsequently localized 55 kb apart from the previously sequenced region, and its deletion abolishes meilingmycin production. A series of deletions within the 55-kb intercluster region rules out its involvement in meilingmycin biosynthesis. Furthermore, gene deletion of meiD eliminates meilingmycins D and E, with methyls at C-5. Our work provides a more specific strategy for the cloning of modular type I PKS gene clusters. The cloning of the meilingmycin gene clusters paves the way for its pathway engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Quantum dots as a novel immunofluorescent detection system for Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot-conjugated antibodies were successfully developed to label Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. This novel fluorescence system exhibited superior photostability, gave 1.5- to 9-fold-higher signal-to-noise ratios than traditional organic dyes in detecting C. parvum, and allowed dual-color detection for C. parvum and G. lamblia.	0
Abstract2class: Rational domain swaps decipher programming in fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases and resurrect an extinct metabolite Abstract: The mechanism of programming of iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases remains one of the key unsolved problems of secondary metabolism. We conducted rational domain swaps between the polyketide synthases encoding the biosynthesis of the closely related compounds tenellin and desmethylbassianin. Expression of the hybrid synthetases in Aspergillus oryzae led to the production of reprogrammed compounds in which the changes to the methylation pattern and chain length could be mapped to the domain swaps. These experiments reveal for the first time the origin of programming in these systems. Domain swaps combined with coexpression of two cytochrome P450 encoding genes from the tenellin biosynthetic gene cluster led to the resurrection of the extinct metabolite bassianin.	1
Abstract2class: Reconstitution of a Highly Reducing Type II PKS System Reveals 6π-Electrocyclization Is Required for o-Dialkylbenzene Biosynthesis Abstract: Natural products containing an o-dialkylbenzene moiety exhibit a wide variety of bioactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, and antiangiogenic activities. However, the biosynthetic scheme of the o-dialkylbenzene moiety remains unclear. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of compounds 1 and 2 in Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404, which contains a rare o-dialkylbenzene moiety, and successfully reconstituted the biosynthesis of 1 using 22 recombinant enzymes in vitro. Our study established a biosynthetic route for the o-tolyl group within the o-dialkylbenzene moiety, where the triene intermediate 3 loaded onto a unique acyl carrier protein (ACP) is elongated by a specific ketosynthase-chain length factor pair of a type II polyketide synthase system with the aid of a putative isomerase to be termed "electrocyclase" and a thioesterase-like enzyme in the BGC. The C2-elongated all-trans diketo-triene intermediate is subsequently isomerized to the 6Z configuration by the electrocyclase to allow intramolecular 6π-electrocyclization, followed by coenzyme FAD/FMN-dependent dehydrogenation. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the key genes are all conserved in BGCs of natural products containing an o-dialkylbenzene moiety, suggesting that the proposed biosynthetic scheme is a common strategy to form o-dialkylbenzenes in nature.	1
Abstract2class: Opening the TRPML gates Abstract: The intracellular TRPML channels have multiple biological roles, but the physiological stimuli that open them remained unknown. In a previous issue of Chemistry & Biology, Grimm et al. report a high-throughput chemical screen that identified a plethora of selective activators of TRPML3 that should open the way to fully characterize these channels and their physiological roles.	0
Abstract2class: Acrophiarin (antibiotic S31794/F-1) from Penicillium arenicola shares biosynthetic features with both Aspergillus- and Leotiomycete-type echinocandins Abstract: The antifungal echinocandin lipopeptide, acrophiarin, was circumscribed in a patent in 1979. We confirmed that the producing strain NRRL 8095 is Penicillium arenicola and other strains of P. arenicola produced acrophiarin and acrophiarin analogues. Genome sequencing of NRRL 8095 identified the acrophiarin gene cluster. Penicillium arenicola and echinocandin-producing Aspergillus species belong to the family Aspergillaceae of the Eurotiomycetes, but several features of acrophiarin and its gene cluster suggest a closer relationship with echinocandins from Leotiomycete fungi. These features include hydroxy-glutamine in the peptide core instead of a serine or threonine residue, the inclusion of a non-heme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase for hydroxylation of the C3 of the glutamine, and a thioesterase. In addition, P. arenicola bears similarity to Leotiomycete echinocandin-producing species because it exhibits self-resistance to exogenous echinocandins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the echinocandin biosynthetic family indicated that most of the predicted proteins of acrophiarin gene cluster exhibited higher similarity to the predicted proteins of the pneumocandin gene cluster of the Leotiomycete Glarea lozoyensis than to those of the echinocandin B gene cluster from A. pachycristatus. The fellutamide gene cluster and related gene clusters are recognized as relatives of the echinocandins. Inclusion of the acrophiarin gene cluster into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of echinocandin gene clusters indicated the divergent evolutionary lineages of echinocandin gene clusters are descendants from a common ancestral progenitor. The minimal 10-gene cluster may have undergone multiple gene acquisitions or losses and possibly horizontal gene transfer after the ancestral separation of the two lineages.	1
Abstract2class: Monoacylglycerols activate TRPV1--a link between phospholipase C and TRPV1 Abstract: Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generates diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and protons, all of which can regulate TRPV1 activity via different mechanisms. Here we explored the possibility that the diacylglycerol metabolites 2-arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol, and not metabolites of these monoacylglycerols, activate TRPV1 and contribute to this signaling cascade. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol activated native TRPV1 on vascular sensory nerve fibers and heterologously expressed TRPV1 in whole cells and inside-out membrane patches. The monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors methylarachidonoyl-fluorophosphonate and JZL184 prevented the metabolism of deuterium-labeled 2-arachidonoylglycerol and deuterium-labeled 1-arachidonoylglycerol in arterial homogenates, and enhanced TRPV1-mediated vasodilator responses to both monoacylglycerols. In mesenteric arteries from TRPV1 knock-out mice, vasodilator responses to 2-arachidonoylglycerol were minor. Bradykinin and adenosine triphosphate, ligands of phospholipase C-coupled membrane receptors, increased the content of 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dorsal root ganglia. In HEK293 cells expressing the phospholipase C-coupled histamine H1 receptor, exposure to histamine stimulated the formation of 2-AG, and this effect was augmented in the presence of JZL184. These effects were prevented by the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin. Histamine induced large whole cell currents in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV1 and the histamine H1 receptor, and the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine abolished these currents. JZL184 increased the histamine-induced currents and tetrahydrolipstatin prevented this effect. The calcineurin inhibitor ciclosporin and the endogenous "entourage" compound palmitoylethanolamide potentiated the vasodilator response to 2-arachidonoylglycerol, disclosing TRPV1 activation of this monoacylglycerol at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of JZL184 produced TRPV1-dependent antinociception in the mouse formalin test. Our results show that intact 2-arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol are endogenous TRPV1 activators, contributing to phospholipase C-dependent TRPV1 channel activation and TRPV1-mediated antinociceptive signaling in the brain.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by functional analysis of gene products expressed in Escherichia coli Abstract: The most important function of carotenoid pigments, especially beta-carotene in higher plants, is to protect organisms against photooxidative damage (G. Britton, in T. W. Goodwin, ed., Plant Pigments--1988, 1988; N. I. Krinsky, in O. Isler, H. Gutmann, and U. Solms, ed., Carotenoids--1971, 1971). beta-Carotene also functions as a precursor of vitamin A in mammals (G. A. J. Pitt, in I. Osler, H. Gutmann, and U. Solms, ed., Carotenoids--1971, 1971). The enzymes and genes which mediate the biosynthesis of cyclic carotenoids such as beta-carotene are virtually unknown. We have elucidated for the first time the pathway for biosynthesis of these carotenoids at the level of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, using bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis genes. These genes were cloned from a phytopathogenic bacterium, Erwinia uredovora 20D3 (ATCC 19321), in Escherichia coli and located on a 6,918-bp fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. Six open reading frames were found and designated the crtE, crtX, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtZ genes in reference to the carotenoid biosynthesis genes of a photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter capsulatus; only crtZ had the opposite orientation from the others. The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Erwinia uredovora was clarified by analyzing carotenoids accumulated in E. coli transformants in which some of these six genes were expressed, as follows: geranylgeranyl PPiCrtB----prephytoene PPiCrtE----phytoeneCrtI---- lycopeneCrtY----beta-caroteneCrtZ----zeaxanthinCrtX--- -zeaxanthin-beta- diglucoside. The carotenoids in this pathway appear to be close to those in higher plants rather than to those in bacteria. Also significant is that only one gene product (CrtI) for the conversion of phytoene to lycopene is required, a conversion in which four sequential desaturations should occur via the intermediates phytofluene, zeta-carotene, and neurosporene.	1
Abstract2class: Genes involved in the regulation of beta-lactamase production in enterococci and staphylococci Abstract: In enterococci, the structural gene for beta-lactamase (blaZ) is identical to blaZ from Staphylococcus aureus. However, in the enterococci studied to date, beta-lactamase is produced constitutively, whereas in staphylococci it is often inducible. Recent reports have revealed the presence of two adjacent genes upstream of the staphylococcal blaZ thought to be the antirepressor (blaR1) and repressor (blaI) genes. In the present study, beta-lactamase expression mutants of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmid pI524 were generated by transposon mutagenesis with the transposon Tn917. Tn917 insertions upstream of blaZ in either blaR1 or blaI resulted in constitutive beta-lactamase production, indicating that the repressor function is lost with insertion of Tn917 into either gene. This finding supports the concept that the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes are encoded on a polycistronic mRNA. The corresponding region upstream of the enterococcal blaZ from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was sequenced and compared with the staphylococcal blaR1 sequence. The two sequences were identical for 893 nucleotides, and then the sequences diverged completely. Therefore, in strain HH22, only 51% of the putative antirepressor gene is present and the repressor gene is also absent. In conclusion, constitutive beta-lactamase production in HH22 appears to be due to a lack of the regulatory genes blaR1 and blaI which regulate expression of blaZ in staphylococci.	0
Abstract2class: Antiproliferative withanolides from Datura wrightii Abstract: A new withanolide, named withawrightolide (1), and four known withanolides (2-5) were isolated from the aerial parts of Datura wrightii. The structure of compound 1 was elucidated through 2D NMR and other spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the structure of withametelin L (2) was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using MTS viability assays, withanolides 1-5 showed antiproliferative activities against human glioblastoma (U251 and U87), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (MDA-1986), and normal fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC50 values in the range between 0.56 and 5.6 μM.	0
Abstract2class: Uncovering the formation and selection of benzylmalonyl-CoA from the biosynthesis of splenocin and enterocin reveals a versatile way to introduce amino acids into polyketide carbon scaffolds Abstract: Selective modification of carbon scaffolds via biosynthetic engineering is important for polyketide structural diversification. Yet, this scope is currently restricted to simple aliphatic groups due to (1) limited variety of CoA-linked extender units, which lack aromatic structures and chemical reactivity, and (2) narrow acyltransferase (AT) specificity, which is limited to aliphatic CoA-linked extender units. In this report, we uncovered and characterized the first aromatic CoA-linked extender unit benzylmalonyl-CoA from the biosynthetic pathways of splenocin and enterocin in Streptomyces sp. CNQ431. Its synthesis employs a deamination/reductive carboxylation strategy to convert phenylalanine into benzylmalonyl-CoA, providing a link between amino acid and CoA-linked extender unit synthesis. By characterization of its selection, we further validated that AT domains of splenocin, and antimycin polyketide synthases are able to select this extender unit to introduce the phenyl group into their dilactone scaffolds. The biosynthetic machinery involved in the formation of this extender unit is highly versatile and can be potentially tailored for tyrosine, histidine and aspartic acid. The disclosed aromatic extender unit, amino acid-oriented synthetic pathway, and aromatic-selective AT domains provides a systematic breakthrough toward current knowledge of polyketide extender unit formation and selection, and also opens a route for further engineering of polyketide carbon scaffolds using amino acids.	1
Abstract2class: Assembly and heterologous expression of the coumermycin A1 gene cluster and production of new derivatives by genetic engineering Abstract: Many secondary metabolites of clinical importance have been isolated from different Streptomyces species. As most of the natural producers remain difficult to handle genetically, heterologous expression of an entire biosynthetic gene cluster in a well characterised host allows improved possibilities for modifications of the desired compound by manipulation of the biosynthetic genes. However, the large size of a functional gene cluster often prevents its direct cloning into a single cosmid clone. Here we describe a successful strategy to assemble the entire coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster (38.6 kb) into a single cosmid clone by lambda RED recombination technology. Heterologous expression of the reconstituted gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the heterologous production of coumermycin A1. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene couO--responsible for the C-methylation at the 8-positions of the aminocoumarin moieties in coumermycin A1--and heterologous expression of the modified cluster resulted in an accumulation of a C-8-unsubstituted coumermycin A1 derivative. Subsequent expression of the halogenase gene clo-hal from the clorobiocin gene cluster in the heterologous producer strain led to the formation of two new hybrid antibiotics, containing either one or two chlorine atoms. The identities of the new compounds were verified by LC-MS, and their antibacterial activities were tested against Bacillus subtilis in an agar diffusion assay.	1
Abstract2class: Genome mining unearths a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides represent a large class of metabolites with pharmaceutical relevance. Pteridines, such as pterins, folates, and flavins, are heterocyclic metabolites that often serve as redox-active cofactors. The biosynthetic machineries for construction of these distinct classes of small molecules operate independently in the cell. Here, we discovered an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in Photorhabdus luminescens using genome synteny analysis. P. luminescens is a Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes phenotypic variation and can have both pathogenic and mutualistic roles. Through extensive gene deletion, pathway-targeted molecular networking, quantitative proteomic analysis, and NMR, we show that the genetic locus affects the regulation of quorum sensing and secondary metabolic enzymes and encodes new pteridine metabolites functionalized with cis-amide acyl-side chains, termed pepteridine A (1) and B (2). The pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic phenotypic variant and represent the first reported metabolites to be synthesized by a hybrid NRPS-pteridine pathway. These studies expand our view of the combinatorial biosynthetic potential available in bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Automated Continuous Evolution of Proteins in Vivo Abstract: We present automated continuous evolution (ACE), a platform for the hands-free directed evolution of biomolecules. ACE pairs OrthoRep, a genetic system for continuous targeted mutagenesis of user-selected genes in vivo, with eVOLVER, a scalable and automated continuous culture device for precise, multiparameter regulation of growth conditions. By implementing real-time feedback-controlled tuning of selection stringency with eVOLVER, genes of interest encoded on OrthoRep autonomously traversed multimutation adaptive pathways to reach desired functions, including drug resistance and improved enzyme activity. The durability, scalability, and speed of biomolecular evolution with ACE should be broadly applicable to protein engineering as well as prospective studies on how selection parameters and schedules shape adaptation.	0
Abstract2class: Teaching an old pET new tricks: tuning of inclusion body formation and properties by a mixed feed system in E. coli Abstract: Against the outdated belief that inclusion bodies (IBs) in Escherichia coli are only inactive aggregates of misfolded protein, and thus should be avoided during recombinant protein production, numerous biopharmaceutically important proteins are currently produced as IBs. To obtain correctly folded, soluble product, IBs have to be processed, namely, harvested, solubilized, and refolded. Several years ago, it was discovered that, depending on cultivation conditions and protein properties, IBs contain partially correctly folded protein structures, which makes IB processing more efficient. Here, we present a method of tailored induction of recombinant protein production in E. coli by a mixed feed system using glucose and lactose and its impact on IB formation. Our method allows tuning of IB amount, IB size, size distribution, and purity, which does not only facilitate IB processing, but is also crucial for potential direct applications of IBs as nanomaterials and biomaterials in regenerative medicine.	0
Abstract2class: Response of Secondary Metabolism of Hypogean Actinobacterial Genera to Chemical and Biological Stimuli Abstract: Microorganisms within microbial communities respond to environmental challenges by producing biologically active secondary metabolites, yet the majority of these small molecules remain unidentified. We have previously demonstrated that secondary metabolite biosynthesis in actinomycetes can be activated by model environmental chemical and biological stimuli, and metabolites can be identified by comparative metabolomics analyses under different stimulus conditions. Here, we surveyed the secondary metabolite productivity of a group of 20 phylogenetically diverse actinobacteria isolated from hypogean (cave) environments by applying a battery of stimuli consisting of exposure to antibiotics, metals, and mixed microbial culture. Comparative metabolomics was used to reveal secondary metabolite responses from stimuli. These analyses revealed substantial changes in global metabolomic dynamics, with over 30% of metabolomic features increasing more than 10-fold under at least one stimulus condition. Selected features were isolated and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revealing several known secondary metabolite families, including the tetarimycins, aloesaponarins, hypogeamicins, actinomycins, and propeptins. One prioritized metabolite was identified to be a previously unreported aminopolyol polyketide, funisamine, produced by a cave isolate of Streptosporangium when exposed to mixed culture. The production of funisamine was most significantly increased in mixed culture with Bacillus species. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of funisamine was identified via genomic sequencing of the producing strain, Streptosporangium sp. strain KDCAGE35, which facilitated a deduction of its biosynthesis. Together, these data demonstrate that comparative metabolomics can reveal the stimulus-induced production of natural products from diverse microbial phylogenies.IMPORTANCE Microbial secondary metabolites are an important source of biologically active and therapeutically relevant small molecules. However, much of this active molecular diversity is challenging to access due to low production levels or difficulty in discerning secondary metabolites within complex microbial extracts prior to isolation. Here, we demonstrate that ecological stimuli increase secondary metabolite production in phylogenetically diverse actinobacteria isolated from understudied hypogean environments. Additionally, we show that comparative metabolomics linking stimuli to metabolite response data can effectively reveal secondary metabolites within complex biological extracts. This approach highlighted secondary metabolites in almost all observed natural product classes, including low-abundance analogs of biologically relevant metabolites, as well as a new linear aminopolyol polyketide, funisamine. This study demonstrates the generality of activating stimuli to potentiate secondary metabolite production across diverse actinobacterial genera.	1
Abstract2class: Constitutive and induced functions of the p53 gene Abstract: The p53 tumor suppressor serves to secure genetic stability of multicellular organisms. It suppresses the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells and substantially decreases the probability of malignant diseases. The p53 gene acts highly selectively through multiple mechanisms. Under relatively favorable conditions, p53 helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis by balancing anabolic and catabolic processes and by timely elimination of reactive oxygen species. These functions of p53 facilitate maximal efficiency and survival of cells under conditions of physiological stresses. In the case of grave molecular damage caused by severe stress, a significant amount of highly active p53 is induced leading to irreversible growth arrest and programmed cell death. The induced functions of p53 secure the timely elimination from the organism of damaged and potentially dangerous cells. Collectively, the functions of p53 contribute to the prevention of malignant and other diseases and decelerate the aging process.	0
Abstract2class: The PH domain of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 exhibits a novel, phospho-regulated monomer-dimer equilibrium with important implications for kinase domain activation: single-molecule and ensemble studies Abstract: Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is an essential master kinase recruited to the plasma membrane by the binding of its C-terminal PH domain to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Membrane binding leads to PDK1 phospho-activation, but despite the central role of PDK1 in signaling and cancer biology, this activation mechanism remains poorly understood. PDK1 has been shown to exist as a dimer in cells, and one crystal structure of its isolated PH domain exhibits a putative dimer interface. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of PH domain residue T513 (or the phospho-mimetic T513E mutation) may regulate a novel PH domain dimer-monomer equilibrium, thereby converting an inactive PDK1 dimer to an active monomer. However, the oligomeric states of the PH domain on the membrane have not yet been determined, nor whether a negative charge at position 513 is sufficient to regulate its oligomeric state. This study investigates the binding of purified wild-type (WT) and T513E PDK1 PH domains to lipid bilayers containing the PIP3 target lipid, using both single-molecule and ensemble measurements. Single-molecule analysis of the brightness of the fluorescent PH domain shows that the PIP3-bound WT PH domain on membranes is predominantly dimeric while the PIP3-bound T513E PH domain is monomeric, demonstrating that negative charge at the T513 position is sufficient to dissociate the PH domain dimer and is thus likely to play a central role in PDK1 monomerization and activation. Single-molecule analysis of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion of PH domain-PIP3 complexes reveals that the dimeric WT PH domain diffuses at the same rate as a single lipid molecule, indicating that only one of its two PIP3 binding sites is occupied and there is little penetration of the protein into the bilayer as observed for other PH domains. The 2D diffusion of T513E PH domain is slower, suggesting the negative charge disrupts local structure in a way that allows deeper insertion of the protein into the viscous bilayer, thereby increasing the diffusional friction. Ensemble measurements of PH domain affinity for PIP3 on plasma membrane-like bilayers reveal that the dimeric WT PH domain possesses a one order of magnitude higher target membrane affinity than the previously characterized monomeric PH domains, consistent with a dimerization-triggered, allosterically enhanced affinity for one PIP3 molecule (a much larger affinity enhancement would be expected for dimerization-triggered binding to two PIP3 molecules). The monomeric T513E PDK1 PH domain, like other monomeric PH domains, exhibits a PIP3 affinity and bound state lifetime that are each 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the dimeric WT PH domain, which is predicted to facilitate release of activated, monomeric PDK1 to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study yields the first molecular picture of PH domain regulation via electrostatic control of dimer-monomer conversion.	0
Abstract2class: Predicting Transcriptional Output of Synthetic Multi-input Promoters Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic biology have led to a wealth of well-characterized genetic parts. As parts libraries grow, so too does the potential to create novel multi-input promoters that integrate disparate signals to determine transcriptional output. Our ability to construct such promoters will outpace our ability to characterize promoter performance, due to the vast number of input combinations. In this study, we examine the input-output relations of recently developed synthetic multi-input promoters and describe two methods for predicting their behavior. The first method uses 1-dimensional induction data obtained from experiments on single-input systems to predict the n-dimensional induction responses of systems with n inputs. We demonstrate that this approach accurately predicts Boolean (on/off) responses of multi-input systems consisting of novel chimeric transcription factors and hybrid promoters in Escherichia coli. The second method uses only a small amount of multi-input response data to accurately predict analog system response over the entire landscape of input combinations. Taken together, these methods facilitate the design of synthetic circuits that utilize multi-input promoters.	0
Abstract2class: Functional Operons in Secondary Metabolic Gene Clusters in Glarea lozoyensis (Fungi, Ascomycota, Leotiomycetes) Abstract: Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Protein-coding operons have not been reported in the Fungi even though they represent a very diverse kingdom of organisms. Here, we report a functional operon involved in the secondary metabolism of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis belonging to Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota). Two contiguous genes, glpks3 and glnrps7, encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase, respectively, are cotranscribed into one dicistronic mRNA under the control of the same promoter, and the mRNA is then translated into two individual proteins, GLPKS3 and GLNRPS7. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans shows that the GLPKS3-GLNRPS7 enzyme complex catalyzes the biosynthesis of a novel pyrrolidinedione-containing compound, xenolozoyenone (compound 1), which indicates the operon is functional. Although it is structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus has a monophylogenic origin from fungi rather than having been horizontally transferred from prokaryotes. Moreover, two additional operons, glpks28-glnrps8 and glpks29-glnrps9, were verified at the transcriptional level in the same fungus. This is the first report of protein-coding operons in a member of the Fungi.                  Importance:                       Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Three operon-like gene structures for secondary metabolism that were discovered in the filamentous fungus Glarea lozoyensis are the first examples of protein-coding operons identified in a member of the Fungi. Among them, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon is responsible for the biosynthesis of xenolozoyenone, which is a novel tetramic acid-containing compound. Although structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus did not result from horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. In addition, operonlike structures have been predicted in silico to be common in other fungi. The common occurrence and operonlike structure in fungi provide evolutionary insight and essential data for eukaryotic gene transcription.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into cleavage specificity from the crystal structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C protease complexed with a peptide substrate Abstract: Picornavirus replication is critically dependent on the correct processing of a polyprotein precursor by 3C protease(s) (3C(pro)) at multiple specific sites with related but non-identical sequences. To investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity, we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non-covalent complexes of a picornavirus 3C(pro) with peptide substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro), mutated to replace the catalytic Cys by Ala and bound to a peptide (APAKQ|LLNFD) corresponding to the P5-P5' region of the VP1-2A cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein, was determined up to 2.5 A resolution. Comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in 3C(pro) on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the P4-P2' positions of the peptide. Strikingly, the deep S1' specificity pocket needed to accommodate P1'-Leu only forms when the peptide binds. Substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the P5-P4' region of synthetic substrates. The structure of the enzyme-peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular P4, P2 and P1 residue types, as well as the relative promiscuity at P3 and on the P' side of the scissile bond. Furthermore, crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified VP1-2A peptide (APAKE|LLNFD) containing a Gln-to-Glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro) to cleave sequences containing either P1-Gln or P1-Glu. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the S1' specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by Asp84 of the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity. Our results provide a new level of detail in our understanding of the structural basis of polyprotein cleavage by 3C(pro).	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptional and bioinformatic analysis of the 56.8 kb DNA region amplified in tandem repeats containing the penicillin gene cluster in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: High penicillin-producing strains of Penicillium chrysogenum contain 6-14 copies of the three clustered structural biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE [Barredo, J.L., Díez, B., Alvarez, E., Martín, J.F., 1989. Large amplification of a 35-kb DNA fragment carrying two penicillin biosynthetic genes in high penicillin producing strains of Penicillium chrysogenum. Curr. Genet. 16, 453-459; Smith, D.J., Bull, J.H., Edwards, J., Turner, G., 1989. Amplification of the isopenicillin N synthetase gene in a strain of Penicillium chrysogenum producing high levels of penicillin. Mol. Gen. Genet. 216, 492-497.] . The cluster is located in a 56.8 kb DNA region bounded by a conserved TGTAAA/T hexanucleotide that undergoes amplification in tandem repeats [Fierro, F., Barredo, J.L., Díez, B., Gutiérrez, S., Fernández, F.J., Martín, J.F., 1995. The penicillin gene cluster is amplified in tandem repeats linked by conserved hexanucleotide sequences. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 6200-6204; Newbert, R.W., Barton, B., Greaves, P., Harper, J., Turner, G., 1997. Analysis of a commercially improved Penicillium chrysogenum strain series: involvement of recombinogenic regions in amplification and deletion of the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 19, 18-27]. Transcriptional analysis of this amplified region (AR) revealed the presence of at least eight transcripts expressed in penicillin producing conditions. Three of them correspond to the known penicillin biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE. To locate genes related to penicillin precursor formation, or penicillin transport and regulation we have sequenced and analyzed the 56.8 kb amplified region of P. chrysogenum AS-P-78, finding a total of 16 open reading frames. Two of these ORFs have orthologues of known function in the databases. Other ORFs showed similarities to specific domains occurring in different proteins and superfamilies which allowed to infer their probable function. ORF11 encodes a D-amino acid oxidase that might be responsible for the conversion of D-amino acids in the tripeptide L-alpha-aminoadipyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine or other beta-lactam intermediates to deaminated by-products. ORF12 encodes a predicted protein with similarity to saccharopine dehydrogenases that seems to be related to biosynthesis of the penicillin precursor alpha-aminoadipic acid. A deletion mutant, P. chrysogenum npe10 lacking the entire AR including ORF12, shows a partial requirement of L-lysine for growth. ORF13 encodes a putative protein containing a Zn(II)2-Cys6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain, probably a transcriptional regulator. Although some of the ORFs in the AR may play roles in increasing penicillin production, none of the 13 ORFs other than pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE seem to be strictly indispensable for penicillin biosynthesis. The genes located in the P. chrysogenum AR have been compared with those found in the Aspergillus nidulans 50 kb DNA region adjacent to the penicillin gene cluster, showing no conservation between these two fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Ca2+ dysregulation in Ryr1(I4895T/wt) mice causes congenital myopathy with progressive formation of minicores, cores, and nemaline rods Abstract: Ryr1(I4895T/wt) (IT/+) mice express a knockin mutation corresponding to the human I4898T EC-uncoupling mutation in the type 1 ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1), which causes a severe form of central core disease (CCD). IT/+ mice exhibit a slowly progressive congenital myopathy, with neonatal respiratory stress, skeletal muscle weakness, impaired mobility, dorsal kyphosis, and hind limb paralysis. Lesions observed in myofibers from diseased mice undergo age-dependent transformation from minicores to cores and nemaline rods. Early ultrastructural abnormalities include sarcomeric misalignment, Z-line streaming, focal loss of cross-striations, and myofibrillar splitting and intermingling that may arise from defective myofibrillogenesis. However, manifestation of the disease phenotype is highly variable on a Sv129 genomic background. Quantitative RT-PCR shows an equimolar ratio of WT and mutant Ryr1 transcripts within IT/+ myofibers and total RyR1 protein expression levels are normal. We propose a unifying theory in which the cause of core formation lies in functional heterogeneity among RyR1 tetramers. Random combinations of normal and either leaky or EC-uncoupled RyR subunits would lead to spatial differences in Ca(2+) transients; the resulting heterogeneity of contraction among myofibrils would lead to focal, irreversible tearing and shearing, which would, over time, enlarge to form minicores, cores, and nemaline rods. The IT/+ mouse line is proposed to be a valid model of RyR1-related congenital myopathy, offering high potential for elucidation of the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle disorders arising from impaired EC coupling.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the 4-methyloxazoline-containing nonribosomal peptides, JBIR-34 and -35, in Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 Abstract: JBIR-34 and -35 produced by Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 are nonribosomal peptides that possess an unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety. Through draft genome sequencing, cosmid cloning, and gene disruption, the JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis gene cluster (fmo cluster) was identified; it encodes 20 proteins including five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Disruption of one of these NRPS genes (fmoA3) resulted in no JBIR-34 and -35 production and accumulation of 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid. Stable isotope-feeding experiments indicated that the methyl group of the methyloxazoline ring is derived from alanine rather than methionine. A recombinant FmoH protein, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, catalyzed conversion of α-methyl-l-serine into d-alanine (the reverse reaction of α-methyl-l-serine synthesis catalyzed by FmoH in vivo). Taken together, we concluded that α-methyl-l-serine synthesized from d-alanine is incorporated into JBIR-34 and -35 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. We also propose the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35.	1
Abstract2class: Outer Membrane Vesicle-Mediated Codelivery of the Antifungal HSAF Metabolites and Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase in the Predatory Lysobacter enzymogenes Abstract: Lysobacter are new biocontrol agents known for their prolific production of lytic enzymes and bioactive metabolites. L. enzymogenes is a predator of fungi and produces several structurally distinct antimicrobial compounds, such as the antifungal HSAF (heat stable antifungal factor) and analogs. The mechanism by which L. enzymogenes interacts with fungal prey is not well understood. Here, we found that the production of HSAF and analogs in L. enzymogenes OH11 was significantly induced in media supplemented with ground fungal mycelia or chitin. In the OH11 genome, we identified a gene (LeLPMO10A) that was annotated to encode a chitin-binding protein. The stimulation of HSAF and analogs by chitin was diminished when LeLPMO10A was deleted. We expressed the gene in E. coli and demonstrated that purified LeLPMO10A oxidatively cleaved chitin into oligomeric products, including 1,5 δ-lactones and aldonic acids. The results revealed that LeLPMO10A encodes a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, which has not been reported in Lysobacter. The metabolite analysis, antifungal assay, and proteomic analysis showed that the antifungal compounds and the chitin-cleaving LeLPMO10A are colocalized in outer membrane vesicles. The enzymatic products that resulted from in vitro LeLPMO10A-cleaved chitin also significantly induced HSAF and analogs in OH11. Scanning electron microscopic analysis indicated that spherical vesicles were formed outside of OH11 cells, and fewer OH11 cells were observed to attach to fungal hyphae when LeLPMO10A was deleted. Together, the study revealed a previously uncharacterized synergistic strategy utilized by the predatory Lysobacter during interaction with fungal prey.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene cluster for telomestatin biosynthesis and heterologous expression using a specific promoter in a clean host Abstract: Telomestatin, a strong telomerase inhibitor with G-quadruplex stabilizing activity, is a potential therapeutic agent for treating cancers. Difficulties in isolating telomestatin from microbial cultures and in chemical synthesis are bottlenecks impeding the wider use. Therefore, improvement in telomestatin production and structural diversification are required for further utilization and application. Here, we discovered the gene cluster responsible for telomestatin biosynthesis, and achieved production of telomestatin by heterologous expression of this cluster in the engineered Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA strain. Utilization of an optimal promoter was essential for successful production. Gene disruption studies revealed that the tlsB, tlsC, and tlsO-T genes play key roles in telomestatin biosynthesis. Moreover, exchanging TlsC core peptide sequences resulted in the production of novel telomestatin derivatives. This study sheds light on the expansion of chemical diversity of natural peptide products for drug development.	1
Abstract2class: Assessment of microbial communities by graph partitioning in a study of soil fungi in two Alpine meadows Abstract: Understanding how microbial community structure and diversity respond to environmental conditions is one of the main challenges in environmental microbiology. However, there is often confusion between determining the phylogenetic structure of microbial communities and assessing the distribution and diversity of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in these communities. This has led to the use of sequence analysis tools such as multiple alignments and hierarchical clustering that are not adapted to the analysis of large and diverse data sets and not always justified for characterization of MOTUs. Here, we developed an approach combining a pairwise alignment algorithm and graph partitioning by using MCL (Markov clustering) in order to generate discrete groups for nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene and internal transcript spacer 1 sequence data sets obtained from a yearly monitoring study of two spatially close but ecologically contrasting alpine soils (namely, early and late snowmelt locations). We compared MCL with a classical single-linkage method (Ccomps) and showed that MCL reduced bias such as the chaining effect. Using MCL, we characterized fungal communities in early and late snowmelt locations. We found contrasting distributions of MOTUs in the two soils, suggesting that there is a high level of habitat filtering in the assembly of alpine soil fungal communities. However, few MOTUs were specific to one location.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis and reactivity of a trigonal porous nanographene on a gold surface Abstract: The synthesis of porous nanographenes is a challenging task for solution chemistry, and thus, on-surface synthesis provides an alternative approach. Here, we report the synthesis of a triporous nanographene with 102 sp2 carbon atoms by combining solution and surface chemistry. The carbon skeleton was obtained by Pd-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of arynes in solution, while planarization of the molecule was achieved through two hierarchically organized on-surface cyclodehydrogenation reactions, intra- and inter-blade. Remarkably, the three non-planar [14]annulene pores of this nanographene further evolved at higher temperatures showing interesting intra-porous on-surface reactivity.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of mercapturic acid derivative of the labdane-type diterpene, cyslabdan that potentiates imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: cyslabdan is generated by mycothiol-mediated xenobiotic detoxification Abstract: Genome mining of cyslabdan-producing Streptomyces cyslabdanicus K04-0144 revealed that a set of four genes, cldA, cldB, cldC, and cldD (the cld cluster), which formed a single transcriptional unit, were involved in the biosynthesis of cyslabdan that potentiates imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Experimental studies supported the heterologous expression of the cld cluster of S. cyslabdanicus K04-0144 in S. avermitilis SUKA22, and transformants carrying the cld cluster produced not only cyslabdan A (1), but also its new derivatives, 17-hydroxyl-1 (2) and 2-hydroxyl-1 (3), in the culture broth. An analysis of diterpene metabolites in the mycelia showed that a large amount of a novel intermediate had accumulated and its structure was elucidated as (7S, 8S, 12E)-8,17-epoxy-7-hydroxylabda-12,14-diene (4). The cld-like cluster (rmn cluster) was also detected in the genome of S. anulatus GM95 by searching our in-house genome databases, and the heterologous expression of the rmn cluster in S. avermitilis SUAK22 demonstrated that the rmn cluster was involved in the biosynthesis of the labdane-type bicyclic diterpene, raimonol (7). CldA/RmnA catalyzed the generation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate. CldB/RmnB converted GGPP to (+)-copalyl diphosphate, and CldD/RmnD generated labda-8(17),12(E),14-triene (5). CldC introduced two oxygen atoms at C-7 and C-8,17 to generate 4, while RmnC hydroxylated 5 at C-7 to generate 7. The heterologous expression of the cld cluster suggested that four gene products catalyzed to generate 4, but not 1. The deletion mutant of the gene encoding the mycothiol (MSH)-S-conjugate amidase (mca) of S. avermitilis SUKA22 carrying the cld cluster failed to produce 1, but accumulated 4 in the mycelia, whereas S. avermitilis SUKA22 and its mca-deletion mutant carrying the cld cluster both produced the MSH-S-conjugate of 4. The intermediate 4 was converted into the MSH-S-conjugate with MSH, which was achieved through a non-enzymatic nucleophilic reaction. The MSH-S-conjugate of 4 generated was further hydrolyzed to generate the mercapturic acid derivative, 1, by MSH-S-conjugate amidase and 1 was excreted from the mycelia.	1
Abstract2class: Microbial community composition and diversity in rice straw digestion bioreactors with and without dairy manure Abstract: Anaerobic digestion (AD) uses a range of substrates to generate biogas, including energy crops such as globally abundant rice straw (RS). Unfortunately, RS is high in lignocellulosic material and has high to C:N ratios (~80:1), which makes it (alone) a comparatively poor substrate for AD. Co-digestion with dairy manure (DM) has been promoted as a method for balancing C:N ratios to improve RS AD whilst also treating another farm waste and co-producing a potentially useful fertiliser. However, past co-digestion studies have not directly compared RS AD microbial communities with and without DM additions, which has made it hard to assess all impacts of DM addition to RS AD processes. Here, four RS:DM ratios were contrasted in identical semi-continuous-fed AD bioreactors, and 100% RS was found to produce the highest specific methane yields (112 mL CH4/g VS/day; VS, volatile solids), which is over double yields achieved in the reactor with the highest DM content (30:70 RS:DM by mass; 48 mL CH4/g VS/day). To underpin these data, microbial communities were sequenced and characterised across the four reactors. Dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the 100% RS unit were Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes, whereas the 30:70 RS:DM unit was dominated by Proteobacteria/Spirochaetes, suggesting major microbial community shifts occur with DM additions. However, community richness was lowest with 100% RS (despite higher specific yields), suggesting particular OTUs may be more important to yields than microbial diversity. Further, ambient VFA and VS levels were significantly higher when no DM was added, suggesting DM-amended reactors may cope better with higher organic loading rates (OLR). Results show that RS AD without DM addition is feasible, although co-digestion with DM will probably allow higher OLRs, resulting in great RS throughput in farm AD units.	0
Abstract2class: New Vocabulary for Bacterial Communication Abstract: Quorum sensing (QS) is widely accepted as a procedure that bacteria use to converse. However, prevailing thinking places acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) at the forefront of this communication pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. With the advent of high-throughput genomics and the subsequent influx of bacterial genomes, bioinformatics analysis has determined that the genes encoding AHL biosynthesis, originally discovered to be indispensable for QS (LuxI-like proteins and homologues), are often absent in QS-capable bacteria. Instead, the sensing protein (LuxR-like proteins) is present with an apparent inability to produce any outgoing AHL signal. Recently, several signals for these LuxR solos have been identified. Herein, advances in the field of QS are discussed, with a particular focus on recent research in the field of bacterial cell-cell communication.	0
Abstract2class: SimReg1 is a master switch for biosynthesis and export of simocyclinone D8 and its precursors Abstract: Analysis of the simocyclinone biosynthesis (sim) gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040 led to the identification of a putative pathway specific regulatory gene simReg1. In silico analysis places the SimReg1 protein in the OmpR-PhoB subfamily of response regulators. Gene replacement of simReg1 from the S. antibioticus chromosome completely abolishes simocyclinone production indicating that SimReg1 is a key regulator of simocyclinone biosynthesis. Results of the DNA-shift assays and reporter gene expression analysis are consistent with the idea that SimReg1 activates transcription of simocyclinone biosynthesis, transporter genes, regulatory gene simReg3 and his own transcription. The presence of extracts (simocyclinone) from S. antibioticus Tü6040 × pSSimR1-1 could dissociate SimReg1 from promoter regions. A preliminary model for regulation of simocyclinone biosynthesis and export is discussed.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation, Structure Elucidation, Biosynthesis, and Synthesis of Antalid, a Secondary Metabolite from Polyangium species Abstract: The isolation, structure elucidation, and synthesis of antalid (1), a novel secondary metabolite from Polyangium sp., is described herein. The structure elucidation of 1 was performed with the aid of mass spectrometry, high field NMR experiments, and crystal structure analysis. The absolute configuration of antalid was confirmed through the Mosher ester method and ultimately by total synthesis. In addition, the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Long-Lived, Non-Geminate, Radiative Recombination of Photogenerated Charges in a Polymer/Small-Molecule Acceptor Photovoltaic Blend Abstract: Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency.	0
Abstract2class: Enzyme-Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia Abstract: Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density-dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone-containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome-guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S→N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme-primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the dichloroacetyl component of chloramphenicol in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230: genes required for halogenation Abstract: Five ORFs were detected in a fragment from the Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 genomic DNA library by hybridization with a PCR product amplified from primers representing a consensus of known halogenase sequences. Sequencing and functional analyses demonstrated that ORFs 11 and 12 (but not ORFs 13-15) extended the partially characterized gene cluster for chloramphenicol (Cm) biosynthesis in the chromosome. Disruption of ORF11 (cmlK) or ORF12 (cmlS) and conjugal transfer of the insertionally inactivated genes to S. venezuelae gave mutant strains VS1111 and VS1112, each producing a similar series of Cm analogues in which unhalogenated acyl groups replaced the dichloroacetyl substituent of Cm. 1H-NMR established that the principal metabolite in the disrupted strains was the alpha-N-propionyl analogue. The sequence of CmlK implicated the protein in adenylation, and involvement in halogenation was inferred from biosynthesis of analogues by the cmlK-disrupted mutant. A role in generating the dichloroacetyl substituent was supported by partial restoration of Cm biosynthesis when a cloned copy of cmlK was introduced in trans into VS1111. Complementation of the mutant also indicated that inactivation of cmlK rather than a polar effect of the disruption on cmlS expression had interfered with dichloroacetyl biosynthesis. The deduced CmlS sequence resembled sequences of FADH2-dependent halogenases. Conjugal transfer of cmlK or cmlS into S. venezuelae cml-2, a chlorination-deficient strain with a mutation mapped genetically to the Cm biosynthesis gene cluster, did not complement the cml-2 lesion, suggesting that one or more genes in addition to cmlK and cmlS is needed to assemble the dichloroacetyl substituent. Insertional inactivation of ORF13 did not affect Cm production, and the products of ORF14 and ORF15 matched Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) proteins lacking plausible functions in Cm biosynthesis. Thus cmlS appears to mark the downstream end of the gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Taurine Boosts Cellular Uptake of Small D-Peptides for Enzyme-Instructed Intracellular Molecular Self-Assembly Abstract: Due to their biostability, D-peptides are emerging as an important molecular platform for biomedical applications. Being proteolytically resistant, D-peptides lack interactions with endogenous transporters and hardly enter cells. Here we show that taurine, a natural amino acid, drastically boosts the cellular uptake of small D-peptides in mammalian cells by >10-fold, from 118 μM (without conjugating taurine) to >1.6 mM (after conjugating taurine). The uptake of a large amount of the ester conjugate of taurine and D-peptide allows intracellular esterase to trigger intracellular self-assembly of the D-peptide derivative, further enhancing their cellular accumulation. The study on the mechanism of the uptake reveals that the conjugates enter cells via both dynamin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, but likely not relying on taurine transporters. Differing fundamentally from the positively charged cell-penetrating peptides, the biocompatibility, stability, and simplicity of the enzyme-cleavable taurine motif promise new ways to promote the uptake of bioactive molecules for countering the action of efflux pump and contributing to intracellular molecular self-assembly.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of violacein: intact incorporation of the tryptophan molecule on the oxindole side, with intramolecular rearrangement of the indole ring on the 5-hydroxyindole side Abstract: Feeding experiments with a mixture of [2-13C]- and [indole-3-13C]tryptophans, of [3-13C]- and [indole-3-13 C]tryptophans (1:1 molar ratio) and of others have proved that the 1,2-shift of the indole ring occurred via an intramolecular process for formation of the left part (5-hydroxyindole side) of the violacein skeleton and demonstrated that the C-C bond from C2 of the indole ring to C2 of the side chain was completely retained for formation of the right part (oxindole side) during the entire biosynthetic process. Due to the involvement of transaminase, it has remained unresolved whether indolylpyruvic acid is the biosynthetic intermediate and/or from where the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolidone ring originates. An incorporation experiment with a mixture of [2-13C]- and [alpha-15N]tryptophans (1:1 molar ratio) verified that the nitrogen atom in the central ring was exclusively derived from the right-side tryptophan. Thus, all the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the right part of the violacein skeleton were constructed by intact incorporation of the tryptophan molecule, with decarboxylation probably occurring at a later biosynthetic stage.	1
Abstract2class: Lag phase of Salmonella enterica under osmotic stress conditions Abstract: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was grown at salt concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 7.5% in minimal medium with and without added osmoprotectant and in a rich medium. In minimal medium, the cells showed an initial decline period, and consequently the definition of the lag time of the resultant log count curve was revised. The model of Baranyi and Roberts (Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23:277-294, 1994) was modified to take into account the initial decline period, based on the assumption that the log count curve of the total population was the sum of a dying and a surviving-then-growing subpopulation. The lag time was defined as the lag of the surviving subpopulation. It was modeled by means of a parameter quantifying the biochemical work the surviving cells carry out during this phase, the "work to be done." The logarithms of the maximum specific growth rates as a function of the water activity in the three media differed only by additive constants, which gave a theoretical basis for bias factors characterizing the relationships between different media. Models for the lag and the "work to be done" as a function of the water activity showed similar properties, but in rich medium above 5% salt concentrations, the data showed a maximum for this work. An accurate description of the lag time is important to avoid food wastage, which is an issue of increasing significance in the food industry, while maintaining food safety standards.	0

All mothers had <400 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA copies/ml at delivery. Two had elevated liver transaminases and amylase. Seven infant adverse events were possibly treatment related (anemia, neutropenia, and hyperbilirubinemia).	0
Abstract2class: Isolation, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of an unusual hydroxamic acid ester-containing siderophore from Actinosynnema mirum Abstract: In this study we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of mirubactin (1), a siderophore containing an unprecedented chemical functionality in natural products, namely, an O-acyl hydroxamic acid ester. Mirubactin represents the first siderophore isolated from the genus Actinosynnema and the first natural product produced by Actinosynnema mirum whose biosynthetic gene cluster could be identified. Structure elucidation was accomplished through a combination of spectroscopic (NMR, IR, and UV/vis) and mass spectrometric methods and revealed the presence of an unusual ester bond between the δ-N-hydroxyl group of δ-N-formyl-δ-N-hydroxyornithine and a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate moiety. Bioinformatic analysis of the A. mirum genome and subsequent biochemical characterization of the putative biosynthetic machinery identified the gene cluster responsible for mirubactin assembly. The proposed biosynthesis of mirubactin comprises the iterative use of a stand-alone carrier-protein-bound substrate, as well as an ester-bond-forming step catalyzed by a C-terminal condensation domain, thus revealing an interesting system for further biochemical studies to gain a deeper understanding of nonribosomal peptide synthetase-catalyzed siderophore biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Transforming RNA-Seq data to improve the performance of prognostic gene signatures Abstract: Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptional activation of the pathway-specific regulator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The Streptomyces produce a plethora of secondary metabolites including antibiotics and undergo a complex developmental cycle. As a means of establishing the pathways that regulate secondary metabolite production by this important bacterial genus, the model species Streptomyces coelicolor and its relatives have been the subject of several genetic screens. However, despite the identification and characterization of numerous genes that affect antibiotic production, there is still no overall understanding of the network that integrates the various environmental and growth signals to bring about changes in the expression of biosynthetic genes. To establish new links, we are taking a biochemical approach to identify transcription factors that regulate antibiotic production in S. coelicolor. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a transcription factor, designated AtrA, that regulates transcription of actII-ORF4, the pathway-specific activator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. coelicolor. Disruption of the corresponding atrA gene, which is not associated with any antibiotic gene cluster, reduced the production of actinorhodin, but had no detectable effect on the production of undecylprodigiosin or the calcium-dependent antibiotic. These results indicate that atrA has specificity with regard to the biosynthetic genes it influences. An orthologue of atrA is present in the genome of Streptomyces avermitilis, the only other streptomycete for which there is a publicly available complete sequence. We also show that S. coelicolor AtrA can bind in vitro to the promoter of strR, a transcriptional activator unrelated to actII-ORF4 that is the final regulator of streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus. These findings provide further evidence that the path leading to the expression of pathway-specific activators of antibiotic biosynthesis genes in disparate Streptomyces may share evolutionarily conserved components in at least some cases, even though the final activators are not related, and suggests that the regulation of streptomycin production, which serves an important paradigm, may be more complex than represented by current models.	1
Abstract2class: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Abstract2class: Liver X Receptor Agonists Inhibit the Phospholipid Regulatory Gene CTP: Phosphoethanolamine Cytidylyltransferase-Pcyt2 Abstract: Metabolic pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), the endogenous activator of the liver X receptor (LXR), significantly reduced the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine via CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway at the step catalyzed by CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2). In the mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2, the LXR synthetic agonist TO901317 lowered Pcyt2 promoter-luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, 25-OH and TO901317 reduced mouse Pcyt2 mRNA and protein levels by 35-60%. The inhibitory effects of oxysterols and TO901317 on the Pcyt2 promoter function, mRNA and protein expression were conserved in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. These studies identify the Pcyt2 gene as a novel target whereby LXR agonists may indirectly modulate inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis.	0
Abstract2class: Fungal echinocandin resistance Abstract: The echinocandins are the newest class of antifungal agents in the clinical armory. These secondary metabolites are non-competitive inhibitors of the synthesis of beta-(1,3)-glucan, a major structural component of the fungal cell wall. Recent work has shown that spontaneous mutations can arise in two hot spot regions of Fks1 the target protein of echinocandins that reduce the enzyme's sensitivity to the drug. However, other strains have been isolated in which the sequence of FKS1 is unaltered yet the fungus has decreased sensitivity to echinocandins. In addition it has been shown that echinocandin-treatment can induce cell wall salvage mechanisms that result in the compensatory upregulation of chitin synthesis in the cell wall. This salvage mechanism strengthens cell walls damaged by exposure to echinocandins. Therefore, fungal resistance to echinocandins can arise due to the selection of either stable mutational or reversible physiological alterations that decrease susceptibility to these antifungal agents.	0
Abstract2class: Butyrivibriocin AR10, a new cyclic bacteriocin produced by the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens AR10: characterization of the gene and peptide Abstract: The gene (bviA) encoding the ruminal bacteriocin butyrivibriocin AR10 was cloned from an EcoRI library by using an oligonucleotide probe based on a partial peptide sequence of the previously isolated peptide. The gene encoded an 80 amino acid prebacteriocin that demonstrated significant identity with the cyclic bacteriocin gassericin A. Negative ion time of flight mass spectroscopic analysis (ESI/MS) indicated a mass of 5981.5 Da for the isolated bacteriocin, a molecular mass that could not be generated by removal of a leader peptide alone. However, an N- to C-terminal cyclization of the predicted mature bacteriocin resulted in a peptide that conformed to the determined mass and charge characteristics. Northern blotting confirmed that expression of bviA mirrored the production of the bacteriocin in both liquid and solid media.	1
Abstract2class: Orthogonal Peptide-Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETA R/ETB R Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling Abstract: Fine-tuning of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one-step labeling method of multiple membrane-embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e. g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5 min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETA R and ETB R), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type-like G protein activation after N-terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET-competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero-receptors was limited to ETA R/ETB R. Further, we demonstrate, that ETA R expression regulates the signaling of co-expressed ETB R. Our orthogonal peptide-templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.	0

Abstract2class: Being surveyed can change later behavior and related parameter estimates Abstract: Does completing a household survey change the later behavior of those surveyed? In three field studies of health and two of microlending, we randomly assigned subjects to be surveyed about health and/or household finances and then measured subsequent use of a related product with data that does not rely on subjects' self-reports. In the three health experiments, we find that being surveyed increases use of water treatment products and take-up of medical insurance. Frequent surveys on reported diarrhea also led to biased estimates of the impact of improved source water quality. In two microlending studies, we do not find an effect of being surveyed on borrowing behavior. The results suggest that limited attention could play an important but context-dependent role in consumer choice, with the implication that researchers should reconsider whether, how, and how much to survey their subjects.	0
Abstract2class: A gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces resistomycificus; exploring polyketide cyclization beyond linear and angucyclic patterns Abstract: Resistomycin is a pentacyclic polyketide metabolite of Streptomyces resistomycificus that exhibits a variety of pharmacologically relevant properties. While virtually all bacterial aromatic polyketides can be grouped into linear and angular polyphenols, resistomycin has a unique "discoid" ring system. We have successfully identified the entire gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis by heterologously expressing a pooled cosmid library and screening for the fluorescence of the metabolite produced. The rem gene cluster exhibits several unusual features of the type II PKS involved, most remarkably a putative MCAT with highest homology to AT domains from modular PKSs. In addition, we provide the first insight into the molecular basis of a unique mode of cyclization giving rise to a discoid polyketide.	1
Abstract2class: Disruption of NMDAR-dependent burst firing by dopamine neurons provides selective assessment of phasic dopamine-dependent behavior Abstract: Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons fire in 2 characteristic modes, tonic and phasic, which are thought to modulate distinct aspects of behavior. However, the inability to selectively disrupt these patterns of activity has hampered the precise definition of the function of these modes of signaling. Here, we addressed the role of phasic DA in learning and other DA-dependent behaviors by attenuating DA neuron burst firing and subsequent DA release, without altering tonic neural activity. Disruption of phasic DA was achieved by selective genetic inactivation of NMDA-type, ionotropic glutamate receptors in DA neurons. Disruption of phasic DA neuron activity impaired the acquisition of numerous conditioned behavioral responses, and dramatically attenuated learning about cues that predicted rewarding and aversive events while leaving many other DA-dependent behaviors unaffected.	0
Abstract2class: Fungal Isocyanide Synthases and Xanthocillin Biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Microbial secondary metabolites, including isocyanide moieties, have been extensively mined for their repertoire of bioactive properties. Although the first naturally occurring isocyanide (xanthocillin) was isolated from the fungus Penicillium notatum over half a century ago, the biosynthetic origins of fungal isocyanides remain unknown. Here we report the identification of a family of isocyanide synthases (ICSs) from the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus Comparative metabolomics of overexpression or knockout mutants of ICS candidate genes led to the discovery of a fungal biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that produces xanthocillin (xan). Detailed analysis of xanthocillin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus revealed several previously undescribed compounds produced by the xan BGC, including two novel members of the melanocin family of compounds. We found both the xan BGC and a second ICS-containing cluster, named the copper-responsive metabolite (crm) BGC, to be transcriptionally responsive to external copper levels and further demonstrated that production of metabolites from the xan BGC is increased during copper starvation. The crm BGC includes a novel type of fungus-specific ICS-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) hybrid enzyme, CrmA. This family of ICS-NRPS hybrid enzymes is highly enriched in fungal pathogens of humans, insects, and plants. Phylogenetic assessment of all ICSs spanning the tree of life shows not only high prevalence throughout the fungal kingdom but also distribution in species not previously known to harbor BGCs, indicating an untapped resource of fungal secondary metabolism.IMPORTANCE Fungal ICSs are an untapped resource in fungal natural product research. Their isocyanide products have been implicated in plant and insect pathogenesis due to their ability to coordinate transition metals and disable host metalloenzymes. The discovery of a novel isocyanide-producing family of hybrid ICS-NRPS enzymes enriched in medically and agriculturally important fungal pathogens may reveal mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and afford opportunities to discover additional families of isocyanides. Furthermore, the identification of noncanonical ICS BGCs will enable refinement of BGC prediction algorithms to expand on the secondary metabolic potential of fungal and bacterial species. The identification of genes related to ICS BGCs in fungal species not previously known for secondary metabolite-producing capabilities (e.g., Saccharomyces spp.) contributes to our understanding of the evolution of BGC in fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1: genetic organization of the tod operon Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PpF1 degrades toluene through cis-toluene dihydrodiol to 3-methylcatechol. The latter compound is metabolized through the well-established meta pathway for catechol degradation. The first four steps in the pathway involve the sequential action of toluene dioxygenase (todABC1C2), cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (todD), 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE), and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate hydrolase (todF). The genes for these enzymes form part of the tod operon which is responsible for the degradation of toluene by this organism. A combination of transposon mutagenesis of the PpF1 chromosome, as well as analysis of cloned chromosomal fragments, was used to determine the physical order of the genes in the tod operon. The genes were determined to be transcribed in the order todF, todC1, todC2, todB, todA, todD, todE.	0
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of Chitinophaga pinensis type strain (UQM 2034) Abstract: Chitinophaga pinensis Sangkhobol and Skerman 1981 is the type strain of the species which is the type species of the rapidly growing genus Chitinophaga in the sphingobacterial family 'Chitinophagaceae'. Members of the genus Chitinophaga vary in shape between filaments and spherical bodies without the production of a fruiting body, produce myxospores, and are of special interest for their ability to degrade chitin. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence, and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the family 'Chitinophagaceae', and the 9,127,347 bp long single replicon genome with its 7,397 protein-coding and 95 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.	1
Abstract2class: Sequence analysis of mutA and mutM genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mutacin II in Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Streptococcus mutans, along with many other gram-positive bacteria produce small antibacterial peptides called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins elaborated by S. mutans, termed mutacins, may provide a selective force necessary for initial or sustained colonization in dental plaque by this major dental pathogen. Previously, we purified and characterized mutacin II, the first lantibiotic found in S. mutans. Specific oligonucleotides designed according to the N-terminal amino acid sequence permitted amplification of 0.7 kb upstream and 2.1 kb downstream of the N-terminus, using single-specific-primer PCR (SSP-PCR). The gene encoding the mutacin II prepeptide, mutA, was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The complete prepeptide consists of 53 amino acids, including the 26 amino acid amphipathic leader peptide with the Gly(-2)-Gly(-1) sequence at the processing site. The prepeptide showed similarity to the lantibiotics lacticin 481, variacin, salivaricin and streptococcin A-FF22. A 3 kb open reading frame immediately downstream of mutA, denoted mutM, showed sequence similarities to LCNDR2 from Lactococcus lactis. By analogy, mutM is probably involved in post-translational modification of the mutacin prepeptide. Gene disruption with an insertional vector pVA891 showed that intact copies of mutA and mutM are required for production of mutacin II.	1
Abstract2class: Prokaryotic Community Structure Driven by Salinity and Ionic Concentrations in Plateau Lakes of the Tibetan Plateau Abstract: The prokaryotic community composition and diversity and the distribution patterns at various taxonomic levels across gradients of salinity and physiochemical properties in the surface waters of seven plateau lakes in the Qaidam Basin, Tibetan Plateau, were evaluated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. These lakes included Lakes Keluke (salinity, <1 g/liter), Qing (salinity, 5.5 to 6.6 g/liter), Tuosu (salinity, 24 to 35 g/liter), Dasugan (salinity, 30 to 33 g/liter), Gahai (salinity, 92 to 96 g/liter), Xiaochaidan (salinity, 94 to 99 g/liter), and Gasikule (salinity, 317 to 344 g/liter). The communities were dominated by Bacteria in lakes with salinities of <100 g/liter and by Archaea in Lake Gasikule. The clades At12OctB3 and Salinibacter, previously reported only in hypersaline environments, were found in a hyposaline lake (salinity, 5.5 to 6.6 g/liter) at an abundance of ∼1.0%, indicating their ecological plasticity. Salinity and the concentrations of the chemical ions whose concentrations covary with salinity (Mg(2+), K(+), Cl(-), Na(+), SO4 (2-), and Ca(2+)) were found to be the primary environmental factors that directly or indirectly determined the composition and diversity at the level of individual clades as well as entire prokaryotic communities. The distribution patterns of two phyla, five classes, five orders, five families, and three genera were well predicted by salinity. The variation of the prokaryotic community structure also significantly correlated with the dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, the total nitrogen concentration, and the PO4 (3-) concentration. Such correlations varied depending on the taxonomic level, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive correlation analyses at various taxonomic levels in evaluating the effects of environmental variable factors on prokaryotic community structures. Our findings clarify the distribution patterns of the prokaryotic community composition in plateau lakes at the levels of individual clades as well as whole communities along gradients of salinity and ionic concentrations.	0
Abstract2class: Unveiling the Biosynthetic Pathway of the Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptide Ustiloxin B in Filamentous Fungi Abstract: The biosynthetic machinery of the first fungal ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) ustiloxin B was elucidated through a series of gene inactivation and heterologous expression studies. The results confirmed an essential requirement for novel oxidases possessing the DUF3328 motif for macrocyclization, and highly unique side-chain modifications by three oxidases (UstCF1F2) and a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme (UstD). These findings provide new insight into the expression of the RiPP gene clusters found in various fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis, Synthesis, and Activities of Barnesin A, a NRPS-PKS Hybrid Produced by an Anaerobic Epsilonproteobacterium Abstract: Despite the wealth of physiological knowledge and plentiful genomes available, only few natural products of anaerobic bacteria have been identified until today and even less have been linked to their biosynthetic gene cluster. Here, we analyzed a unique NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from an anaerobic Epsilonproteobacterium ( Sulfurospirillum barnesii). Phylogenetic analysis of key biosynthetic genes, gene expression studies, and comparative metabolomics resulted in the identification of the first anoxically biosynthesized NRPS-PKS hybrid metabolite: a lipo-dipeptide with a vinylogous side chain, called barnesin A. The absolute structure was verified by a modular total synthesis, and barnesin and derivatives were found to have antimicrobial activity, as well as selective and nanomolar inhibitory activity, against pharmacological important cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B.	1

The nucleotide sequence of the SA-FF22 structural gene (scnA) was determined and shown to encode a 51-amino-acid prepeptide. The proteolytic processing site of the SA-FF22 prepeptide differs from that which characterizes other type A lantibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Investigating Nucleosome Accessibility for MNase, FeII Peplomycin, and Duocarmycin B2 by Using Capillary Electrophoresis Abstract: Capillary electrophoresis, coupled with DNA 5' Texas Red labeling, was used to investigate the ability of MNase, FeII peplomycin, and duocarmycin B2 to access the nucleosome. Distinct accessibility patterns of these species to the nucleosome were observed. MNase was completely prevented from approaching the nucleosome core and exhibited a higher site specificity for targeting DNA sites located close to the core region. Intercalation of peplomycin in the nucleosomal core region was highly suppressed, but reaction sites located at the ends of the nucleosomal core remained accessible, which implied flexibility of the core DNA end. Duocarmycin B2 was able to enter and react in the core region, although its alkylating efficiency decreased significantly.	0
Abstract2class: Antibiotic resistance mechanisms inform discovery: identification and characterization of a novel amycolatopsis strain producing ristocetin Abstract: Discovering new antibiotics is a major scientific challenge, made increasingly urgent by the continued development of resistance in bacterial pathogens. A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance will be vital for the future discovery or design of new, more effective antibiotics. We have exploited our intimate knowledge of the molecular mechanism of glycopeptide antibiotic resistance in the harmless bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor to develop a new two-step cell wall bioactivity screen, which efficiently identified a new actinomycete strain containing a previously uncharacterized glycopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster. The screen first identifies natural product extracts capable of triggering a generalized cell wall stress response and then specifically selects for glycopeptide antibacterials by assaying for the induction of glycopeptide resistance genes. In this study, we established a diverse natural product extract library from actinomycete strains isolated from locations with widely varying climates and ecologies, and we screened them using the novel two-step bioassay system. The bioassay ultimately identified a single strain harboring the previously unidentified biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide ristocetin, providing a proof of principle for the effectiveness of the screen. This is the first report of the ristocetin biosynthetic gene cluster, which is predicted to include some interesting and previously uncharacterized enzymes. By focusing on screening libraries of microbial extracts, this strategy provides the certainty that identified producer strains are competent for growth and biosynthesis of the detected glycopeptide under laboratory conditions.	1
Abstract2class: REVERSAL OF d-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL GROWTH BY ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Reversal of d-cycloserine inhibition of bacterial growth by alanine. J. Bacteriol. 84:154-156. 1962.-Reversal of the antibacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidone by alanine in bacterial cultures actively growing on chemically defined media was compared in cultures requiring exogenous alanine and those capable of its synthesis. dl-Alanine was the most effective reversal agent in Pediococcus cerevisiae, an alanine-requiring organism, and d-alanine was effective in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, organisms synthesizing alanine. With all three cultures, l-alanine was the least effective reversal agent.	0
Abstract2class: Global genome analysis of the shikimic acid pathway reveals greater gene loss in host-associated than in free-living bacteria Abstract: Background:                       A central tenet in biochemistry for over 50 years has held that microorganisms, plants and, more recently, certain apicomplexan parasites synthesize essential aromatic compounds via elaboration of a complete shikimic acid pathway, whereas metazoans lacking this pathway require a dietary source of these compounds. The large number of sequenced bacterial and archaean genomes now available for comparative genomic analyses allows the fundamentals of this contention to be tested in prokaryotes. Using Hidden Markov Model profiles (HMM profiles) to identify all known enzymes of the pathway, we report the presence of genes encoding shikimate pathway enzymes in the hypothetical proteomes constructed from the genomes of 488 sequenced prokaryotes.                  Results:                       Amongst free-living prokaryotes most Bacteria possess, as expected, genes encoding a complete shikimic acid pathway, whereas of the culturable Archaea, only one was found to have a complete complement of recognisable enzymes in its predicted proteome. It may be that in the Archaea, the primary amino-acid sequences of enzymes of the pathway are highly divergent and so are not detected by HMM profiles. Alternatively, structurally unrelated (non-orthologous) proteins might be performing the same biochemical functions as those encoding recognized genes of the shikimate pathway. Most surprisingly, 30% of host-associated (mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic) bacteria likewise do not possess a complete shikimic acid pathway. Many of these microbes show some degree of genome reduction, suggesting that these host-associated bacteria might sequester essential aromatic compounds from a parasitised host, as a 'shared metabolic adaptation' in mutualistic symbiosis, or obtain them from other consorts having the complete biosynthetic pathway. The HMM results gave 84% agreement when compared against data in the highly curated BioCyc reference database of genomes and metabolic pathways.                  Conclusions:                       These results challenge the conventional belief that the shikimic acid pathway is universal and essential in prokaryotes. The possibilities that non-orthologous enzymes catalyse reactions in this pathway (especially in the Archaea), or that there exist specific uptake mechanisms for the acquisition of shikimate intermediates or essential pathway products, warrant further examination to better understand the precise metabolic attributes of host-beneficial and pathogenic bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Patulin is a cultivar-dependent aggressiveness factor favouring the colonization of apples by Penicillium expansum Abstract: The blue mould decay of apples is caused by Penicillium expansum and is associated with contamination by patulin, a worldwide regulated mycotoxin. Recently, a cluster of 15 genes (patA-patO) involved in patulin biosynthesis was identified in P. expansum. blast analysis revealed that patL encodes a Cys6 zinc finger regulatory factor. The deletion of patL caused a drastic decrease in the expression of all pat genes, leading to an absence of patulin production. Pathogenicity studies performed on 13 apple varieties indicated that the PeΔpatL strain could still infect apples, but the intensity of symptoms was weaker compared with the wild-type strain. A lower growth rate was observed in the PeΔpatL strain when this strain was grown on nine of the 13 apple varieties tested. In the complemented PeΔpatL:patL strain, the ability to grow normally in apple and the production of patulin were restored. Our results clearly demonstrate that patulin is not indispensable in the initiation of the disease, but acts as a cultivar-dependent aggressiveness factor for P. expansum. This conclusion was strengthened by the fact that the addition of patulin to apple infected by the PeΔpatL mutant restored the normal fungal colonization in apple.	1
Abstract2class: Polyketide synthase chemistry does not direct biosynthetic divergence between 9- and 10-membered enediynes Abstract: Enediynes are potent antitumor antibiotics that are classified as 9- or 10-membered according to the size of the enediyne core structure. However, almost nothing is known about enediyne core biosynthesis, and the determinants of 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence remain elusive. Previous work identified enediyne-specific polyketide synthases (PKSEs) that can be phylogenetically distinguished as being involved in 9- versus 10-membered enediyne biosynthesis, suggesting that biosynthetic divergence might originate from differing PKSE chemistries. Recent in vitro studies have identified several compounds produced by the PKSE and associated thioesterase (TE), but condition-dependent product profiles make it difficult to ascertain a true catalytic difference between 9- and 10-membered PKSE-TE systems. Here we report that PKSE chemistry does not direct 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence as revealed by comparing the products from three 9-membered and two 10-membered PKSE-TE systems under identical conditions using robust in vivo assays. Three independent experiments support a common catalytic function for 9- and 10-membered PKSEs by the production of a heptaene metabolite from: (i) all five cognate PKSE-TE pairs in Escherichia coli; (ii) the C-1027 and calicheamicin cognate PKSE-TEs in Streptomyces lividans K4-114; and (iii) selected native producers of both 9- and 10-membered enediynes. Furthermore, PKSEs and TEs from different 9- and 10-membered enediyne biosynthetic machineries are freely interchangeable, revealing that 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence occurs beyond the PKSE-TE level. These findings establish a starting point for determining the origins of this biosynthetic divergence.	1
Abstract2class: Organization of genes required for gellan polysaccharide biosynthesis in Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 Abstract: Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 produces gellan, a capsular polysaccharide that is useful as a gelling agent for food and microbiological media. Complementation of nonmucoid S. elodea mutants with a gene library resulted in identification of genes essential for gellan biosynthesis. A cluster of 18 genes spanning 21 kb was isolated. These 18 genes are homologous to genes for synthesis of sphingan polysaccharide S-88 from Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 31554, with predicted amino acid identities varying from 61% to 98%. Both polysaccharides have the same tetrasaccharide repeat unit, comprised of [-->4)-alpha- l-rhamnose-(1-->3)-beta- d-glucose-(1-->4)-beta- d-glucuronic acid-(1-->4)-beta- d-glucose-(1-->]. Polysaccharide S-88, however, has mannose or rhamnose in the fourth position and has a rhamnosyl side chain, while gellan has no sugar side chain but is modified by glyceryl and acetyl substituents. Genes for synthesis of the precursor dTDP- l-rhamnose were highly conserved. The least conserved genes in this cluster encode putative glycosyl transferases III and IV and a gene of unknown function, gelF. Three genes ( gelI, gelM, and gelN) affected the amount and rheology of gellan produced. Four additional genes present in the S-88 sphingan biosynthetic gene cluster did not have homologs in the gene cluster for gellan biosynthesis. Three of these gene homologs, gelR, gelS, and gelG, were found in an operon unlinked to the main gellan biosynthetic gene cluster. In a third region, a gene possibly involved in positive regulation of gellan biosynthesis was identified.	1
Abstract2class: Bisucaberin B, a linear hydroxamate class siderophore from the marine bacterium Tenacibaculum mesophilum Abstract: A siderophore, named bisucaberin B, was isolated from Tenacibaculum mesophilum bacteria separated from a marine sponge collected in the Republic of Palau. Using spectroscopic and chemical methods, the structure of bisucaberin B (1) was clearly determined to be a linear dimeric hydroxamate class siderophore. Although compound 1 is an open form of the known macrocyclic dimer bisucaberin (2), and was previously described as a bacterial degradation product of desferrioxamine B (4), the present report is the first description of the de novo biosynthesis of 1. To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 is the first chemically characterized siderophore isolated from a bacterium belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and Mobilization of a Cryptic Antibiotic Biosynthesis Gene Locus from a Human-Pathogenic Nocardia Isolate Abstract: The genus Nocardia contains >50 human pathogenic species that cause a range of illnesses from skin and soft tissue infections to lung and brain infections. However, despite their membership in the most prominent family of secondary metabolite producers (the Actinomycetes), the ability of Nocardia species, especially those that cause human infections, to produce secondary metabolites has not been as well studied. Using genome mining, we have investigated cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters from Nocardia species and identified a conserved locus within human pathogenic strains of Nocardia brasiliensis and Nocardia vulneris. Direct capture and heterologous expression in a Streptomyces host activated the biosynthetic locus, revealing it to be the source of the brasiliquinones, benz[a]anthraquinone antibiotics whose biosynthetic pathway has remained hidden for over two decades, until now. Our findings highlight these hitherto neglected human pathogenic Nocardia as a source of diverse and important natural products.	1
Abstract2class: An Uncommon Type II PKS Catalyzes Biosynthesis of Aryl Polyene Pigments Abstract: Aryl polyene (APE) pigments are a widely distributed class of bacterial polyketides. So far, little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds, which are produced by a novel type II polyketide synthase (PKS). We have identified all enzymes involved in APE biosynthesis and determined their peculiar functions. The biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro, and ACP-bound intermediates were assigned for each reaction step by HPLC-MS. Native mass spectrometry experiments identified four stable complexes: the acyl-carrier proteins ApeE and ApeF bound to the thioesterase ApeK, the dehydratases ApeI and ApeP, and the ketosynthase ApeO in complex with its chain-length factor ApeC. X-ray structures of the heterodimeric ApeO:ApeC and ApeI:ApeP complexes depict striking protein-protein interactions. Altogether, our study elucidated mechanistic aspects of APE biosynthesis that unifies elements of type II fatty acid and PKS systems, but in addition includes novel enzyme complexes.	1
Abstract2class: Catalytic and Photochemical Strategies to Stabilized Radicals Based on Anomeric Nucleophiles Abstract: Carbohydrates, one of the three primary macromolecules of living organisms, play significant roles in various biological processes such as intercellular communication, cell recognition, and immune activity. While the majority of established methods for the installation of carbohydrates through the anomeric carbon rely on nucleophilic displacement, anomeric radicals represent an attractive alternative because of their functional group compatibility and high anomeric selectivities. Herein, we demonstrate that anomeric nucleophiles such as C1 stannanes can be converted into anomeric radicals by merging Cu(I) catalysis with blue light irradiation to achieve highly stereoselective C(sp3)-S cross-coupling reactions. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the C-S bond-forming step occurs via the transfer of the anomeric radical directly to a sulfur electrophile bound to Cu(II) species. This pathway complements a radical chain observed for photochemical metal-free conditions where a disulfide initiator can be activated by a Lewis base additive. Both strategies utilize anomeric nucleophiles as efficient radical donors and achieve a switch from an ionic to a radical pathway. Taken together, the stability of glycosyl nucleophiles, a broad substrate scope, and high anomeric selectivities observed for the thermal and photochemical protocols make this novel C-S cross coupling a practical tool for late-stage glycodiversification of bioactive natural products and drug candidates.	0
Abstract2class: The role of cell type-specific responses in IFN-β therapy of multiple sclerosis Abstract: The mechanism of IFN-β therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is not well understood, but induction of apoptosis in specific leukocyte subsets is likely to be important. Enhanced expression of TNFSF10 or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mRNA in unseparated leukocytes has been put forward as a therapeutic response marker, but it is unclear which leukocyte subsets express TRAIL. We investigated the basis of TRAIL expression in response to IFN-β by studying activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in different leukocyte subsets of patients with RRMS. Monocytes, B cells, and T cells showed substantial differences in the activation of p38 and the STATs in response to i.m. injection of IFN-β1a or stimulation in vitro. Induction of cell-surface TRAIL, analyzed in nine leukocyte subsets, was observed only on monocytes and granulocytes and correlated with the activation of p38 and/or NF-κB in these subsets only, in agreement with previous work in fibroblasts showing that the induction of TRAIL in response to IFN-β depends on the activation of p38 and NF-κB as well as STATs 1 and 2. We propose that, in myeloid cells, the differential activation of p38 and NF-κB and induction of TRAIL, which sensitizes cells to apoptosis, can help to explain differences in responsiveness to IFN-β therapy among patients with RRMS and, furthermore, that such differential patterns of activation and expression may also be important in understanding the therapeutic responses to IFN-α/β in hepatitis and cancer.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of a gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythraeus) which is involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: A 7.3 kbp DNA fragment, encompassing the erythromycin (Em) resistance gene (ermE) and a portion of the gene cluster encoding the biosynthetic genes for erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) has been cloned in Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ702, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined using a modified dideoxy chain-termination procedure. In particular, we have examined the region immediately 5' of the resistance determinant, where the tandem promoters for ermE overlap the promoters for a divergently transcribed coding sequence (ORF). Disruption of this ORF using an integrational pIJ702-based plasmid vector gave mutants which were specifically blocked in erythromycin biosynthesis, and which accumulated 3-O-alpha-L-mycarosylerythronolide B: this behaviour is identical to that of previously described eryC1 mutants. The eryC1-gene product, a protein of subunit Mr 39,200, is therefore involved either as a structural or as a regulatory gene in the formation of the deoxyamino-sugar desosamine or in its attachment to the macrolide ring.	1
Abstract2class: Anticancer and multidrug resistance-reversal effects of solanidine analogs synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate Abstract: A set of solanidine analogs with antiproliferative properties were recently synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate, which occurs in Nature. The aim of the present study was an in vitro characterization of their antiproliferative action and an investigation of their multidrug resistance-reversal activity on cancer cells. Six of the compounds elicited the accumulation of a hypodiploid population of HeLa cells, indicating their apoptosis-inducing character, and another one caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The most effective agents inhibited the activity of topoisomerase I, as evidenced by plasmid supercoil relaxation assays. One of the most potent analogs down-regulated the expression of cell-cycle related genes at the mRNA level, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and induced growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45 alpha. Some of the investigated compounds inhibited the ABCB1 transporter and caused rhodamine-123 accumulation in murine lymphoma cells transfected by human MDR1 gene, expressing the efflux pump (L5178). One of the most active agents in this aspect potentiated the antiproliferative action of doxorubicin without substantial intrinsic cytostatic capacity. The current results indicate that the modified solanidine skeleton is a suitable substrate for the rational design and synthesis of further innovative drug candidates with anticancer activities.	0
Abstract2class: Synthetic biology based construction of biological activity-related library of fungal decalin-containing diterpenoid pyrones Abstract: A synthetic biology method based on heterologous biosynthesis coupled with genome mining is a promising approach for increasing the opportunities to rationally access natural product with novel structures and biological activities through total biosynthesis and combinatorial biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of the synthetic biology method to explore biological activity-related chemical space through the comprehensive heterologous biosynthesis of fungal decalin-containing diterpenoid pyrones (DDPs). Genome mining reveals putative DDP biosynthetic gene clusters distributed in five fungal genera. In addition, we design extended DDP pathways by combinatorial biosynthesis. In total, ten DDP pathways, including five native pathways, four extended pathways and one shunt pathway, are heterologously reconstituted in a genetically tractable heterologous host, Aspergillus oryzae, resulting in the production of 22 DDPs, including 15 new analogues. We also demonstrate the advantage of expanding the diversity of DDPs to probe various bioactive molecules through a wide range of biological evaluations.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthesis: identification and characterization of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides (1-3) represent a structurally unique class of antibiotics, acting as specific inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. L-49973 and the development of a genetic manipulation system for Streptomyces sp. L-49973. The biosynthetic gene cluster for the tetrapeptide antibiotic GE81112 (getA-N) was identified within a 61.7-kb region comprising 29 open reading frames (open reading frames), 14 of which were assigned to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis revealed the GE81112 cluster to consist of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding incomplete di-domain NRPS modules and a single free standing NRPS domain as well as genes encoding other biosynthetic and modifying proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in GE81112 biosynthesis was confirmed by inactivating the NRPS gene getE resulting in a GE81112 production abolished mutant. In addition, we characterized the NRPS A-domains from the pathway by expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro enzymatic assays. The previously unknown stereochemistry of most chiral centers in GE81112 was established from a combined chemical and biosynthetic approach. Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for GE81112 biosynthesis. The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising antibiotic compounds by genetic engineering.	1

Abstract2class: Heterologous Expression of the Unusual Terreazepine Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Reveals a Promising Approach for Identifying New Chemical Scaffolds Abstract: Advances in genome sequencing have revitalized natural product discovery efforts, revealing the untapped biosynthetic potential of fungi. While the volume of genomic data continues to expand, discovery efforts are slowed due to the time-consuming nature of experiments required to characterize new molecules. To direct efforts toward uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters most likely to encode novel chemical scaffolds, we took advantage of comparative metabolomics and heterologous gene expression using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs). By linking mass spectral profiles with structural clues provided by FAC-encoded gene clusters, we targeted a compound originating from an unusual gene cluster containing an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). With this approach, we isolate and characterize R and S forms of the new molecule terreazepine, which contains a novel chemical scaffold resulting from cyclization of the IDO-supplied kynurenine. The discovery of terreazepine illustrates that FAC-based approaches targeting unusual biosynthetic machinery provide a promising avenue forward for targeted discovery of novel scaffolds and their biosynthetic enzymes, and it also represents another example of a biosynthetic gene cluster "repurposing" a primary metabolic enzyme to diversify its secondary metabolite arsenal.IMPORTANCE Here, we provide evidence that Aspergillus terreus encodes a biosynthetic gene cluster containing a repurposed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) dedicated to secondary metabolite synthesis. The discovery of this neofunctionalized IDO not only enabled discovery of a new compound with an unusual chemical scaffold but also provided insight into the numerous strategies fungi employ for diversifying and protecting themselves against secondary metabolites. The observations in this study set the stage for further in-depth studies into the function of duplicated IDOs present in fungal biosynthetic gene clusters and presents a strategy for accessing the biosynthetic potential of gene clusters containing duplicated primary metabolic genes.	1
Abstract2class: Reciprocal Regulation of ERα and ERβ Stability and Activity by Diptoindonesin G Abstract: ERβ is regarded as a "tumor suppressor" in breast cancer due to its anti-proliferative effects. However, unlike ERα, ERβ has not been developed as a therapeutic target in breast cancer due to loss of ERβ in aggressive cancers. In a small-molecule library screen for ERβ stabilizers, we identified Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), which significantly increases ERβ protein stability while decreasing ERα protein levels. Dip G enhances the transcription and anti-proliferative activities of ERβ, while attenuating the transcription and proliferative effects of ERα. Further investigation revealed that instead of targeting ER, Dip G targets the CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase shared by ERα and ERβ. Thus, Dip G is a dual-functional moiety that reciprocally controls ERα and ERβ protein stability and activities via an indirect mechanism. The ERβ stabilization effects of Dip G may enable the development of ERβ-targeted therapies for human breast cancers.	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptional organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli K30 group 1 capsule biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster Abstract: Escherichia coli group 1 capsules are important virulence determinants, yet little is known about the transcriptional organization or regulation of their biosynthetic (cps) operons. Transcription of the prototype serotype K30 cluster is modulated by the JUMPStart-RfaH antitermination mechanism, with the cps promoter being localized to a region immediately upstream of the JUMPStart sequence. A putative stem-loop structure located within the K30 cps cluster separates conserved genes with products that are required for surface expression of capsule from serotype-specific genes encoding enzymes for polymer repeat-unit synthesis and polymerization. This putative stem-loop structure significantly reduces transcription in a termination-probe vector and may contribute to differential expression of the cps genes. Previous work indicated that increased amounts of group 1 capsular polysaccharide synthesis resulted from the overexpression of the Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) proteins. However, neither overexpression of the transcriptional activator RcsB nor an rcsB::aadA chromosomal insertion altered the level of transcription measured by cps::lacZ fusions. In the group 1 strains examined, an RcsAB box was found immediately upstream of galF, a gene involved in the production of sugar nucleotide precursors. Overexpression of RcsB was found to result in a threefold increase in transcription of a galF::lacZ chromosomal fusion. Moreover, overexpression of GalF gave rise to a two- to threefold increase in cell-free as well as cell-associated capsule, without affecting cps::lacZ activity. These results indicate that transcription of the E. coli group 1 capsule cluster itself is not regulated by the Rcs system and may, in fact, be constitutive. However, the Rcs system can potentially influence levels of capsular polysaccharide production by increasing galF transcription and influencing the available pool of biosynthetic precursors.	1
Abstract2class: Multiple biosynthetic and uptake systems mediate siderophore-dependent iron acquisition in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877 Abstract: Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition has been well studied in many bacterial pathogens because it contributes to virulence. In contrast, siderophore-mediated iron acquisition by saprophytic bacteria has received relatively little attention. The independent identification of the des and cch gene clusters that direct production of the tris-hydroxamate ferric iron-chelators desferrioxamine E and coelichelin, respectively, which could potentially act as siderophores in the saprophyte Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), has recently been reported. Here it is shown that the des cluster also directs production of desferrioxamine B in S. coelicolor and that very similar des and cch clusters direct production of desferrioxamines E and B, and coelichelin, respectively, in Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877. Sequence analyses of the des and cch clusters suggest that components of ferric-siderophore uptake systems are also encoded within each cluster. The construction and analysis of a series of mutants of S. coelicolor lacking just biosynthetic genes or both the biosynthetic and siderophore uptake genes from the des and cch clusters demonstrated that coelichelin and desferrioxamines E and B all function as siderophores in this organism and that at least one of these metabolites is required for growth under defined conditions even in the presence of significant quantities of ferric iron. These experiments also demonstrated that a third siderophore uptake system must be present in S. coelicolor, in addition to the two encoded within the cch and des clusters, which show selectivity for coelichelin and desferrioxamine E, respectively. The ability of the S. coelicolor mutants to utilize a range of exogenous xenosiderophores for iron acquisition was also examined, showing that the third siderophore-iron transport system has broad specificity for tris-hydroxamate-containing siderophores. Together, these results define a complex system of multiple biosynthetic and uptake pathways for siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in S. coelicolor and S. ambofaciens.	1
Abstract2class: Xanthomonins I-III: a new class of lasso peptides with a seven-residue macrolactam ring Abstract: Lasso peptides belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. Their common distinguishing feature is an N-terminal macrolactam ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail. This lasso fold is maintained through steric interactions. The isolation and characterization of xanthomonins I-III, the first lasso peptides featuring macrolactam rings consisting of only seven amino acids, is now presented. The crystal structure of xanthomonin I and the NMR structure of xanthomonin II were also determined. A total of 25 variants of xanthomonin II were generated to probe different aspects of the biosynthesis, stability, and fold maintenance. These mutational studies reveal the limits such a small ring imposes on the threading and show that every plug amino acid larger than serine is able to maintain a heat-stable lasso fold in the xanthomonin II scaffold.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of phantasmidine Abstract: Reaction of 6-chloro-2-fluoro-3-pyridineacetamide with 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclobutene in ether saturated with hydrogen chloride afforded the keto amide in 85% yield. In the key step, treatment of the keto amide with aqueous KOH in t-BuOH resulted in a tandem intramolecular aldol reaction-intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution sequence to give the tetracylic lactam in 46% yield. Reduction of the lactam with BH(3) in THF gave phantasmidine in 67% yield.	0
Abstract2class: Antibiotic streptolydigin requires noncatalytic Mg2+ for binding to RNA polymerase Abstract: Multisubunit RNA polymerase, an enzyme that accomplishes transcription in all living organisms, is a potent target for antibiotics. The antibiotic streptolydigin inhibits RNA polymerase by sequestering the active center in a catalytically inactive conformation. Here, we show that binding of streptolydigin to RNA polymerase strictly depends on a noncatalytic magnesium ion which is likely chelated by the aspartate of the bridge helix of the active center. Substitutions of this aspartate may explain different sensitivities of bacterial RNA polymerases to streptolydigin. These results provide the first evidence for the role of noncatalytic magnesium ions in the functioning of RNA polymerase and suggest new routes for the modification of existing and the design of new inhibitors of transcription.	0
Abstract2class: Prevention of peroxidative stress in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet by supplementing with a fermented bovine milk whey preparation: effect of lactic acid and beta-lactoglobulin on the antiperoxidative action Abstract: We examined the antiperoxidative properties of a fermented bovine milk whey preparation in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet and identified the active principle in the preparation. An exogenous supply of either lactic acid or an amino acid mixture simulated the unfermented whey proteins to prevent red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis and to lower liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The supply of either whey proteins or beta-lactoglobulin resulted in an increase in liver GSH and prevented iron-mediated lipoprotein peroxidation. These protein effects were reproduced in rats orally administered with either GSH or its precursor, gamma-glutamylcysteine. The amount of TBARS formed during in vitro lipoprotein peroxidation were positively correlated with liver TBARS. These results suggest that fermented milk products containing lactic acid and bovine milk whey proteins can ameliorate peroxidative stress in tissues subjected to vitamin E deficiency.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering of Streptomyces platensis MA7339 for overproduction of platencin and congeners Abstract: Platensimycin (1) and platencin (2) are novel antibiotic leads against multidrug resistant pathogens. The production of 2 in Streptomyces platensis MA7339 is under the control of ptnR1, a GntR-like transcriptional regulator. Inactivating ptnR1 afforded S. platensis MA7339 mutant strain SB12600 that overproduces 2 at a titer approximately 100-fold greater than that from the wild-type strain and accumulates platencin A(1) (3) and eight new congeners, platencins A(2)-A(9) (4-11). The isolation, structural elucidation, and antibacterial activity of 4-11, in comparison to 1-3, are described.	1
Abstract2class: Enzymatic conversion of aclacinomycin A to Y by a specific oxidoreductase in Streptomyces Abstract: A specific oxidoreductase converting aclacinomycin A to a new analog, aclacinomycin Y, was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture filtrate of aclacinomycin-producing microorganisms. The isolated enzyme was a weakly acidic protein (isoelectric point, 5.9) with a molecular weight of about 72,000. The enzymatic reaction requires molecular oxygen and has a pH optimum at 5.5. The enzyme catalyzed an oxidation of the terminal sugar, L-cinerulose, of the trisaccharide moiety of aclacinomycin A to L-aculose (2,3,6-trideoxyhex-2-enopyranos-4-ulose) with removal of two electrons. Studies of substrate specificity revealed that the enzyme is an oxidoreductase capable of modifying anthracyclic triglycosides by oxidizing their terminal sugars.	0
Abstract2class: Impact of mammalian cell culture conditions on monoclonal antibody charge heterogeneity: an accessory monitoring tool for process development Abstract: Recombinant monoclonal antibodies are predominantly produced in mammalian cell culture bioprocesses. Post-translational modifications affect the micro-heterogeneity of the product and thereby influence important quality attributes, such as stability, solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The analysis of the surface charge distribution of monoclonal antibodies provides aggregated information about these modifications. In this work, we established a direct injection pH gradient cation exchange chromatography method, which determines charge heterogeneity from cell culture supernatant without any purification steps. This tool was further applied to monitor processes that were performed under certain process conditions. Concretely, we were able to provide insights into charge variant formation during a fed-batch process of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, in turn producing a monoclonal antibody under varying temperatures and glucose feed strategies. Glucose concentration impacted the total emergence of acidic variants, whereas the variation of basic species was mainly dependent on process temperature. The formation rates of acidic species were described with a second-order reaction, where a temperature increase favored the conversion. This platform method will aid as a sophisticated optimization tool for mammalian cell culture processes. It provides a quality fingerprint for the produced mAb, which can be tested, compared to the desired target and confirmed early in the process chain.	0
Abstract2class: Posttranscriptional regulation by light of the steady-state levels of mature B800-850 light-harvesting complexes in Rhodobacter capsulatus Abstract: Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a variety of responses to changes in light intensity, including differential biosynthesis of chlorophyll-protein complexes. Cultures of Rhodobacter capsulatus grown anaerobically with a low intensity of light (2 W/m2) contained about four times as much B800-850 light-harvesting complex as cells grown under high light intensity (140 W/m2). The mRNA transcripts encoding B800-850 beta and alpha peptides were analyzed by Northern blot (RNA blot), S1 nuclease protection, and capping with guanylyl transferase. It was found that the steady-state levels of B800-850 mRNAs in high-light-grown cultures were about four times as great as in cells grown under low light intensity. Therefore, the lesser amounts of mature B800-850 peptide gene products found in cells grown with high light intensity are the result of a posttranscriptional regulatory process. It was also found that there are two polycistronic messages encoding the B800-850 peptides. These messages share a common 3' terminus but differ in their 5'-end segments as a result of transcription initiation at two discrete sites. Moreover, the half-lives of B800-850 mRNAs were about 10 min in cells grown with high light and approximately 19 min in cultures grown with low light. It is concluded that there must be more frequent initiations of transcription of B800-850 genes in cells grown with high light than in those grown with low light, and that the relative amounts of B800-850 complexes under these conditions are controlled by a translational or posttranslational mechanism.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for kutznerides Abstract: Kutznerides, actinomycete-derived cyclic depsipetides, consist of six nonproteinogenic residues, including a highly oxygenated tricyclic hexahydropyrroloindole, a chlorinated piperazic acid, 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-glycine, a beta-branched-hydroxy acid, and 3-hydroxy glutamic acid, for which biosynthetic logic has not been elucidated. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster for the kutzneride family, identified by degenerate primer PCR for halogenating enzymes postulated to be involved in biosyntheses of these unusual monomers. The 56-kb gene cluster encodes a series of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules distributed over three proteins and a variety of tailoring enzymes, including both mononuclear nonheme iron and two flavin-dependent halogenases, and an array of oxygen transfer catalysts. The sequence and organization of NRPS genes support incorporation of the unusual monomer units into the densely functionalized scaffold of kutznerides. Our work provides insight into the formation of this intriguing class of compounds and provides a foundation for elucidating the timing and mechanisms of their biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Microbiota of the Gut-Lymph Node Axis: Depletion of Mucosa-Associated Segmented Filamentous Bacteria and Enrichment of Methanobrevibacter by Colistin Sulfate and Linco-Spectin in Pigs Abstract: Microorganisms are translocated from the gut to lymphatic tissues via immune cells, thereby challenging and training the mammalian immune system. Antibiotics alter the gut microbiome and consecutively might also affect the corresponding translocation processes, resulting in an imbalanced state between the intestinal microbiota and the host. Hence, understanding the variant effects of antibiotics on the microbiome of gut-associated tissues is of vital importance for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and animal health. In the present study, we analyzed the microbiome of (i) pig feces, ileum, and ileocecal lymph nodes under the influence of antibiotics (Linco-Spectin and Colistin sulfate) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for high-resolution community profiling and (ii) ileocecal lymph nodes in more detail with two additional methodological approaches, i.e., cultivation of ileocecal lymph node samples and (iii) metatranscriptome sequencing of a single lymph node sample. Supplementation of medicated feed showed a local effect on feces and ileal mucosa-associated microbiomes. Pigs that received antibiotics harbored significantly reduced amounts of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) along the ileal mucosa (p = 0.048; 199.17-fold change) and increased amounts of Methanobrevibacter, a methanogenic Euryarchaeote in fecal samples (p = 0.005; 20.17-fold change) compared to the control group. Analysis of the porcine ileocecal lymph node microbiome exposed large differences between the viable and the dead fraction of microorganisms and the microbiome was altered to a lesser extent by antibiotics compared with feces and ileum. The core microbiome of lymph nodes was constituted mainly of Proteobacteria. RNA-sequencing of a single lymph node sample unveiled transcripts responsible for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as protein turnover, DNA replication and signal transduction. The study presented here is the first comparative study of microbial communities in feces, ileum, and its associated ileocecal lymph nodes. In each analyzed site, we identified specific phylotypes susceptible to antibiotic treatment that can have profound impacts on the host physiological and immunological state, or even on global biogeochemical cycles. Our results indicate that pathogenic bacteria, e.g., enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, could escape antibiotic treatment by translocating to lymph nodes. In general ileocecal lymph nodes harbor a more diverse and active community of microorganisms than previously assumed.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and analysis of the gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of paenibactin, a catecholate siderophore produced by Paenibacillus elgii B69 Abstract: Bacteria belonging to the genus Paenibacillus are recognized as rich sources of bioactive natural products. To date, there are few characterized siderophores from this genus. Here, through genome analysis, we identified a non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster (pae) responsible for siderophore assembly in Paenibacillus elgii B69. The 12.8 kb gene cluster comprises six open reading frames encoding proteins similar to the components of the bacillibactin biosynthetic machinery and bacillibactin esterase. To examine the product of the pae gene cluster, we cultured P. elgii B69 in iron-deficient medium for siderophore expression. A novel siderophore structurally similar to bacillibactin, designated paenibactin, was purified and characterized. Its structure was determined as a cyclic trimeric lactone of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-alanine-threonine. The involvement of the pae gene cluster in paenibactin biosynthesis was confirmed by the biochemical assay of adenylation domain specificity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the pae gene cluster evolves from an ancestral bacillibactin biosynthetic gene cluster via sequence and phylogenetic analyses. The structural difference between paenibactin and bacillibactin may stem from a mutation-induced change in the adenylation domain specificity. Based on these findings and published models for bacillibactin, we proposed models for paenibactin biosynthesis, ferric-paenibactin uptake and paenibactin-bounded iron release.	1
Abstract2class: Feed-forward regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis in Microbispora corallina Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. Microbisporicin is a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina and contains unique chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin encodes several putative regulatory proteins, including, uniquely, an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor, σ(MibX), a likely cognate anti-σ factor, MibW, and a potential helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein, MibR. Here we examine the roles of these proteins in regulating microbisporicin biosynthesis. S1 nuclease protection assays were used to determine transcriptional start sites in the microbisporicin gene cluster and confirmed the presence of the likely ECF sigma factor -10 and -35 sequences in five out of six promoters. In contrast, the promoter of mibA, encoding the microbisporicin prepropeptide, has a typical Streptomyces vegetative sigma factor consensus sequence. The ECF sigma factor σ(MibX) was shown to interact with the putative anti-sigma factor MibW in Escherichia coli using bacterial two-hybrid analysis. σ(MibX) autoregulates its own expression but does not directly regulate expression of mibA. On the basis of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) data, we propose a model for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin in which MibR functions as an essential master regulator and the ECF sigma factor/anti-sigma factor pair, σ(MibX)/MibW, induces feed-forward biosynthesis of microbisporicin and producer immunity.	1
Abstract2class: Effect of isotopically sensitive branching on product distribution for pentalenene synthase: support for a mechanism predicted by quantum chemistry Abstract: Mechanistic proposals for the carbocation cascade reaction leading to the tricyclic sesquiterpene pentalenene are assessed in light of the results of isotopically sensitive branching experiments with the H309A mutant of pentalenene synthase. These experimental results support a mechanism for pentalenene formation involving a 7-protoilludyl cation whose intermediacy was first predicted using quantum-chemical calculations.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering deazapurine biosynthesis: pathway for pyrrolopyrimidine nucleosides toyocamycin and sangivamycin Abstract: Pyrrolopyrimidine nucleosides analogs, collectively referred to as deazapurines, are an important class of structurally diverse compounds found in a wide variety of biological niches. In this report, a cluster of genes from Streptomyces rimosus (ATCC 14673) involved in production of the deazapurine antibiotics sangivamycin and toyocamycin was identified. The cluster includes toyocamycin nitrile hydratase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of toyocamycin to sangivamycin. In addition to this rare nitrile hydratase, the cluster encodes a GTP cyclohydrolase I, linking the biosynthesis of deazapurines to folate biosynthesis, and a set of purine salvage/biosynthesis genes, which presumably convert the guanine moiety from GTP to the adenine-like deazapurine base found in toyocamycin and sangivamycin. The gene cluster presented here could potentially serve as a model to allow identification of deazapurine biosynthetic pathways in other bacterial species.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of colabomycin E, a new manumycin-family metabolite, involves an unusual chain-length factor Abstract: Colabomycin E is a new member of the manumycin-type metabolites produced by the strain Streptomyces aureus SOK1/5-04 and identified by genetic screening from a library of streptomycete strains. The structures of colabomycin E and accompanying congeners were resolved. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Streptomyces lividans. Bioinformatic analysis and mutagenic studies identified components of the biosynthetic pathway that are involved in the formation of both polyketide chains. Recombinant polyketide synthases (PKSs) assembled from the components of colabomycin E and asukamycin biosynthetic routes catalyzing the biosynthesis of "lower" carbon chains were constructed and expressed in S. aureus SOK1/5-04 ΔcolC11-14 deletion mutant. Analysis of the metabolites produced by recombinant strains provided evidence that in both biosynthetic pathways the length of the lower carbon chain is controlled by an unusual chain-length factor supporting biosynthesis either of a triketide in asukamycin or of a tetraketide in colabomycin E. Biological activity assays indicated that colabomycin E significantly inhibited IL-1β release from THP-1 cells and might thus potentially act as an anti-inflammatory agent.	1
Abstract2class: Difficidin and bacilysin produced by plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are efficient in controlling fire blight disease Abstract: Representatives of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were shown to possess biocontrol activity against fire blight, a serious disease of orchard trees caused by Erwinia amylovora. Genome analysis of B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 identified gene clusters responsible for synthesis of several polyketide compounds with antibacterial action. We show here that the antibacterial polyketides difficidin and to a minor extent bacillaene act efficiently against E. amylovora. Surprisingly, a mutant strain blocked in the production of difficidin (CH8 Deltadfn) inhibited growth of E. amylovora and suppressed fire blight disease nearly in the same range as the wild type. In addition, a sfp mutant (CH3 Deltasfp) unable to synthesize non-ribosomally lipopeptides and polyketides did still suppress growth of E. amylovora, suggesting that besides action of polyketides another antagonistic principle exist. A double mutant (RS06 Deltasfp Deltabac) devoid in polyketide and bacilysin synthesis was unable to suppress growth of E. amylovora indicating that the additional inhibitory effect is due to production of bacilysin, a dipeptide whose synthesis does not depend on Sfp. We propose to use B. amyloliquefaciens strains with enhanced synthesis of difficidin and/or bacilysin for development of biocontrol agents efficient against fire blight disease.	1
Abstract2class: Revisiting and revising the purinosome Abstract: Some metabolic pathway enzymes are known to organize into multi-enzyme complexes for reasons of catalytic efficiency, metabolite channeling, and other advantages of compartmentalization. It has long been an appealing prospect that de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes form such a complex, termed the "purinosome." Early work characterizing these enzymes garnered scarce but encouraging evidence for its existence. Recent investigations led to the discovery in human cell lines of purinosome bodies-cytoplasmic puncta containing transfected purine biosynthesis enzymes, which were argued to correspond to purinosomes. New discoveries challenge both the functional and physiological relevance of these bodies in favor of protein aggregation.	0
Abstract2class: Prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis by rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Mechanism of stimulation by angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin Abstract: The mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis was investigated in rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin stimulated arachidonic acid release and subsequent prostaglandin biosynthesis. Indomethacin completely inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis without affecting arachidonic acid release. Mepacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited arachidonic acid release without affecting subsequent synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Our studies suggest that arachidonic acid release via hormone-activated phospholipase or acylhydrolase (or both) is the mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis.	0
Abstract2class: On the nutritional and therapeutic effects of ketone body D-β-hydroxybutyrate Abstract: D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-3HB), a monomer of microbial polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), is also a natural ketone body produced during carbohydrate deprivation to provide energy to the body cells, heart, and brain. In recent years, increasing evidence demonstrates that D-3HB can induce pleiotropic effects on the human body which are highly beneficial for improving physical and metabolic health. Conventional ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketone salts (KS) and esters (KE) have been used to increase serum D-3HB level. However, strict adaptation to the KD was often associated with poor patient compliance, while the ingestion of KS caused gastrointestinal distresses due to excessive consumption of minerals. As for ingestion of KE, subsequent degradation is required before releasing D-3HB for absorption, making these methods somewhat inferior. This review provides novel insights into a biologically synthesized D-3HB (D-3-hydroxybutyric acid) which can induce a faster increase in plasma D-3HB compared to the use of KD, KS, or KE. It also emphasizes on the most recent applications of D-3HB in different fields, including its use in improving exercise performance and in treating metabolic or age-related diseases. Ketones may become a fourth micro-nutrient that is necessary to the human body along with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Indeed, D-3HB being a small molecule with multiple signaling pathways within the body exhibits paramount importance in mitigating metabolic and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, specific dose-response relationships and safety margins of using D-3HB remain to be elucidated with more research. KEY POINTS: • D-3HB induces pleiotropic effects on physical and metabolic health. • Exogenous ketone supplements are more effective than ketogenic diet. • d-3HB as a ketone supplement has long-term healthy impact.	0
Abstract2class: MS/MS-based networking and peptidogenomics guided genome mining revealed the stenothricin gene cluster in Streptomyces roseosporus Abstract: Most (75%) of the anti-infectives that save countless lives and enormously improve quality of life originate from microbes found in nature. Herein, we described a global visualization of the detectable molecules produced from a single microorganism, which we define as the 'molecular network' of that organism, followed by studies to characterize the cellular effects of antibacterial molecules. We demonstrate that Streptomyces roseosporus produces at least four non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived molecular families and their gene subnetworks (daptomycin, arylomycin, napsamycin and stenothricin) were identified with different modes of action. A number of previously unreported analogs involving truncation, glycosylation, hydrolysis and biosynthetic intermediates and/or shunt products were also captured and visualized by creation of a map through MS/MS networking. The diversity of antibacterial compounds produced by S. roseosporus highlights the importance of developing new approaches to characterize the molecular capacity of an organism in a more global manner. This allows one to more deeply interrogate the biosynthetic capacities of microorganisms with the goal to streamline the discovery pipeline for biotechnological applications in agriculture and medicine. This is a contribution to a special issue to honor Chris Walsh's amazing career.	1
Abstract2class: Imaging LDL receptor oligomerization during endocytosis using a co-internalization assay Abstract: Methods to probe receptor oligomerization are useful to understand the molecular mechanisms of receptor signaling. Here we report a fluorescence imaging method to determine receptor oligomerization state in living cells during endocytic internalization. The wild-type receptor is co-expressed with an internalization-defective mutant, and the internalization kinetics of each are independently monitored. If the receptor internalizes as an oligomer, then the wild-type and mutant isoforms will mutually influence each others' trafficking properties, causing co-internalization of the mutant or co-retention of the wild-type at the cell surface. Using this approach, we found that the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor internalizes as an oligomer into cells, both in the presence and absence of LDL ligand. The internalization kinetics of the wild-type receptor are not changed by LDL binding. We also found that the oligomerization domain of the LDL receptor is located in its cytoplasmic tail.	0
Abstract2class: In Lactobacillus plantarum, carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized by two carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases (CPS): carbon dioxide differentiates the arginine-repressed from the pyrimidine-regulated CPS Abstract: Carbamoyl phosphate (CP) is an intermediate in pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) contains a small amidotransferase subunit (GLN) that hydrolyzes glutamine and transfers ammonia to the large synthetase subunit (SYN), where CP biosynthesis occurs in the presence of ATP and CO(2). Lactobacillus plantarum, a lactic acid bacterium, harbors a pyrimidine-inhibited CPS (CPS-P; Elagöz et al., Gene 182:37-43, 1996) and an arginine-repressed CPS (CPS-A). Sequencing has shown that CPS-A is encoded by carA (GLN) and carB (SYN). Transcriptional studies have demonstrated that carB is transcribed both monocistronically and in the carAB arginine-repressed operon. CP biosynthesis in L. plantarum was studied with three mutants (DeltaCPS-P, DeltaCPS-A, and double deletion). In the absence of both CPSs, auxotrophy for pyrimidines and arginine was observed. CPS-P produced enough CP for both pathways. In CO(2)-enriched air but not in ordinary air, CPS-A provided CP only for arginine biosynthesis. Therefore, the uracil sensitivity observed in prototrophic wild-type L. plantarum without CO(2) enrichment may be due to the low affinity of CPS-A for its substrate CO(2) or to regulation of the CP pool by the cellular CO(2)/bicarbonate level.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the halogenated mycotoxin aspirochlorine in koji mold involves a cryptic amino acid conversion Abstract: Aspirochlorine (1) is an epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxin produced from koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae), which has been used in the oriental cuisine for over two millennia. Considering its potential risk for food safety, we have elucidated the molecular basis of aspirochlorine biosynthesis. By a combination of genetic and chemical analyses we found the acl gene locus and identified the key role of AclH as a chlorinase. Stable isotope labeling, biotransformation, and mutational experiments, analysis of intermediates and an in vitro adenylation domain assay gave totally unexpected insights into the acl pathway: Instead of one Phe and one Gly, two Phe units are assembled by an iterative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS, AclP), followed by halogenation and an unprecedented Phe to Gly amino acid conversion. Biological assays showed that both amino acid transformations are required to confer cytotoxicity and antifungal activity to the mycotoxin.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of a natural polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound, furaquinocin A: identification and heterologous expression of the gene cluster Abstract: Furaquinocin (FQ) A, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988, is a natural polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound that exhibits a potent antitumor activity. As a first step toward understanding the biosynthetic machinery of this unique and pharmaceutically useful compound, we have cloned an FQ A biosynthetic gene cluster by taking advantage of the fact that an isoprenoid biosynthetic gene cluster generally exists in flanking regions of the mevalonate (MV) pathway gene cluster in actinomycetes. Interestingly, Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988 was the first example of a microorganism equipped with two distinct mevalonate pathway gene clusters. We were able to localize a 25-kb DNA region that harbored FQ A biosynthetic genes (fur genes) in both the upstream and downstream regions of one of the MV pathway gene clusters (MV2) by using heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK23. This was the first example of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of a polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound. We have also confirmed that four genes responsible for viguiepinol [3-hydroxypimara-9(11),15-diene] biosynthesis exist in the upstream region of the other MV pathway gene cluster (MV1), which had previously been cloned from strain KO-3988. This was the first example of prokaryotic enzymes with these biosynthetic functions. By phylogenetic analysis, these two MV pathway clusters were identified as probably being independently distributed in strain KO-3988 (orthologs), rather than one cluster being generated by the duplication of the other cluster (paralogs).	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of the Indole Diterpene Gene Cluster for Biosynthesis of the Epoxy-Janthitrems in Epichloë Endophytes Abstract: Epoxy-janthitrems are a class of indole diterpenes with structural similarity to lolitrem B. Two taxa of asexual Epichloë endophytes have been reported to produce epoxy-janthitrems, LpTG-3 (Lolium perenne Taxonomic Group 3; e.g., NEA12) and LpTG-4 (e.g., E1). Epichloë epoxy-janthitrems are not well understood, the biosynthetic pathway and associated gene complement have not been described and while the literature suggests they are associated with superior protection against pasture insect pests and are tremorgenic in grazing mammals, these properties have not been confirmed using isolated and purified compounds. Whole genome sequence analysis was used to identify candidate genes for epoxy-janthitrem biosynthesis that are unique to epoxy-janthitrem producing strains of Epichloë. A gene, jtmD, was identified with homology to aromatic prenyl transferases involved in synthesis of indole diterpenes. The location of the epoxy-janthitrem biosynthesis gene cluster (JTM locus) was determined in the assembled nuclear genomes of NEA12 and E1. The JTM locus contains cluster 1 and cluster 2 of the lolitrem B biosynthesis gene cluster (LTM locus), as well as four genes jtmD, jtmO, jtm01, and jtm02 that are unique to Epichloë spp. that produce epoxy-janthitrems. Expression of each of the genes identified was confirmed using transcriptome analysis of perennial ryegrass-NEA12 and perennial ryegrass-E1 symbiota. Sequence analysis confirmed the genes are functionally similar to those involved in biosynthesis of related indole diterpene compounds. RNAi silencing of jtmD and in planta assessment in host-endophyte associations confirms the role of jtmD in epoxy-janthitrem production. Using LCMS/MS technologies, a biosynthetic pathway for the production of epoxy-janthitrems I-IV in Epichloë endophytes is proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Genome-Mining-Based Discovery of the Cyclic Peptide Tolypamide and TolF, a Ser/Thr Forward O-Prenyltransferase Abstract: Cyanobactins comprise a widespread group of peptide metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that are often diversified by post-translational prenylation. Several enzymes have been identified in cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways that carry out chemically diverse prenylation reactions, representing a resource for the discovery of post-translational alkylating agents. Here, genome mining was used to identify orphan cyanobactin prenyltransferases, leading to the isolation of tolypamide from the freshwater cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. The structure of tolypamide was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, degradation, and enzymatic total synthesis. Tolypamide is forward-prenylated on a threonine residue, representing an unprecedented post-translational modification. Biochemical characterization of the cognate enzyme TolF revealed a prenyltransferase with strict selectivity for forward O-prenylation of serine or threonine but with relaxed substrate selectivity for flanking peptide sequences. Since cyanobactin pathways often exhibit exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, these enzymes represent robust tools for synthetic biology.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the sisomicin biosynthetic gene cluster from Micromonospora inyoensis Abstract: Micromonospora inyoensis produces sisomicin (Sm), an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The gene cluster of sisomicin biosynthesis spanning ca. 47 kb consists of 37 ORFs encoding various proteins for sisomicin biosynthesis, regulation, resistance and transport. The comparative genetic studies on the biosynthetic genes of sisomicin and gentamicin (Gm) reveal a similar biosynthetic route and provide a framework for the future biosynthetic studies.	1
Abstract2class: Endocytic properties of the M-type 180-kDa receptor for secretory phospholipases A2 Abstract: Endocytic properties of the M-type 180-kDa receptor for secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) were first investigated in rabbit myocytes that express it at high levels. Internalization of the receptor was shown to be clathrin-coated pit-mediated, rapid (ke = 0.1 min-1), and ligand-independent. The signal sequence for internalization was then identified upon transient and stable expression of various receptor constructs with mutated cytoplasmic sequences. Analysis of the internalization efficiency of the mutants suggested that the NSYY motif encodes the major endocytic signal, with the distal tyrosine residue playing the key role. Amino acid substitutions at the putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site of the receptor did not affect internalization. A chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the rabbit sPLA2 receptor and of the cytoplasmic domain of the structurally homologous human macrophage mannose receptor retained the high affinity for sPLA2 and was internalization competent, exhibiting 50% endocytic activity of the M-type sPLA2 receptor. The results indicate the compatibility of the structural domains of the two parent proteins and provide evidence for the interchangeable character of their internalization signals.	0
Abstract2class: Oxidative cleavage of premithramycin B is one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin is a member of the clinically important aureolic acid group of antitumor drugs that interact with GC-rich regions of DNA nonintercalatively. These drugs contain a chromophore aglycon that is derived from condensation of ten acetate units (catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase). The aglycones are glycosylated at two positions with different chain length deoxyoligosaccharides, which are essential for the antitumor activity. During the early stages of mithramycin biosynthesis, tetracyclic intermediates of the tetracycline-type occur, which must be converted at later stages into the tricyclic glycosylated molecule, presumably through oxidative breakage of the fourth ring.                  Results:                       Two intermediates in the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway, 4-demethyl-premithramycinone and premithramycin B, were identified in a mutant lacking the mithramycin glycosyltransferase and methyltransferase genes and in the same mutant complemented with the deleted genes, respectively. Premithramycin B contains five deoxysugars moieties (like mithramycin), but contains a tetracyclic aglycon moiety instead of a tricyclic aglycon. We hypothesized that transcription of mtmOIV (encoding an oxygenase) was impaired in this strain, preventing oxidative breakage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B. Inactivating mtmOIV generated a mithramycin nonproducing mutant that accumulated premithramycin B instead of mithramycin. In vitro assays demonstrated that MtmOIV converted premithramycin B into a tricyclic compound.                  Conclusions:                       In the late stages of mithramycin biosynthesis by Strepyomyces argillaceus, a fully glycosylated tetracyclic tetracycline-like intermediate (premithramycin B) is converted into a tricyclic compound by the oxygenase MtmOIV. This oxygenase inserts an oxygen (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) and opens the resulting lactone. The following decarboxylation and ketoreduction steps lead to mithramycin. Opening of the fourth ring represents one of the last steps in mithramycin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: CloR, a bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase involved in clorobiocin biosynthesis Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and clorobiocin contain a 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (3DMA-4HB) moiety. The biosynthesis of this moiety has now been identified by biochemical and molecular biological studies. CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12976 has recently been identified as a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-3-dimethylallyltransferase. In the present study, the enzyme CloR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase, which converts 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (3DMA-4HPP) via 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA) to 3DMA-4HB by two consecutive oxidative decarboxylation steps. In 18O2 labeling experiments we showed that two oxygen atoms are incorporated into the intermediate 3DMA-4HMA in the first reaction step, but only one further oxygen is incorporated into the final product 3DMA-4HB during the second reaction step. CloR does not show sequence similarity to known oxygenases. It apparently presents a novel member of the diverse family of the non-heme iron (II) and alpha-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases, with 3DMA-4HPP functioning both as an alpha-keto acid and as a hydroxylation substrate. The reaction catalyzed by CloR represents a new pathway for the formation of benzoic acids in nature.	1
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling, filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. Here we report the 8,667,507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism, containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium. The 7,825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites. The genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes, predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses, and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development, a unique situation for a bacterium. An ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: A Remarkable Difference That One Fluorine Atom Confers on the Mechanisms of Inactivation of Human Ornithine Aminotransferase by Two Cyclohexene Analogues of γ-Aminobutyric Acid Abstract: Human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological selective inhibition of hOAT has been shown to be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC. Inspired by the discovery of the nonselective aminotransferase inactivator (1R,3S,4S)-3-amino-4-fluoro cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (1), in this work, we rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel series of fluorine-substituted cyclohexene analogues, thereby identifying 8 and 9 as novel selective hOAT time-dependent inhibitors. Intact protein mass spectrometry and protein crystallography demonstrated 8 and 9 as covalent inhibitors of hOAT, which exhibit two distinct inactivation mechanisms resulting from the difference of a single fluorine atom. Interestingly, they share a similar turnover mechanism, according to the mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites and fluoride ion release experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrostatic potential (ESP) charge calculations were conducted, which elucidated the significant influence of the one-fluorine difference on the corresponding intermediates, leading to two totally different inactivation pathways. The novel addition-aromatization inactivation mechanism for 9 contributes to its significantly enhanced potency, along with excellent selectivity over other aminotransferases.	0
Abstract2class: A chemical and genetic approach to the mode of action of fumagillin Abstract: Previous mode of action studies identified methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2) as the target of the antiangiogenic natural product fumagillin and its drug candidate analog, TNP-470. We report here that TNP-470-mediated MetAP-2 inhibition blocks noncanonical Wnt signaling, which plays a critical role in development, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this finding, antisense MetAP-2 morpholino oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish embryos phenocopies gastrulation defects seen in noncanonical Wnt5 loss-of-function zebrafish mutants. MetAP-2 inhibition or depletion blocks signaling downstream of the Wnt receptor Frizzled, but upstream of Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II, RhoA, and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase. Moreover, we demonstrate that TNP-470 does not block the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Thus, TNP-470 selectively regulates noncanonical over canonical Wnt signaling and provides a unique means to explore and dissect the biological systems mediated by these pathways.	0
Abstract2class: Cytotoxic clerodane diterpenoids and their hydrolysis products from Casearia nigrescens from the rainforest of Madagascar Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of the cytotoxic leaf and flower extract of Casearia nigrescens led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, designated caseanigrescens A-D (1-4). These compounds were subject to hydrolysis to dialdehydes when stored in CDCl3. The structures of compounds 1-4 were determined using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. All four compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity to the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line, with an IC50 range of 0.83-1.4 microM.	0
Abstract2class: Target-selective phototherapy using a ligand-based photosensitizer for type 2 cannabinoid receptor Abstract: Phototherapy is a powerful, noninvasive approach for cancer treatment, with several agents currently in clinical use. Despite the progress and promise, most current phototherapy agents have serious side effects as they can lead to damage to healthy tissue, even when the photosensitizers are fused to targeting molecules due to nonspecific light activation of the unbound photosensitizer. To overcome these limitations, we developed a phototherapy agent that combines a functional ligand and a near infrared phthalocyanine dye. Our target is type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R), considered an attractive therapeutic target for phototherapy given it is overexpressed by many types of cancers that are located at a surface or can be reached by an endoscope. We show that our CB2R-targeted phototherapy agent, IR700DX-mbc94, is specific for CB2R and effective only when bound to the target receptor. Overall, this opens up the opportunity for development of an alternative treatment option for CB2R-positive cancers.	0
Abstract2class: Insights into the biosynthesis of 12-membered resorcylic acid lactones from heterologous production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The phytotoxic fungal polyketides lasiodiplodin and resorcylide inhibit human blood coagulation factor XIIIa, mineralocorticoid receptors, and prostaglandin biosynthesis. These secondary metabolites belong to the 12-membered resorcylic acid lactone (RAL12) subclass of the benzenediol lactone (BDL) family. Identification of genomic loci for the biosynthesis of lasiodiplodin from Lasiodiplodia theobromae and resorcylide from Acremonium zeae revealed collaborating iterative polyketide synthase (iPKS) pairs whose efficient heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided a convenient access to the RAL12 scaffolds desmethyl-lasiodiplodin and trans-resorcylide, respectively. Lasiodiplodin production was reconstituted in the heterologous host by co-expressing an O-methyltransferase also encoded in the lasiodiplodin cluster, while a glutathione-S-transferase was found not to be necessary for heterologous production. Clarification of the biogenesis of known resorcylide congeners in the heterologous host helped to disentangle the roles that biosynthetic irregularities and chemical interconversions play in generating chemical diversity. Observation of 14-membered RAL homologues during in vivo heterologous biosynthesis of RAL12 metabolites revealed "stuttering" by fungal iPKSs. The close global and domain-level sequence similarities of the orthologous BDL synthases across different structural subclasses implicate repeated horizontal gene transfers and/or cluster losses in different fungal lineages. The absence of straightforward correlations between enzyme sequences and product structural features (the size of the macrocycle, the conformation of the exocyclic methyl group, or the extent of reduction by the hrPKS) suggest that BDL structural variety is the result of a select few mutations in key active site cavity positions.	1
Abstract2class: Microtubule dynamics in mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans is very rapid, requiring less than 5 min at 37 °C in germlings (Bergen and Morris, 1983). In this time the cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) must disassemble, the mitotic spindle assemble, function and disassemble, and cytoplasmic MTs reassemble. It follows that cytoplasmic MTs must be extremely dynamic in this period and we were interested, in particular, in examining the processes of MT disassembly in prophase and reassembly in anaphase and telophase. We observed a diploid strain that expressed GFP-α-tubulin. We used a spinning disk confocal microscope that allowed rapid image capture, which proved necessary because microtubule dynamics were extremely rapid. We found, for the first time, that microtubule severing occurs in prophase in a filamentous fungus and that catastrophe rather than nucleation limits astral microtubule growth.	0
Abstract2class: The adenovirus-mediated transfer of PTEN inhibits the growth of esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo Abstract: The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome, including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that compared to control cells, overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression. Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo. Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer.	0
Abstract2class: Evaluation of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as a heterologous expression host for the cyanobacterial protein kinase C activator lyngbyatoxin A Abstract: Filamentous marine cyanobacteria are extremely rich sources of bioactive natural products and often employ highly unusual biosynthetic enzymes in their assembly. However, the current lack of techniques for stable DNA transfer into these filamentous organisms, combined with the absence of heterologous expression strategies for nonribosomal cyanobacterial gene clusters, prohibit the creation of mutant strains or the heterologous production of these cyanobacterial compounds in other bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the capability of a derivative of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to express enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the protein kinase C activator lyngbyatoxin A from a Hawaiian strain of Moorea producta (previously classified as Lyngbya majuscula). Despite large differences in GC content between these two bacteria and the presence of rare TTA/UUA leucine codons in lyngbyatoxin ORFs we were able to achieve expression of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase LtxB and reverse prenyltransferase LtxC in S. coelicolor M512 and confirmed the in vitro functionality of S. coelicolor overexpressed LtxC. Attempts to express the entire lyngbyatoxin A gene cluster in S. coelicolor M512 were not successful because of transcript termination observed for the ltxA gene, which encodes a large nonribosomal peptide synthetase. However, these attempts did show a detectable level of cyanobacterial promoter recognition in Streptomyces. Successful expression of lyngbyatoxin A proteins in Streptomyces provides a new platform for biochemical investigation of natural product enzymes from Moorea strains.	1
Abstract2class: Genome Mining for Sesterterpenes Using Bifunctional Terpene Synthases Reveals a Unified Intermediate of Di/Sesterterpenes Abstract: Genome mining is a promising method to discover novel secondary metabolites in the postgenomic era. We applied the Aspergillus oryzae heterologous expression system to functionally characterize cryptic bifunctional terpene synthase genes found in fungal genomes and identified the sesterfisherol synthase gene (NfSS) from Neosartorya fischeri. Sesterfisherol contains a characteristic 5-6-8-5 tetracyclic ring system and is modified by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (NfP450) to sesterfisheric acid. The cyclization mechanism was proposed on the basis of the analysis of in vivo and in vitro enzymatic reactions with isotopically labeled precursors. The mechanism involves C1 cation-olefin IV-olefin V cyclization followed by five hydride shifts, allowing us to propose a unified biogenesis for sesterterpenes branching from bicyclic (5-15), tricyclic (5-12-5), and tetracyclic (5-6-8-5) cation intermediates. Furthermore, the mechanism is distinct from that of a separate class of di/sesterterpenes including fusicoccins and ophiobolins. The difference between mechanisms is consistent with phylogenetic analysis of bifunctional terpene synthases, suggesting that the amino acid sequence reflects the initial cyclization mode, which is most likely related to the initial conformation of a linear prenyl diphosphate.	1
Abstract2class: 7-Step Flow Synthesis of the HIV Integrase Inhibitor Dolutegravir Abstract: Dolutegravir (DTG), an important active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV, has been synthesized in continuous flow. By adapting the reported GlaxoSmithKline process chemistry batch route for Cabotegravir, DTG was produced in 4.5 h in sequential flow operations from commercially available materials. Key features of the synthesis include rapid manufacturing time for pyridone formation, one-step direct amidation of a functionalized pyridone, and telescoping of multiple steps to avoid isolation of intermediates and enable for greater throughput.	0
Abstract2class: A complex multienzyme system encoded by five polyketide synthase genes is involved in the biosynthesis of the 26-membered polyene macrolide pimaricin in Streptomyces natalensis Abstract: Background:                       Polyene macrolides are a class of large macrocyclic polyketides that interact with membrane sterols, having antibiotic activity against fungi but not bacteria. Their rings include a chromophore of 3-7 conjugated double bonds which constitute the distinct polyene structure. Pimaricin is an archetype polyene, important in the food industry as a preservative to prevent mould contamination of foods, produced by Streptomyces natalensis. We set out to clone, sequence and analyse the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this tetraene.                  Results:                       A large cluster of 16 open reading frames spanning 84985 bp of the S. natalensis genome has been sequenced and found to encode 13 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules) of a polyketide synthase (PKS) distributed within five giant multienzyme proteins (PIMS0-PIMS4). The total of 60 constituent active sites, 25 of them on a single enzyme (PIMS2), make this an exceptional multienzyme system. Eleven additional genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework and export. Disruption of the genes encoding the PKS abolished pimaricin production.                  Conclusions:                       The overall architecture of the PKS gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the 26-membered polyene macrolide pimaricin has been determined. Eleven additional tailoring genes have been cloned and analysed. The availability of the PKS cluster will facilitate the generation of designer pimaricins by combinatorial biosynthesis approaches. This work represents the extensive description of a second polyene macrolide biosynthetic gene cluster after the one for the antifungal nystatin.	1
Abstract2class: Light control of cellular processes by using photocaged abscisic acid Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) was chemically modified with a photocaging group to promote photo-induced protein dimerization. This photocontrolled chemically induced dimerization (CID) method based on caged ABA enables dose-dependent light regulation of cellular processes, including transcription, protein translocation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal remodeling, without the need to perform extensive protein engineering. Caged ABA can be easily modified to respond to different wavelengths of light. Consequently, this strategy should be applicable to the design of light-regulated protein dimerization systems and potentially be used orthogonally with other light-controlled CID systems.	0
Abstract2class: The reductase domain in a Type I fatty acid synthase from the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum: restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters Abstract: Background:                       The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum genome possesses a 25-kb intronless open reading frame (ORF) that predicts a multifunctional Type I fatty acid synthase (CpFAS1) with at least 21 enzymatic domains. Although the architecture of CpFAS1 resembles those of bacterial polyketide synthases (PKSs), this megasynthase is predicted to function as a fatty acyl elongase as our earlier studies have indicated that the N-terminal loading unit (acyl-[ACP] ligase) prefers using intermediate to long chain fatty acids as substrates, and each of the three internal elongation modules contains a complete set of enzymes to produce a saturated fatty acyl chain. Although the activities of almost all domains were confirmed using recombinant proteins, that of the C-terminal reductase domain (CpFAS1-R) was yet undetermined. In fact, there were no published studies to report the kinetic features of any reductase domains in bacterial PKSs using purified recombinant or native proteins.                  Results:                       In the present study, the identity of CpFAS1-R as a reductase is confirmed by in silico analysis on sequence similarity and characteristic motifs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the R-domains supports a previous notion on the bacterial origin of apicomplexan Type I FAS/PKS genes. We also developed a novel assay using fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, and determined that CpFAS1-R could only utilize very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates (i.e., with activity on C26 > C24 > C22 > C20, but no activity on C18 and C16). It was capable of using both NADPH and NADH as electron donors, but prefers NADPH to NADH. The activity of CpFAS1-R displayed allosteric kinetics towards C26 hexacosanoyl CoA as a substrate (h = 2.0; Vmax = 32.8 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein; and K50 = 0.91 mM).                  Conclusions:                       We have confirmed the activity of CpFAS1-R by directly assaying its substrate preference and kinetic parameters, which is for the first time for a Type I FAS, PKS or non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) reductase domain. The restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters may be an important feature for this megasynthase to avoid the release of product(s) with undesired lengths.	0
Abstract2class: Total Synthesis of Scytonemide A Employing Weinreb AM Solid-Phase Resin Abstract: The human 20S proteasome inhibitor scytonemide A (1), a macrocyclic imine originally isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema hofmanni, was synthesized via a biomimetic solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach employing the Weinreb AM resin. Utilizing this approach, cyclization of the protected heptapeptide via formation of the imine bond occurred spontaneously upon cleavage from the resin in the presence of a reducing agent and subsequent aqueous workup. The final deprotection step necessary to produce the natural product was accomplished under slightly basic conditions, facilitating cleavage of the silyl ether group while leaving the macrocycle intact. Purification of the synthetic scytonemide A was accomplished via normal-phase flash column chromatography, potentially facilitating larger scale preparation of the compound necessary for future mechanistic and SAR studies. The structure of the target compound was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, which also shed light on differences in the spectroscopic data obtained for the synthetic and natural scytonemide A samples for some of the amide and alcohol signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.	0
Abstract2class: CuH-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamidation of Vinylarenes Abstract: A CuH-catalyzed enantioselective hydroamidation reaction of vinylarenes has been developed using readily accessible 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones as electrophilic amidating reagents. This method provides a straightforward and efficient approach to synthesize chiral amides in good yields with high levels of enantiopurity under mild conditions. Moreover, this transformation tolerates substrates bearing a broad range of functional groups.	0
Abstract2class: The structure, function, and origin of the microcin H47 ATP-binding cassette exporter indicate its relatedness to that of colicin V Abstract: Microcin H47, a gene-encoded peptide antibiotic produced by a natural Escherichia coli strain, was shown to be secreted by a three-component ATP-binding cassette exporter which was revealed to be strongly related to that of colicin V. The results of sequence and gene fusion analyses, as well as heterologous complementation assays, are presented.	1
Abstract2class: Organization of the teicoplanin gene cluster in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus Abstract: The glycopeptide teicoplanin is used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. The tcp gene cluster, devoted to teicoplanin biosynthesis in the actinomycete Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, was isolated and characterized. From sequence analysis, the tcp cluster spans approximately 73 kb and includes 39 ORFs participating in teicoplanin biosynthesis, regulation, resistance and export. Of these, 34 ORFs find a match in at least one of the five glycopeptide gene clusters previously characterized. Putative roles could be assigned for most of the tcp genes. The two glycosyltransferases responsible for attaching amino sugars to amino acids 4 and 6 of the teicoplanin aglycon were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. They both recognize N-acetylglucosamine as the substrate. tGtfA can add a sugar residue in the presence or absence of N-acetylglucosamine at amino acid 4, while tGtfB can only glycosylate the teicoplanin aglycon.	1
Abstract2class: Functional expression of a highly-reducing polyketide synthase of Emericella variecolor IFM42010, an asteltoxin-producing strain, resulted in production of two polyenoic β-ketolactones with opposite stereochemistry Abstract: The asteltoxin-producing fungus Emericella variecolor IFM42010 possesses 22 highly-reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) genes. Of these, an HR-PKS with a methyltransferase domain but lacking an enoylreductase domain could be involved in the biosynthesis of asteltoxin and related compounds. From six such candidate HR-PKS genes, Ev460pks was analyzed by gene disruption in E. variecolor and heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae. The Ev460pks-disrupted strain retained asteltoxin production ability, indicating that Ev460pks is not involved in asteltoxin biosynthesis. The A. oryzae transformant harboring the Ev460pks gene produced compounds 1 and 2, along with several unidentified products possibly decomposed from 2. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that 1 was a 4-methyl-β-ketolactone with a methylheptatriene side-chain at the C-5 position, and 2 was also a 4-methyl-β-ketolactone, bearing a dimethyltetradecahexaene side-chain at the same position. The relative configuration at C-4 in compounds 1 and 2 was opposite.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, which carries the genes for biosynthesis of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin A and a gene probably involved in its oxygenation Abstract: A DNA fragment was cloned as cosmid purd8, which encodes a polyketide synthase involved in the production of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717. Deletion of the polyketide synthase genes from the chromosome abolished urdamycin production. In addition, purd8 conferred urdamycin resistance on introduction into Streptomyces lividans TK24. Sequence analysis of 5.7 kb of purd8 revealed six open reading frames transcribed in the same direction. The deduced amino acid sequences of the six open reading frames strongly resemble proteins from known type II polyketide synthase gene clusters: a ketoacyl synthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein, a ketoreductase, a cyclase, and an oxygenase. Heterologous expression of the urdamycin genes encoding a ketoacyl synthase and a chain length factor in Streptomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin C-nonproducing mutants impaired in either the TcmK ketoacyl synthase or TcmL chain length factor resulted in the production of tetracenomycin C. Heterologous expression of a putative oxygenase gene from the urdamycin gene cluster in S. glaucescens GLA.O caused production of the hybrid antibiotic 6-hydroxy tetracenomycin C.	1
Abstract2class: Efomycins K and L From a Termite-Associated Streptomyces sp. M56 and Their Putative Biosynthetic Origin Abstract: Two new elaiophylin derivatives, efomycins K (1) and L (2), and five known elaiophylin derivatives (3-7) were isolated from the termite-associated Streptomyces sp. M56. The structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR and HR-ESIMS analyses and comparative CD spectroscopy. The putative gene cluster responsible for the production of the elaiophylin and efomycin derivatives was identified based on significant homology to related clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of gene cluster domains was used to provide a biosynthetic rational for these new derivatives and to demonstrate how a single biosynthetic pathway can produce diverse structures.	1
Abstract2class: Cross-linking of a growth hormone releasing factor-binding protein in anterior pituitary cells Abstract: Growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary and is related to the peptides of the glucagon/secretin family. Although the mechanism of action of this hormone has been studied in considerable detail, little is known concerning the GRF receptor itself. We have attempted to label the GRF receptor by chemically coupling the 125I-GRF analog [His1, Nle27]-hGRF(1-32)-NH2 (GRFa) (where Nle is norleucine) to plated rat anterior pituitary cells with the protein cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (0.1 mM). Verification of biological activity of the 125I-GRFa was confirmed prior to the cross-linking experiments using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Whole cell extracts prepared from the cross-linked cells were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Four bands of 72, 50, 30, and 26 kDa were detected in autoradiograms from cells exposed to the labeled analog for 20 min (22 degrees C) followed by exposure to DSS for 2 min. The 72-kDa band was interpreted to be bovine serum albumin, which was used as a carrier in initial studies. The 50- and 30-kDa bands were very faint and probably represent nonspecific binding sites since they were unchanged in the presence of excess unlabeled GRFa. The 26-kDa band was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled rat GRF, GRFa, and to a lesser extent by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It is unlikely, however, that GRFa was acting at a VIP receptor since the labeled analog did not induce prolactin secretion (VIP is a prolactin secretagogue). GRFa also increased cellular cAMP to levels similar to GRF and greater than VIP. Autoradiographs from gels run under nonreducing conditions revealed the 26-kDa band as the major species, indicating that, if a polymeric form of this binding protein exists, it does not involve disulfide linkages. Thus, the best candidate for the putative GRF receptor is the 26-kDa band. We have further demonstrated that the higher concentrations of DSS used previously (5 mM) result in diffuse autoradiograms with multiple bands, suggesting that caution should be exercised when interpreting cross-linking data under these conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Investigation of the catalytic mechanism of the hotdog-fold enzyme superfamily Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase Abstract: The 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4-HB-CoA) thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 catalyzes the final step of the 4-chlorobenzoate degradation pathway, which is the hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA to coenzyme A (CoA) and 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB). In previous work, X-ray structural analysis of the substrate-bound thioesterase provided evidence of the role of an active site Asp17 in nucleophilic catalysis [Thoden, J. B., Holden, H. M., Zhuang, Z., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (2002) X-ray crystallographic analyses of inhibitor and substrate complexes of wild-type and mutant 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 27468-27476]. In the study presented here, kinetic techniques were used to test the catalytic mechanism that was suggested by the X-ray structural data. The time course for the multiple-turnover reaction of 50 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 10 μM thioesterase supported a two-step pathway in which the second step is rate-limiting. Steady-state product inhibition studies revealed that binding of CoA (K(is) = 250 ± 70 μM; K(ii) = 900 ± 300 μM) and 4-HB (K(is) = 1.2 ± 0.2 mM) is weak, suggesting that product release is not rate-limiting. A substantial D(2)O solvent kinetic isotope effect (3.8) on the steady-state k(cat) value (18 s(-1)) provided evidence that a chemical step involving proton transfer is the rate-limiting step. Taken together, the kinetic results support a two-chemical pathway. The microscopic rate constants governing the formation and consumption of the putative aspartyl 17-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)anhydride intermediate were determined by simulation-based fitting of a kinetic model to time courses for the substrate binding reaction (5.0 μM 4-HB-CoA and 0.54 μM thioesterase), single-turnover reaction (5 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 50 μM thioesterase), steady-state reaction (5.2 μM 4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 0.003 μM thioesterase), and transient-state multiple-turnover reaction (50 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 10 μM thioesterase). Together with the results obtained from solvent (18)O labeling experiments, the findings are interpreted as evidence of the formation of an aspartyl 17-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)anhydride intermediate that undergoes rate-limiting hydrolytic cleavage at the hydroxybenzoyl carbonyl carbon atom.	0
Abstract2class: Bacillus subtilis as heterologous host for the secretory production of the non-ribosomal cyclodepsipeptide enniatin Abstract: The heterologous expression of genes or gene clusters in microbial hosts, followed by metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways, is key to access industrially and pharmaceutically relevant compounds in an economically affordable and sustainable manner. Therefore, platforms need to be developed, which provide tools for the controlled synthesis of bioactive compounds. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a promising candidate for such applications, as it is generally regarded as a safe production host, its physiology is well investigated and a variety of tools is available for its genetic manipulation. Furthermore, this industrially relevant bacterium provides a high secretory potential not only for enzymes but also for primary and secondary metabolites. In this study, we present the first heterologous expression of an eukaryotic non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene (esyn) coding for the biosynthesis of the small molecule enniatin in B. subtilis. Enniatin is a pharmaceutically used cyclodepsipeptide for treatment of topical bacterial and fungal infections. We generated various enniatin-producing B. subtilis strains, allowing for either single chromosomal or plasmid-based multi-copy expression of the esyn cluster under the control of an acetoin-inducible promoter system. Optimization of cultivation conditions, combined with modifications of the genetic background and multi-copy plasmid-based esyn expression, resulted in a secretory production of enniatin B. This work presents B. subtilis as a suitable host for the expression of heterologous eukaryotic non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) clusters.	0
Abstract2class: Fusarium graminearum PKS14 is involved in orsellinic acid and orcinol synthesis Abstract: The available genome sequences show that the number of secondary metabolite genes in filamentous fungi vastly exceeds the number of known products. This is also true for the global plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum, which contains 15 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, of which only 6 have been linked to products. To help remedy this, we focused on PKS14, which has only been shown to be expressed during plant infections or when cultivated on rice or corn meal (RM) based media. To enhance the production of the resulting product we introduced a constitutive promoter in front of PKS14 and cultivated two of the resulting mutants on RM medium. This led to the production of two compounds, which were only detected in the PKS14 overexpressing mutants and not in the wild type or PKS14 deletion mutants. The two compounds were tentatively identified as orsellinic acid and orcinol by comparing spectroscopic data (mass spectroscopy and chromatography) to authentic standards. NMR analysis of putative orcinol isolated from the PKS14 overexpressing mutant supported our identification. Orcinol and orsellinic acid, not previously detected in Fusarium, have primarily been detected in lichen fungi. Orsellinic acid is hypothesized to be the PKS release product which is transformed to orcinol through decarboxylation. Phylogenetic analyses of PKSs placed PKS14 in a subclade of known OA synthases. Expression analysis by microarray of 55 experiments identified seven genes near PKS14 that were expressed in a similar manner. One of the seven genes encodes a predicted carboxylase, which could be responsible for transforming orsellinic acid to orcinol.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of a gene cluster for synthesis of the polyketide antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol from Pseudomonas fluorescens Q2-87 Abstract: The polyketide metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) is produced by many strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. with biocontrol activity against soilborne fungal plant pathogens. Genes required for 2,4-DAPG synthesis by P. fluorescens Q2-87 are encoded by a 6.5-kb fragment of genomic DNA that can transfer production of 2,4-DAPG to 2,4-DAPG-nonproducing recipient Pseudomonas strains. In this study the nucleotide sequence was determined for the 6.5-kb fragment and flanking regions of genomic DNA from strain Q2-87. Six open reading frames were identified, four of which (phlACBD) comprise an operon that includes a set of three genes (phlACB) conserved between eubacteria and archaebacteria and a gene (phlD) encoding a polyketide synthase with homology to chalcone and stilbene synthases from plants. The biosynthetic operon is flanked on either side by phlE and phlF, which code respectively for putative efflux and regulatory (repressor) proteins. Expression in Escherichia coli of phlA, phlC, phlB, and phlD, individually or in combination, identified a novel polyketide biosynthetic pathway in which PhlD is responsible for the production of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG). PhlA, PhlC, and PhlB are necessary to convert MAPG to 2,4-DAPG, and they also may function in the synthesis of MAPG.	1
Abstract2class: The RAD17 Promoter Sequence Contains a Potential Tail-Dependent G-Quadruplex That Downregulates Gene Expression upon Oxidative Modification Abstract: Our laboratory has recently proposed that the oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG) in G-rich promoter regions of DNA repair genes can serve as a regulatory mechanism of gene transcription. These regions also have the potential to fold into G-quadruplexes (G4). The human RAD17 promoter sequence has such a region in the template strand of the gene. In this work, the potential G-quadruplex sequence (PQS) of the RAD17 gene promoter was analyzed in different sequence contexts. With two extra nucleotides of the native sequence on either side of the G4, the structure was found to fold into a hybrid-like G4, similar to the hybrid-1 fold that the human telomere sequence can adopt. With only one nucleotide on either side of the PQS, the topology of the structure was observed to be mixed, and without extra nucleotides on the ends, the sequence adopted a parallel fold. Next, the sequence was studied with synthetic incorporation of the oxidative modification OG into specific sites and installed into the promoter of plasmids with a luciferase gene. These plasmids were transfected into a human cell line to observe the effect of the G4s on transcription. The RAD17 PQS was found to decrease luciferase expression with the presence of OG that is consistent with RAD17 expression under oxidative stress. This serves as an example of how oxidative modification could affect transcription in the context of a G4.	0
Abstract2class: Protein phosphorylation and intermolecular electron transfer: a joint experimental and computational study of a hormone biosynthesis pathway Abstract: Protein phosphorylation is a common regulator of enzyme activity. Chemical modification of a protein surface, including phosphorylation, could alter the function of biological electron-transfer reactions. However, the sensitivity of intermolecular electron-transfer kinetics to post-translational protein modifications has not been widely investigated. We have therefore combined experimental and computational studies to assess the potential role of phosphorylation in electron-transfer reactions. We investigated the steroid hydroxylating system from bovine adrenal glands, which consists of adrenodoxin (Adx), adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), and a cytochrome P450, CYP11A1. We focused on the phosphorylation of Adx at Thr-71, since this residue is located in the acidic interaction domain of Adx, and a recent study has demonstrated that this residue is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in vitro.1 Optical biosensor experiments indicate that the presence of this phosphorylation slightly increases the binding affinity of oxidized Adx with CYP11A1ox but not AdRox. This tendency was confirmed by KA values extracted from Adx concentration-dependent stopped-flow experiments that characterize the interaction between AdRred and Adxox or between Adxred and CYP11A1ox. In addition, acceleration of the electron-transfer kinetics measured with stopped-flow is seen only for the phosphorylated Adx-CYP11A1 reaction. Biphasic reaction kinetics are observed only when Adx is phosphorylated at Thr-71, and the Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations suggest that this phosphorylation may enhance the formation of a secondary Adx-CYP11A1 binding complex that provides an additional electron-transfer pathway with enhanced coupling.	0
Abstract2class: Catenulisporolides, Glycosylated Triene Macrolides from the Chemically Underexploited Actinomycete Catenulispora Species Abstract: New glycosylated 26-membered triene macrolides catenulisporolides, the first polyketide metabolites from Catenulispora species, were obtained by targeting slow-forming colonies on selection agar plates and applying long-term cultivation. Their structures, including the full stereochemistry, were defined by comprehensive spectroscopic and chemical methods and confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster spanning ∼160 kbp, and feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors showed that isovaleric acid acts as a rare starter unit. Catenulisporolides exhibited antimalarial activities against resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, and enhanced activity was observed in semisynthetic derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov., a novel actinomycete that produces kigamicins Abstract: The taxonomic position of seven soil actinomycetes provisionally assigned to the genus Amycolatopsis was established in a polyphasic study. The isolates, which had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, had closest similarity to the type strain of Amycolatopsis orientalis. A representative isolate, strain GY080T, had chemotaxonomic properties that were typical of the genus Amycolatopsis and could be distinguished from the type strain of A. orientalis using DNA-DNA relatedness data. All of the isolates shared a phenotypic profile that distinguished them from representatives of phylogenetically closely related species. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis showed that the isolates formed a homogeneous group that was distinctly separate from single-membered groups consisting of representative Amycolatopsis type strains, including that of A. orientalis. Based on the combined genotypic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the seven isolates be classified as representatives of a novel species for which the name Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GY080T (=DSM 45072T=NCIMB 14277T).	1
Abstract2class: Stress-responsive systems set specific limits to the overproduction of membrane proteins in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Essential membrane proteins are generally recognized as relevant potential drug targets due to their exposed localization in the cell envelope. Unfortunately, high-level production of membrane proteins for functional and structural analyses is often problematic. This is mainly due to their high overall hydrophobicity. To develop new concepts for membrane protein overproduction, we investigated whether the biogenesis of overproduced membrane proteins is affected by stress response-related proteolytic systems in the membrane. For this purpose, the well-established expression host Bacillus subtilis was used to overproduce eight essential membrane proteins from B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The results show that the sigma(W) regulon (responding to cell envelope perturbations) and the CssRS two-component regulatory system (responding to unfolded exported proteins) set critical limits to membrane protein production in large quantities. The identified sigW or cssRS mutant B. subtilis strains with significantly improved capacity for membrane protein production are interesting candidate expression hosts for fundamental research and biotechnological applications. Importantly, our results pinpoint the interdependent expression and function of membrane-associated proteases as key parameters in bacterial membrane protein production.	0
Abstract2class: The active conformation of avilamycin A is conferred by AviX12, a radical AdoMet enzyme Abstract: The antibiotic avilamycin A is produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57. Avilamycin belongs to the family of orthosomycins with a linear heptasaccharide chain linked to a terminal dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. The gene cluster for avilamycin biosynthesis contains 54 open reading frames. Inactivation of one of these genes, namely aviX12, led to the formation of a novel avilamycin derivative named gavibamycin N1. The structure of the new metabolite was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR analysis. It harbors glucose as a component of the heptasaccharide chain instead of a mannose moiety in avilamycin A. Antibacterial activity tests against a spectrum of Gram-positive organisms showed that the new derivative possesses drastically decreased biological activity in comparison to avilamycin A. Thus, AviX12 seems to be implicated in converting avilamycin to its bioactive conformation by catalyzing an unusual epimerization reaction. Sequence comparisons grouped AviX12 in the radical S-adenosylmethionine protein family. AviX12 engineered with a His tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The iron sulfur cluster [Fe-S] present in radical AdoMet enzymes was detected in purified AviX12 by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.	1
Abstract2class: Evaluation of housekeeping genes in Listeria monocytogenes as potential internal control references for normalizing mRNA expression levels in stress adaptation models using real-time PCR Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen that can tolerate a wide range of stress conditions. However, its stress adaptation processes are still poorly understood. Real-time-based quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) provides a tool to probe gene expression changes underlying stress adaptation. But, a limitation to study mRNA levels by real-time qRT-PCR is that validated reference genes are required for normalization. Such genes are currently lacking for experimental models that may be applied to evaluate stress-related gene expression changes in L. monocytogenes. Therefore, five housekeeping genes (HKG) were studied as potential reference genes. Their expression stability was evaluated across 16 L. monocytogenes strains. Three experimental models designed to assess gene expression changes induced by cold, acid and high NaCl concentration stress adaptation were applied. The 16S rRNA gene was consistently the most stably expressed HKG across the different L. monocytogenes strains under all the experimental conditions. While the expressions of beta-glucosidase (bglA), Glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (gap), RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) and Ribosomal protein L4 (rplD) was stable amongst the different L. monocytogenes strains, they were prone to significant variations under the different stress adaptation models.	0
Abstract2class: A type I/type III polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic pathway for the structurally unique ansa compound kendomycin Abstract: Kendomycin is a bioactive polyketide that is produced by various Streptomyces strains. It displays strong antibiotic activities against a wide range of bacteria and exhibits remarkable cytotoxic effects on the growth of several human cancer cell lines. In this study we cloned the corresponding biosynthetic locus from the producer Streptomyces violaceoruber (strain 3844-33C). Our analysis shows that a mixed type I/type III polyketide synthase pathway is responsible for the formation of the fully carbogenic macrocyclic scaffold of kendomycin, which is unprecedented among all of the ansa compounds that have been isolated so far. Heterologous expression of a gene set in Streptomyces coelicolor shows that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid is an intermediate in the starter unit biosynthesis that is initiated by the type III polyketide synthase. The identification of the kendomycin biosynthetic gene cluster sets the stage to study a novel chain termination mechanism by a type I PKS that leads to carbocycle formation and provides the starting material for the heterologous expression of the entire pathway, and the production of novel derivatives by genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Tandem carbocupration/oxygenation of terminal alkynes Abstract: [chemical reaction: see text]. A direct and general synthesis of alpha-branched aldehydes and their enol derivatives is described. Carbocupration of terminal alkynes and subsequent oxygenation with lithium tert-butyl peroxide generates a metallo-enolate. Trapping with various electrophiles provides alpha-branched aldehydes or stereo-defined trisubstituted enol esters or silyl ethers. The tandem carbocupration/oxygenation tolerates alkyl and silyl ethers, esters, and tertiary amines. The reaction is effective with organocopper complexes derived from primary, secondary, and tertiary Grignard reagents and from n-butyllithium.	0
Abstract2class: Control of Protein Activity and Gene Expression by Cyclofen-OH Uncaging Abstract: The use of light to control the expression of genes and the activity of proteins is a rapidly expanding field. Whereas many of these approaches use fusion between a light-activable protein and the protein of interest to control the activity of the latter, it is also possible to control the activity of a protein by uncaging a specific ligand. In that context, controlling the activation of a protein fused to the modified estrogen receptor (ERT) by uncaging its ligand cyclofen-OH has emerged as a generic and versatile method to control the activation of proteins quantitatively, quickly, and locally in a live organism. We present that approach and its uses in a variety of physiological contexts.	0
Abstract2class: Phylum-wide comparative genomics unravel the diversity of secondary metabolism in Cyanobacteria Abstract: Background:                       Cyanobacteria are an ancient lineage of photosynthetic bacteria from which hundreds of natural products have been described, including many notorious toxins but also potent natural products of interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. Many of these compounds are the products of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. However, current understanding of the diversification of these pathways is largely based on the chemical structure of the bioactive compounds, while the evolutionary forces driving their remarkable chemical diversity are poorly understood.                  Results:                       We carried out a phylum-wide investigation of genetic diversification of the cyanobacterial NRPS and PKS pathways for the production of bioactive compounds. 452 NRPS and PKS gene clusters were identified from 89 cyanobacterial genomes, revealing a clear burst in late-branching lineages. Our genomic analysis further grouped the clusters into 286 highly diversified cluster families (CF) of pathways. Some CFs appeared vertically inherited, while others presented a more complex evolutionary history. Only a few horizontal gene transfers were evidenced amongst strongly conserved CFs in the phylum, while several others have undergone drastic gene shuffling events, which could result in the observed diversification of the pathways.                  Conclusions:                       Therefore, in addition to toxin production, several NRPS and PKS gene clusters are devoted to important cellular processes of these bacteria such as nitrogen fixation and iron uptake. The majority of the biosynthetic clusters identified here have unknown end products, highlighting the power of genome mining for the discovery of new natural products.	1
Abstract2class: A unique amino transfer mechanism for constructing the β-amino fatty acid starter unit in the biosynthesis of the macrolactam antibiotic cremimycin Abstract: Cremimycin is a 19-membered macrolactam glycoside antibiotic based on three distinctive substructures: 1) a β-amino fatty acid starter moiety, 2) a bicyclic macrolactam ring, and 3) a cymarose unit. To elucidate the biosynthetic machineries responsible for these three structures, the cremimycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The cmi gene cluster consists of 33 open reading frames encoding eight polyketide synthases, six deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, and a characteristic group of five β-amino-acid-transfer enzymes. Involvement of the gene cluster in cremimycin production was confirmed by a gene knockout experiment. Further, a feeding experiment demonstrated that 3-aminononanoate is a direct precursor of cremimycin. Two characteristic enzymes of the cremimycin-type biosynthesis were functionally characterized in vitro. The results showed that a putative thioesterase homologue, CmiS1, catalyzes the Michael addition of glycine to the β-position of a non-2-enoic acid thioester, followed by hydrolysis of the thioester to give N-carboxymethyl-3-aminononanoate. Subsequently, the resultant amino acid was oxidized by a putative FAD-dependent glycine oxidase homologue, CmiS2, to produce 3-aminononanoate and glyoxylate. This represents a unique amino transfer mechanism for β-amino acid biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces griseochromogenes ATCC 14511T, a producer of nucleoside compounds and diverse secondary metabolites Abstract: ATCC 14511T (=DSM 40499, =NBRC 13413) is a type strain of Streptomyces griseochromogenes. It is known as a producer of nucleoside antibiotic, blasticidin S. In this report we present the complete genome sequence of S. griseochromogenes ATCC 14511T, which consists of 10,764,674bp with a linear chromosome, 9822 protein-coding genes, 6 rRNA operons, 74 tRNA and 3 sRNA. The genomic analysis revealed that 52 putative gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including four gene clusters of nucleoside antibiotics. These gene clusters provide a beneficial source for production of bioactive natural compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Predictions of linear T-cell and B-cell epitopes in proteins encoded by HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVMAC and the conservation of these sites between strains Abstract: An important consideration in the design of vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection effective against different strains is the amino acid sequence conservation of antigenic determinants. Even one amino acid change can destroy the antigenicity of a site for the antibody or T-cell receptor. The comparisons of predicted T- and B-cell epitopes between human HIV-1, HIV-2 and monkey SIVMAC AIDS viruses are presented. The three major gene products (env, gag and pol) were examined. A number of epitopes were identical between strains of HIV-1. Our analysis highlights the problem of designing an effective HIV-1 and HIV-2 vaccine and also the problem of testing human vaccines in monkey models.	0
Abstract2class: Incorporation of P and Growth of Pseudomonad UP-2 on n-Tetracosane Abstract: Cultures of the marine pseudomonad UP-2 growing on n-tetracosane contained both free cells and cells bound to the solid hydrocarbon. After separation by filtration through a Whatman no. 1 filter, the numbers of free and bound cells were estimated from the amount of P incorporated into each fraction and the determined value of P incorporation per viable cell in the filtrate (free cells). During the early exponential growth phase, over 80% of the cells were bound to large pieces of n-tetracosane; as the culture approached the stationary phase, the number of bound cells remained constant, whereas free cells continued to accumulate. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that cells grew both on the surface of the solid and in the aqueous medium. During the growth cycle, a portion of the n-tetracosane which was initially nonfilterable was recovered in the filtrate in a form which was largely cell associated. This cell-associated n-tetracosane was preferentially utilized and could completely account for the observed growth of free cells.	0
Abstract2class: Thioesterase II of Escherichia coli plays an important role in 3-hydroxydecanoic acid production Abstract: 3-Hydroxydecanoic acid (3HD) was produced in Escherichia coli by mobilizing (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-acyl carrier protein-coenzyme A transacylase (PhaG, encoded by the phaG gene). By employing an isogenic tesB (encoding thioesterase II)-negative knockout E. coli strain, CH01, it was found that the expressions of tesB and phaG can up-regulate each other. In addition, 3HD was synthesized from glucose or fructose by recombinant E. coli harboring phaG and tesB. This study supports the hypothesis that the physiological role of thioesterase II in E. coli is to prevent the abnormal accumulation of intracellular acyl-coenzyme A.	0
Abstract2class: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acids D, C, and B: Evolution of a Unified Synthetic Strategy Abstract: A unified synthetic strategy leading to the total synthesis of (-)-nodulisporic acids D, C, and B is described. Key synthetic transformations include a nickel-chromium-mediated cyclization, an aromatic ring functionalization employing a novel copper-promoted alkylation, a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling cascade/indole ring construction, and a palladium-mediated regio- and diastereoselective allylic substitution/cyclization reaction, the latter to construct ring D.	0
Abstract2class: A highly efficient microwave-assisted suzuki coupling reaction of aryl perfluorooctylsulfonates with boronic acids Abstract: [reaction: see text] A new strategy to improve the efficiency of Suzuki coupling reactions is introduced by combining fast microwave reaction with easy fluorous separation. Aryl perfluorooctylsulfonates derived from the corresponding phenols are coupled with aryl boronic acids to form biaryls under general microwave conditions. Both intermediates and products are purified by solid-phase extraction over FluoroFlash silica gel. Application of this tagging strategy to multistep synthesis of biaryl-substituted hydantoin is also described.	0
Abstract2class: Bacteroides fragilis NCTC9343 produces at least three distinct capsular polysaccharides: cloning, characterization, and reassignment of polysaccharide B and C biosynthesis loci Abstract: Bacteroides fragilis produces a capsular polysaccharide complex (CPC) that is directly involved in its ability to induce abscesses. Two distinct capsular polysaccharides, polysaccharide A (PS A) and PS B, have been shown to be synthesized by the prototype strain for the study of abscesses, NCTC9343. Both of these polysaccharides in purified form induce abscesses in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate that the CPC of NCTC9343 is composed of at least three distinct capsular polysaccharides: PS A, PS B, and PS C. A previously described locus contains genes whose products are involved in the biosynthesis of PS C rather than PS B as was originally suggested. The actual PS B biosynthesis locus was cloned, sequenced, and found to contain 22 genes in an operon-type structure. A mutant with a large chromosomal deletion of the PS B biosynthesis locus was created so that the contribution of PS B to the formation of abscesses could be assessed in a rodent model. Although purified PS B can induce abscesses, removal of this polysaccharide does not attenuate the organism's ability to induce abscesses.	1
Abstract2class: Development and Application of a Novel Rapid and Throughput Method for Broad-Spectrum Anti-Foodborne Norovirus Antibody Testing Abstract: Foodbone norovirus (NoV) is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Candidate vaccines are being developed, however, no licensed vaccines are currently available for managing NoV infections. Screening for stimulated antibodies with broad-spectrum binding activities can be performed for the development of NoV polyvalent vaccines. In this study, we aimed to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for testing the broad spectrum of anti-NoV antibodies. Capsid P proteins from 28 representative NoV strains (GI.1-GI.9 and GII.1-GII.22 except GII.11, GII.18, and GII.19) were selected, prepared, and used as coating antigens on one microplate. Combined with incubation and the horseradish peroxidase chromogenic reaction, the entire process for testing the spectrum of unknown antibodies required 2 h for completion. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%. The new method was successfully performed with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies induced by multiple antigens. In conclusion, the indirect ELISA assay developed in this study had a good performance of reliability, convenience, and high-throughput screening for broad-spectrum antibodies.	0
Abstract2class: Role of the FeoB protein and siderophore in promoting virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae on rice Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice. Our analysis revealed that the X. oryzae pv. oryzae genome encodes genes responsible for iron uptake through FeoB (homolog of the major bacterial ferrous iron transporter) and a siderophore. A mutation in the X. oryzae pv. oryzae feoB gene causes severe virulence deficiency, growth deficiency in iron-limiting medium, and constitutive production of a siderophore. We identified an iron regulated xss gene cluster, in which xssABCDE (Xanthomonas siderophore synthesis) and xsuA (Xanthomonas siderophore utilization) genes encode proteins involved in biosynthesis and utilization of X. oryzae pv. oryzae siderophore. Mutations in the xssA, xssB, and xssE genes cause siderophore deficiency and growth restriction under iron-limiting conditions but are virulence proficient. An xsuA mutant displayed impairment in utilization of native siderophore, suggesting that XsuA acts as a specific receptor for a ferric-siderophore complex. Histochemical and fluorimetric assays with gusA fusions indicate that, during in planta growth, the feoB gene is expressed and that the xss operon is not expressed. This study represents the first report describing a role for feoB in virulence of any plant-pathogenic bacterium and the first functional characterization of a siderophore-biosynthetic gene cluster in any xanthomonad.	1
Abstract2class: Minimization of the Thiolactomycin Biosynthetic Pathway Reveals that the Cytochrome P450 Enzyme TlmF Is Required for Five-Membered Thiolactone Ring Formation Abstract: Thiolactomycin (TLM) belongs to a class of rare and unique thiotetronate antibiotics that inhibit bacterial fatty acid synthesis. Although this group of natural product antibiotics was first discovered over 30 years ago, the study of TLM biosynthesis remains in its infancy. We recently discovered the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for TLM from the marine bacterium Salinispora pacifica CNS-863. Here, we report the investigation of TLM biosynthetic logic through mutagenesis and comparative metabolic analyses. Our results revealed that only four genes (tlmF, tlmG, tlmH, and tlmI) are required for the construction of the characteristic γ-thiolactone skeleton of this class of antibiotics. We further showed that the cytochrome P450 TlmF does not directly participate in sulfur insertion and C-S bond formation chemistry but rather in the construction of the five-membered thiolactone ring as, upon its deletion, we observed the alternative production of the six-membered δ-thiolactomycin. Our findings pave the way for future biochemical investigation of the biosynthesis of this structurally unique group of thiotetronic acid natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Twilight zone sponges from Guam yield theonellin isocyanate and psammaplysins I and J Abstract: From the organic extracts of two Guam sponges, Rhaphoxya sp. and Suberea sp., determined to have cytotoxic and chemopreventive activities, three new compounds, theonellin isocyanate (1) and psammaplysins I and J (5, 6), and six previously reported compounds (2-4, 7-9) were isolated and characterized spectroscopically ((1)H and (13)C NMR, MS, IR, UV, [α](D)). The two new metabolites (5 and 6) isolated from the Suberea sp. sponge are rare examples of compounds containing a bromotyramine moiety rather than the more usual dibromo analogue. For the compounds isolated from the Rhaphoxya sp., this is the first report of the known compounds 2-4 being found in a single sponge. For previously reported compounds 2-4 complete unambiguous (1)H and (13)C NMR data are provided.	0
Abstract2class: Microscale sulfur cycling in the phototrophic pink berry consortia of the Sippewissett Salt Marsh Abstract: Microbial metabolism is the engine that drives global biogeochemical cycles, yet many key transformations are carried out by microbial consortia over short spatiotemporal scales that elude detection by traditional analytical approaches. We investigate syntrophic sulfur cycling in the 'pink berry' consortia of the Sippewissett Salt Marsh through an integrative study at the microbial scale. The pink berries are macroscopic, photosynthetic microbial aggregates composed primarily of two closely associated species: sulfide-oxidizing purple sulfur bacteria (PB-PSB1) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (PB-SRB1). Using metagenomic sequencing and (34) S-enriched sulfate stable isotope probing coupled with nanoSIMS, we demonstrate interspecies transfer of reduced sulfur metabolites from PB-SRB1 to PB-PSB1. The pink berries catalyse net sulfide oxidation and maintain internal sulfide concentrations of 0-500 μm. Sulfide within the berries, captured on silver wires and analysed using secondary ion mass spectrometer, increased in abundance towards the berry interior, while δ(34) S-sulfide decreased from 6‰ to -31‰ from the exterior to interior of the berry. These values correspond to sulfate-sulfide isotopic fractionations (15-53‰) consistent with either sulfate reduction or a mixture of reductive and oxidative metabolisms. Together this combined metagenomic and high-resolution isotopic analysis demonstrates active sulfur cycling at the microscale within well-structured macroscopic consortia consisting of sulfide-oxidizing anoxygenic phototrophs and sulfate-reducing bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Abstract2class: Chromosomal organization governs the timing of cell type-specific gene expression required for spore formation in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: During the early stages of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, asymmetric division precedes chromosome segregation, such that the forespore transiently contains only about one-third of the genetic material surrounding the origin of replication. Shortly after septum formation, the transcription factor sigmaF initiates forespore-specific gene expression that is essential for the proteolytic activation of pro-sigmaE in the neighbouring mother cell. Moving the sigmaF-dependent spoIIR gene from its original origin-proximal position to an ectopic origin-distal site caused a delay in spoIIR transcription, as well as delays and reductions in the proteolytic activation of pro-sigmaE and sigmaE-directed gene expression. These defects correlated with the accumulation of disporic sporangia, thus reducing sporulation efficiency in a manner that depended upon the distance that spoIIR had been moved from the origin-proximal third of the chromosome. A significant proportion of disporic sporangia exhibited sigmaE activity in their central compartment, indicating that delays and reductions in sigmaE activation can lead to the formation of a second septum at the opposite pole. These observations support a model in which chromosomal spoIIR position temporally regulates sigmaE activation, thereby allowing for the rapid establishment of mother cell-specific gene expression that is essential for efficient spore formation. The implications of these findings for cell type-specific gene expression during the early stages of spore formation in B. subtilis are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Shift to Pseudomonic acid B production in P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 by mutation of mupirocin tailoring genes mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE Abstract: Mupirocin, a polyketide-derived antibiotic from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB10586, is a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PA) that target isoleucyl-tRNA synthase. The mup gene cluster encodes both type I polyketide synthases and monofunctional enzymes that should play a role during the conversion of the product of the polyketide synthase into the active antibiotic (tailoring). By in-frame deletion analysis of selected tailoring open-reading frames we show that mupQ, mupS, mupT, and mupW are essential for mupirocin production, whereas mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE are essential for production of PA-A but not PA-B. Therefore, PA-B is not simply produced by hydroxylation of PA-A but is either a precursor of PA-A or a shunt product. In the mupW mutant, a new metabolite lacking the tetrahydropyran ring is produced, implicating mupW in oxidation of the 16-methyl group.	1
Abstract2class: The biosynthetic genes for disorazoles, potent cytotoxic compounds that disrupt microtubule formation Abstract: Disorazoles are polyketides produced by the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce12. Their mode of action is to inhibit tubulin polymerization and destabilize microtubules. Using transposon mutagenesis, two mutant strains were identified that produced no disorazoles. Sequencing the DNA flanking the insertions revealed a polyketide synthase gene cluster that would encode three polypeptides, DszA, DszB, and DszC, with DszC containing both nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase modules. The disorazole polyketide synthase modules lack an acyltransferase domain. Instead, a separate gene, dszD, encodes an AT protein, thus revealing that the disorazole gene cluster falls into the trans-AT Type I family of PKS enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the Amipurimycin Gene Cluster Yields Insight into the Biosynthesis of C9 Sugar Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Feeding studies indicate a possible synthetic pattern for the N-terminal cis-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (ACPC) and suggest an unusual source of the high-carbon sugar skeleton of amipurimycin (APM). The biosynthetic gene cluster of APM was identified and confirmed by in vivo experiments. A C9 core intermediate was discovered from null mutants of ACPC pathway, and an ATP-grasp enzyme (ApmA8) was reconstituted in vitro for ACPC loading. Our observations allow a first proposal of the APM biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the lnmKLM genes unveiling key intermediates for β-alkylation in leinamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Leinamycin (LNM, 1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve β-alkylation of the polyketide intermediate, catalyzed by LnmKLM. Inactivation of lnmK, lnmL, or lnmM afforded mutant strains that accumulated LNM K-1 (2), K-2 (3), K-3 (4), and isomers LNM K-1' (5), K-2' (6), and K-3' (7) whose polyketide origin was established by feeding experiments with sodium [1-(13)C]acetate. These findings confirm the indispensability of LnmKLM in 1 biosynthesis and suggest that β-alkylation proceeds on the growing polyketide intermediate while bound to the LNM polyketide synthase.	1
Abstract2class: Recruitment of a foreign quinone into the A(1) site of photosystem I. II. Structural and functional characterization of phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway mutants by electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance studies of the photosystem (PS) I quinone acceptor, A(1), in phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway mutants are described. Room temperature continuous wave EPR measurements at X-band of whole cells of menA and menB interruption mutants show a transient reduction and oxidation of an organic radical with a g-value and anisotropy characteristic of a quinone. In PS I complexes, the continuous wave EPR spectrum of the photoaccumulated Q(-) radical, measured at Q-band, and the electron spin-polarized transient EPR spectra of the radical pair P700(+) Q(-), measured at X-, Q-, and W-bands, show three prominent features: (i) Q(-) has a larger g-anisotropy than native phylloquinone, (ii) Q(-) does not display the prominent methyl hyperfine couplings attributed to the 2-methyl group of phylloquinone, and (iii) the orientation of Q(-) in the A(1) site as derived from the spin polarization is that of native phylloquinone in the wild type. Electron spin echo modulation experiments on P700(+) Q(-) show that the dipolar coupling in the radical pair is the same as in native PS I, i.e. the distance between P700(+) and Q(-) (25.3 +/- 0.3 A) is the same as between P700(+) and A(1)(-) in the wild type. Pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance studies show two sets of resolved spectral features with nearly axially symmetric hyperfine couplings. They are tentatively assigned to the two methyl groups of the recruited plastoquinone-9, and their difference indicates a strong inequivalence among the two groups when in the A(1) site. These results show that Q (i) functions in accepting an electron from A(0)(-) and in passing the electron forward to the iron-sulfur clusters, (ii) occupies the A(1) site with an orientation similar to that of phylloquinone in the wild type, and (iii) has spectroscopic properties consistent with its identity as plastoquinone-9.	0
Abstract2class: Evidence of Naturalized Stress-Tolerant Strains of Escherichia coli in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants Abstract: Escherichia coli has been proposed to have two habitats-the intestines of mammals/birds and the nonhost environment. Our goal was to assess whether certain strains of E. coli have evolved toward adaptation and survival in wastewater. Raw sewage samples from different treatment plants were subjected to chlorine stress, and ∼59% of the surviving E. coli strains were found to contain a genetic insertion element (IS30) located within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region. The positional location of the IS30 element was not observed across a library of 845 E. coli isolates collected from various animal hosts or within GenBank or whole-genome reference databases for human and animal E. coli isolates (n = 1,177). Phylogenetics clustered the IS30 element-containing wastewater E. coli isolates into a distinct clade, and biomarker analysis revealed that these wastewater isolates contained a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarker pattern that was specific for wastewater. These isolates belonged to phylogroup A, possessed generalized stress response (RpoS) activity, and carried the locus of heat resistance, features likely relevant to nonhost environmental survival. Isolates were screened for 28 virulence genes but carried only the fimH marker. Our data suggest that wastewater contains a naturalized resident population of E. coli We developed an endpoint PCR targeting the IS30 element within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region, and all raw sewage samples (n = 21) were positive for this marker. Conversely, the prevalence of this marker in E. coli-positive surface and groundwater samples was low (≤5%). This simple PCR assay may represent a convenient microbial source-tracking tool for identification of water samples affected by municipal wastewater.                  Importance:                       The results of this study demonstrate that some strains of E. coli appear to have evolved to become naturalized populations in the wastewater environment and possess a number of stress-related genetic elements likely important for survival in this nonhost environment. The presence of non-host-adapted strains in wastewater challenges our understanding of using E. coli as a microbial indicator of wastewater treatment performance, suggesting that the E. coli strains present in human and animal feces may be very different from those found in treated wastewater.	0
Abstract2class: Functional Analyses of the Diels-Alderase Gene sol5 of Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani Indicate that the Solanapyrone Phytotoxins Are Not Required for Pathogenicity Abstract: Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani, the causal agents of Ascochyta blight of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and early blight of potato (Solanum tuberosum), respectively, produce a set of phytotoxic compounds including solanapyrones A, B, and C. Although both the phytotoxicity of solanapyrones and their universal production among field isolates have been documented, the role of solanapyrones in pathogenicity is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the sol5 gene, which encodes a Diels-Alderase that catalyzes the final step of solanapyrone biosynthesis. Deletion of sol5 in both Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani completely prevented production of solanapyrones and led to accumulation of the immediate precursor compound, prosolanapyrone II-diol, which is not toxic to plants. Deletion of sol5 did not negatively affect growth rate or spore production in vitro, and led to overexpression of the other solanapyrone biosynthesis genes, suggesting a possible feedback regulation mechanism. Phytotoxicity tests showed that solanapyrone A is highly toxic to several legume species and Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite the apparent phytotoxicity of solanapyrone A, pathogenicity tests showed that solanapyrone-minus mutants of Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani were equally virulent as their corresponding wild-type progenitors, suggesting that solanapyrones are not required for pathogenicity.	1
Abstract2class: Engineering Aspergillus nidulans for heterologous ent-kaurene and gamma-terpinene production Abstract: Terpenes are a large and varied group of natural products with a wide array of bioactivities and applications. The chemical production of industrially relevant terpenes can be expensive and time-consuming due to the structural complexity of these compounds. Here, we studied Aspergillus nidulans as a heterologous host for monoterpene and diterpene production. Previously, we identified a novel diterpene gene cluster in A. nidulans and showed that overexpression of the cluster-specific transcription factor (pbcR) led to ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene (PD) production. We report further characterization of the A. nidulans PD synthase gene (pbcA). In A. nidulans, overexpression of pbcA resulted in PD production, while deletion of pbcA abolished PD production. Overexpression of Fusarium fujikuroi ent-kaurene synthase (cps/ks) and Citrus unshiu gamma-terpinene synthase resulted in ent-kaurene and gamma-terpinene production, respectively. A. nidulans is a fungal model organism and a close relative to other industrially relevant Aspergillus species. A. nidulans is a known producer of many secondary metabolites, but its ability to produce heterologous monoterpene and diterpene compounds has not been characterized. Here, we show that A. nidulans is capable of heterologous terpene production and thus has potential as a production host for industrially relevant compounds. The genetic engineering principles reported here could also be applied to other Aspergilli.	1
Abstract2class: Multidimensional glycan arrays for enhanced antibody profiling Abstract: Carbohydrate-binding antibodies play a critical role in basic and clinical research. Monoclonal antibodies that bind glycans are used to measure carbohydrate expression, and serum antibodies to glycans can be important elements of the immune response to pathogens and vaccines. Carbohydrate antigen arrays, or glycan arrays, have emerged as powerful tools for the high-throughput analysis of carbohydrate-protein interactions. Our group has focused on the development and application of neoglycoprotein arrays, a unique array format wherein carbohydrates are covalently attached to a carrier protein prior to immobilization on the surface. The neoglycoprotein format permits variations of glycan structure, glycan density, and neoglycoprotein density on a single array. The focus of this study was on the effects of neoglycoprotein density on antibody binding. First, we evaluated binding of five monoclonal antibodies (81FR2.2, HE-195, HE-193, B480, and Z2A) to the blood group A antigen and found that neoglycoprotein density had a substantial effect on recognition. Next, we profiled serum antibodies in 15 healthy individuals and showed that inclusion of multiple neoglycoprotein densities helps distinguish different subpopulations of antibodies. Finally, we evaluated immune responses induced by a prostate cancer vaccine and showed that variations in neoglycoprotein density enable one to detect antibody responses that could not be detected otherwise. Neoglycoprotein density is a useful element of diversity for evaluating antibody recognition and, when combined with variations in glycan structure and glycan density, provides multidimensional glycan arrays with enhanced performance for monoclonal antibody development, biomarker discovery, and vaccine optimization.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the Antifungal Metabolite Chaetoglobosin P From Discosia rubi Using a Cryptococcus neoformans Inhibition Assay: Insights Into Mode of Action and Biosynthesis Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogen with limited options for treatments. We have interrogated extracts from fungal fermentations to find Cryptococcus-inhibiting natural products using assays for growth inhibition, differential thermosensitivity, and synergy with existing antifungal drugs. Extracts from fermentations of strains of Discosia rubi from eastern Texas showed anticryptococcal bioactivity with preferential activity in agar zone of inhibition assays against C. neoformans at 37°C versus 25°C. Assay-guided fractionation led to the purification and identification of chaetoglobosin P as the active component of these extracts. Genome sequencing of these strains revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with chaetoglobosin biosynthesis and β-methylation of the tryptophan residue. Proximity of genes of the actin-binding protein twinfilin-1 to the chaetoglobosin P and K gene clusters suggested a possible self-resistance mechanism involving twinfilin-1 which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action involving interference with the polymerization of the capping process of filamentous actin. A C. neoformans mutant lacking twinfilin-1 was hypersensitive to chaetoglobosin P. Chaetoglobosins also potentiated the effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on C. neoformans.	1
Abstract2class: Pore Engineering for One-Step Ethylene Purification from a Three-Component Hydrocarbon Mixture Abstract: Ethylene production from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures through one separation step is desirable but challenging because of the similar size and physical properties of acetylene, ethylene, and ethane. Herein, we report three new isostructural porous coordination networks (NPU-1, NPU-2, NPU-3; NPU represents Northwestern Polytechnical University) that are sustained by 9-connected nodes based upon a hexanuclear metal cluster of composition [Mn6(μ3-O)2(CH3COO)3]6+. NPU-1/2/3 exhibit a dual cage structure that was systematically fine-tuned in terms of cage size to realize selective adsorption of C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated that NPU-1 produces ethylene in >99.9% purity from a three-component gas mixture (1:1:1 C2H2/C2H4/C2H6). Molecular modeling studies revealed that the dual adsorption preference for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4 originates from (a) strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between electronegative carboxylate O atoms and C2H2 molecules in one cage and (b) multiple non-covalent interactions between the organic linkers of the host network and C2H6 molecules in the second cage.	0
Abstract2class: Gold(I)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,3-Diols through Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of Allenes Abstract: A gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of 1,3-diols was achieved by intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenes. The catalyst system 3-F-dppe(AuCl)2/(R)-C8-TRIPAg proved to be specifically efficient to promote the desymmetrizing cyclization of 2-aryl-1,3-diols, which have proven challenging substrates in previous reports. Multisubstituted tetrahydrofurans were prepared in good yield with good enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity by this method.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering the biosynthetic codes for the potent anti-SARS-CoV cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin in Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141 Abstract: Valinomycin was recently reported to be the most potent agent against severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in infected Vero E6 cells. Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal-peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid and L-lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate-specificity-conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Human G-CSF synthesis using stress-responsive bacterial proteins Abstract: We previously reported that under the stress condition caused by the addition of 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, a thiol-specific oxidant, to growing cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), a population of stress-responsive proteins [peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PpiB), bacterioferritin (Bfr), putative HTH-type transcriptional regulator yjdC (YjdC), dihydrofolate reductase (FolA), chemotaxis protein cheZ (CheZ), and glutathione synthetase (GshB)] were significantly upregulated when compared with the nonstress condition. When those stress-responsive proteins were used as fusion partners for the expression of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF), the solubility of hG-CSF was dramatically enhanced in E. coli cytoplasm, whereas almost all of the directly expressed hG-CSF were aggregated to inclusion bodies. In addition, the spectra of circular dichroism measured with the purified hG-CSF were identical to that of standard hG-CSF, implying that the synthesized hG-CSF has native conformation. These results indicate that the bacterial stress-responsive proteins could be potent fusion expression partners for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm.	0

Abstract2class: Nucleotide sequence of the leader region of the phenylalanine operon of Escherichia coli Abstract: The pheA structural gene of the phenylalanine operon of Escherichia coli is preceded by a transcribed leader region of about 170 nucleotide pairs. In vitro transcription of plasmids and restriction fragments containing the phe promoter and leader region yields a major RNA transcript about 140 nucleotides in length. This transcript, pheA leader RNA, has the following features: (i) a potential ribosome binding site and AUG translation start codon about 20 nucleotides from its 5' end; (ii) 14 additional in phase amino acid codons and a UGA stop codon after the AUG; 7 of these 14 are Phe codons; (iii) a 3'-OH terminus about 140 nucleotides from the 5' end (transcription termination occurs in an A.T-rich region which is subsequent to a G.C-rich region; just beyond the site of transcription termination there is a sequence corresponding to a ribosome binding site and the AUG translation start codon of the pheA structural gene); (iv) a sequence which would permit extensive intrastrand stable hydrogen bonding. In addition to G.C-rich stem structures, highly analogous to those proposed for the leader RNAs of the tryptophan operons of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium [Lee, F. & Yanofsky, C. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 4365-4369], there is also extensive base-pairing possible between the phe codon region and a more distal region of the leader transcript. The roles of synthesis of the Phe-rich leader peptide and secondary structure of the leader transcript in the regulation of transcription termination at the attenuator of the phe operon are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: DNA-scaffolded multivalent ligands to modulate cell function Abstract: We report a simple, versatile, multivalent ligand system that is capable of specifically and efficiently modulating cell-surface receptor clustering and function. The multivalent ligand is made of a polymeric DNA scaffold decorated with biorecognition ligands (i.e., antibodies) to interrogate and modulate cell receptor signaling and function. Using CD20 clustering-mediated apoptosis in B-cell cancer cells as a model system, we demonstrated that our multivalent ligand is significantly more effective at inducing apoptosis of target cancer cells than its monovalent counterpart. This multivalent DNA material approach represents a new chemical biology tool to interrogate cell receptor signaling and functions and to potentially manipulate such functions for the development of therapeutics.	0
Abstract2class: Terfestatins B and C, New p-Terphenyl Glycosides Produced by Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8 Abstract: Terfestatins B (1) and C (2), new p-terphenyls bearing a novel unsaturated hexuronic acid (4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronate), a unique β-D-glycosyl ester of 5-isoprenylindole-3-carboxylate (3) and the same rare sugar, and two new hygromycin precursors, were characterized as metabolites of the coal mine fire isolate Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8. EtOH damage neuroprotection assays using rat hippocampal-derived primary cell cultures with 1, 2, 3 and echoside B (a terfestatin C-3'-β-D-glucuronide from Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8) revealed 1 as potently neuroprotective, highlighting a new potential application of the terfestatin scaffold.	1
Abstract2class: Community dynamics and activity of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes in intertidal sediments of the Yangtze estuary Abstract: Diversity, abundance, and activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were investigated using the ammonia monooxygenase α subunit (amoA) in the intertidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary. Generally, AOB had a lower diversity of amoA genes than did AOA in this study. Clone library analysis revealed great spatial variations in both AOB and AOA communities along the estuary. The UniFrac distance matrix showed that all the AOB communities and 6 out of 7 AOA communities in the Yangtze Estuary were statistically indistinguishable between summer and winter. The studied AOB and AOA community structures were observed to correlate with environmental parameters, of which salinity, pH, ammonium, total phosphorus, and organic carbon had significant correlations with the composition and distribution of both communities. Also, the AOA communities were significantly correlated with sediment clay content. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results indicated that the abundance of AOB amoA genes was greater than that of AOA amoA genes in 10 of the 14 samples analyzed in this study. Potential nitrification rates were significantly greater in summer than in winter and had a significant negative correlation with salinity. In addition, potential nitrification rates were correlated strongly only with archaeal amoA gene abundance and not with bacterial amoA gene abundance. However, no significant differences were observed between rates measured with and without ampicillin (AOB inhibitor). These results implied that archaea might play a more important role in mediating the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in the Yangtze estuarine sediments.	0
Abstract2class: Nodularin, a cyanobacterial toxin, is synthesized in planta by symbiotic Nostoc sp Abstract: The nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Nostoc, is a commonly occurring cyanobacterium often found in symbiotic associations. We investigated the potential of cycad cyanobacterial endosymbionts to synthesize microcystin/nodularin. Endosymbiont DNA was screened for the aminotransferase domain of the toxin biosynthesis gene clusters. Five endosymbionts carrying the gene were screened for bioactivity. Extracts of two isolates inhibited protein phosphatase 2A and were further analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)/MS. Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' both contained nodularin. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HESI-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of nodularin at 9.55±2.4 ng μg-1 chlorophyll a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and 12.5±8.4 ng μg-1 Chl a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' extracts. Further scans indicated the presence of the rare isoform [L-Har(2)] nodularin, which contains L-homoarginine instead of L-arginine. Nodularin was also present at 1.34±0.74 ng ml(-1) (approximately 3 pmol per g plant ww) in the methanol root extracts of M. riedlei MZ65, while the presence of [L-Har(2)] nodularin in the roots of M. serpentina MZ73 was suggested by HPLC HESI-MS/MS analysis. The ndaA-B and ndaF genomic regions were sequenced to confirm the presence of the hybrid polyketide/non-ribosomal gene cluster. A seven amino-acid insertion into the NdaA-C1 domain of N. spumigena NSOR10 protein was observed in all endosymbiont-derived sequences, suggesting the transfer of the nda cluster from N. spumigena to terrestrial Nostoc species. This study demonstrates the synthesis of nodularin and [L-Har(2)] nodularin in a non-Nodularia species and the production of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin by a symbiont in planta.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular analysis of the Enterobacter sakazakii O-antigen gene locus Abstract: Nucleotide polymorphism associated with the O-antigen-encoding locus, rfb, in Enterobacter sakazakii was determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Based on the analysis of these DNA profiles, 12 unique banding patterns were detected among a collection of 62 strains from diverse origins. Two common profiles were identified and were designated serotypes O:1 and O:2. DNA sequencing of the 12,500-bp region flanked by galF and gnd identified 11 open reading frames, all with the same transcriptional direction. Analysis of the proximal region of both sequences demonstrated remarkable heterogeneity. A PCR assay targeting genes specific for the two prominent serotypes was developed and applied for the identification of these strains recovered from food, environmental, and clinical samples.	1
Abstract2class: In vitro Cas9-assisted editing of modular polyketide synthase genes to produce desired natural product derivatives Abstract: One major bottleneck in natural product drug development is derivatization, which is pivotal for fine tuning lead compounds. A promising solution is modifying the biosynthetic machineries of middle molecules such as macrolides. Although intense studies have established various methodologies for protein engineering of type I modular polyketide synthase(s) (PKSs), the accurate targeting of desired regions in the PKS gene is still challenging due to the high sequence similarity between its modules. Here, we report an innovative technique that adapts in vitro Cas9 reaction and Gibson assembly to edit a target region of the type I modular PKS gene. Proof-of-concept experiments using rapamycin PKS as a template show that heterologous expression of edited biosynthetic gene clusters produced almost all the desired derivatives. Our results are consistent with the promiscuity of modular PKS and thus, our technique will provide a platform to generate rationally designed natural product derivatives for future drug development.	1
Abstract2class: Acyl Histidines: New N-Acyl Amides from Legionella pneumophila Abstract: Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a Gram-negative gammaproteobacterial pathogen that infects and intracellularly replicates in human macrophages and a variety of protozoa. L. pneumophila encodes an orphan biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that contains isocyanide-associated biosynthetic genes and is upregulated during infection. Because isocyanide-functionalized metabolites are known to harbor invertebrate innate immunosuppressive activities in bacterial pathogen-insect interactions, we used pathway-targeted molecular networking and tetrazine-based chemoseletive ligation chemistry to characterize the metabolites from the orphan pathway in L. pneumophila. We also assessed their intracellular growth contributions in an amoeba and in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Unexpectedly, two distinct groups of aromatic amino acid-derived metabolites were identified from the pathway, including a known tyrosine-derived isocyanide and a family of new N-acyl-l-histidine metabolites.	0
Abstract2class: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolactone ring of the immunosuppressant FK506 Abstract: Biosynthesis of the macrolactone ring of FK506 involves 10 elongation cycles that mechanistically resemble the steps in fatty acid synthesis. Sequencing of a 40-kb DNA segment of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 has revealed two additional polyketide synthases (PKS) genes fkbB and fkbC which lie upstream of fkbA, a PKS gene recently shown to be responsible for the last four condensation steps of the FK506 biosynthesis [Motamedi, H., Cai, S. J., Shafiee, A. & Elliston, K. O. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 74-80]. fkbB and fkbC are contiguous and encode respectively, the first (790129 Da) and the second (374438 Da) components of the FK506 polyketide synthase, a complex of three multidomain polypeptides. The predicted domain structures of FkbB and FkbC are analogous to that of FkbA and comprise 30 fatty-acid-synthase(FAS)-like domains arranged in 6 modules. Each module performs a specific extension cycle in the assembly of the carbon skeleton of the FK506 macrolactone ring. The component activities for the initiation of the polyketide chain consisting of a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase and a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl CoA reductase required for the formation of the dihydrocyclohexylcarbonyl CoA starter unit and an acyl-carrier-protein to which the starter unit is anchored and translocated to the appropriate site on the PKS multienzyme are located at the N-terminal region of the FkbB polypeptide. A third gene, fkbL, lies at one end of the cluster and encodes lysine cyclodeaminase which catalyzes alpha-deamination and cyclization of the lysine into pipecolate. A fourth gene fkbP located at the other end of the sequence reported here encodes a peptide synthetase required for the activation and incorporation of the pipecolate moiety into the completed acyl chain. Finally the cluster carries a gene, fkbO, whose product is presumed to carry out a post-polyketide oxidation step of the FK506 marocycle.	1
Abstract2class: Autoregulation of microRNA biogenesis by let-7 and Argonaute Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a large family of small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in many biological pathways. Most miRNAs are derived from long primary transcripts that undergo processing by Drosha to produce ~65-nucleotide precursors that are then cleaved by Dicer, resulting in the mature 22-nucleotide forms. Serving as guides in Argonaute protein complexes, mature miRNAs use imperfect base pairing to recognize sequences in messenger RNA transcripts, leading to translational repression and destabilization of the target messenger RNAs. Here we show that the miRNA complex also targets and regulates non-coding RNAs that serve as substrates for the miRNA-processing pathway. We found that the Argonaute protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, ALG-1, binds to a specific site at the 3′ end of let-7 miRNA primary transcripts and promotes downstream processing events. This interaction is mediated by mature let-7 miRNA through a conserved complementary site in its own primary transcript, thus creating a positive-feedback loop. We further show that ALG-1 associates with let-7 primary transcripts in nuclear fractions. Argonaute also binds let-7 primary transcripts in human cells, demonstrating that the miRNA pathway targets non-coding RNAs in addition to protein-coding messenger RNAs across species. Moreover, our studies in C. elegans reveal a novel role for Argonaute in promoting biogenesis of a targeted transcript, expanding the functions of the miRNA pathway in gene regulation. This discovery of autoregulation of let-7 biogenesis establishes a new mechanism for controlling miRNA expression.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning, sequencing and heterologous expression of the medermycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. AM-7161: towards comparative analysis of the benzoisochromanequinone gene clusters Abstract: Medermycin is a Streptomyces aromatic C-glycoside antibiotic classified in the benzoisochromanequinones (BIQs), which presents several interesting biosynthetic problems concerning polyketide synthase (PKS), post-PKS tailoring and deoxysugar pathways. The biosynthetic gene cluster for medermycin (the med cluster) was cloned from Streptomyces sp. AM-7161. Completeness of the clone was proved by the heterologous expression of a cosmid carrying the entire med cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999 to produce medermycin. The DNA sequence of the cosmid (36 202 bp) revealed 34 complete ORFs, with an incomplete ORF at either end. Functional assignment of the deduced products was made for PKS and biosynthetically related enzymes, tailoring steps including strereochemical control, oxidation, angolosamine pathway, C-glycosylation, and regulation. The med cluster was estimated to be about 30 kb long, covering 29 ORFs. An unusual characteristic of the cluster is the disconnected organization of the minimal PKS genes: med-ORF23 encoding the acyl carrier protein is 20 kb apart from med-ORF1 and med-ORF2 for the two ketosynthase components. Secondly, the six genes (med-ORF14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 20) for the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar, angolosamine, are all contiguous. Finally, the finding of a glycosyltransferase gene, med-ORF8, suggests a possible involvement of conventional C-glycosylation in medermycin biosynthesis. Comparison among the three complete BIQ gene clusters - med and those for actinorhodin (act) and granaticin (gra) - revealed some common genes whose deduced functions are unavailable from database searches (the 'unknowns'). An example is med-ORF5, a homologue of actVI-ORF3 and gra-ORF18, which was highlighted by a recent proteomic analysis of S. coelicolor A3(2).	1
Abstract2class: An unusual amide synthetase (CouL) from the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A1 produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 contains two amide bonds. The biosynthetic gene cluster of coumermycin contains a putative amide synthetase gene, couL, encoding a protein of 529 amino acids. CouL was overexpressed as hexahistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, resulting in a nearly homogenous protein. CouL catalysed the formation of both amide bonds of coumermycin A1, i.e. between the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and two aminocoumarin moieties. Gel exclusion chromatography showed that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The activity was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The apparent Km values were determined as 26 micro m for the 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and 44 micro m for the aminocoumarin moiety, respectively. Several analogues of the pyrrole dicarboxylic acid were accepted as substrates. In contrast, pyridine carboxylic acids were not accepted. 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the acyl component in novobiocin biosynthesis, was well accepted, despite its structural difference from the genuine acyl substrate of CouL.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide beauvericin, a virulence factor of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauvericin, a cyclohexadepsipeptide ionophore from the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana, shows antibiotic, antifungal, insecticidal, and cancer cell antiproliferative and antihaptotactic (cell motility inhibitory) activity in vitro. The bbBeas gene encoding the BbBEAS nonribosomal peptide synthetase was isolated from B. bassiana and confirmed to be responsible for beauvericin biosynthesis by targeted disruption. BbBEAS utilizes D-2-hydroxyisovalerate (D-Hiv) and L-phenylalanine (Phe) for the iterative synthesis of a predicted N-methyl-dipeptidol intermediate, and forms the cyclic trimeric ester beauvericin from this intermediate in an unusual recursive process. Heterologous expression of the bbBeas gene in Escherichia coli to produce the 3189 amino acid, 351.9 kDa BbBEAS enzyme provided a strain proficient in beauvericin biosynthesis. Comparative infection assays with a BbBEAS knockout B. bassiana strain against three insect hosts revealed that beauvericin plays a highly significant but not indispensable role in virulence.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of ebelactone A: isotopic tracer, advanced precursor and genetic studies reveal a thioesterase-independent cyclization to give a polyketide β-lactone Abstract: Macrocyclization of polyketides generates arrays of molecular architectures that are directly linked to biological activities. The four-membered ring in oxetanones (β-lactones) is found in a variety of bioactive polyketides (for example, lipstatin, hymeglusin and ebelactone), yet details of its molecular assembly have not been extensively elucidated. Using ebelactone as a model system, and its producer Streptomyces aburaviensis ATCC 31860, labeling with sodium [1-(13)C,(18)O2]propionate afforded ebelactone A that contains (18)O at all oxygen sites. The pattern of (13)C-(18)O bond retention defines the steps for ebelactone biosynthesis, and demonstrates that β-lactone ring formation occurs by attack of a β-hydroxy group onto the carbonyl moiety of an acyclic precursor. Reaction of ebelactone A with N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) gives the β-hydroxyacyl thioester, which cyclizes quantitatively to give ebelactone A in aqueous ethanol. The putative gene cluster encoding the polyketide synthase (PKS) for biosynthesis of 1 was also identified; notably the ebelactone PKS lacks a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain and no stand alone TE was found. Thus the formation of ebelactone is not TE dependent, supporting the hypothesis that cyclization occurs on the PKS surface in a process that is modeled by the chemical cyclization of the NAC thioester.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of a d-Tryptophan-Containing Lasso Peptide, MS-271 Abstract: MS-271, produced by Streptomyces sp. M-271, is a lasso peptide natural product comprising 21 amino acid residues with a d-tryptophan at its C terminus. Because lasso peptides are ribosomal peptides, the biosynthesis of MS-271, especially the mechanism of d-Trp introduction, is of great interest. The MS-271 biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by draft genome sequencing of the MS-271 producer, and it was revealed that the precursor peptide contains all 21 amino acid residues including the C-terminal tryptophan. This suggested that the d-Trp residue is introduced by epimerization. Genes for modification enzymes such as a macrolactam synthetase (mslC), precursor peptide recognition element (mslB1), cysteine protease (mslB2), disulfide oxidoreductases (mslE, mslF), and a protein of unknown function (mslH) were found in the flanking region of the precursor peptide gene. Although obvious epimerase genes were absent in the cluster, heterologous expression of the putative MS-271 cluster in Streptomyces lividans showed that it contains all the necessary genes for MS-271 production including a gene for a new peptide epimerase. Furthermore, a gene-deletion experiment indicated that MslB1, -B2, -C and -H were indispensable for MS-271 production and that some interactions of the biosynthetic enzymes were essential for the biosynthesis of MS-271.	1
Abstract2class: Slow calcium-dependent inactivation of depletion-activated calcium current. Store-dependent and -independent mechanisms Abstract: Feedback regulation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels was studied in Jurkat leukemic T lymphocytes using whole cell recording and [Ca2+]i measurement techniques. CRAC channels were activated by passively depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under conditions of moderate intracellular Ca2+ buffering, elevating [Ca2+]o to 22 mM initiated an inward current through CRAC channels that declined slowly with a half-time of approximately 30 s. This slow inactivation was evoked by a rise in [Ca2+]i, as it was effectively suppressed by an elevated level of EFTA in the recording pipette that prevented increases in [Ca2+]i. Blockade of Ca2+ uptake into stores by thapsigargin with or without intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate reduced the extent of slow inactivation by approximately 50%, indicating that store refilling normally contributes significantly to this process. The store-independent (thapsigargin-insensitive) portion of slow inactivation was largely prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and by a structurally related compound, 1-norokadaone, but not by calyculin A nor by cyclosporin A and FK506 at concentrations that fully inhibit calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) in T cells. These results argue against the involvement of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B, or 3 in store-independent inactivation. We conclude that calcium acts through at least two slow negative feedback pathways to inhibit CRAC channels. Slow feedback inhibition of CRAC current is likely to play important roles in controlling the duration and dynamic behavior of receptor-generated Ca2+ signals.	0
Abstract2class: Computational Investigation of the Mechanism of Diels-Alderase PyrI4 Abstract: We studied the mechanisms of activation and stereoselectivity of a monofunctional Diels-Alderase (PyrI4)-catalyzed intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction that leads to formation of the key spiro-tetramate moiety in the biosynthesis of the pyrroindomycin family of natural products. Key activation effects of PyrI4 include acid catalysis and an induced-fit mechanism that cooperate with the unique "lid" feature of PyrI4 to stabilize the Diels-Alder transition state. PyrI4 enhances the intrinsic Diels-Alder stereoselectivity of the substrate and leads to stereospecific formation of the product.	0
Abstract2class: Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in vitro Applications Abstract: Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over-reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post-translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110-fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30 mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2 h of reaction.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of endophytic colonizing bacteria from agronomic crops and prairie plants Abstract: Endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without causing disease symptoms. In this study, 853 endophytic strains were isolated from aerial tissues of four agronomic crop species and 27 prairie plant species. We determined several phenotypic properties and found approximately equal numbers of gram-negative and gram-positive isolates. In a greenhouse study, 28 of 86 prairie plant endophytes were found to colonize their original hosts at 42 days postinoculation at levels of 3.5 to 7.7 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). More comprehensive colonization studies were conducted with 373 corn and sorghum endophytes. In growth room studies, none of the isolates displayed pathogenicity, and 69 of the strains were recovered from corn or sorghum seedlings at levels of 8.3 log(10) CFU/plant or higher. Host range greenhouse studies demonstrated that 26 of 29 endophytes were recoverable from at least one host other than corn and sorghum at levels of up to 5.8 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). Long-range dent corn greenhouse studies and field trials with 17 wild-type strains and 14 antibiotic-resistant mutants demonstrated bacterial persistence at significant average colonization levels ranging between 3.4 and 6.1 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight) up to 78 days postinoculation. Three prairie and three agronomic endophytes exhibiting the most promising levels of colonization and an ability to persist were identified as Cellulomonas, Clavibacter, Curtobacterium, and Microbacterium isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence, fatty acid, and carbon source utilization analyses. This study defines for the first time the endophytic nature of Microbacterium testaceum. These microorganisms may be useful for biocontrol and other applications.	0
Abstract2class: Site-Specific Immobilization of the Peptidoglycan Synthase PBP1B on a Surface Plasmon Resonance Chip Surface Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is one of the most powerful label-free methods to determine the kinetic parameters of molecular interactions in real time and in a highly sensitive way. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes present in most bacteria. Established protocols to analyze interactions of PBPs by SPR involve immobilization to an ampicillin-coated chip surface (a β-lactam antibiotic mimicking its substrate), thereby forming a covalent complex with the PBPs transpeptidase (TP) active site. However, PBP interactions measured with a substrate-bound TP domain potentially affect interactions near the TPase active site. Furthermore, in vivo PBPs are anchored in the inner membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane helix, and hence immobilization at the C-terminal TPase domain gives an orientation contrary to the in vivo situation. We designed a new procedure: immobilization of PBP by copper-free click chemistry at an azide incorporated in the N terminus. In a proof-of-principle study, we immobilized Escherichia coli PBP1B on an SPR chip surface and used this for the analysis of the well-characterized interaction of PBP1B with LpoB. The site-specific incorporation of the azide affords control over protein orientation, thereby resulting in a homogeneous immobilization on the chip surface. This method can be used to study topology-dependent interactions of any (membrane) protein.	0
Abstract2class: Control of Charge Carriers Trapping and Relaxation in Hematite by Oxygen Vacancy Charge: Ab Initio Non-adiabatic Molecular Dynamics Abstract: Ultrafast charge recombination in hematite (α-Fe2O3) severely limits its applications in solar energy conversion and utilization, for instance, in photoelectrochemical water splitting. We report the first time-domain ab initio study of charge relaxation dynamics in α-Fe2O3 with and without the oxygen vacancy (Ov) defect, using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics implemented within time-dependent density functional theory. The simulations show that the hole trapping is the rate-limiting step in the electron-hole recombination process for both neutral and ionized Ov systems. The electron trapping is fast, and the trapped electron are relatively long-lived. A similar asymmetry is found for the relaxation of free charge carriers: relaxation of photoholes in the valence band is slower than relaxation of photoelectrons in the conduction band. The slower dynamics of holes offers an advantage to water oxidation at α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Notably, the neutral Ov defect accelerates significantly the charge recombination rate, by about a factor of 30 compared to the ideal lattice, due to the stronger electron-vibrational coupling at the defect. However, the recombination rate in the ionized Ov defect is decreased by a factor of 10 with respect to the neutral defect, likely due to expansion of the local iron shell around the Ov site. The Ov defect ionization in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is important for increasing both electrical conductivity and charge carrier lifetimes. The simulations reproduce well the time scales for the hot carrier cooling, trapping and recombination available from transient spectroscopy experiments, and suggest two alternative mechanisms for the Ov-assisted electron-hole recombination. The study provides a detailed atomistic understanding of carrier dynamics in hematite, and rationalizes the experimentally reported activation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by incorporation of Ov defects.	0
Abstract2class: Synthetic tetra-acylated derivatives of lipid A from Porphyromonas gingivalis are antagonists of human TLR4 Abstract: Tetra-acylated lipid As derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS have been synthesized using a key disaccharide intermediate functionalized with levulinate (Lev), allyloxycarbonate (Alloc) and anomeric dimethylthexylsilyl (TDS) as orthogonal protecting groups and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbamate (Fmoc) and azido as amino protecting groups. Furthermore, an efficient cross-metathesis has been employed for the preparation of the unusual branched R-(3)-hydroxy-13-methyltetradecanic acid and (R)-3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoic acid of P. gingivalis lipid A. Biological studies have shown that the synthetic lipid As cannot activate human and mouse TLR2 and TLR4 to produce cytokines. However, it has been found that the compounds are potent antagonist of cytokine secretion by human monocytic cells induced by enteric LPS.	0
Abstract2class: HPLC-based activity profiling: discovery of piperine as a positive GABA(A) receptor modulator targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site Abstract: A plant extract library was screened for GABA(A) receptor activity making use of a two-microelectrode voltage clamp assay on Xenopus laevis oocytes. An ethyl acetate extract of black pepper fruits [Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) 100 microg/mL] potentiated GABA-induced chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors (composed of alpha(1), beta(2), and gamma(2S) subunits) by 169.1 +/- 2.4%. With the aid of an HPLC-based activity profiling approach, piperine (5) was identified as the main active compound, together with 12 structurally related less active or inactive piperamides (1-4, 6-13). Identification was achieved by on-line high-resolution mass spectrometry and off-line microprobe 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, using only milligram amounts of extract. Compound 5 induced a maximum potentiation of the chloride currents by 301.9 +/- 26.5% with an EC(50) of 52.4 +/- 9.4 microM. A comparison of the modulatory activity of 5 and other naturally occurring piperamides enabled insights into structural features critical for GABA(A) receptor modulation. The stimulation of chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors by compound 5 was not antagonized by flumazenil (10 microM). These data show that piperine (5) represents a new scaffold of positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulators targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium Abstract: Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density-dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain Nostoc punctiforme, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high-titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.	1

Abstract2class: Measurement and modeling of multiple substrate oxidation by methanotrophs at 20 degrees C Abstract: Earlier experiments have shown that when Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was grown at 30 degrees C, greater growth and degradation of chlorinated ethenes was observed under particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)-expressing conditions than sMMO-expressing conditions. The effect of temperature on the growth and ability of methanotrophs to degrade chlorinated ethenes, however, has not been examined, particularly temperatures more representative of groundwater systems. Thus, experiments were performed at 20 degrees C to examine the effect of mixtures of trichloroethylene, trans-dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride in the presence of methane on the growth and ability of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b cells to degrade these pollutants. Although the maximal rates of chlorinated ethane degradation were greater by M. trichosporium OB3b expressing sMMO as compared with the same cell expressing pMMO, the growth and ability of sMMO-expressing cells to degrade these cosubstrates was substantially inhibited in their presence as compared with the same cell expressing pMMO. The Delta model developed earlier was found to be useful for predicting the effect of chlorinated ethenes on the growth and ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to degrade these compounds at a growth temperature of 20 degrees C. Finally, it was also discovered that at 20 degrees C, cells expressing pMMO exhibited faster turnover of methane than sMMO-expressing cells, unlike that found earlier at 30 degrees C, suggesting that temperature may exert selective pressure on methanotrophic communities to express sMMO or pMMO.	0
Abstract2class: Control of the Stereochemical Course of [4+2] Cycloaddition during trans-Decalin Formation by Fsa2-Family Enzymes Abstract: Enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition has been proposed to be a key transformation process in various natural product biosynthetic pathways. Recently Fsa2 was found to be involved in stereospecific trans-decalin formation during the biosynthesis of equisetin, a potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitor. To understand the mechanisms by which fsa2 determines the stereochemistry of reaction products, we sought an fsa2 homologue that is involved in trans-decalin formation in the biosynthetic pathway of an enantiomerically opposite analogue, and we found phm7, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phomasetin. A decalin skeleton with an unnatural configuration was successfully constructed by gene replacement of phm7 with fsa2, thus demonstrating enzymatic control of all stereochemistry in the [4+2] cycloaddition. Our findings highlight enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition as a stereochemically divergent step in natural product biosynthetic pathways and open new avenues for generating derivatives with different stereochemistry.	1
Abstract2class: Selvamicin, an atypical antifungal polyene from two alternative genomic contexts Abstract: The bacteria harbored by fungus-growing ants produce a variety of small molecules that help maintain a complex multilateral symbiosis. In a survey of antifungal compounds from these bacteria, we discovered selvamicin, an unusual antifungal polyene macrolide, in bacterial isolates from two neighboring ant nests. Selvamicin resembles the clinically important antifungals nystatin A1 and amphotericin B, but it has several distinctive structural features: a noncationic 6-deoxymannose sugar at the canonical glycosylation site and a second sugar, an unusual 4-O-methyldigitoxose, at the opposite end of selvamicin's shortened polyene macrolide. It also lacks some of the pharmacokinetic liabilities of the clinical agents and appears to have a different target. Whole genome sequencing revealed the putative type I polyketide gene cluster responsible for selvamicin's biosynthesis including a subcluster of genes consistent with selvamicin's 4-O-methyldigitoxose sugar. Although the selvamicin biosynthetic cluster is virtually identical in both bacterial producers, in one it is on the chromosome, in the other it is on a plasmid. These alternative genomic contexts illustrate the biosynthetic gene cluster mobility that underlies the diversity and distribution of chemical defenses by the specialized bacteria in this multilateral symbiosis.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a second tetracycline-inducible polypeptide encoded by Tn10 Abstract: Three Tn10 polypeptides were detected by analyzing the proteins synthesized in ultraviolet light-irradiated Escherichia coli cells after infection with lambda::Tn10. One of these polypeptides was the previously identified 36,000-dalton TET polypeptide. The other two had approximate sizes of 25,000 and 13,000 daltons. The syntheses of both the TET polypeptide and the 25,000-dalton polypeptide were inducible by tetracycline in lambda-immune hosts. Similarly, the synthesis of the TET polypeptide was inducible in nonimmune hosts. However, the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton polypeptide was constitutive in nonimmune hosts. An amber mutation in a gene required for tetracycline resistance on lambda::Tn10 was isolated that eliminated the synthesis of the TET polypeptide in sup+ hosts but not the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton or the 13,000-dalton polypeptides. The expression of tetracycline resistance from wild-type Tn10 was found to be anomalous in E. coli strains carrying the amber suppressors supD, supE, and supF. In general, strains containing these nonsense suppressors were less resistant to tetracycline.	0
Abstract2class: Biological effects of paenilamicin, a secondary metabolite antibiotic produced by the honey bee pathogenic bacterium Paenibacillus larvae Abstract: Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood (AFB) a world-wide distributed devastating disease of the honey bee brood. Previous comparative genome analysis and more recently, the elucidation of the bacterial genome, provided evidence that this bacterium harbors putative functional nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) and therefore, might produce nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs). Such biosynthesis products have been shown to display a wide-range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activity. Herein we present an in silico analysis of the first NRPS/PKS hybrid of P. larvae and we show the involvement of this cluster in the production of a compound named paenilamicin (Pam). For the characterization of its in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, a knock-out mutant strain lacking the production of Pam was constructed and subsequently compared to wild-type species. This led to the identification of Pam by mass spectrometry. Purified Pam-fractions showed not only antibacterial but also antifungal and cytotoxic activities. The latter suggested a direct effect of Pam on honey bee larval death which could, however, not be corroborated in laboratory infection assays. Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death. We propose that Pam, although not essential for larval mortality, is a virulence factor of P. larvae influencing the time course of disease. These findings are not only of significance in elucidating and understanding host-pathogen interactions but also within the context of the quest for new compounds with antibiotic activity for drug development.	1
Abstract2class: A feed-forward signalling circuit controls bacterial virulence through linking cyclic di-GMP and two mechanistically distinct sRNAs, ArcZ and RsmB Abstract: Dickeya dadantii is a plant pathogen that causes soft rot disease on vegetable and potato crops. To successfully cause infection, this pathogen needs to coordinately modulate the expression of genes encoding several virulence determinants, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), type III secretion system (T3SS) and flagellar motility. Here, we uncover a novel feed-forward signalling circuit for controlling virulence. Global RNA chaperone Hfq interacts with an Hfq-dependent sRNA ArcZ and represses the translation of pecT, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. We demonstrate that the ability of ArcZ to be processed to a 50 nt 3'- end fragment is essential for its regulation of pecT. PecT down-regulates PCWDE and the T3SS by repressing the expression of a global post-transcriptional regulator- (RsmA-) associated sRNA encoding gene rsmB. In addition, we show that the protein levels of two cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), GcpA and GcpL, are repressed by Hfq. Further studies show that both DGCs are essential for the Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional regulation on RsmB. Overall, our report provides new insights into the interplays between ubiquitous signalling transduction systems that were most studied independently and sheds light on multitiered regulatory mechanisms for a precise disease regulation in bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Polyphyly of non-bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri sharing a lux-locus deletion Abstract: This study reports the first description and molecular characterization of naturally occurring, non-bioluminescent strains of Vibrio fischeri. These 'dark' V. fischeri strains remained non-bioluminescent even after treatment with both autoinducer and aldehyde, substrate additions that typically maximize light production in dim strains of luminous bacteria. Surprisingly, the entire lux locus (eight genes) was absent in over 97% of these dark V. fischeri strains. Although these strains were all collected from a Massachusetts (USA) estuary in 2007, phylogenetic reconstructions allowed us to reject the hypothesis that these newly described non-bioluminescent strains exhibit monophyly within the V. fischeri clade. These dark strains exhibited a competitive disadvantage against native bioluminescent strains when colonizing the light organ of the model V. fischeri host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. Significantly, we believe that the data collected in this study may suggest the first observation of a functional, parallel locus-deletion event among independent lineages of a non-pathogenic bacterial species.	0
Abstract2class: Difficidin and oxydifficidin: novel broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotics produced by Bacillus subtilis. I. Production, taxonomy and antibacterial activity Abstract: Difficidin and oxydifficidin, two novel macrocyclic polyene lactone phosphate esters were discovered in fermentation broths of each of two strains of Bacillus subtilis: ATCC 39320 and ATCC 39374. Difficidin and oxydifficidin each showed a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Many of the susceptible aerobes and anaerobes were human pathogens resistant to one or more antibiotics. Difficidin and oxydifficidin when administered intraperitoneally protected mice against an otherwise lethal bacteremia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (ED50 in mg/kg of 1.31 and 15.6 respectively). Neither difficidin nor oxydifficidin were effective when administered via the subcutaneous route.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of cryptic prophages (monocins) in Listeria and sequence analysis of a holin/endolysin gene Abstract: Monocins in Listeria were induced by UV-irradiation of liquid cultures, and defective phage particles were purified from the lysates. Electron microscopy showed flexible, non-contractile bacteriophage-tail-like particles, consisting of specific proteins of molecular mass 20-45 kDa and pI 4.6-6.7. These particles were able to lyse listerial cells. DNA sequence homologies between chromosomal DNA of monocin-producing strains and labelled Listeria phage DNAs were inferred from DNA/DNA hybridizations, suggesting that most of the prophage DNA is still present in the listerial chromosome. An endolysin gene cpl2438 was cloned from listerial chromosomal DNA and was identified by its expression of lytic activity against Listeria cells in a bioassay. The gene consists of 864 nt encoding a protein of 287 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 32975 Da (CPL2438). This is in good agreement with the size of a protein observed in SDS-PAGE after overexpression of the lytic protein in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a putative holin gene (hol2438, 291 nt) upstream of cpl2438 was determined after PCR-amplification of listerial DNA and it shows typical features common to the holin gene family. Expression of the encoded protein (HOL2438, 95 aa, 10.1 kDa) in E. coli was found to be lethal for the host cells. The results underline the close relationship between monocins and intact Listeria bacteriophages, indicating that monocins are incompletely assembled phage particles derived from cryptic prophages of Listeria, probably including the phage lysin.	0
Abstract2class: Cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds during biosynthesis of the griseorhodin a spiroketal pharmacophore Abstract: The rubromycins, such as gamma-rubromycin, heliquinomycin, and griseorhodin A, are a family of extensively modified aromatic polyketides that inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and human telomerase. Telomerase inhibition crucially depends on the presence of a spiroketal moiety that is unique among aromatic polyketides. Biosynthetic incorporation of this pharmacophore into the rubromycins results in a dramatic distortion of the overall polyketide structure, but how this process is achieved by the cell has been obscure. To identify the enzymes involved in spiroketal construction, we generated 14 gene-deletion variants of the griseorhodin A biosynthetic gene cluster isolated from the tunicate-associated bacterium Streptomyces sp. JP95. Heterologous expression and metabolic analysis allowed for an assignment of most genes to various stages of griseorhodin tailoring and pharmacophore generation. The isolation of the novel advanced intermediate lenticulone, which exhibits cytotoxic, antibacterial, and elastase-inhibiting activity, provided direct evidence that the spiroketal is formed by cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds in a pentangular polyketide precursor. This remarkable transformation is followed by an epoxidation catalyzed by an unusual cytochrome P450/NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase pair that utilizes a saturated substrate. In addition, the absolute configuration of griseorhodin A was determined by quantum-chemical circular dichroism (CD) calculations in combination with experimental CD measurements.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase and its engineering to orsellinic acid synthase for spirotetronate generation Abstract: The enzymes 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthases (6-MSASs) are involved in the building of an aryl moiety in many bioactive secondary metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. Using the bacterial 6-MSAS ChlB1 in the biosynthesis of spirotetronate antibiotic chlorothricin (CHL) as a model, functional analysis of its dehydratase (DH) and ketoreductase (KR) domains by site-specific mutagenesis revealed that selective ketoreduction is not essential for polyketide chain extension. Promiscuity of the ketoacylsynthase domain in beta functionality recognition allows for engineering ChlB1 to an orsellinic acid (OSA) synthase (OSAS) by inactivating KR at the active site. The engineered ChlB1 is compatible with the enzymes for late-stage tailoring in CHL biosynthesis, featuring specific protein recognitions that facilitate variable aryl group incorporation. The resulting spirotetronates, which bear an OSA-derived aryl group, exhibited antibacterial activities comparable to those of the parent products.	1
Abstract2class: Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine Abstract: Disease-causing mutations occur in genes for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. That some mutations are dominant suggests a gain of function. Native tRNA synthetases, such as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, catalyze aminoacylation and are also procytokines that are activated by natural fragmentation. In principle, however, gain-of-function phenotypes could arise from mutational activation of synthetase procytokines. From crystal structure analysis, we hypothesized that a steric block of a critical Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif in full-length TyrRS suppresses the cytokine activity of a natural fragment. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to uncover ELR in the procytokine by mutating a conserved tyrosine (Y341) that tethers ELR. Site-specific proteolytic cleavage and small-angle X-ray scattering established subtle opening of the structure by the mutation. Strikingly, four different assays demonstrated mutational activation of cytokine functions. The results prove the possibilities for constitutive gain-of-function mutations in tRNA synthetases.	0
Abstract2class: The electrophilic and leaving group phosphates in the catalytic mechanism of yeast pyrophosphatase Abstract: Binding of pyrophosphate or two phosphate molecules to the pyrophosphatase (PPase) active site occurs at two subsites, P1 and P2. Mutations at P2 subsite residues (Y93F and K56R) caused a much greater decrease in phosphate binding affinity of yeast PPase in the presence of Mn(2+) or Co(2+) than mutations at P1 subsite residues (R78K and K193R). Phosphate binding was estimated in these experiments from the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis at a sub-K(m) concentration of ATP. Tight phosphate binding required four Mn(2+) ions/active site. These data identify P2 as the high affinity subsite and P1 as the low affinity subsite, the difference in the affinities being at least 250-fold. The time course of five "isotopomers" of phosphate that have from zero to four (18)O during [(18)O]P(i)-[(16)O]H(2)O oxygen exchange indicated that the phosphate containing added water is released after the leaving group phosphate during pyrophosphate hydrolysis. These findings provide support for the structure-based mechanism in which pyrophosphate hydrolysis involves water attack on the phosphorus atom located at the P2 subsite of PPase.	0
Abstract2class: Sterol carrier protein-2 directly interacts with caveolin-1 in vitro and in vivo Abstract: HDL-mediated reverse-cholesterol transport as well as phosphoinositide signaling are mediated through plasma membrane microdomains termed caveolae/lipid rafts. However, relatively little is known regarding mechanism(s) whereby these lipids traffic to or are targeted to caveolae/lipid rafts. Since sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) binds both cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol, the possibility that SCP-2 might interact with caveolin-1 and caveolae was examined. Double immunolabeling and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy showed that a small but significant portion of SCP-2 colocalized with caveolin-1 primarily at the plasma membrane of L-cells and more so within intracellular punctuate structures in hepatoma cells. In SCP-2 overexpressing L-cells, SCP-2 was detected in close proximity to caveolin, 48 +/- 4 A, as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and immunogold electron microscopy. Cell fractionation of SCP-2 overexpressing L-cells and Western blotting detected SCP-2 in purified plasma membranes, especially in caveolae/ lipid rafts as compared to the nonraft fraction. SCP-2 and caveolin-1 were coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-caveolin-1 and anti-SCP-2. Finally, a yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that SCP-2 directly interacts with caveolin-1 in vivo. These interactions of SCP-2 with caveolin-1 were specific since a functionally related protein, phosphatidyinositol transfer protein (PITP), colocalized much less well with caveolin-1, was not in close proximity to caveolin-1 (i.e., >120 A), and was not coimmunoprecipitated by anti-caveolin-1 from cell lysates. In summary, it was shown for the first time that SCP-2 (but not PITP) selectively interacted with caveolin-1, both within the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. These data contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of SCP-2 in cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol targeted from intracellular sites of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to caveolae/lipid rafts at the cell surface plasma membrane.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Antimicrobial Peptide Penisin, a Class Ia Novel Lantibiotic from Paenibacillus sp. Strain A3 Abstract: Attempts to isolate novel antimicrobial peptides from microbial sources have been on the rise recently, despite their low efficacy in therapeutic applications. Here, we report identification and characterization of a new efficient antimicrobial peptide from a bacterial strain designated A3 that exhibited highest identity with Paenibacillus ehimensis. Upon purification and subsequent molecular characterization of the antimicrobial peptide, referred to as penisin, we found the peptide to be a bacteriocin-like peptide. Consistent with these results, RAST analysis of the entire genome sequence revealed the presence of a lantibiotic gene cluster containing genes necessary for synthesis and maturation of a lantibiotic. While circular dichroism and one-dimension nuclear magnetic resonance experiments confirmed a random coil structure of the peptide, similar to other known lantibiotics, additional biochemical evidence suggests posttranslational modifications of the core peptide yield six thioether cross-links. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative biosynthetic gene penA showed approximately 74% similarity with elgicin A and 50% similarity with the lantibiotic paenicidin A. Penisin effectively killed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and did not exhibit hemolysis activity. Unlike other lantibiotics, it effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, 80 mg/kg of body weight of penisin significantly reduced bacterial burden in a mouse thigh infection model and protected BALB/c mice in a bacteremia model entailing infection with Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, suggesting that it could be a promising new antimicrobial peptide.	1

Abstract2class: Mechanistic insights into the LsrK kinase required for autoinducer-2 quorum sensing activation Abstract: In enteric bacteria, the kinase LsrK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the C5-hydroxyl group in the linear form of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor of the type II bacterial quorum sensing molecule (AI-2). This phosphorylation is required for AI-2 sequestration in the cytoplasm and subsequent derepression of AI-2-related genes necessary for quorum development. While LsrK is a critical enzyme within the DPD quorum sensing relay system, kinetic details of this kinase have yet to be reported. A continuous UV-vis spectrophotometric assay was developed that allowed steady-state kinetic analysis of LsrK to be undertaken with the substrates ATP and DPD. The data was most consistent with a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with ATP binding first: kcat (7.4 ± 0.6 s(-1)), Km,ATP (150 ± 30 μM) and Km(app),DPD (1.0 ± 0.2 mM). The assay also allowed a DPD substrate profile to be conducted, which provided an unexpected biochemical disconnect between the previous agonist/antagonist cell-based reporter assay and the LsrK assay presented herein. Together these findings raise the importance of LsrK and lay the foundation not only for further understanding of this enzyme and its critical biological role but also for the rational design of regulatory molecules targeting AI-2 quorum sensing in pathogenic bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Five gene products are required for assembly of the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 Abstract: Coumermycin A1 is an aminocoumarin antibiotic produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis. It exhibits potent antibacterial and anticancer activity. The coumermycin A1 molecule contains two terminal 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moieties and one central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid moiety (CPM). While the biosynthesis of the terminal moieties has been elucidated in detail, the pathway leading to the CPM remains poorly understood. In this work, the minimal set of genes required for the generation of the CPM scaffold was identified. It comprises the five genes couR1, couR2a, couR2b, couR3, and couR4 which are grouped together in a contiguous 4.7 kb region within the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster. The DNA fragment containing these genes was cloned into an expression plasmid and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. Thereupon, the formation of CPM could be shown by HPLC and by HPLC-MS/MS, in comparison to an authentic CPM standard. This proves that the genes couR1-couR4 are sufficient to direct the biosynthesis of CPM, and that the adjacent genes couR5 and couR6 are not required for this pathway. The enzyme CouR3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The protein exhibited an ATPase activity similar to that reported for its close ortholog, the threonine kinase PduX. However, we could not show a threonine kinase activity of CouR3, and; therefore, the substrate of CouR3 in CPM biosynthesis is still unknown and may be different from threonine.	1
Abstract2class: Carbon-starvation induction of the ugp operon, encoding the binding protein-dependent sn-glycerol-3-phosphate transport system in Escherichia coli Abstract: The gene products of the ugp operon of Escherichia coli are responsible for the uptake of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and certain glycerophosphodiesters. The regulation of ugp is mainly phoBR-dependent. Significant expression, however, can be observed even in the presence of high concentrations of phosphate, a condition which normally completely represses pho expression. Pho-independent ugp expression was found to be derepressed during the late logarithmic growth phase due to carbon starvation. Among different carbon sources tested, glucose caused the most complete repression. Addition of cAMP prevented glucose repression, indicating that a cAMP-CRP control mechanism may be directly or indirectly involved in the carbon-starvation response. This conclusion is supported by the fact that pho-independent ugp expression correlated with the presence of the cya and crp gene products.	0
Abstract2class: A kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu species reverses streptomycin dependence of Escherichia coli strains mutated in ribosomal protein S12 Abstract: Streptomycin dependence can be caused by mutations in ribosomal protein S12. Mutations suppressing such streptomycin dependence have been found in ribosomal proteins S4 and S5, and in 16S rRNA. Here a new suppressor mutation localized in elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is described, consistent with recent models of ribosome-EF-Tu-tRNA interaction at the decoding centre. The EF-Tu mutation was obtained by genetic selection for streptomycin independence; it was identified as Ala375 --> Thr, previously described as EF-TuA(R) and known to confer a kirromycin-resistant, error-prone phenotype. Also, other streptomycin-dependent (SmD) S12 mutations could be complemented by this mutation. The streptomycin-independent (Sm1) strain grows more slowly than the wild-type (wt), suggesting that not all the defects of the S12 mutation can be complemented by EF-Tu[A375T]. Moreover, this strain is more susceptible than wt to reduction in the cellular EF-Tu concentration, and disruption of tufB led to considerable growth-rate impairment. Expression of EF-Tu from tufB, not only of wt EF-Tu and EF-Tu[A375T] but, remarkably, also of EF-Tu[G222D], known as EF-TuB0 and defective in protein synthesis, equally contributed to cell growth. In vitro analysis revealed a decreased translational activity of wt EF-Tu with SmD ribosomes as compared to EF-Tu[A375T], while EF-Tu[G222D] showed no activity at all, just as with wt ribosomes. Possible mechanisms are discussed for the improved growth rate observed in such Sm1 strains when they include wt EF-Tu or EF-Tu[G222D].	0
Abstract2class: Polyketide-chain branching by an enzymatic Michael addition Abstract: A new "branch" for polyketide synthases was discovered in the biosynthesis of the antimitotic rhizoxin complex in the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica. Genetic engineering and the structural elucidation of pathway intermediates revealed that a complex polyketide chain is branched at the beta position by an unprecedented conjugate addition of an acetyl building block to an acryloyl precursor (see scheme).	1
Abstract2class: Genomics of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake in pseudomonads Abstract: Pyoverdines (PVDs) are complex siderophores produced by members of the fluorescent Pseudomonas. They comprise a dihydroxyquinoline fluorescent chromophore joined to a peptide of remarkably variable length and composition. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PVDs also function as signal molecules for the production of virulence factors. Genes responsible for the biosynthesis, excretion, uptake and regulation of these high-affinity siderophores are located either at a single locus or at up to three different loci in the genomes of the four pseudomonads analyzed. The peptide backbone of PVD is assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and modified by accessory enzymes in the cytoplasm, and probably the periplasm. Regulation of PVD production and uptake depends on two extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ECF-sigmas), PvdS and FpvI, together with one anti-sigma, FpvR.	1
Abstract2class: Catalytic Carbocation Generation Enabled by the Mesolytic Cleavage of Alkoxyamine Radical Cations Abstract: A new catalytic method is described to access carbocation intermediates via the mesolytic cleavage of alkoxyamine radical cations. In this process, electron transfer between an excited state oxidant and a TEMPO-derived alkoxyamine substrate gives rise to a radical cation with a remarkably weak C-O bond. Spontaneous scission results in the formation of the stable nitroxyl radical TEMPO(.) as well as a reactive carbocation intermediate that can be intercepted by a wide range of nucleophiles. Notably, this process occurs under neutral conditions and at comparatively mild potentials, enabling catalytic cation generation in the presence of both acid sensitive and easily oxidized nucleophilic partners.	0
Abstract2class: Actinopolysporins A-C and tubercidin as a Pdcd4 stabilizer from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600 Abstract: Our current natural product program utilizes new actinomycetes originating from unexplored and underexplored ecological niches, employing cytotoxicity against a selected panel of cancer cell lines as the preliminary screen to identify hit strains for natural product dereplication, followed by mechanism-based assays of the purified natural products to discover potential anticancer drug leads. Three new linear polyketides, actinopolysporins A (1), B (2), and C (3), along with the known antineoplastic antibiotic tubercidin (4), were isolated from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600, and the structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. All four compounds were assayed for their ability to stabilize the tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), which is known to antagonize critical events in oncogenic pathways. Only 4 significantly inhibited proteasomal degradation of a model Pdcd4-luciferase fusion protein, with an IC50 of 0.88±0.09 μM, unveiling a novel biological activity for this well-studied natural product.	0
Abstract2class: Iterative Mechanism of Macrodiolide Formation in the Anticancer Compound Conglobatin Abstract: Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment, encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through engineering of the polyketide synthase.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the complete zwittermicin A biosynthesis gene cluster from Bacillus cereus Abstract: Bacillus cereus UW85 produces the linear aminopolyol antibiotic zwittermicin A (ZmA). This antibiotic has diverse biological activities, such as suppression of disease in plants caused by protists, inhibition of fungal and bacterial growth, and amplification of the insecticidal activity of the toxin protein from Bacillus thuringiensis. ZmA has an unusual chemical structure that includes a d amino acid and ethanolamine and glycolyl moieties, as well as having an unusual terminal amide that is generated from the modification of the nonproteinogenic amino acid beta-ureidoalanine. The diverse biological activities and unusual structure of ZmA have stimulated our efforts to understand how this antibiotic is biosynthesized. Here, we present the identification of the complete ZmA biosynthesis gene cluster from B. cereus UW85. A nearly identical gene cluster is identified on a plasmid from B. cereus AH1134, and we show that this strain is also capable of producing ZmA. Bioinformatics and biochemical analyses of the ZmA biosynthesis enzymes strongly suggest that ZmA is initially biosynthesized as part of a larger metabolite that is processed twice, resulting in the formation of ZmA and two additional metabolites. Additionally, we propose that the biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of the amino sugar kanosamine is contained within the ZmA biosynthesis gene cluster in B. cereus UW85.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 29050 genes encoding doxorubicin polyketide synthase Abstract: The dps genes of Streptomyces peucetius, encoding daunorubicin (DNR)-doxorubicin (DXR) polyketide synthase (PKS), are largely within an 8.7-kb region of DNA that has been characterized by Southern analysis, and gene sequencing, mutagenesis and expression experiments. This region contains nine ORFs, many of whose predicted products are homologous to known PKS enzymes. Surprisingly, the gene encoding the DXR PKS acyl carrier protein is not in this region, but is located about 10 kb distant from the position it usually occupies in other gene clusters encoding type-II PKS. An in-frame deletion in the dpsB gene, encoding a putative subunit of the DXR PKS, resulted in loss of production of DXR and the known intermediates of its biosynthetic pathway, confirming that this gene and, by implication, the adjacent dps genes are required for DXR biosynthesis. This was verified by expression of the dps genes in the heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, which resulted in the production of aklanonic acid, an early intermediate of DXR biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of an autoinhibitory domain in human mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-activated protein kinase 2, a Ser/Thr kinase, is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase. Sequence analysis of a clone isolated from the human HL-60 cell line revealed a 370-amino acid protein with a proline-rich N terminus, a highly conserved catalytic domain, and a C-terminal region containing a MAP kinase phosphorylation site. To better understand how the kinase is regulated, mutation analysis was used to map the functional domain(s). The wild type recombinant kinase had a low basal activity as detected by phosphorylation of a substrate peptide derived from the N terminus of glycogen synthase. Deletion of the proline-rich N terminus showed little effect on the basal activity. Deletion of the C terminus resulted in a marked increase in catalytic activity either with or without the pretreatment of the kinase by MAP kinase. Further analysis indicated that amino acid residues 339-353 in the C-terminal region were acting as an autoinhibitory domain. A synthetic peptide (RVLKEDKERWEDVK-amide) derived from this autoinhibitory domain inhibited the kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest a regulatory model for the kinase.	0
Abstract2class: Cross-kingdom expression of synthetic genetic elements promotes discovery of metabolites in the human microbiome Abstract: Small molecules encoded by biosynthetic pathways mediate cross-species interactions and harbor untapped potential, which has provided valuable compounds for medicine and biotechnology. Since studying biosynthetic gene clusters in their native context is often difficult, alternative efforts rely on heterologous expression, which is limited by host-specific metabolic capacity and regulation. Here, we describe a computational-experimental technology to redesign genes and their regulatory regions with hybrid elements for cross-species expression in Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and eukaryotes, decoupling biosynthetic capacity from host-range constraints to activate silenced pathways. These synthetic genetic elements enabled the discovery of a class of microbiome-derived nucleotide metabolites-tyrocitabines-from Lactobacillus iners. Tyrocitabines feature a remarkable orthoester-phosphate, inhibit translational activity, and invoke unexpected biosynthetic machinery, including a class of "Amadori synthases" and "abortive" tRNA synthetases. Our approach establishes a general strategy for the redesign, expression, mobilization, and characterization of genetic elements in diverse organisms and communities.	1
Abstract2class: Using ¹⁵N-ammonium to characterise and map potassium binding sites in proteins by NMR spectroscopy Abstract: A variety of enzymes are activated by the binding of potassium ions. The potassium binding sites of these enzymes are very specific, but ammonium ions can often replace potassium ions in vitro because of their similar ionic radii. In these cases, ammonium can be used as a proxy for potassium to characterise potassium binding sites in enzymes: the (1) H,(15) N spin-pair of enzyme-bound (15) NH4 (+) can be probed by (15) N-edited heteronuclear NMR experiments. Here, we demonstrate the use of NMR spectroscopy to characterise binding of ammonium ions to two different enzymes: human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), which is activated allosterically by potassium, and the bacterial Hsp70 homologue DnaK, for which potassium is an integral part of the active site. Ammonium activates both enzymes in a similar way to potassium, thus supporting this non-invasive approach. Furthermore, we present an approach to map the observed binding site onto the structure of HDAC8. Our method for mapping the binding site is general and does not require chemical shift assignment of the enzyme resonances.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and sequence analysis of the genes encoding a polyketide synthase required for pyoluteorin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Abstract: Pyoluteorin is a chlorinated antifungal metabolite of mixed polyketide/amino-acid origin produced by certain strains of Pseudomonas spp., including the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Sequence analysis of a gene cluster required for pyoluteorin biosynthesis by Pf-5 (Kraus, J., Loper, J., 1995. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61, 849-854) has identified two genes whose deduced peptide sequences exhibit characteristics of both fungal and bacterial Type I polyketide synthases (PKSs). The pyoluteorin PKS does not contain a loading domain that is typically present in bacterial Type I PKSs. Furthermore, this PKS possesses an acyltransferase domain that does not contain the conserved residues surrounding the active-site motif typically found in domains of similar function. Based on the organization of the functional domains within the pyoluteorin PKS, we propose a biosynthetic pathway analogous to non-aromatic polyketide biosynthesis within the Actinomycete bacteria that is responsible for the formation of the resorcinol moiety of pyoluteorin.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical probes identify a role for histone deacetylase 3 in Friedreich's ataxia gene silencing Abstract: We recently identified a class of pimelic diphenylamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that show promise as therapeutics in the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and Huntington's disease. Here, we describe chemical approaches to identify the HDAC enzyme target of these inhibitors. Incubation of a trifunctional activity-based probe with a panel of class I and class II recombinant HDAC enzymes, followed by click chemistry addition of a fluorescent dye and gel electrophoresis, identifies HDAC3 as a unique high-affinity target of the probe. Photoaffinity labeling in a nuclear extract prepared from human lymphoblasts with the trifunctional probe, followed by biotin addition through click chemistry, streptavidin enrichment, and Western blotting also identifies HDAC3 as the preferred cellular target of the inhibitor. Additional inhibitors with different HDAC specificity profiles were synthesized, and results from transcription experiments in FRDA cells point to a unique role for HDAC3 in gene silencing in Friedreich's ataxia.	0
Abstract2class: Decoding cyclase-dependent assembly of hapalindole and fischerindole alkaloids Abstract: The formation of C-C bonds in an enantioselective fashion to create complex polycyclic scaffolds in the hapalindole- and fischerindole- type alkaloids from Stigonematales cyanobacteria represents a compelling and urgent challenge in adapting microbial biosynthesis as a catalytic platform in drug development. Here we determine the biochemical basis for tri- and tetracyclic core formation in these secondary metabolites, involving a new class of cyclases that catalyze a complex cyclization cascade.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of thiolutin, a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor, in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137 Abstract: In this study, a new dithiolopyrrolone biosynthetic pathway was identified in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137, which was reported to produce a variety of dithiolopyrrolone natural products including thiolutin, a potential drug candidate for tumor angiogenesis inhibition. Bioinformatics analysis of the cluster revealed that it contains all the essential genes for holothin core biosynthesis and several other auxiliary genes. Interestingly, heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces albus only induced the production of holomycin, implying that the gene responsible for the N4-methylation and the gene(s) involved in the formation of various acylated chains on N7 position of the holothin may locate outside the gene cluster. Incubation of holomycin with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the cell-free extract of Sa. algeriensis resulted in the production of thiolutin, suggesting that the N4-methyl group of thiolutin is originated from SAM, and the N4-methylation could be in the late stage of biosynthesis of thiolutin type dithiolopyrrolones. An evolution-based model for biosynthesis of thiolutin and its analogs was further proposed based on these results.	1
Abstract2class: Transfer of proteins into mitochondria. Precursor to the ADP/ATP carrier binds to receptor sites on isolated mitochondria Abstract: The precursor form of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier synthesized in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system can be imported into isolated mitochondria. If the mitochondrial transmembrane potential is abolished, import does not occur but the precursor binds to the mitochondrial surface. Upon reestablishment of the membrane potential, the bound precursor is imported. This occurs without dissociation of the bound precursor from the mitochondrial surface. We conclude that the binding observed represents an interaction with receptor sites and thus is an early step in the import pathway.	0
Abstract2class: Folding of the polyketide chain is not dictated by minimal polyketide synthase in the biosynthesis of mithramycin and anthracycline Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin, nogalamycin and aclacinomycins are aromatic polyketide antibiotics that exhibit antitumour activity. The precursors of these antibiotics are formed via a polyketide biosynthetic pathway in which acetate (for mithramycinone and nogalamycinone) or propionate (for aklavinone) is used as a starter unit and nine acetates are used as extender units. The assembly of building blocks is catalyzed by the minimal polyketide synthase (PKS). Further steps include regiospecific reductions (if any) and cyclization. In the biosynthesis of mithramycin, however, ketoreduction is omitted and the regiospecificity of the first cyclization differs from that of anthracycline antibiotics (e.g. nogalamycin and aclacinomycins). These significant differences provide a convenient means to analyze the determinants for the regiospecificity of the first cyclization step.                  Results:                       In order to analyze a possible role of the minimal PKS in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization in polyketide biosynthesis, we expressed the mtm locus, which includes mithramycin minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces galilaeus, which normally makes aclacinomycins, and the sno locus, which includes nogalamycin minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces argillaceus, which normally makes mithramycin. The host strains are defective in the minimal PKS, but they express other antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Expression of the sno minimal PKS in the S. argillaceus polyketide-deficient strain generated mithramycin production. Auramycins, instead of aclacinomycins, accumulated in the recombinant S. galilaeus strains, suggesting that the mithramycin minimal PKS is responsible for the choice of starter unit. We also describe structural analysis of the compounds accumulated by a ketoreductase-deficient S. galilaeus mutant; spectroscopic studies on the major polyketide compound that accumulated revealed a first ring closure which is not typical of anthracyclines, suggesting an important role for the ketoreductase in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization.                  Conclusions:                       These experiments clearly support the involvement of ketoreductase and a cyclase in the regiospecific cyclization of the biosynthetic pathway for aromatic polyketides.	1
Abstract2class: High-efficiency promoter-driven coordinated regulation of multiple metabolic nodes elevates lipid accumulation in the model microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum Abstract: Background:                       Microalgal metabolic engineering holds great promise for the overproduction of a wide range of commercial bioproducts. It demands simultaneous manipulation of multiple metabolic nodes. However, high-efficiency promoters have been lacking.                  Results:                       Here we report a strong constitutive promoter Pt211 in expressing multiple target genes in oleaginous microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Pt211 was revealed to contain significant cis-acting elements. GUS reporter and principal genes glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis were tested under driven of Pt211 in P. tricornutum. GUS staining and qPCR analysis showed strong GUS expression. DGAT2 and GPAT linked with a designed 2A sequence exhibited higher transcript abundances than WT, while algal growth and photosynthesis were not impaired.                  Conclusion:                       The total lipid content increased notably by 2.6-fold compared to WT and reached up to 57.5% (dry cell weight). Overall, our findings report a strong promoter and a strategy for coordinated manipulation of complex metabolic pathways.	0
Abstract2class: Bacterial Production of a Pederin Analogue by a Free-Living Marine Alphaproteobacterium Abstract: The polyketide pederin family are cytotoxic compounds isolated from insects, lichen, and marine sponges. During the past decade, different uncultivable bacteria symbionts have been proposed as the real producers of these compounds, such as those found in insects, lichen, and marine sponges, and their trans-AT polyketide synthase gene clusters have been identified. Herein we report the isolation and biological activities of a new analogue of the pederin family, compound 1, from the culture of a marine heterotrophic alphaproteobacterium, Labrenzia sp. PHM005. This is the first report of the production of a pederin-type compound by a free-living marine bacteria that could be cultured in the laboratory.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation and structural characterization of capistruin, a lasso peptide predicted from the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis E264 Abstract: Lasso peptides are a structurally unique class of bioactive peptides characterized by a knotted arrangement, where the C-terminus threads through an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Although ribosomally synthesized, only the gene cluster for the best studied lasso peptide MccJ25 from Escherichia coli consisting of the precursor protein McjA and the processing and immunity proteins McjB, McjC, and McjD is known. Through genome mining studies, we have identified homologues of all four proteins in Burkholderia thailandensis E264 and predicted this strain to produce a lasso peptide. Here we report the successful isolation of the predicted peptide, named capistruin. Upon optimization of the fermentation conditions, mass spectrometric and NMR structural studies proved capistruin to adopt a novel lasso fold. Heterologous production of the lasso peptide in Escherichia coli showed that the identified genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis of capistruin, which exhibits antimicrobial activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. In general, our rational approach should be widely applicable for the isolation of new lasso peptides to explore their high structural stability and diverse biological activity.	1
Abstract2class: New natural products identified by combined genomics-metabolomics profiling of marine Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 Abstract: Marine actinobacteria are drawing more and more attention as a promising source of new natural products. Here we report isolation, genome sequencing and metabolic profiling of new strain Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 isolated from marine sediment sample collected in the Trondheim Fjord, Norway. The 16S rRNA and multilocus phylogenetic analysis showed that MP131-18 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The genome of MP131-18 isolate was sequenced, and 36 gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of 18 different types of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain led to the identification of several new biologically active compounds. As a result, the family of bisindole pyrroles spiroindimicins was extended with two new members, spiroindimicins E and F. Furthermore, prediction of the biosynthetic pathway for unusual α-pyrone lagunapyrone isolated from MP131-18 resulted in foresight and identification of two new compounds of this family - lagunapyrones D and E. The diversity of identified and predicted compounds from Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 demonstrates that marine-derived actinomycetes are not only a promising source of new natural products, but also represent a valuable pool of genes for combinatorial biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Diversity of carotenoid synthesis gene clusters from environmental Enterobacteriaceae strains Abstract: Eight Enterobacteriaceae strains that produce zeaxanthin and derivatives of this compound were isolated from a variety of environmental samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains grouped with different clusters of Erwinia type strains. Four strains representing the phylogenetic diversity were chosen for further characterization, which revealed their genetic diversity as well as their biochemical diversity. The carotenoid synthesis gene clusters cloned from the four strains had three different gene organizations. Two of the gene clusters, those from strains DC416 and DC260, had the classical organization crtEXYIBZ; the gene cluster from DC413 had the rare organization crtE-idi-XYIBZ; and the gene cluster from DC404 had the unique organization crtE-idi-YIBZ. Besides the diversity in genetic organization, these genes also exhibited considerable sequence diversity. On average, they exhibited 60 to 70% identity with each other, as well as with the corresponding genes of the Pantoea type strains. The four different clusters were individually expressed in Escherichia coli, and the two idi-containing clusters gave more than fivefold-higher carotenoid titers than the two clusters lacking idi. Expression of the crtEYIB genes with and without idi confirmed the effect of increasing carotenoid titer by the type II idi gene linked with the carotenoid synthesis gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: Biphenyl-derived phosphepines as chiral nucleophilic catalysts: enantioselective [4+1] annulations to form functionalized cyclopentenes Abstract: Because of the frequent occurrence of cyclopentane subunits in bioactive compounds, the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their synthesis is an important objective. Introduced herein is a new family of chiral nucleophilic catalysts, biphenyl-derived phosphepines, and we apply them to an enantioselective variant of a useful [4+1] annulation. A range of one-carbon coupling partners can be employed, thereby generating cyclopentenes which bear a fully substituted stereocenter [either all-carbon or heteroatom-substituted (sulfur and phosphorus)]. Stereocenters at the other four positions of the cyclopentane ring can also be introduced with good stereoselectivity. An initial mechanistic study indicates that phosphine addition to the electrophilic four-carbon coupling partner is not the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle.	0
Abstract2class: S-3578, a new broad spectrum parenteral cephalosporin exhibiting potent activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships Abstract: A series of 7-aminothiadiazolylcephalosporins having a 1-(substituted)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium group at the C-3' position of the cephem nucleus were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. Among the cephalosporins prepared in this study, 7beta-[2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-ethoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[1-(3-methylaminopropyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium-4-yl]methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate sulfate (S-3578) showed extremely potent broad spectrum activity against both gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and good water solubility.	0
Abstract2class: The biosynthesis and catabolism of the maleic anhydride moiety of stipitatonic acid Abstract: A series of directed knockout experiments, combined with an in vitro assay of pathway components, has elucidated for the first time the chemical steps involved in the biosynthesis of the tropolone class of fungal maleic anhydrides. The pathway involves the stepwise oxidation of aldehyde and methyl carbon atoms to form a 1,2-dicarboxylate. A hydrolase-catalyzed interconversion of this and the corresponding maleic anhydride, followed by decarboxylation of the diacid leads to the pathway's final product of stipitatic acid.	1
Abstract2class: CGP 9000: a new orally active, broad-spectrum cephalosporin Abstract: CGP 9000, (7-[D-2-amino-2-(1,4-cyclohexadienyl)-acetamido]-3-methoxy-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid), is a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. Its antibacterial activity in vitro (MIC) is similar, but its bactericidal efficacy superior to that of cephalexin and cephradine. Upon oral administration to mice infected with various bacteria, CGP 9000 is, in general, 2 to 7 times more effective than either cephalexin or cephradine.	0
Abstract2class: Commensal Oral Rothia mucilaginosa Produces Enterobactin, a Metal-Chelating Siderophore Abstract: Next-generation sequencing studies of saliva and dental plaque from subjects in both healthy and diseased states have identified bacteria belonging to the Rothia genus as ubiquitous members of the oral microbiota. To gain a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the chemical ecology of this unexplored group, we applied a genome mining approach that targets functionally important biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). All 45 genomes that were mined, representing Rothia mucilaginosa, Rothia dentocariosa, and Rothia aeria, harbored a catechol-siderophore-like BGC. To explore siderophore production further, we grew the previously characterized R. mucilaginosa ATCC 25296 in liquid cultures, amended with glycerol, which led to the identification of the archetype siderophore enterobactin by using tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Normally attributed to pathogenic gut bacteria, R. mucilaginosa is the first commensal oral bacterium found to produce enterobactin. Cocultivation studies including R. mucilaginosa or purified enterobactin revealed that enterobactin reduced growth of certain strains of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans and pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus Commensal oral bacteria were either unaffected, reduced in growth, or induced to grow adjacent to enterobactin-producing R. mucilaginosa or the pure compound. Taken together with Rothia's known capacity to ferment a variety of carbohydrates and amino acids, our findings of enterobactin production add an additional level of explanation to R. mucilaginosa's prevalence in the oral cavity. Enterobactin is the strongest Fe(III) binding siderophore known, and its role in oral health requires further investigation.IMPORTANCE The communication language of the human oral microbiota is vastly underexplored. However, a few studies have shown that specialized small molecules encoded by BGCs have critical roles such as in colonization resistance against pathogens and quorum sensing. Here, by using a genome mining approach in combination with compound screening of growth cultures, we identified that the commensal oral community member R. mucilaginosa harbors a catecholate-siderophore BGC, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of enterobactin. The iron-scavenging role of enterobactin is known to have positive effects on the host's iron pool and negative effects on host immune function; however, its role in oral health remains unexplored. R. mucilaginosa was previously identified as an abundant community member in cystic fibrosis, where bacterial iron cycling plays a major role in virulence development. With respect to iron's broad biological importance, iron-chelating enterobactin may explain R. mucilaginosa's colonization success in both health and disease.	1
Abstract2class: Unprecedented [5.5.5.6]Dioxafenestrane Ring Construction in Fungal Insecticidal Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis Abstract: Fenestranes, a specific class of natural products, contain four fused rings that share a central quaternary carbon atom. The fungal natural product penifulvin A (1) is a potent insecticidal sesquiterpene that features the [5.5.5.6]dioxafenestrane ring. Although the chemical synthesis of 1 has been achieved recently, the enzymes catalysing the cyclization and oxidation of FPP to 1 remain unknown. In this work, we identified a concise pathway that uses only three enzymes to produce 1. A new sesquiterpene cyclase (PeniA) generates the angular triquinane scaffold silphinene (6). A cytochrome P450 (PeniB) and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (PeniC) catalyse a series of oxidation reactions to transform 6 into 1, including oxidation of the C15 methyl group to a carboxylate moiety, oxidative coupling of the C15 carboxylate and the C1-C2 olefin to form a γ-lactone, and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form a δ-lactone. Our results demonstrate the highly concise and efficient ways in which fungal biosynthetic pathways can generate complex sesquiterpene scaffolds.	1
Abstract2class: Purification and biochemical characterization of mutacin I from the group I strain of Streptococcus mutans, CH43, and genetic analysis of mutacin I biosynthesis genes Abstract: Previously, we reported isolation and characterization of mutacin III and genetic analysis of mutacin III biosynthesis genes from the group III strain of Streptococcus mutans, UA787 (F. Qi, P. Chen, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:3880-3887, 1999). During the same process of isolating the mutacin III structural gene, we also cloned the structural gene for mutacin I. In this report, we present purification and biochemical characterization of mutacin I from the group I strain CH43 and compare mutacin I and mutacin III biosynthesis genes. The mutacin I biosynthesis gene locus consists of 14 genes in the order mutR, -A, -A', -B, -C, -D, -P, -T, -F, -E, -G, orfX, orfY, orfZ. mutA is the structural gene for mutacin I, while mutA' is not required for mutacin I activity. DNA and protein sequence analysis revealed that mutacins I and III are homologous to each other, possibly arising from a common ancestor. The mature mutacin I is 24 amino acids in size and has a molecular mass of 2, 364 Da. Ethanethiol modification and peptide sequencing of mutacin I revealed that it contains six dehydrated serines, four of which are probably involved with thioether bridge formation. Comparison of the primary sequence of mutacin I with that of mutacin III and epidermin suggests that mutacin I likely has the same bridging pattern as epidermin.	1
Abstract2class: Genomic and transcriptomic comparison of Aspergillus oryzae strains: a case study in soy sauce koji fermentation Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae is used in soy sauce koji making due to its high productivity of hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, we compared the genomes and transcriptomes of an industrial strain RD2 and a strain with decreased fermentation performance TS2, aiming to explain their phenotypic differences at the molecular level. Under the regulation of conidiation and fermentation conditions, the enhanced hydrolytic enzyme production and flavor precursor formation in RD2 described a complete expression profile necessary to maintain desirable fermentation performance. By contrast, central carbon metabolism was up-regulated in TS2 for fast growth, suggesting a conflicting relationship between mycelium growth and fermentation performance. Accumulation of mutations also lowered the fermentation performance of TS2. Our study has deepened the understanding of the metabolism and related regulatory mechanisms in desirable koji fermentation. A list of potential molecular markers identified here could facilitate targeted strain maintenance and improvement for better koji fermentation.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide bassianolide, an insecticidal virulence factor of Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauveria bassiana is a facultative entomopathogen with an extremely broad host range that is used as a commercial biopesticide for the control of insects of agricultural, veterinary and medical significance. B. bassiana produces bassianolide, a cyclooligomer depsipeptide secondary metabolite. We have cloned the bbBsls gene of B. bassiana encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Targeted inactivation of the B. bassiana genomic copy of bbBsls abolished bassianolide production, but did not affect the biosynthesis of beauvericin, another cyclodepsipeptide produced by the strain. Comparative sequence analysis of the BbBSLS bassianolide synthetase revealed enzymatic domains for the iterative synthesis of an enzyme-bound dipeptidol monomer intermediate from d-2-hydroxyisovalerate and l-leucine. Further BbBSLS domains are predicted to catalyze the formation of the cyclic tetrameric ester bassianolide by recursive condensations of this monomer. Comparative infection assays against three selected insect hosts established bassianolide as a highly significant virulence factor of B. bassiana.	1
Abstract2class: Streamlined syntheses of (-)-dictyostatin, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin, and 6-epi-16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin Abstract: The dictyostatins are a promising class of potential anti-cancer drugs because they are powerful microtubule-stabilizing agents, but the complexity of their chemical structures is a severe impediment to their further development. On the basis of both synthetic and medicinal chemistry analyses, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6 epimer were chosen as potentially potent yet accessible dictyostatin analogues, and three new syntheses were developed. A relatively classical synthesis involving vinyllithium addition and macrocyclization gave way to a newer and more practical approach based on esterification and ring-closing metathesis reaction. Finally, aspects of these two approaches were combined to provide a third new synthesis based on esterification and Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction. This was used to prepare the target dihydro analogues and the natural product. All of the syntheses are streamlined because of their high convergency. The work provided several new analogues of dictyostatin, including a truncated macrolactone and a C10 E-alkene, which were 400- and 50-fold less active than (-)-dictyostatin, respectively. In contrast, the targeted 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin analogues retained almost complete activity in preliminary biological assays.	0
Abstract2class: Cell membrane expression of cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 is modulated by alpha-actinin-2 interaction Abstract: Cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 plays a critical role in heart excitability and conduction. The molecular mechanism that underlies the expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that cytoskeleton proteins can be involved in the regulation of cell surface expression and localization of several ion channels. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Na(v)1.5-associated proteins that may be involved in channel function and expression. We identified alpha-actinin-2 as an interacting partner of the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains III and IV of Na(v)1.5 (Na(v)1.5/LIII-IV). Co-immunoprecipitation and His(6) pull-down assays confirmed the physical association between Na(v)1.5 and alpha-actinin-2 and showed that the spectrin-like repeat domain is essential for binding of alpha-actinin-2 to Na(v)1.5. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the interaction with alpha-actinin-2 increases sodium channel density without changing their gating properties. Consistent with these findings, coexpression of alpha-actinin-2 and Na(v)1.5 in tsA201 cells led to an increase in the level of expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation. Lastly, immunostaining experiments showed that alpha-actinin-2 was colocalized with Na(v)1.5 along the Z-lines and in the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that alpha-actinin-2, which is known to regulate the functional expression of the potassium channels, may play a role in anchoring Na(v)1.5 to the membrane by connecting the channel to the actin cytoskeleton network.	0
Abstract2class: Regulation of the Streptomyces coelicolor calcium-dependent antibiotic by absA, encoding a cluster-linked two-component system Abstract: The Streptomyces coelicolor absA two-component system was initially identified through analysis of mutations in the sensor kinase absA1 that caused inhibition of all four antibiotics synthesized by this strain. Previous genetic analysis had suggested that the phosphorylated form of AbsA2 acted as a negative regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor (T. B. Anderson, P. Brian, and W. C. Champness, Mol. Microbiol. 39:553-566, 2001). Genomic sequence data subsequently provided by the Sanger Centre (Cambridge, United Kingdom) revealed that absA was located within the gene cluster for production of one of the four antibiotics, calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA). In this paper we have identified numerous transcriptional start sites within the CDA cluster and have shown that the original antibiotic-negative mutants used to identify absA exhibit a stronger negative regulation of promoters upstream of the proposed CDA biosynthetic genes than of promoters in the clusters responsible for production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. The same antibiotic-negative mutants also showed an increase in transcription from a promoter divergent to that of absA, upstream of a putative ABC transporter, in addition to an increase in transcription of absA itself. Interestingly, the negative regulation of the biosynthetic transcripts did not appear to be mediated by transcriptional regulation of cdaR (a gene encoding a homolog of the pathway-specific regulators of the act and red clusters) or by any other recognizable transcriptional regulator associated with the cluster. The role of absA in regulating the expression of the diverse antibiotic biosynthesis clusters in the genome is discussed in light of its location in the cda cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of mureidomycin analogues and functional analysis of an N-acetyltransferase in napsamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Antibiotic abundance: Several new uridyl peptide antibiotics were identified from a heterologous producer strain containing the mureidomycin/napsamycin biosynthetic gene cluster by using HRMS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Analysis of the new compounds and the corresponding gene cluster revealed NpsB, an N-acetyltransferase, to be responsible for acetylation of the uridyl peptide antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Activity of four cephalosporin antibiotics in vitro against bovine udder pathogens and pathogenic bacteria isolated from newborn calves Abstract: The in vitro activity of chephaloridine, cephalexin, cefatrizine (BL-S640), and cephapirin (BL-P-1322) was evaluated by the serial dilution method against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine udders and neonatal calf diseases. Cephapirin showed the comparatively greatest activity against the most common streptococcal species associated with bovine mastitis, whereas cephaloridine exhibited the best activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Cefatrizine was more active than the other cephalosporins against the gram-negative bacteria studied. In general, the minimal bactericidal concentration of each cephalosporin was two- to fourfold lower than the comparative value reported in the literature against the same type of pathogen of human origin.	0
Abstract2class: Activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters using transcription factor decoys Abstract: Here we report a transcription factor decoy strategy for targeted activation of eight large silent polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters, ranging from 50 to 134 kilobases (kb) in multiple streptomycetes, and characterization of a novel oxazole family compound produced by a 98-kb biosynthetic gene cluster. Owing to its simplicity and ease of use, this strategy can be scaled up readily for discovery of natural products in streptomycetes.	1
Abstract2class: Energy Transfer between Spatially Separated Entangled Molecules Abstract: Light-matter strong coupling allows for the possibility of entangling the wave functions of different molecules through the light field. We hereby present direct evidence of non-radiative energy transfer well beyond the Förster limit for spatially separated donor and acceptor cyanine dyes strongly coupled to a cavity. The transient dynamics and the static spectra show an energy transfer efficiency approaching 37 % for donor-acceptor distances ≥100 nm. In such systems, the energy transfer process becomes independent of distance as long as the coupling strength is maintained. This is consistent with the entangled and delocalized nature of the polaritonic states.	0
Abstract2class: Different antibiotic resistance and sporulation properties within multiclonal Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes 078, 126, and 033 in a single calf farm Abstract: Clostridium difficile strains were sampled periodically from 50 animals at a single veal calf farm over a period of 6 months. At arrival, 10% of animals were C. difficile positive, and the peak incidence was determined to occur at the age of 18 days (16%). The prevalence then decreased, and at slaughter, C. difficile could not be isolated. Six different PCR ribotypes were detected, and strains within a single PCR ribotype could be differentiated further by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PCR ribotype diversity was high up to the animal age of 18 days, but at later sampling points, PCR ribotype 078 and the highly related PCR ribotype 126 predominated. Resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and erythromycin was detected, while all strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and metronidazole. Multiple variations of the resistance gene tet(M) were present at the same sampling point, and these changed over time. We have shown that PCR ribotypes often associated with cattle (ribotypes 078, 126, and 033) were not clonal but differed in PFGE type, sporulation properties, antibiotic sensitivities, and tetracycline resistance determinants, suggesting that multiple strains of the same PCR ribotype infected the calves and that calves were likely to be infected prior to arrival at the farm. Importantly, strains isolated at later time points were more likely to be resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin and showed higher early sporulation efficiencies in vitro, suggesting that these two properties converge to promote the persistence of C. difficile in the environment or in hosts.	0
Abstract2class: DNA polymorphism analysis of Brucella lipopolysaccharide genes reveals marked differences in O-polysaccharide biosynthetic genes between smooth and rough Brucella species and novel species-specific markers Abstract: Background:                       The lipopolysaccharide is a major antigen and virulence factor of Brucella, an important bacterial pathogen. In smooth brucellae, lipopolysaccharide is made of lipid A-core oligosaccharide and N-formylperosamine O-polysaccharide. B. ovis and B. canis (rough species) lack the O-polysaccharide.                  Results:                       The polymorphism of O-polysaccharide genes wbkE, manA(O-Ag), manB(O-Ag), manC(O-Ag), wbkF and wbkD) and wbo (wboA and wboB), and core genes manB(core) and wa** was analyzed. Although most genes were highly conserved, species- and biovar-specific restriction patterns were found. There were no significant differences in putative N-formylperosamyl transferase genes, suggesting that Brucella A and M serotypes are not related to specific genes. In B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti (both smooth), manB(O-Ag) carried an IS711, confirming its dispensability for perosamine synthesis. Significant differences between smooth and rough species were found in wbkF and wbkD, two adjacent genes putatively related to bactoprenol priming for O-polysaccharide polymerization. B. ovis wbkF carried a frame-shift and B. canis had a long deletion partially encompassing both genes. In smooth brucellae, this region contains two direct repeats suggesting the deletion mechanism.                  Conclusion:                       The results define species and biovar markers, confirm the dispensability of manB(O-Ag) for O-polysaccharide synthesis and contribute to explain the lipopolysaccharide structure of rough and smooth Brucella species.	0
Abstract2class: Purification, characterization and synergism in autolysis of a group of 1,3-β-glucan hydrolases from the pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies Abstract: Using a combined chromatography method, we simultaneously purified three protein fractions (II-2, II-3 and II-4) with 1,3-β-glucanase activity from extraction of pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies. MALDI-TOF/TOF amino acid sequencing showed that these three fractions matched a putative exo-1,3-β-glucanase, a putative glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase and a putative glycosyl hydrolase family 16 protein annotated in the C. cinerea genome, respectively; however, they were characterized as a 1,3-β-glucosidase, an exo-1,3-β-glucanase and an endo-1,3-β-glucanase, respectively, by analysis of their substrate specificities and modes of action. This study explored how these three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases synergistically acted on laminarin: the endo-1,3-β-glucanase hydrolysed internal glycosidic bonds of laminarin to generate 1,3-β-oligosaccharides of various lengths, the exo-1,3-β-glucanase cleaved the longer-chain laminarioligosaccharides into short-chain disaccharides, laminaribiose and gentiobiose, and the 1,3-β-glucosidase further hydrolysed laminaribiose to glucose. The remaining gentiobiose must be hydrolysed by other 1,6-β-glucosidases. Therefore, the endo-1,3-β-glucanase, exo-1,3-β-glucanase and 1,3-β-glucosidase may act synergistically to completely degrade the 1,3-β-glucan backbone of the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis. These three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases share a similar optimum pH and optimum temperature, supporting the speculation that these enzymes work together under the same conditions to degrade 1,3-β-glucan in the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the Phenalamide Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Myxococcus stipitatus DSM 14675 Abstract: Phenalamide is a bioactive secondary metabolite produced by Myxococcus stipitatus. We identified a 56 kb phenalamide biosynthetic gene cluster from M. stipitatus DSM 14675 by genomic sequence analysis and mutational analysis. The cluster is comprised of 12 genes (MYSTI_04318-MYSTI_04329) encoding three pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits, eight polyketide synthase modules, a non-ribosomal peptide synthase module, a hypothetical protein, and a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding protein. Disruption of the MYSTI_04324 or MYSTI_04325 genes by plasmid insertion resulted in a defect in phenalamide production. The organization of the phenalamide biosynthetic modules encoded by the fifth to tenth genes (MYSTI_04320-MYSTI_04325) was very similar to that of the myxalamid biosynthetic gene cluster from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15, as expected from similar backbone structures of the two substances. However, the loading module and the first extension module of the phenalamide synthase encoded by the first to fourth genes (MYSTI_04326-MYSTI_04329) were found only in the phenalamide biosynthetic gene cluster from M. stipitatus DSM 14675.	1
Abstract2class: Autoregulation of ZEB2 expression for zearalenone production in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: Several Fusarium species produce the polyketide mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA), a causative agent of hyperestrogenic syndrome in animals that is often found in F. graminearum-infected cereals in temperate regions. The ZEA biosynthetic cluster genes PKS4, PKS13, ZEB1 and ZEB2 encode a reducing polyketide synthase, a non-reducing polyketide synthase, an isoamyl alcohol oxidase and a transcription factor respectively. In this study, the production of two isoforms (ZEB2L and ZEB2S) from the ZEB2 gene in F. graminearum via an alternative promoter was characterized. ZEB2L contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus, whereas ZEB2S is an N-terminally truncated form of ZEB2L that lacks the bZIP domain. Interestingly, ZEA triggers the induction of both ZEB2L and ZEB2S transcription. ZEB2L and ZEB2S interact with each other to form a heterodimer that regulates ZEA production by reducing the binding affinity of ZEB2L for the ZEB2L gene promoter. Our study provides insight into the autoregulation of ZEB2 expression by alternative promoter usage and a feedback loop during ZEA production; this regulatory mechanism is similar to that observed in higher eukaryotes.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of an Orphan Type III Polyketide Synthase Conserved in Uncultivated "Entotheonella" Sponge Symbionts Abstract: Uncultivated bacterial symbionts from the candidate genus "Entotheonella" have been shown to produce diverse natural products previously attributed to their sponge hosts. In addition to these known compounds, "Entotheonella" genomes contain rich sets of biosynthetic gene clusters that lack identified natural products. Among these is a small type III polyketide synthase (PKS) cluster, one of only three clusters present in all known "Entotheonella" genomes. This conserved "Entotheonella" PKS (cep) cluster encodes the type III PKS CepA and the putative methyltransferase CepB. Herein, the characterization of CepA as an enzyme involved in phenolic lipid biosynthesis is reported. In vitro analysis showed a specificity for alkyl starter substrates and the production of tri- and tetraketide pyrones and tetraketide resorcinols. The conserved distribution of the cep cluster suggests an important role for the phenolic lipid polyketides produced in "Entotheonella" variants.	1
Abstract2class: Catalytic Enantioselective Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation: Phosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzylic Ethers via the Oxidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds Abstract: Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, γ-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene.	0
Abstract2class: Enzymatic Formation of Rufoschweinitzin, a Binaphthalene from the Basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus Abstract: Dimeric polyketides are widespread fungal secondary metabolites. They occur in both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes and, therefore, across fungal phyla. Here we report the isolation of a new binaphthalene, named rufoschweinitzin, from the basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus. Rufoschweinitzin consists of two symmetrically 4,4'-coupled torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether moieties. Furthermore, we have identified a binaphthalene biosynthetic gene cluster in an unrelated fungus, the ascomycete Xylaria schweinitzii. Heterologous expression of the encoded cytochrome P450 enzyme verified its coupling activity: dimerization of torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether led to the formation of rufoschweinitzin alongside a hitherto unknown regioisomer, now named alloschweinitzin. We have thus demonstrated enzymatic formation of the basidiomycete's metabolite rufoschweinitzin and made the regiochemistry of alloschweinitzin accessible with an ascomycete-derived enzyme.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the asperthecin gene cluster of Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: The sequencing of Aspergillus genomes has revealed that the products of a large number of secondary metabolism pathways have not yet been identified. This is probably because many secondary metabolite gene clusters are not expressed under normal laboratory culture conditions. It is, therefore, important to discover conditions or regulatory factors that can induce the expression of these genes. We report that the deletion of sumO, the gene that encodes the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO in A. nidulans, caused a dramatic increase in the production of the secondary metabolite asperthecin and a decrease in the synthesis of austinol/dehydroaustinol and sterigmatocystin. The overproduction of asperthecin in the sumO deletion mutant has allowed us, through a series of targeted deletions, to identify the genes required for asperthecin synthesis. The asperthecin biosynthesis genes are clustered and include genes encoding an iterative type I polyketide synthase, a hydrolase, and a monooxygenase. The identification of these genes allows us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for asperthecin.	1
Abstract2class: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Abstract2class: Mithramycin SK, a novel antitumor drug with improved therapeutic index, mithramycin SA, and demycarosyl-mithramycin SK: three new products generated in the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus through combinatorial biosynthesis Abstract: To gain initial structure-activity relationships regarding the highly functionalized pentyl side chain attached at C-3 of mithramycin (MTM), we focused on a post-polyketide synthase (post-PKS) tailoring step of the MTM biosynthesis by Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, which was proposed to be catalyzed by ketoreductase (KR) MtmW. In this last step of the MTM biosynthesis, a keto group of the pentyl side chain is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and we anticipated the generation of an MTM derivative with an additional keto group in the 3-side chain. Insertional inactivation of mtmW, a gene located ca. 8 kb downstream of the mithramycin-PKS genes, yielded an S. argillaceus mutant, which accumulated three new mithramycin analogues, namely mithramycin SA, demycarosyl-mithramycin SK, and mithramycin SK (MTM-SK). The structures of these three compounds confirmed indirectly the proposed role of MtmW in MTM biosynthesis. However, the new mithramycin derivatives bear unexpectedly shorter 3-side chains (ethyl or butyl) than MTM, presumably caused by nonenzymatic rearrangement or cleavage reactions of the initially formed pentyl side chain with a reactive beta-dicarbonyl functional group. The major product, MTM-SK, was tested in vitro against a variety of human cancer cell lines, as well as in an in vitro toxicity assay, and showed an improved therapeutic index, in comparison to the parent drug, MTM.	1
Abstract2class: Exopolysaccharide production and ropy phenotype are determined by two gene clusters in putative probiotic strain Lactobacillus paraplantarum BGCG11 Abstract: Lactobacillus paraplantarum BGCG11, a putative probiotic strain isolated from a soft, white, artisanal cheese, produces a high molecular-weight heteropolysaccharide, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-CG11, responsible for the ropy phenotype and immunomodulatory activity of the strain. In this study, a 26.4-kb region originating from the pCG1 plasmid, previously shown to be responsible for the production of EPS-CG11 and a ropy phenotype, was cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. In this region 16 putative open reading frames (ORFs), encoding enzymes for the production of EPS-CG11, were organized in specific loci involved in the biosynthesis of the repeat unit, polymerization, export, regulation, and chain length determination. Interestingly, downstream of the eps gene cluster, a putative transposase gene was identified, followed by an additional rfb gene cluster containing the rfbACBD genes, the ones most probably responsible for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis. The functional analysis showed that the production of the high-molecular-weight fraction of EPS-CG11 was absent in two knockout mutants, one in the eps and the other in the rfb gene cluster, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography analysis. Therefore, both eps and rfb genes clusters are prerequisites for the production of high-molecular-weight EPS-CG11 and for the ropy phenotype of strain L. paraplantarum BGCG11.	0
Abstract2class: Studies on new vasodilators, WS-1228 A and B. I. Discovery, taxonomy, isolation and characterization Abstract: New vasodilators, designated WS-1228 A and B have been discovered in the culture filtrate of a strain of Streptomyces aureofaciens. The active compounds were purified by column chromatography with Diaion HP-20 and silica gel, and finally separated from each other by high performance liquid chromatography. They were obtained as pale yellow crystals and their molecular formulae were both C11H17N3O.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the final reactions of DIMBOA-glucoside biosynthesis in maize: characterization of Bx6 and Bx7 Abstract: Benzoxazinoids were identified in the early 1960s as secondary metabolites of the grasses that function as natural pesticides and exhibit allelopathic properties. Benzoxazinoids are synthesized in seedlings and stored as glucosides (glcs); the main aglucone moieties are 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIBOA) and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA). The genes of DIBOA-glc biosynthesis have previously been isolated and the enzymatic functions characterized. Here, the enzymes for conversion of DIBOA-glc to DIMBOA-glc are identified. DIBOA-glc is the substrate of the dioxygenase BENZOXAZINLESS6 (BX6) and the produced 2,4,7-trihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one-glc is metabolized by the methyltransferase BX7 to yield DIMBOA-glc. Both enzymes exhibit moderate K(m) values (below 0.4 mm) and k(cat) values of 2.10 s(-1) and 0.25 s(-1), respectively. Although BX6 uses a glucosylated substrate, our localization studies indicate a cytoplasmic localization of the dioxygenase. Bx6 and Bx7 are highest expressed in seedling tissue, a feature shared with the other Bx genes. At present, Bx6 and Bx7 have no close relatives among the members of their respective gene families. Bx6 and Bx7 map to the cluster of Bx genes on the short arm of chromosome 4.	1
Abstract2class: Scalarane-based sesterterpenoid RCE-protease inhibitors isolated from the Indonesian marine sponge Carteriospongia foliascens Abstract: Two new 20,24-bishomo-25-norscalaranes, compounds 1 and 2, and two new and two known 20,24-bishomoscalaranes, compounds 3-6, have been isolated from the Indonesian marine sponge Carteriospongia foliascens. The structures of 1-6 were determined by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 3-6 inhibit RCE-protease activity.	0
Abstract2class: Beta-glucuronidase as a sensitive and versatile reporter in actinomycetes Abstract: Here we describe a versatile and sensitive reporter system for actinomycetes that is based on gusA, which encodes the β-glucuronidase enzyme. A series of gusA-containing transcriptional and translational fusion vectors were constructed and utilized to study the regulatory cascade of the phenalinolactone biosynthetic gene cluster. Furthermore, these vectors were used to study the efficiency of translation initiation at the ATG, GTG, TTG, and CTG start codons. Surprisingly, constructs using a TTG start codon showed the best activity, whereas those using ATG or GTG were approximately one-half or one-third as active, respectively. The CTG fusion showed only 5% of the activity of the TTG fusion. A suicide vector, pKGLP2, carrying gusA in its backbone was used to visually detect merodiploid formation and resolution, making gene targeting in actinomycetes much faster and easier. Three regulatory genes, plaR1, plaR2, and plaR3, involved in phenalinolactone biosynthesis were efficiently replaced with an apramycin resistance marker using this system. Finally, we expanded the genetic code of actinomycetes by introducing the nonproteinogenic amino acid N-epsilon-cyclopentyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine with the GusA protein as a reporter.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the terminal activation step catalyzed by oxygenase CmmOIV of the chromomycin biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Inactivation and initial interrogation of key oxygenase CmmOIV of the biosynthetic pathway of chromomycin A(3) in Streptomyces griseus ssp. griseus revealed that a completely methylated and acetylated prechromomycin is the preferred substrate of this enzyme. This suggests that the three sugar decoration reactions, two O-acetylations and an O-methylation, which were previously believed to occur as the final steps of chromomycin A(3) biosynthesis, indeed take place prior to the CmmOIV reaction. Upon inactivation of CmmOIV, four new compounds accumulated; the fully decorated prechromomycin and its incompletely acetylated precursor along with a diketoprechromomycin-type compound were fully characterized and assayed with CmmOIV.	1

Abstract2class: Resolving discrepancy between nucleotides and amino acids in deep-level arthropod phylogenomics: differentiating serine codons in 21-amino-acid models Abstract: Background:                       In a previous study of higher-level arthropod phylogeny, analyses of nucleotide sequences from 62 protein-coding nuclear genes for 80 panarthopod species yielded significantly higher bootstrap support for selected nodes than did amino acids. This study investigates the cause of that discrepancy.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       The hypothesis is tested that failure to distinguish the serine residues encoded by two disjunct clusters of codons (TCN, AGY) in amino acid analyses leads to this discrepancy. In one test, the two clusters of serine codons (Ser1, Ser2) are conceptually translated as separate amino acids. Analysis of the resulting 21-amino-acid data matrix shows striking increases in bootstrap support, in some cases matching that in nucleotide analyses. In a second approach, nucleotide and 20-amino-acid data sets are artificially altered through targeted deletions, modifications, and replacements, revealing the pivotal contributions of distinct Ser1 and Ser2 codons. We confirm that previous methods of coding nonsynonymous nucleotide change are robust and computationally efficient by introducing two new degeneracy coding methods. We demonstrate for degeneracy coding that neither compositional heterogeneity at the level of nucleotides nor codon usage bias between Ser1 and Ser2 clusters of codons (or their separately coded amino acids) is a major source of non-phylogenetic signal.                  Conclusions:                       The incongruity in support between amino-acid and nucleotide analyses of the forementioned arthropod data set is resolved by showing that "standard" 20-amino-acid analyses yield lower node support specifically when serine provides crucial signal. Separate coding of Ser1 and Ser2 residues yields support commensurate with that found by degenerated nucleotides, without introducing phylogenetic artifacts. While exclusion of all serine data leads to reduced support for serine-sensitive nodes, these nodes are still recovered in the ML topology, indicating that the enhanced signal from Ser1 and Ser2 is not qualitatively different from that of the other amino acids.	0
Abstract2class: Bell's theorem for temporal order Abstract: Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classical-a scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.	0
Abstract2class: Perspectives of mitochondrial medicine Abstract: Mitochondrial medicine was established more than 50 years ago after discovery of the very first pathology caused by impaired mitochondria. Since then, more than 100 mitochondrial pathologies have been discovered. However, the number may be significantly higher if we interpret the term "mitochondrial medicine" more widely and include in these pathologies not only those determined by the genetic apparatus of the nucleus and mitochondria, but also acquired mitochondrial defects of non-genetic nature. Now the main problems of mitochondriology arise from methodology, this being due to studies of mitochondrial activities under different models and conditions that are far from the functioning of mitochondria in a cell, organ, or organism. Controversial behavior of mitochondria ("friends and foes") to some extent might be explained by their bacterial origin with possible preservation of "egoistic" features peculiar to bacteria. Apparently, for normal mitochondrial functioning it is essential to maintain homeostasis of a number of mitochondrial elements such as mitochondrial DNA structure, membrane potential, and the system of mitochondrial quality control. Abrogation of these elements can cause a number of pathologies that have become subjects of mitochondrial medicine. Some approaches to therapy of mitochondrial pathologies are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Total synthesis and biological evaluation of largazole and derivatives with promising selectivity for cancers cells Abstract: The efficient total synthesis of the natural substance largazole is described. Using this strategy, a small library of largazole analogs was developed. Structure-activity relationship studies suggested that the geometry of the alkene in the side chain is critical. While the largazole's analogues with trans-alkene are potent for the antiproliferative effect, those with cis-alkene are completely inactive. Most importantly, replacement of valine with tyrosine in largazole increased selectivity toward human cancer cells over human normal cells more than 100-fold.	0
Abstract2class: Thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone Inhibits Alg44 Binding to c-di-GMP and Reduces Alginate Production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that affects a large proportion of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF patients have dehydrated mucus within the airways that leads to the inability of the mucociliary escalator to expel inhaled microbes. Once inhaled, P. aeruginosa can persist in the lungs of the CF patients for the remainder of their lives. During this chronic infection, a phenomenon called mucoid conversion can occur in which P. aeruginosa can mutate and inactivate their mucA gene. As a consequence, transcription of the alg operon is highly expressed, leading to the copious secretion of the alginate exopolysaccharide, which is associated with decreased lung function and increased CF patient morbidity and mortality. Alginate biosynthesis by P. aeruginosa is post-translationally regulated by bis(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which binds to the receptor protein Alg44 to activate alginate production. The identification of small molecules that disrupt the binding of c-di-GMP to Alg44 could inhibit the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce alginate. In this work, a class of thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone compounds that inhibited Alg44 binding to c-di-GMP in vitro was identified after screening chemical libraries consisting of ∼50 000 chemical compounds. Thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinones were shown to specifically inhibit Alg44-c-di-GMP interactions by forming a disulfide bond with the cysteine residue in the PilZ domain of Alg44. The more potent thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone had the ability to reduce P. aeruginosa alginate secretion by up to 30%. These compounds serve as leads in the development of novel inhibitors of alginate production by P. aeruginosa after mucoid conversion.	0
Abstract2class: Vertical transmission of highly similar bla CTX-M-1-harboring IncI1 plasmids in Escherichia coli with different MLST types in the poultry production pyramid Abstract: Objectives:                       The purpose of this study was to characterize sets of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected longitudinally from different flocks of broiler breeders, meconium of 1-day-old broilers from theses breeder flocks, as well as from these broiler flocks before slaughter.                  Methods:                       Five sets of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli were studied by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), phylogenetic grouping, PCR-based replicon typing and resistance profiling. The bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids of one set (pHV295.1, pHV114.1, and pHV292.1) were fully sequenced and subjected to comparative analysis.                  Results:                       Eleven different MLST sequence types (ST) were identified with ST1056 the predominant one, isolated in all five sets either on the broiler breeder or meconium level. Plasmid sequencing revealed that bla CTX-M-1 was carried by highly similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids that were 105 076 bp, 110 997 bp, and 117 269 bp in size, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The fact that genetically similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids were found in ESBL-producing E. coli of different MLST types isolated at the different levels in the broiler production pyramid provides strong evidence for a vertical transmission of these plasmids from a common source (nucleus poultry flocks).	0
Abstract2class: Regulation of production of the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol in Pseudomonas fluorescens F113: genetic analysis of phlF as a transcriptional repressor Abstract: The antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol plays a major role in the biocontrol capabilities of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The phloroglucinol biosynthetic locus of P. fluorescens F113 has been isolated previously. From nucleotide sequence data, a putative regulator gene (phlF) was identified upstream and divergently transcribed from the phlACBD phloroglucinol biosynthetic genes. PhlF shows similarity to various transcriptional repressors in the EMBL database and exhibits a helix-turn-helix motif in its amino acid sequence. phlF was cloned into an expression vector and the PhlF protein product was purified. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated PhlF to be a DNA-binding protein and showed that it binds to the phlA-phlF intergenic region. Introduction of phlF into P. fluorescens F113 in multiple copies resulted in repression of phloroglucinol production in this strain. This effect was mediated at the transcription level since the expression of a phloroglucinol biosynthetic gene fusion in this background was equally repressed. Furthermore, the inactivation of phlF results in derepression of phloroglucinol production in this strain.	1
Abstract2class: The genetic and molecular basis for sunscreen biosynthesis in cyanobacteria Abstract: Ultraviolet UV-A and UV-B radiation is harmful to living systems, causing damage to biological macromolecules. An important strategy for dealing with UV exposure is the biosynthesis of small-molecule sunscreens. Among such metabolites, the mycosporine and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are remarkable for their wide phylogenetic distribution and their unique chemical structures. Here, we report the identification of a MAA biosynthetic gene cluster in a cyanobacterium and the discovery of analogous pathways in other sequenced organisms. We have expressed the cluster in a heterologous bacterial host and characterized all four biosynthetic enzymes in vitro. In addition to clarifying the origin of the MAAs, these efforts have revealed two unprecedented enzymatic strategies for imine formation.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of HbCDPK1, an ethephon-induced calcium-dependent protein kinase gene of Hevea brasiliensis Abstract: Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), as major primary Ca(2+) sensors, have been implicated in the regulation of stress and developmental signals in plants. In this study, a novel CDPK gene, designated HbCDPK1, was isolated from Hevea brasiliensis. The HbCDPK1 cDNA had 2,400 bp with an open reading frame of 1,671 bp encoding 556 amino acids, and the deduced HbCDPK1 protein contained four characteristic domains identified in CDPKs, showing a high level of sequence similarity to CDPKs from other plants. Expression analysis revealed more significant accumulation of the transcripts of HbCDPK1 in latex than in the leaves, bark, and roots in H. brasiliensis. In addition, transcription of HbCDPK1 was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, jasmonic acid (JA), and ethephon. Recombinant HbCDPK1 was expressed in E. coli, and its activity was assayed. The assay indicated that HbCDPK1 had the kinase and Ca(2+)-binding activity in vitro as a calcium-dependent protein. The potential roles of the HbCDPK1 are discussed as to latex production and rubber biosynthesis.	0
Abstract2class: The enduracidin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fungicidicus Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the 17 aa peptide antibiotic enduracidin has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces fungicidicus ATCC 21013. The 84 kb gene cluster contains 25 ORFs and is located within a 116 kb genetic locus that was fully sequenced. Targeted disruption of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes in the cluster abolished enduracidin production and confirmed function. The cluster includes four genes, endA-D, encoding two-, seven-, eight- and one-module NRPSs, respectively, and includes unique modules for the incorporation of citrulline and enduracididine. The NRPS organization generally follows the collinearity principle, and starts with a condensation domain (C domain) similar to those found in other lipopeptide systems for the coupling of an acyl group to the starting amino acid. The sixth module of EndB, corresponding to Thr(8), is missing an adenylation domain (A domain) and this module is presumed to be loaded in trans by the single module protein EndD. The most striking feature of the NRPS organization is the lack of epimerization domains (E domains) in light of the fact that the product has seven d-amino acid residues. Sequence analysis reveals that C domains following modules corresponding to d-amino acids belong to a unique subset of C domains able to catalyse both epimerization and condensation reactions. Other genes directing lipid modification and activation, and formation of the non-proteinogenic amino acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and enduracididine are readily identified, as are genes possibly involved in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis and export. These findings provide the basis to further genetically manipulate and improve lipodepsipeptide antibiotics via combinatorial and chemical methods.	1
Abstract2class: Genome sequences of four divergent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients with sepsis or osteomyelitis Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections worldwide, with recent prevalence and higher frequency in wounded military personnel. Four A. baumannii strains from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) isolated between 2008 and 2009 were sequenced, representing diverse, multidrug-resistant isolates from osteomyelitis or septic patients.	0
Abstract2class: Relative morphological effects induced by cefoxitin and other beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro Abstract: Cefoxitin, a new semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic, induced filament formation at subinhibitory concentrations with a beta-lactamaseless strain of Enterobacter cloacae (HSC 18410 M66). The extent of filament induction by cefoxitin was similar to that seen with cephalothin, cefazolin, and benzylpenicillin. Filament induction by cefoxitin was markedly less than that seen with cephalexin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, cephradine, and cephapirin. Antibiotics which failed to induce filaments at any level tested included cephaloridine, cephacetrile, cephalosporin C, the cephamycins, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, A16884, A16886, and FL-1060. Those antimicrobial agents tested which lacked an aromatic substituent in the 7-position (for cephems) or in the 6-position (for penams) did not induce filaments. These observations suggest a possible relationship between filament induction of the test organism and the molecular nature of constituents in the 7- or 6-position of beta-lactams.	0
Abstract2class: Genome and proteome of Listeria monocytogenes phage PSA: an unusual case for programmed + 1 translational frameshifting in structural protein synthesis Abstract: PSA is a temperate phage isolated from Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A. We report its complete nucleotide sequence, which consists of a linear 37 618 bp DNA featuring invariable, 3'-protruding single stranded (cohesive) ends of 10 nucleotides. The physical characteristics were confirmed by partial denaturation mapping and electron microscopy of DNA molecules. Fifty-seven open reading frames were identified on the PSA genome, which are apparently organized into three major transcriptional units, in a life cycle-specific order. Functional assignments could be made to 33 gene products, including structural proteins, lysis components, DNA packaging proteins, lysogeny control functions and replication proteins. Bioinformatics demonstrated relatedness of PSA to phages infecting lactic acid bacteria and other low G + C Gram-positives, but revealed only few similarities to Listeria phage A118. Virion proteins were analysed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, which enabled identification of major capsid and tail proteins, a tape measure and a putative portal. These analyses also revealed an unusual form of translational frameshifting, which occurs during decoding of the mRNAs specifying the two major structural proteins. Frameshifting yields different length forms of Cps (gp5) and Tsh (gp10), featuring identical N-termini but different C-termini. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of tryptic peptide fragments was used to identify the modified C-termini of the longer protein species, by demonstration of specific sequences resulting from + 1 programmed translational frameshifting. A slippery sequence with overlapping proline codons near the 3' ends of both genes apparently redirects the ribosomes and initiates the recoding event. Two different cis-acting factors, a shifty stop and a pseudoknot, presumably stimulate frameshifting efficiency. PSA represents the first case of + 1 frameshifting among dsDNA phages, and appears to be the first example of a virus utilizing a 3' pseudoknot to stimulate such an event.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of a polyketide synthesis-encoding gene cluster of Streptomyces curacoi Abstract: A gene cluster homologous to the beta-ketoacyl synthase-encoding gene, actl, was cloned by Southern blot hybridization from Streptomyces curacoi, and a 5469-bp fragment was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed seven open reading frames (ORFs). A striking similarity to the whiE locus (encoding spore pigment synthesis) of Streptomyces coelicolor was found throughout the whole cluster, with conservation of the size and position of the seven ORFs. The structure of these two gene clusters suggests that they have a common origin, although the lower similarity in the noncoding regions suggests that the regulatory regions have diverged through evolution.	1
Abstract2class: Cytochrome P450 for Citreohybridonol Synthesis: Oxidative Derivatization of the Andrastin Scaffold Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster similar to that for andrastin A (1) was discovered in Emericella variecolor NBRC 32302. Ctr-P450, a cytochrome P450 uniquely present in the cluster, was coexpressed with the andrastin A biosynthetic genes, leading to the production of the antifeedant agent citreohybridonol (4), along with four new andrastin derivatives. The results revealed the unusual multifunctionality of Ctr-P450 and indicated that this approach can be applied for further natural product diversification.	1

Abstract2class: Barriers to genome editing with CRISPR in bacteria Abstract: Genome editing is essential for probing genotype-phenotype relationships and for enhancing chemical production and phenotypic robustness in industrial bacteria. Currently, the most popular tools for genome editing couple recombineering with DNA cleavage by the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. Although successful in some model strains, CRISPR-based genome editing has been slow to extend to the multitude of industrially relevant bacteria. In this review, we analyze existing barriers to implementing CRISPR-based editing across diverse bacterial species. We first compare the efficacy of current CRISPR-based editing strategies. Next, we discuss alternatives when the S. pyogenes Cas9 does not yield colonies. Finally, we describe different ways bacteria can evade editing and how elucidating these failure modes can improve CRISPR-based genome editing across strains. Together, this review highlights existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and offers guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in a wider range of bacterial species, including non-model strains.	0
Abstract2class: Temporal sequence of events during the initiation process in Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid replication: roles of the dnaA and dnaC gene products and ribonucleic acid polymerase Abstract: Three thermosensitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) initiation mutants of Escherichia coli exposed to the restrictive temperature for one to two generations were examined for the ability to reinitiate DNA replication after returning to the permissive temperature in the presence of rifampin, chloramphenicol, or nalidixic acid. Reinitiation in the dnaA mutant was inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas renitiation was not inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas reinitiation was not inhibited in two dnaC mutants by either rifampin or chloramphenicol. To observe the rifampin inhibition, the antibiotic must be added at least 10 min before return to the permissive temperature. The rifampin inhibition of reinitiation was not observed when a rifampin-resistant ribonucleic acid ((RNA) polymerase gene was introduced into the dnaA mutant, demonstrating that RNA polymerase synthesizes one or more RNA species required for the initation of DNA replication (origin-RNA). Reinitiation at 30 degrees C was not inhibited by streptolydigin in a stretolydigin-sensitive dnaA muntant. Incubation in the presence of nalidixic acid prevented subsequent reinitiation in the dnaC28 mutant but did not inhibit reinitiation in the dnaA5 muntant. These results demonstrate that the dnaA gene product acts before or during the synthesis of an origin-RNA, RNA polymerase synthesizes this origin RNA, and the dnaC gene product is involved in a step after this RNA synthesis event. Furthermore, these results suggest that the dnaC gene product is involved in the first deoxyribounucleotide polymerization event wheareas the dnaA gene product acts prior to this event. A model is presented describing the temporal sequence of events that occur during initiation of a round of DNA replication, based on results in this and the accompanying paper.	0
Abstract2class: Insights into the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone ansamycins geldanamycin and herbimycin, obtained by gene sequencing and disruption Abstract: Geldanamycin and the closely related herbimycins A, B, and C were the first benzoquinone ansamycins to be extensively studied for their antitumor properties as small-molecule inhibitors of the Hsp90 protein chaperone complex. These compounds are produced by two different Streptomyces hygroscopicus strains and have the same modular polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived carbon skeleton but different substitution patterns at C-11, C-15, and C-17. To set the stage for structural modification by genetic engineering, we previously identified the gene cluster responsible for geldanamycin biosynthesis. We have now cloned and sequenced a 115-kb segment of the herbimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. hygroscopicus AM 3672, including the genes for the PKS and most of the post-PKS tailoring enzymes. The similarities and differences between the gene clusters and biosynthetic pathways for these closely related ansamycins are interpreted with support from the results of gene inactivation experiments. In addition, the organization and functions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) starter unit and the post-PKS modifications of progeldanamycin were assessed by inactivating the subclusters of AHBA biosynthetic genes and two oxygenase genes (gdmM and gdmL) that were proposed to be involved in formation of the geldanamycin benzoquinoid system. A resulting novel geldanamycin analog, KOS-1806, was isolated and characterized.	1

Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of a novel diterpene gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungal secondary metabolites are a rich source of medically useful compounds due to their pharmaceutical and toxic properties. Sequencing of fungal genomes has revealed numerous secondary metabolite gene clusters, yet products of many of these biosynthetic pathways are unknown since the expression of the clustered genes usually remains silent in normal laboratory conditions. Therefore, to discover new metabolites, it is important to find ways to induce the expression of genes in these otherwise silent biosynthetic clusters. We discovered a novel secondary metabolite in Aspergillus nidulans by predicting a biosynthetic gene cluster with genomic mining. A Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-type transcription factor, PbcR, was identified, and its role as a pathway-specific activator for the predicted gene cluster was demonstrated. Overexpression of pbcR upregulated the transcription of seven genes in the identified cluster and led to the production of a diterpene compound, which was characterized with GC/MS as ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene. A change in morphology was also observed in the strains overexpressing pbcR. The activation of a cryptic gene cluster by overexpression of its putative Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-type transcription factor led to discovery of a novel secondary metabolite in Aspergillus nidulans. Quantitative real-time PCR and DNA array analysis allowed us to predict the borders of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Furthermore, we identified a novel fungal pimaradiene cyclase gene as well as genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. None of these genes have been previously implicated in the biosynthesis of terpenes in Aspergillus nidulans. These results identify the first Aspergillus nidulans diterpene gene cluster and suggest a biosynthetic pathway for ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene.	1
Abstract2class: The proteomic response to mutants of the Escherichia coli RNA degradosome Abstract: The Escherichia coli RNA degradosome recognizes and degrades RNA through the coordination of four main protein components, the endonuclease RNase E, the exonuclease PNPase, the RhlB helicase and the metabolic enzyme enolase. To help our understanding of the functions of the RNA degradosome, we quantified expression changes of >2300 proteins using mass spectrometry based shotgun proteomics in E. coli strains deficient in rhlB, eno, pnp (which displays temperature sensitive growth), or rne(1-602) which encodes a C-terminal truncation mutant of RNase E and is deficient in degradosome assembly. Global protein expression changes are most similar between the pnp and rhlB mutants, confirming the functional relationship between the genes. We observe down-regulation of protein chaperones including GroEL and DnaK (which associate with the degradosome), a decrease in translation related proteins in Δpnp, ΔrhlB and rne(1-602) cells, and a significant increase in the abundance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Analysis of the observed proteomic changes points to a shared motif, CGCTGG, that may be associated with RNA degradosome targets. Further, our data provide information on the expression modulation of known degradosome-associated proteins, such as DeaD and RNase G, as well as other RNA helicases and RNases - suggesting or confirming functional complementarity in some cases. Taken together, our results emphasize the role of the RNA degradosome in the modulation of the bacterial proteome and provide the first large-scale proteomic description of the response to perturbation of this major pathway of RNA degradation.	0
Abstract2class: Fabclavines: bioactive peptide-polyketide-polyamino hybrids from Xenorhabdus Abstract: The structure of the fabclavines-unique mixtures of nonribosomally derived peptide-polyketide hybrids connected to an unusual polyamino moiety-has been solved by detailed NMR and MS methods. These compounds have been identified in two different entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus strains, thereby leading also to the identification of the fabclavine biosynthesis gene cluster. Detailed analysis of these clusters and initial mutagenesis experiments allowed the prediction of a biosynthesis pathway in which the polyamino moiety is derived from an unusual type of fatty acid synthase that is normally involved in formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As fabclavines show broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and other eukaryotic cells, they might act as "protection factors" against all kinds of food competitors during the complex life cycle of Xenorhabdus, its nematode host, and their insect prey.	1
Abstract2class: HTS by NMR of combinatorial libraries: a fragment-based approach to ligand discovery Abstract: Fragment-based ligand design (FBLD) approaches have become more widely used in drug discovery projects from both academia and industry, and are even often preferred to traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) of large collection of compounds (>10(5)). A key advantage of FBLD approaches is that these often rely on robust biophysical methods such as NMR spectroscopy for detection of ligand binding, hence are less prone to artifacts that too often plague the results from HTS campaigns. In this article, we introduce a screening strategy that takes advantage of both the robustness of protein NMR spectroscopy as the detection method, and the basic principles of combinatorial chemistry to enable the screening of large libraries of fragments (>10(5) compounds) preassembled on a common backbone. We used the method to identify compounds that target protein-protein interactions.	0
Abstract2class: Pathway for the Biosynthesis of the Pigment Chrysogine by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Chrysogine is a yellow pigment produced by Penicillium chrysogenum and other filamentous fungi. Although the pigment was first isolated in 1973, its biosynthetic pathway has so far not been resolved. Here, we show that deletion of the highly expressed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene Pc21g12630 (chyA) resulted in a decrease in the production of chrysogine and 13 related compounds in the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Each of the genes of the chyA-containing gene cluster was individually deleted, and corresponding mutants were examined by metabolic profiling in order to elucidate their function. The data suggest that the NRPS ChyA mediates the condensation of anthranilic acid and alanine into the intermediate 2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzoic acid, which was verified by feeding experiments of a ΔchyA strain with the chemically synthesized product. The remainder of the pathway is highly branched, yielding at least 13 chrysogine-related compounds.IMPORTANCEPenicillium chrysogenum is used in industry for the production of β-lactams, but also produces several other secondary metabolites. The yellow pigment chrysogine is one of the most abundant metabolites in the culture broth, next to β-lactams. Here, we have characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster involved in chrysogine production and elucidated a complex and highly branched biosynthetic pathway, assigning each of the chrysogine cluster genes to biosynthetic steps and metabolic intermediates. The work further unlocks the metabolic potential of filamentous fungi and the complexity of secondary metabolite pathways.	1

Abstract2class: Prochlorococcus ecotype abundances in the North Atlantic Ocean as revealed by an improved quantitative PCR method Abstract: The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus numerically dominates the photosynthetic community in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world's oceans. Six evolutionary lineages of Prochlorococcus have been described, and their distinctive physiologies and genomes indicate that these lineages are "ecotypes" and should have different oceanic distributions. Two methods recently developed to quantify these ecotypes in the field, probe hybridization and quantitative PCR (QPCR), have shown that this is indeed the case. To facilitate a global investigation of these ecotypes, we modified our QPCR protocol to significantly increase its speed, sensitivity, and accessibility and validated the method in the western and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. We showed that all six ecotypes had distinct distributions that varied with depth and location, and, with the exception of the deeper waters at the western North Atlantic site, the total Prochlorococcus counts determined by QPCR matched the total counts measured by flow cytometry. Clone library analyses of the deeper western North Atlantic waters revealed ecotypes that are not represented in the culture collections with which the QPCR primers were designed, explaining this discrepancy. Finally, similar patterns of relative ecotype abundance were obtained in QPCR and probe hybridization analyses of the same field samples, which could allow comparisons between studies.	0
Abstract2class: Investigating the Function of Cryptic Cytochalasan Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Using Combinatorial Biosynthesis Abstract: Tailoring enzymes in cytochalasan biosynthesis are relatively promiscuous. Exploiting this property, we deduced the function of four cryptic cytochrome P450 monooxygenases via heterologous expression of six cytochrome P450-encoding genes, originating from Hypoxylon fragiforme and Pyricularia oryzae, in pyrichalasin H ΔP450 strains. Three cryptic cytochrome P450 enzymes (HffD, HffG, and CYP1) restored pyrichalasin H production in mutant strains, while CYP3 catalyzed a site-selective epoxidation leading to the isolation of three novel cytochalasans.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the biosynthesis gene cluster for alkyl-O-dihydrogeranyl-methoxyhydroquinones in Actinoplanes missouriensis Abstract: A polyketide biosynthesis gene cluster (agq) was found on the genome of a rare actinomycete, Actinoplanes missouriensis. Streptomyces lividans expressing agqA encoding a type III polyketide synthase produced alkylresorcinols mainly from C(16-17) fatty acids. Heterologous expression of the agq genes in S. lividans indicated the function of cognate polyketide modification enzymes; a monooxygenase AgqB hydroxylates the alkylresorcinols to yield 6-alkyl-2-hydroxyhydroquinones, a methyltransferase AgqC catalyzes O-methylation of the alkyl-hydroxyhydroquinones to yield 6-alkyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones, and a UbiA-like prenyltransferase AgqD attaches a prenyl group to the C-4 hydroxy group of the alkyl-methoxyhydroquinones to yield 6-alkyl-4-O-geranyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones and 6-alkyl-4-O-dihydrofarnesyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones derived from C(16-17) fatty acids. In contrast, A. missouriensis was found to produce 6-alkyl-4-O-dihydrogeranyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones derived from C(16-18) fatty acids by the function of the agq gene cluster. All of these prenylated phenolic lipids were novel compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Neutral loss fragmentation pattern based screening for arginine-rich natural products in Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus Abstract: Although sharing a certain degree of structural uniformity, natural product classes exhibit variable functionalities such as different amino acid or acyl residues. During collision induced dissociation, some natural products exhibit a conserved fragmentation pattern close to the precursor ion. The observed fragments result from a shared set of neutral losses, creating a unique fragmentation pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint for members of these natural product classes. The culture supernatants of 69 strains of the entomopathogenic bacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus were analyzed by MALDI-MS(2), and a database comprising MS(2) data from each strain was established. This database was scanned for concordant fragmentation patterns of different compounds using a customized software, focusing on relative mass differences of the fragment ions to their precursor ion. A novel group of related natural products comprising 25 different arginine-rich peptides from 16 different strains was identified due to its characteristic neutral loss fragmentation pattern, and the structures of eight compounds were elucidated. Two biosynthesis gene clusters encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases were identified, emphasizing the possibility to identify a group of structurally and biosynthetically related natural products based on their neutral loss fragmentation pattern.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of anti-BCG benz[α]anthraquinones and new siderophores from a Xinjiang desert-isolated rare actinomycete Nocardia sp. XJ31 Abstract: The current global demand for novel anti-TB drugs has drawn urgent attention on the discovery of natural product compounds with anti-TB activity. Lots of efforts have emphasized on environmental samples from unexplored or underexplored natural habits and identified numerous rare actinomycete taxa producing structurally diverse bioactive natural products. Herein, we report a survey of the rare actinobacteria diversity in Xinjiang region together with the discovery of anti-TB active natural products from these strains. We have collected 17 soil samples at different sites with different environmental conditions, from which 39 rare actinobacteria were identified by using a selective isolation strategy with 5 media variations. Among those isolated strains, XJ31 was identified as a new Nocardia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Through one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy combined with anti-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bioassay-guided isolation, two groups of compounds were identified. They were twelve siderophores (nocardimicins, 1-12) and two anthraquinones (brasiliquinones, 13 and 14) and ten of them were identified as new compounds. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using HR-ESI-MS, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR techniques. The anti-TB bioassays revealed that the two benz[α]anthraquinones have potent activity against BCG (MICs = 25 μM), which can be used as a promising start point for further anti-TB drug development. KEY POINTS: • Ten new natural products were identified from Nocardia sp. XJ31. • Brasiliquinones 13 and 14 showed moderate anti-BCG activity.	0
Abstract2class: Virulence factors and molecular characteristics of Shigella flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea Abstract: Background:                       The natural hosts of Shigella are typically humans and other primates, but it has been shown that the host range of Shigella has expanded to many animals. Although Shigella is becoming a major threat to animals, there is limited information on the genetic background of local strains. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of virulence factors and the molecular characteristics of S. flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea.                  Results:                       Fifty-four S. flexneri isolates from Gansun, Shanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet obtained during 2014 to 2016 possessed four typical biochemical characteristics of Shigella. The prevalences of ipaH, virA, ipaBCD, ial, sen, set1A, set1B and stx were 100 %, 100 %, 77.78 %, 79.63 %, 48.15 %, 48.15 and 0 %, respectively. Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) based on 8 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci discriminated the isolates into 39 different MLVA types (MTs), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) based on NotI digestion divided the 54 isolates into 31 PFGE types (PTs), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 15 housekeeping genes differentiated the isolates into 7 MLST sequence types (STs).                  Conclusions:                       The findings from this study enrich our knowledge of the molecular characteristics of S. flexneri collected from calves with diarrhea, which will be important for addressing clinical and epidemiological issues regarding shigellosis.	0
Abstract2class: Frequency of human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERV) K113 and K115 in the Polish population, and their effect on HIV infection Abstract: Background:                       The human genome contains about 8% of endogenous retroviral sequences originated from germ cell infections by exogenous retroviruses during evolution. Most of those sequences are inactive because of accumulation of mutations but some of them are still capable to be transcribed and translated. The latter are insertionally polymorphic HERV-K113 and HERV-K115. It has been suggested that their presence and expression was connected with several human diseases. It is also believed that they could interfere with the replication cycle of exogenous retroviruses, including HIV.                  Results:                       Prevalence of endogenous retroviral sequences HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 was determined in the Polish population. The frequencies were found as 11.8% for HERV-K113 and 7.92% for HERV-K115. To verify the hypothesis that the presence of these HERVs sequences could affect susceptibility to HIV infection, comparison of a control group (HIV-negative, not exposed to HIV; n = 303) with HIV-positive patients (n = 470) and exposed but uninfected (EU) individuals (n = 121) was performed. Prevalence of HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 in the EU group was 8.26% and 5.71%, respectively. In the HIV(+) group we detected HERV-K113 sequences in 12.98% of the individuals and HERV-K115 sequences in 7.23% of the individuals. There were no statistically significant differences between groups studied.                  Conclusion:                       The frequency of HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 sequences in Poland were found to be higher than usually shown for European populations. No relation between presence of the HERVs and HIV infection was detected.	0
Abstract2class: Modulation of kanamycin B and kanamycin A biosynthesis in Streptomyces kanamyceticus via metabolic engineering Abstract: Both kanamycin A and kanamycin B, antibiotic components produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus, have medical value. Two different pathways for kanamycin biosynthesis have been reported by two research groups. In this study, to obtain an optimal kanamycin A-producing strain and a kanamycin B-high-yield strain, we first examined the native kanamycin biosynthetic pathway in vivo. Based on the proposed parallel biosynthetic pathway, kanN disruption should lead to kanamycin A accumulation; however, the kanN-disruption strain produced neither kanamycin A nor kanamycin B. We then tested the function of kanJ and kanK. The main metabolite of the kanJ-disruption strain was identified as kanamycin B. These results clarified that kanamycin biosynthesis does not proceed through the parallel pathway and that synthesis of kanamycin A from kanamycin B is catalyzed by KanJ and KanK in S. kanamyceticus. As expected, the kanamycin B yield of the kanJ-disruption strain was 3268±255 μg/mL, 12-fold higher than that of the original strain. To improve the purity of kanamycin A and reduce the yield of kanamycin B in the fermentation broth, four different kanJ- and kanK-overexpressing strains were constructed through either homologous recombination or site-specific integration. The overexpressing strain containing three copies of kanJ and kanK in its genome exhibited the lowest kanamycin B yield (128±20 μg/mL), which was 54% lower than that of the original strain. Our experimental results demonstrate that kanamycin A is derived from KanJ-and-KanK-catalyzed conversion of kanamycin B in S. kanamyceticus. Moreover, based on the clarified biosynthetic pathway, we obtained a kanamycin B-high-yield strain and an optimized kanamycin A-producing strain with minimal byproduct.	1
Abstract2class: Ipomoeassin F Binds Sec61α to Inhibit Protein Translocation Abstract: Ipomoeassin F is a potent natural cytotoxin that inhibits growth of many tumor cell lines with single-digit nanomolar potency. However, its biological and pharmacological properties have remained largely unexplored. Building upon our earlier achievements in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry, we used chemical proteomics to identify Sec61α (protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 1), the pore-forming subunit of the Sec61 protein translocon, as a direct binding partner of ipomoeassin F in living cells. The interaction is specific and strong enough to survive lysis conditions, enabling a biotin analogue of ipomoeassin F to pull down Sec61α from live cells, yet it is also reversible, as judged by several experiments including fluorescent streptavidin staining, delayed competition in affinity pulldown, and inhibition of TNF biogenesis after washout. Sec61α forms the central subunit of the ER protein translocation complex, and the binding of ipomoeassin F results in a substantial, yet selective, inhibition of protein translocation in vitro and a broad ranging inhibition of protein secretion in live cells. Lastly, the unique resistance profile demonstrated by specific amino acid single-point mutations in Sec61α provides compelling evidence that Sec61α is the primary molecular target of ipomoeassin F and strongly suggests that the binding of this natural product to Sec61α is distinctive. Therefore, ipomoeassin F represents the first plant-derived, carbohydrate-based member of a novel structural class that offers new opportunities to explore Sec61α function and to further investigate its potential as a therapeutic target for drug discovery.	0
Abstract2class: Electron spin echo studies of the copper complexes of conalbumin Abstract: Electron spin echo envelope spectroscopy was used to probe the two metal binding sites of Cu(II)-conalbumin. The echo envelope spectrum of Cu(II)-conalbumin-oxalate, with metal ion at either one or both of the binding sites, contains lines arising from the interaction of the electron spin of Cu(II) with bound imidazole, demonstrating histidine ligation to the metal ion. The 13C superhyperfine interaction of bound [13C]oxalate, obtained from the ratio of the electron spin echo envelopes of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[13C]oxalate to that of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[12C]oxalate, is about twice the free precession frequency and indicates a contact interaction between 13C and Cu(II). This study indicates that oxalate is directly coordinated to the metal ion. Over the pH range 7.0 to 10.0, where Cu(II)-conalbumin binds carbonate as an associated anion, the echo envelope spectrum indicates that at least one imidazole ligand is coordinated to Cu(II). Below pH 6.0 and above pH 11.0, imidazole coordination is not observed.	0
Abstract2class: Substrate specificity of 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase, a bacterial cytochrome P450 of erythromycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase (EryF) is a soluble cytochrome P450 responsible for the stereospecific C-6 hydroxylation of the erythromycin precursor, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. Using the expression of the eryF gene in Escherichia coli [Andersen, J. F., & Hutchinson, C. R. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 725-735] as the enzyme source, we examined the catalytic activity of the EryF protein toward several macrolide substrates related to 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The results of these studies were compared with measurements of the apparent dissociation constants for various substrates and with information from molecular modeling studies of the substrates and the enzyme-substrate complex. Only minor changes in the structure of 6-deoxyerythronolide B resulted in substrates with catalytic rates less than 1% of those seen with the natural substrate. Although the 9S epimer of 9-deoxo-9-hydroxy-6-deoxyerythronolide B was hydroxylated at a rate approximately equal to the natural substrate, the 9R epimer was hydroxylated at a 2-fold lower rate. Examination of molecular models revealed that the position of the 9-hydroxyl oxygen in the 9S epimer resembles that of the 9-oxo oxygen in the natural substrate more closely than in the 9R epimer. 8,8a-Deoxyoleandolide, which is identical to 6-deoxyerythronolide B except for the presence of a C-13 methyl group, and its (9S)-9-deoxo-9-hydroxy derivative were C-6 hydroxylated at a 4-fold lower rate than the natural substrate, and the 9-oxo form showed a substantially larger apparent dissociation constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Key Dioxygenases that Diverged the Paraherquonin and Acetoxydehydroaustin Pathways in Penicillium brasilianum Abstract: Paraherquonin (1), a fungal meroterpenoid produced by Penicillium brasilianum NBRC 6234, possesses a unique, highly congested hexacyclic molecular architecture. Here we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 (the prh cluster) and elucidated the pathway up to berkeleydione (2), which serves as the key intermediate for the biosynthesis of 1 as well as many other meroterpenoids. Interestingly, the nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase PrhA constructs the cycloheptadiene moiety to afford 2 from preaustinoid A1 (6), probably via the homoallyl-homoallyl radical rearrangement. Additionally, another fungal strain, P. brasilianum MG11, which produces acetoxydehydroaustin instead of 1, was found to have a gene cluster nearly identical to the prh cluster. The dioxygenase encoded by the cluster shares 92% sequence identity with PrhA, and also accepts 6 but produces preaustinoid A3 (17) with a spiro-lactone system, generating a diverging point for the two different meroterpenoid pathways in the same species.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the SgcF epoxide hydrolase supporting an (R)-vicinal diol intermediate for enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: C-1027 is a chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic consisting of an apoprotein and the C-1027 chromophore. The C-1027 chromophore possesses four distinct structural moieties-an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a benzoxazolinate, and an (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine-the latter two of which are proposed to be appended to the enediyne core via a convergent biosynthetic strategy. Here we report the in vitro characterization of SgcF, an epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster that catalyzes regio- and stereospecific hydrolysis of styrene oxide, serving as an enediyne core epoxide intermediate mimic, to form a vicinal diol. Abolishment of C-1027 production in the DeltasgcF mutant strain Streptomyces globisporus SB1010 unambiguously establishes that sgcF plays an indispensable role in C-1027 biosynthesis. SgcF efficiently hydrolyzes (S)-styrene oxide, displaying an apparent K(m) of 0.6 +/- 0.1 mM and k(cat) of 48 +/- 1 min(-1), via attack at the alpha-position to exclusively generate the (R)-phenyl vicinal diol, consistent with the stereochemistry of the C-1027 chromophore. These findings support the role of SgcF in the proposed convergent pathway for C-1027 biosynthesis, unveiling an (R)-vicinal diol as a key intermediate. Interestingly, SgcF can also hydrolyze (R)-styrene oxide to afford preferentially the (R)-phenyl vicinal diol via attack at the beta-position, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency (apparent K(m) of 2.0 +/- 0.4 mM and k(cat) = 4.3 +/- 0.3 min(-1)). Although the latter activity unlikely contributes to C-1027 biosynthesis in vivo, such enantioconvergence arising from complementary regioselective hydrolysis of a racemic substrate could be exploited to engineer epoxide hydrolases with improved regio- and/or enantiospecificity.	1
Abstract2class: Self-resistance guided genome mining uncovers new topoisomerase inhibitors from myxobacteria Abstract: There is astounding discrepancy between the genome-inscribed production capacity and the set of known secondary metabolite classes from many microorganisms as detected under laboratory cultivation conditions. Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to - and inhibition of - unwinding topoisomerases such as E. coli topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since E. coli topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 μg ml-1.	1
Abstract2class: Understanding thioamitide biosynthesis using pathway engineering and untargeted metabolomics Abstract: Thiostreptamide S4 is a thioamitide, a family of promising antitumour ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The thioamitides are one of the most structurally complex RiPP families, yet very few thioamitide biosynthetic steps have been elucidated, even though the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of multiple thioamitides have been identified. We hypothesised that engineering the thiostreptamide S4 BGC in a heterologous host could provide insights into its biosynthesis when coupled with untargeted metabolomics and targeted mutations of the precursor peptide. Modified BGCs were constructed, and in-depth metabolomics enabled a detailed understanding of the biosynthetic pathway to thiostreptamide S4, including the identification of a protein critical for amino acid dehydration that has homology to HopA1, an effector protein used by a plant pathogen to aid infection. We use this biosynthetic understanding to bioinformatically identify diverse RiPP-like BGCs, paving the way for future RiPP discovery and engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Chromobacterium violaceum: a review of pharmacological and industiral perspectives Abstract: Violet-pigmented bacteria, which have been described since the end of the 19th century, are occasionally the causative agent of septicemia and sometimes cause fatal infection in human and animals. Bacteria, producing violet colonies due to the production of a nondiffusible pigment violacein, were classified as a redefined genus Chromobacterium. Chromobacterium violaceum is gram-negative, and saprophyte from soil and water is normally considered nonpathogenic to human, but is an opportunistic pathogen of extreme virulence for human and animals. The biosynthesis and biological activities of violacein and the diverse effects of this pigment have been studied. Besides violacein, C. violaceum produces other antibiotics, such as aerocyanidin and aerocavin, which exhibit in vitro activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. 3,6-Dihydroxyindoxazene and Y-TO678h exhibit a selective activity against gram-negative bacteria. Arphamenine A and B, and FR901228, that enhanced immunoresponse, and potentiators of beta-lactam antibiotics and chelators such as ferrioxamine exhibit important clinical potential applications. Lipopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyesters together with several enzymes appear as important metabolites with biotechnological applications. Many of these metabolites were already studied at the genome level.	1
Abstract2class: An anaerobic bacterium host system for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Anaerobic bacteria represent an overlooked rich source of biological and chemical diversity. Due to the challenge of cultivation and genetic intractability, assessing the capability of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolite production requires an efficient heterologous expression system. However, this kind of host system is still unavailable. Here, we use the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus mutans UA159 as a heterologous host for the expression of BGCs from anaerobic bacteria. A natural competence based large DNA fragment cloning (NabLC) technique was developed, which can move DNA fragments up to 40-kb directly and integrate a 73.7-kb BGC to the genome of S. mutans UA159 via three rounds of NabLC cloning. Using this system, we identify an anti-infiltration compound, mutanocyclin, from undefined BGCs from human oral bacteria. We anticipate this host system will be useful for heterologous expression of BGCs from anaerobic bacteria.	1

Two of the deletions yielded molecules that give information about the biosynthesis of this metabolite.	1
Abstract2class: Engineering the substrate specificity of the DhbE adenylation domain by yeast cell surface display Abstract: The adenylation (A) domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) activate aryl acids or amino acids to launch their transfer through the NRPS assembly line for the biosynthesis of many medicinally important natural products. In order to expand the substrate pool of NRPSs, we developed a method based on yeast cell surface display to engineer the substrate specificities of the A-domains. We acquired A-domain mutants of DhbE that have 11- and 6-fold increases in k(cat)/K(m) with nonnative substrates 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-aminobenzoic acid, respectively and corresponding 3- and 33-fold decreases in k(cat)/K(m) values with the native substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, resulting in a dramatic switch in substrate specificity of up to 200-fold. Our study demonstrates that yeast display can be used as a high throughput selection platform to reprogram the "nonribosomal code" of A-domains.	0
Abstract2class: Antiproliferative prenylated stilbenes and flavonoids from Macaranga alnifolia from the Madagascar rainforest Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of an extract of the fruit of Macaranga alnifolia from Madagascar led to the isolation of four new prenylated stilbenes, schweinfurthins E-H (1-4), and one new geranylated dihydroflavonol, alnifoliol (5). The known prenylated stilbene vedelianin (6) and the known geranylated flavonoids bonanniol A (7), diplacol (8), bonannione A (9), and diplacone (10) were also isolated. All 10 compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity in the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line assay. Vedelianin (IC50 = 0.13 microM) exhibited the greatest activity among all isolates, while schweinfurthin E (IC50 = 0.26 microM) was the most potent of the new compounds.	0
Abstract2class: Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) lacks a genomic island present in the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans 66 Abstract: Streptomyces lividans ZX1 has become a preferred host for DNA cloning in Streptomyces species over its progenitor, the wild-type strain 66 (stock number 1326 from the John Innes Center collection), especially when stable DNA is crucial for in vitro electrophoresis, because DNA from strain 66 contains a novel modification that makes it sensitive to oxidative double-strand cleavage during electrophoresis. Detailed analysis of this modification-deficient mutant (ZX1) revealed that it has several additional phenotypic traits associated with a chromosomal deletion of ca. 90 kb, which was cloned and mapped by using a cosmid library. Comparative sequence analysis of two clones containing the left and right deletion ends originating from strain 66 and one clone with the deletion and fused sequence cloned from strain ZX1 revealed a perfect 15-bp direct repeat, which may have mediated deletion and fusion to yield strain ZX1 by site-specific recombination. Analysis of AseI linking clones in the deleted region in relation to the published AseI map of strain ZX1 yielded a complete AseI map for the S. lividans 66 genome, on which the relative positions of a cloned phage phiHAU3 resistance (phiHAU3r) gene and the dnd gene cluster were precisely localized. Comparison of S. lividans ZX1 and its progenitor 66, as well as the sequenced genome of its close relative, Streptomyces coelicolor M145, reveals that the ca. 90-kb deletion in strain ZX1 may have originated from an insertion from an unknown source.	0
Abstract2class: The natural products beauveriolide I and III: a new class of beta-amyloid-lowering compounds Abstract: Attacking Alzheimer's by ACAT: The aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides, especially Abeta(42), into senile plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that the fungal natural products beauveriolides I and III can potently decrease Abeta secretion from cells expressing human amyloid precursor protein; this offers a potential new scaffold for the development of compounds with proven bioavailability for the treatment of AD.	0
Abstract2class: Activation of human phospholipase C-eta2 by Gbetagamma Abstract: Phospholipase C-eta2 (PLC-eta2) was recently identified as a novel broadly expressed phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing isozyme [Zhou, Y., et al. (2005) Biochem. J. 391, 667-676; Nakahara, M., et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 29128-29134]. In this study, we investigated the direct regulation of PLC-eta2 by Gbetagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Coexpression of PLC-eta2 with Gbeta 1gamma 2, as well as with certain other Gbetagamma dimers, in COS-7 cells resulted in increases in inositol phosphate accumulation. Gbeta 1gamma 2-dependent increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis also were observed with a truncation mutant of PLC-eta2 that lacks the long alternatively spliced carboxy-terminal domain of the isozyme. To begin to define the enzymatic properties of PLC-eta2 and its potential direct activation by Gbetagamma, a construct of PLC-eta2 encompassing the canonical domains conserved in all PLCs (PH domain through C2 domain) was purified to homogeneity after expression from a baculovirus in insect cells. Enzyme activity of purified PLC-eta2 was quantified after reconstitution with PtdIns(4,5)P 2-containing phospholipid vesicles, and values for K m (14.4 microM) and V max [12.6 micromol min (-1) (mg of protein) (-1)] were similar to activities previously observed with purified PLC-beta or PLC-epsilon isozymes. Moreover, purified Gbeta 1gamma 2 stimulated the activity of purified PLC-eta2 in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that observed with purified PLC-beta2. Activation was dependent on the presence of free Gbeta 1gamma 2 since its sequestration in the presence of Galpha i1 or GRK2-ct reversed Gbeta 1gamma 2-promoted activation. The PH domain of PLC-eta2 is not required for Gbeta 1gamma 2-mediated regulation since a purified fragment encompassing the EF-hand through C2 domains but lacking the PH domain nonetheless was activated by Gbeta 1gamma 2. Taken together, these studies illustrate that PLC-eta2 is a direct downstream effector of Gbetagamma and, therefore, of receptor-activated heterotrimeric G proteins.	0
Abstract2class: Semisynthetic analogues of toxiferine I and their pharmacological properties at α7 nAChRs, muscle-type nAChRs, and the allosteric binding site of muscarinic M2 receptors Abstract: A new series of analogues of the calabash curare alkaloid toxiferine I was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated at α7 and muscle-type nAChRs and the allosteric site of muscarinic M2 receptors. The new ligands differ from toxiferine I by the absence of one (2a-c) or two (3a-c) hydroxy groups, saturation of the exocyclic double bonds, and various N-substituents (methyl, allyl, 4-nitrobenzyl). At the muscle-type nAChRs, most ligands showed similar binding to the muscle relaxant alcuronium, indicating neuromuscular blocking activity, with the nonhydroxylated analogues 3b (Ki = 75 nM) and 3c (Ki = 82 nM) displaying the highest affinity. At α7 nAChRs, all ligands showed a moderate to low antagonistic effect, suggesting that the alcoholic functions are not necessary for antagonistic action. Compound 3c exerted the highest preference for the muscle-type nAChRs (Ki = 82 nM) over α7 (IC50 = 21 μM). As for the allosteric site of M2 receptors, binding was found to be dependent on N-substitution rather than on the nature of the side chains. The most potent ligands were the N-allyl analogues 2b and 3b (EC0.5,diss = 12 and 36 nM) and the N-nitrobenzyl derivatives 2c and 3c (EC0.5,diss = 32 and 49 nM). The present findings should help delineate the structural requirements for activity at different types of AChRs and for the design of novel selective ligands.	0
Abstract2class: Detection of miRNA expression in intact cells using activatable sensor oligonucleotides Abstract: We describe a technology for the profiling of miRNA expression in intact cells. The technology is based on sensor oligonucleotides that are cleavable, completely complementary to a target miRNA, and dual-labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher. Upon entering the cell, the sensor oligonucleotide binds its specific miRNA target through complementary base-pairing. This triggers assembly of the endogenous RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) around the miRNA-sensor duplex and cleavage of the sensor oligonucleotide, resulting in separation between the dye and quencher, and a fluorescence turn-on. In the presented feasibility studies, we focus on a specific miRNA (miR-10b) implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Using a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we illustrate the application of this technology for miRNA detection with nanomolar sensitivity in both a cell-free system and intact cells.	0
Abstract2class: Oxygen-18 Kinetic Isotope Effects of Nonheme Iron Enzymes HEPD and MPnS Support Iron(III) Superoxide as the Hydrogen Abstraction Species Abstract: Nonheme iron oxygenases that carry out four-electron oxidations of substrate have been proposed to employ iron(III) superoxide species to initiate this reaction [Paria, S.; Que, L.; Paine, T. K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 11129]. Here we report experimental evidence in support of this proposal. (18)O KIEs were measured for two recently discovered mononuclear nonheme iron oxygenases: hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase (HEPD) and methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS). Competitive (18)O KIEs measured with deuterated substrates are larger than those measured with unlabeled substrates, which indicates that C-H cleavage must occur before an irreversible reductive step at molecular oxygen. A similar observation was previously used to implicate copper(II) superoxide in the H-abstraction reactions catalyzed by dopamine β-monooxygenase [Tian, G. C.; Klinman, J. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 8891] and peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase [Francisco, W. A.; Blackburn, N. J.; Klinman, J. P. Biochemistry 2003, 42, 1813].	0
Abstract2class: Methylation-dependent acyl transfer between polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules in fungal natural product biosynthesis Abstract: Biochemical studies of purified and dissected fungal polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) hybrid enzymes involved in biosynthesis of pseurotin and aspyridone indicate that one α-methylation step during polyketide synthesis is a prerequisite and a key checkpoint for chain transfer between PKS and NRPS modules. In the absence of the resulting γ-methyl feature, the completed polyketide intermediate is offloaded as an α-pyrone instead of being aminoacylated by the NRPS domain. These examples illustrate that precisely timed tailoring domain activities play critical roles in the overall programming of the iterative PKS (and NRPS) functions.	1
Abstract2class: Methanogenesis in a Thermophilic (58 degrees C) Anaerobic Digestor: Methanothrix sp. as an Important Aceticlastic Methanogen Abstract: Aceticlastic methanogens and other microbial groups were enumerated in a 58 degrees C laboratory-scale (3 liter) anaerobic digestor which was fed air-classified municipal refuse, a lignocellulosic waste (loading rate = 1.8 to 2.7 g of volatile solids per liter per day; retention time = 10 days). Two weeks after start-up, Methanosarcina sp. was present in high numbers (10 to 10 CFU/ml) and autofluorescent Methanosarcina-like clumps were abundant in sludge examined by using epifluorescence microscopy. After about 4 months of digestor operation, numbers of Methanosarcina sp. dropped 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and large numbers (most probable number = 10 to 10/ml) of a thermophilic aceticlastic methanogen morphologically resembing Methanothrix sp. were found. Methanothrix sp. had apparently displaced Methanosarcina sp. as the dominant aceticlastic methanogen in the digestor. During the period when Methanothrix sp. was apparently dominant, acetate concentrations varied between 0.3 and 1.5 mumol/ml during the daily feeding cycle, and acetate was the precursor of 63 to 66% of the methane produced during peak digestor methanogenesis. The apparent K(m) value obtained for methanogenesis from acetate, 0.3 mumol/ml, indicated that the aceticlastic methanogens were nearly saturated for substrate during most of the digestor cycle. CO(2)-reducing methanogens were capable of methanogenesis at rates more than 12 times greater than those usually found in the digestor. Added propionate (4.5 mumol/ml) was metabolized slowly by the digestor populations and slightly inhibited methanogenesis. Added n-butyrate, isobutyrate, or n-valerate (4.5 mumol/ml each) were broken down within 24 h. Isobutyrate was oxidized to acetate, a novel reaction possibly involving isomerization to n-butyrate. The rapid growth rate and versatile metabolism of Methanosarcina sp. make it a likely organism to be involved in start-up, whereas the low K(m) value of Methanothrix sp. for acetate may cause it to be favored in stable digestors operated with long retention times.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of myxochromides S1-3 in Stigmatella aurantiaca: evidence for an iterative bacterial type I polyketide synthase and for module skipping in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis Abstract: The myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1 harbours an astonishing variety of secondary metabolic gene clusters, at least two of which were found by gene inactivation experiments to be connected to the biosynthesis of previously unknown metabolites. In this study, we elucidate the structures of myxochromides S1-3, novel cyclic pentapeptide natural products possessing unsaturated polyketide side chains, and identify the corresponding biosynthetic gene locus, made up of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules. By analyzing the deduced substrate specificities of the adenylation domains, it is shown that module 4 is most probably skipped during the biosynthetic process. The polyketide synthase MchA harbours only one module and is presumably responsible for the formation of the variable complete polyketide side chains. These data indicate that MchA is responsible for an unusual iterative polyketide chain assembly.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on a second and third ring cyclization in anthracycline biosynthesis Abstract: This paper focuses on study of second and third ring cyclization in anthracycline biosynthesis by a heterologous gene expression. Firstly, anthracycline non-producing Streptomyces peucetius mutant, D2 was heterologously complemented to produce daunomycins with plasmids pSgs44 and pSYE66, which contain putative cyclase genes of S. galilaeus and S. nogalater, respectively. A point mutation in the cyclase gene dpsY of D2 has changed glycine to serine resulting inactivation of the enzyme. Secondly, the putative cyclase gene snoaM from S. nogalater, was expressed in a gene cassette in S. lividans TK24 and S. coelicolor CH999 to study the influence of the cyclase gene on auramycinone production and the impact of endogenous genes on production profiles. The results obtained confirms that a cyclase closing the second and third ring of a polyketide is essential in anthracycline biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: AvaR2, a pseudo γ-butyrolactone receptor homologue from Streptomyces avermitilis, is a pleiotropic repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth Abstract: Avermectins produced by Streptomyces avermitilis are effective anthelmintic agents. The autoregulatory signalling molecule that triggers avermectin biosynthesis is a novel butenolide-type molecule, avenolide, rather than common γ-butyrolactones (GBLs). We identified AvaR2, a pseudo GBL receptor homologue, as an important repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth. AvaR2 directly repressed transcription of aveR (the ave cluster-situated activator gene), aco (a key gene for avenolide biosynthesis), its own gene (avaR2) and two other GBL receptor homologous genes (avaR1 and avaR3) by binding to their promoter regions. The aveR promoter had the highest affinity for AvaR2. A consensus 18 bp ARE (autoregulatory element)-like sequence was found in the AvaR2-binding regions of these five target genes. Eleven novel AvaR2 targets were identified, including genes involved in primary metabolism, ribosomal protein synthesis, and stress responses. AvaR2 bound and responded to endogenous avenolide and exogenous antibiotics jadomycin B (JadB) and aminoglycosides to modulate its DNA-binding activity. Our findings help to clarify the roles of pseudo GBL receptors as pleiotropic regulators and as receptors for new type autoregulator and exogenous antibiotic signal. A pseudo GBL receptor-mediated antibiotic signalling transduction system may be a common strategy that facilitates Streptomyces interspecies communication and survival in complex environments.	0
Abstract2class: Transposon Tn917lacZ mutagenesis of Bacillus subtilis: identification of two new loci required for motility and chemotaxis Abstract: We have used Tn917lacZ to mutagenize the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and have isolated mutants that are defective in chemotaxis and motility. Mapping of the transposon inserts identified two new loci. Mutations in one of these loci generated mutants that had paralyzed flagella. Accordingly, we designate this a mot locus. The other locus is closely linked to the first and encodes proteins specifying chemotaxis functions. This locus is designated the cheX locus. Both the mot and cheX loci map close to ptsI. An additional transposon insert that maps in the hag locus was obtained. The pattern of beta-galactosidase expression from some of the transposons suggested that the mot locus is regulated by sigD, a minor sigma factor of B. subtilis. The cheX locus appeared to be under the control of vegetative sigA. Four transposon inserts were mapped to a previously characterized che locus near spcB. These mutants did not produce flagellin and were defective in the methylation of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. This locus probably encodes proteins required for flagellum biosynthesis and other proteins that are required for the methylation response.	0
Abstract2class: Distinct calcium-dependent pathways of epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation and PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells Abstract: Recently, we have demonstrated that in PC12 cells activation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in response to membrane depolarization or bradykinin is mediated by calcium-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we address the question whether Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) has a role in the EGFR transactivation signal. Using compounds that selectively interfere with either CaM kinase activity or calmodulin function, we show that KCl-mediated membrane depolarization-triggered, but not bradykinin-mediated signals involve CaM kinase function upstream of the EGFR. Although both depolarization-induced calcium influx and bradykinin stimulation of PC12 cells were found to induce c-fos transcription through EGFR activation, the former signal is CaM kinase-dependent and the latter was shown to be independent. As PYK2 is also activated upon elevation of intracellular calcium, we investigated the potential involvement of this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in EGFR transactivation. Interestingly, we observed that inhibition of CaM kinase activity in PC12 cells abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 upon KCl but not bradykinin treatment. Nevertheless, PYK2 activation in response to both stimuli appeared to be mediated by pathways parallel to EGFR transactivation. Our data demonstrate the existence of two distinct calcium-dependent mechanisms leading either to EGFR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated activation or to PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Both pathways either in concert or independently might contribute to the definition of biological responses in neuronal cell types.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the structural and transporter genes for, and the chemical and biological properties of, sublancin 168, a novel lantibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis 168 Abstract: An antimicrobial peptide produced by Bacillus subtilis 168 was isolated and characterized. It was named sublancin 168, and its behavior during Edman sequence analysis and its NMR spectrum suggested that sublancin is a dehydroalanine-containing lantibiotic. A hybridization probe based on the peptide sequence was used to clone the presublancin gene, which encoded a 56-residue polypeptide consisting of a 19-residue leader segment and a 37-residue mature segment. The mature segment contained one serine, one threonine, and five cysteine residues. Alkylation of mature sublancin showed no free sulfhydryl groups, suggesting that one sulfydryl had formed a beta-methyllanthionine bridge with a dehydrobutyrine derived by posttranslational modification of threonine; with the other four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. It is unprecedented for a lantibiotic to contain a disulfide bridge. The sublancin leader was similar to known type AII lantibiotics, containing a double-glycine motif that is typically recognized by dual-function transporters. A protein encoded immediately downstream from the sublancin gene possessed features of a dual-function ABC transporter with a proteolytic domain and an ATP-binding domain. The antimicrobial activity spectrum of sublancin was like other lantibiotics, inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria; and like the lantibiotics nisin and subtilin in its ability to inhibit both bacterial spore outgrowth and vegetative growth. Sublancin is an extraordinarily stable lantibiotic, showing no degradation or inactivation after being stored in aqueous solution at room temperature for 2 years. The fact that sublancin is a natural product of B. subtilis 168, for which a great deal of genetic information is available, including the entire sequence of its genome, suggests that sublancin will be an especially good model for studying the potential of lantibiotics as sources of novel biomaterials.	1
Abstract2class: Purification and Characterization of an Extracellular Acid Proteinase from the Ectomycorrhizal Fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme Abstract: Hebeloma crustuliniforme produced an extracellular acid proteinase in a liquid medium containing bovine serum albumin as the sole nitrogen source. The proteinase was purified 26-fold with 20% activity recovery and was shown to have a molecular weight of 37,800 (as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an isoelectric point of 4.8 +/- 0.2. The enzyme was most active at 50 degrees C and pH 2.5 against bovine serum albumin and was stable in the absence of substrates at temperatures up to 45 degrees C and pHs between 2.0 and 5.0. Pepstatin A, diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methylester, metallic ions Fe and Fe, and phenolic acids severely inhibited the enzyme activity, while antipain, leupeptin, N-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and trypsin inhibitor inhibited the activity moderately. The proteinase hydrolyzed bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c rapidly compared with casein and azocasein but failed to hydrolyze any of the low-molecular-weight peptide derivatives tested.	0
Abstract2class: Catalytic C-H Trifluoromethoxylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Abstract: The intermolecular C-H trifluoromethoxylation of arenes remains a long-standing and unsolved problem in organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first catalytic protocol employing a novel trifluoromethoxylating reagent and redox-active catalysts for the direct (hetero)aryl C-H trifluoromethoxylation. Our approach is operationally simple, proceeds at room temperature, uses easy-to-handle reagents, requires only 0.03 mol % of redox-active catalysts, does not need specialized reaction apparatus, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups and complex structures such as sugars and natural product derivatives. Importantly, both ground-state and photoexcited redox-active catalysts are effective. Detailed computational and experimental studies suggest a unique reaction pathway where photoexcitation of the trifluoromethoxylating reagent releases the OCF3 radical that is trapped by (hetero)arenes. The resulting cyclohexadienyl radicals are oxidized by redox-active catalysts and deprotonated to form the desired products of trifluoromethoxylation.	0
Abstract2class: Bidirectional transcription of lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes from Campylobacter jejuni Abstract: The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecules of Campylobacter jejuni are involved in virulence and induction of the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This study analysed the transcription of the LOS synthesis genes from the GBS-inducing C. jejuni strain HB 93-13 under microaerobic conditions. Fourteen consecutive genes Cj1132c, waaC, htrB, wlaNC, wlaND, cgtA, cgtB, cstII, neuB, neuC, neuA, wlaVA, wlaQA, and waaF were included. The results of rapid amplification of cDNA ends and single-stranded ligation of complementary ends showed initiation sites with potential promoter regions on both DNA strands in the Cj1132c/waaC, cgtB/cstII, and wlaQA/waaF strand-switch regions. Other termini without recognisable promoter region were also found throughout the LOS gene cluster, suggesting a low specificity of the polymerase during transcription. In addition, all gene junction regions were cloned into the shuttle vector pMW10 carrying the promoterless lacZ gene to identify functional promoter sites. Bidirectional active promoters were found in the strand-switch regions. The results of RT-PCR and cDNA blotting indicated that transcriptional linkage occurred between different operons, indicating a lack of transcription termination within the LOS gene cluster. Moreover, the results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR showed that both DNA strands were transcribed but transcription of the coding strand was at a higher rate. The results presented here provide an insight into transcription of the LOS synthesis gene cluster of C. jejuni.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization and evolution of an activator-independent methanol dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator N-1 Abstract: Methanol utilization by methylotrophic or non-methylotrophic organisms is the first step toward methanol bioconversion to higher carbon-chain chemicals. Methanol oxidation using NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) is of particular interest because it uses NAD(+) as the electron carrier. To our knowledge, only a limited number of NAD-dependent Mdhs have been reported. The most studied is the Bacillus methanolicus Mdh, which exhibits low enzyme specificity to methanol and is dependent on an endogenous activator protein (ACT). In this work, we characterized and engineered a group III NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (Mdh2) from Cupriavidus necator N-1 (previously designated as Ralstonia eutropha). This enzyme is the first NAD-dependent Mdh characterized from a Gram-negative, mesophilic, non-methylotrophic organism with a significant activity towards methanol. Interestingly, unlike previously reported Mdhs, Mdh2 does not require activation by known activators such as B. methanolicus ACT and Escherichia coli Nudix hydrolase NudF, or putative native C. necator activators in the Nudix family under mesophilic conditions. This enzyme exhibited higher or comparable activity and affinity toward methanol relative to the B. methanolicus Mdh with or without ACT in a wide range of temperatures. Furthermore, using directed molecular evolution, we engineered a variant (CT4-1) of Mdh2 that showed a 6-fold higher K cat/K m for methanol and 10-fold lower K cat/K m for n-butanol. Thus, CT4-1 represents an NAD-dependent Mdh with much improved catalytic efficiency and specificity toward methanol compared with the existing NAD-dependent Mdhs with or without ACT activation.	0
Abstract2class: A vicious cycle of β amyloid-dependent neuronal hyperactivation Abstract: β-amyloid (Aβ)-dependent neuronal hyperactivity is believed to contribute to the circuit dysfunction that characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis continues to accrue, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. In this experiment, we used mouse models of Aβ-amyloidosis to show that hyperactivation is initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake. Hyperactivity occurred in neurons with preexisting baseline activity, whereas inactive neurons were generally resistant to Aβ-mediated hyperactivation. Aβ-containing AD brain extracts and purified Aβ dimers were able to sustain this vicious cycle. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism of Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction that can be active before plaque formation.	0
Abstract2class: Activity of trovafloxacin (with or without ampicillin-sulbactam) against enterococci in an in vitro dynamic model of infection Abstract: Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are being increasingly identified as causal agents of infection. Trovafloxacin is a new fluoronaphthyridone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci and variable activity reported against Enterococcus spp. Twenty-one strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (one vancomycin resistant) were studied at an initial inoculum of 10(6) CFU/ml in time-kill assays with trovafloxacin (3 mg/liter), ampicillin-sulbactam (100/50 mg/liter), and the combination. Six strains of E. faecium (five vancomycin resistant) also were studied in an in vitro two-compartment dynamic model that mimics human pharmacokinetics with trovafloxacin simulated at 300 mg every 12 h (q12h), ampicillin-sulbactam at 2/1 g q6h, and the combination. Peripheral compartments were sampled q2h for 30 h for bacterial counts. Trovafloxacin MICs ranged from 0.5 to 32 mg/liter, and the nine strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium for which MICs were < or =2 mg/liter were more likely to show a reduction of 2 log units or more in viable counts in time-kill assays than were strains for which MICs were higher. Synergism with ampicillin-sulbactam was found for only one strain (trovafloxacin MIC, 16 mg/liter). Similar results were obtained in the pharmacokinetic model, with 2- to 4-log-unit reductions in viable bacteria for trovafloxacin-susceptible strains. Although no convincing evidence of synergism was found, ampicillin-sulbactam in combination minimized late bacterial regrowth of two trovafloxacin-susceptible strains. These data suggest that this high dose of trovafloxacin (with or without ampicillin-sulbactam) might be useful against strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium for which MICs were < or =2 mg/liter.	0
Abstract2class: Polynucleotide phosphorylase is involved in the control of lipopeptide fengycin production in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Bacillus subtilis is a wealth source of lipopeptide molecules such as iturins, surfactins and fengycins or plipastatins endowed with a range of biological activities. These molecules, designated secondary metabolites, are synthesized via non-ribosomal peptides synthesis (NRPS) machinery and are most often subjected to a complex regulation with involvement of several regulatory factors. To gain novel insights on mechanism regulating fengycin production, we investigated the effect of the fascinating polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), as well as the effect of lipopeptide surfactin. Compared to the wild type, the production of fengycin in the mutant strains B. subtilis BBG235 and BBG236 altered for PNPase has not only decreased to about 70 and 40%, respectively, but also hampered its antifungal activity towards the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea. On the other hand, mutant strains BBG231 (srfAA-) and BBG232 (srfAC-) displayed different levels of fengycin production. BBG231 had registered an important decrease in fengycin production, comparable to that observed for BBG235 or BBG236. This study permitted to establish that the products of pnpA gene (PNPase), and srfAA- (surfactin synthetase) are involved in fengycin production.	0
Abstract2class: Insights into the biosynthesis of hormaomycin, an exceptionally complex bacterial signaling metabolite Abstract: Hormaomycin produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus is a structurally highly modified depsipeptide that contains several unique building blocks with cyclopropyl, nitro, and chlorine moieties. Within the genus Streptomyces, it acts as a bacterial hormone that induces morphological differentiation and the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. In addition, hormaomycin is an extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. In this study, we shed light on hormaomycin biosynthesis by a combination of feeding studies, isolation of the biosynthetic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster, and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes. In addition, several nonnatural hormaomycin congeners were generated by feeding-induced metabolic rerouting. The NRPS contains numerous highly repetitive regions that suggest an evolutionary scenario for this unusual bacterial hormone, providing new opportunities for evolution-inspired metabolic engineering of novel nonribosomal peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509, a prolific producer of meroterpenoid chemistry Abstract: Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 is a marine actinomycete belonging to the MAR4 streptomycete lineage. MAR4 strains have been linked to the production of diverse and otherwise rare meroterpenoid compounds. The genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 was found to contain 29 putative gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, some of them potentially involved in the formation of meroterpenoid molecules.	1
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthetic assembly of gulmirecins, macrolide antibiotics from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax Abstract: The gulmirecins constitute a new class of glycosylated macrolides that were isolated from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax HKI 727. Their structures were solved by a combination of NMR spectroscopic experiments and chemical derivatization. Analysis of the annotated gulmirecin gene cluster complemented the configurational assignment and provided insights into the stereochemical course of the biosynthetic assembly. The gulmirecins exhibit strong activity against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but no cytotoxic effects on human cells.	1
Abstract2class: Subtilosin production by two Bacillus subtilis subspecies and variance of the sbo-alb cluster Abstract: Eight different Bacillus subtilis strains and Bacillus atrophaeus were found to produce the bacteriocin subtilosin A. On the basis of the subtilosin gene (sbo) sequences two distinct classes of B. subtilis strains were distinguished, and they fell into the two B. subtilis subspecies (B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii). The entire sequence of the subtilosin gene cluster of a B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii strain, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, was determined. This sequence exhibited a high level of homology to the sequence of the sbo-alb gene locus of B. subtilis 168. By using primer extension analysis the transcriptional start sites of sbo in B. subtilis strains ATCC 6633 and 168 were found to be 47 and 45 bp upstream of the sbo start codon, respectively. Our results provide insight into the incipient evolutionary divergence of the two B. subtilis subspecies.	1
Abstract2class: Structure of cytochrome P450eryF involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: Cytochrome P450eryF catalyzes the 6S-hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the initial reaction in a multistep pathway to convert 6-deoxyerythronolide B into the antibiotic, erythromycin. The overall structure of P450eryF is similar to that of P450cam but differs in the exact positioning of several alpha-helices. The largest difference occurs in the B' helix and results in the enlargement of the substrate-binding pocket of P450eryF. The substrate is positioned with the macrolide ring perpendicular to the haem plane and contacts seven hydrophobic residues and three solvent molecules. The substrate participates in a network of hydrogen bonds that may provide a proton shuttle pathway in the oxygen cleavage reaction.	1
Abstract2class: New insights into the bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor CBR703 as a starting point for optimization as an anti-infective agent Abstract: CBR703 was reported to inhibit bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and biofilm formation, considering it to be a good candidate for further optimization. While synthesized derivatives of CBR703 did not result in more-active RNAP inhibitors, we observed promising antibacterial activities. These again correlated with a significant cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Furthermore, we suspect the promising effects on biofilm formation to be artifacts. Consequently, this class of compounds can be considered unattractive as antibacterial agents.	0
Abstract2class: Probing the substrate specificity of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II by use of synthetic oligosaccharides and a catalytic nucleophile mutant Abstract: Inhibition of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GMII), which acts late in the N-glycan processing pathway, provides a route to blocking cancer-induced changes in cell surface oligosaccharide structures. To probe the substrate requirements of GMII, oligosaccharides were synthesized that contained an alpha(1,3)- or alpha(1,6)-linked 1-thiomannoside. Surprisingly, these oligosaccharides were not observed in X-ray crystal structures of native Drosophila GMII (dGMII). However, a mutant enzyme in which the catalytic nucleophilic aspartate was changed to alanine (D204A) allowed visualization of soaked oligosaccharides and led to the identification of the binding site for the alpha(1,3)-linked mannoside of the natural substrate. These studies also indicate that the conformational change of the bound mannoside to a high-energy B 2,5 conformation is facilitated by steric hindrance from, and the formation of strong hydrogen bonds to, Asp204. The observation that 1-thio-linked mannosides are not well tolerated by the catalytic site of dGMII led to the synthesis of a pentasaccharide containing the alpha(1,6)-linked Man of the natural substrate and the beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc moiety proposed to be accommodated by the extended binding site of the enzyme. A cocrystal structure of this compound with the D204A enzyme revealed the molecular interactions with the beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc. The structure is consistent with the approximately 80-fold preference of dGMII for the cleavage of substrates containing a nonreducing beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc. By contrast, the lysosomal mannosidase lacks an equivalent GlcNAc binding site and kinetic analysis indicates oligomannoside substrates without non-reducing-terminal GlcNAc modifications are preferred, suggesting that selective inhibitors for GMII could exploit the additional binding specificity of the GlcNAc binding site.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the DNA region responsible for Megacin A-216 production in Bacillus megaterium 216 Abstract: Upon induction, Bacillus megaterium 216 produces the bacteriocin megacin A-216, which leads to lysis of the producer cell and kills B. megaterium and a few other bacterial species. The DNA region responsible for megacinogeny was cloned in B. megaterium. The nucleotide sequence of a 5,494-bp-long subfragment was determined, and the function of the genes on this fragment was studied by generating deletions and analyzing their effects on MegA phenotypes. An open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 293-amino-acid protein was identified as the gene (megA) coding for megacin A-216. BLAST searches detected sequence similarity between megacin A-216 and proteins with phospholipase A2 activity. Purified biologically active megacin A-216 preparations contained three proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the largest protein is the full-length translation product of the megA gene, whereas the two shorter proteins are fragments of the long protein created by cleavage between Gln-185 and Val-186. The molecular masses of the three polypeptides are 32,855, 21,018, and 11,855 Da, respectively. Comparison of different megacin preparations suggests that the intact chain as well as the two combined fragments can form biologically active megacin. An ORF located next to the megA gene and encoding a 91-amino-acid protein was shown to be responsible for the relative immunity displayed by the producer strain against megacin A-216. Besides the megA gene, at least two other genes, including a gene encoding a 188-amino-acid protein sharing high sequence similarity with RNA polymerase sigma factors, were shown to be required for induction of megacin A-216 expression.	1
Abstract2class: A newly described cellulosomal cellobiohydrolase, CelO, from Clostridium thermocellum: investigation of the exo-mode of hydrolysis, and binding capacity to crystalline cellulose Abstract: The sequence of the celO gene from Clostridium thermocellum F7 was determined. The gene product, cellulase CelO (Ct-Cel5F), had a modular structure consisting of a carbohydrate-binding module of the CBM3 family and a catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The presence of the dockerin module indicated that the enzyme was a component of the cellulosome complex. The thermostable recombinant gene product was active on cellodextrins, barley beta-glucan, carboxymethylcellulose and insoluble cellulose. Cellobiose was the only product released from amorphic and crystalline cellulose, cellotetraose and higher cello-oligosaccharides, identifying CelO as a cellobiohydrolase. The cleavage pattern of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotetraoside, blockage of the hydrolysis of NaBH(4)-reduced cellopentaose and the reduction in substrate viscosity suggested activity from the reducing end in a processive mode after making random cuts. Binding to insoluble, i.e. amorphous, and crystalline cellulose was mediated by the carbohydrate-binding module CBM3b, with a preference for the crystalline substrate.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of salt-sensitive mutants of the moderately halophilic bacterium Salinivibrio costicola subsp. yaniae Abstract: Salinivibrio costicola subsp. yaniae is a moderately halophilic bacterium which can grow over a wide range of salinity. In response to external osmotic stress (1-3 M NaCl), S. costicola subsp. yaniae can accumulate ectoine, glycine betaine, and glutamate as compatible solutes. We used suicide plasmids pSUP101 to introduce transposon Tn1732 into S. costicola subsp. yaniae via Escherichia coli SM10 mediated by conjugation. One Tn1732-induced mutant, MU1, which was very sensitive to the external salt concentration, was isolated. Mutant MU1 did not grow above 1.5 M NaCl and did not synthesize ectoine, but accumulated Ngamma-acetyldiaminobutyrate, an ectoine precursor, as confirmed by (1)H-NMR analysis. From these data, we concluded that ectoine performs a key role in osmotic adaptation towards high salinity environments in strain S. costicola subsp. yaniae.	0
Abstract2class: Tunable Expression Systems for Orthogonal DNA Replication Abstract: We recently developed an orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) system capable of driving the rapid continuous evolution of genes in vivo. However, OrthoRep uses a special transcription system, the components of which (e.g., promoters) have previously limited the strength with which OrthoRep-encoded genes can be expressed. Here, we report a collection of synthetic and evolved OrthoRep expression parts that allow OrthoRep-encoded genes to span expression levels matching those of endogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Specifically, we found that various promoter mutations as well as a genetically encoded poly(A) tail enable us to tune the expression level of OrthoRep-encoded genes over a large range and up to levels 43-fold higher than were previously attained, reaching at least ∼40% of the strength of the genomic TDH3 promoter. We further show that expression level gains using our new parts are stable over passaging and consistent across multiple genes and OrthoRep systems of different mutation rates. This new set of expression parts further expands OrthoRep's applicability to the continuous in vivo evolution of proteins and pathways.	0
Abstract2class: Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy Abstract: Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti-PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral-flow assays based on up-converting nanoparticles (UCP-LFAs) showed that the generated PGL-I and PGL-II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the insecticidal xenocyloins in Xenorhabdus bovienii Abstract: The biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of xenocyloins was identified in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004, and their biosynthesis was elucidated by heterologous expression and in vitro characterization of the enzymes. XclA is an S-selective ThDP-dependent acyloin-like condensation enzyme, and XclB and XclC are examples of the still-rare acylating ketosynthases that catalyze the acylation of the XclA-derived initial xenocyloins with acetyl-, propionyl-, or malonyl-CoA, thereby resulting in the formation of further xenocyloin derivatives. All xenocyloins were produced mainly by the more virulent primary variant of X. bovienii and showed activity against insect hemocytes thus contributing to the overall virulence of X. bovienii against insects.	1
Abstract2class: Angucyclines Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 from Streptomyces sp. SCC-2136: cloning, sequencing, and characterization Abstract: The entire gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of angucyclines Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA spanning 77.5-kb revealed a total of 55 open reading frames, and the deduced products exhibited strong sequence similarities to type II polyketide synthases, deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, and a variety of accessory enzymes. The involvement of this gene cluster in the pathway of Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 was confirmed by genetic inactivation of the aromatase, including a portion of the ketoreductase, which was disrupted by inserting the thiostrepton gene.	1
Abstract2class: HIV anti-latency treatment mediated by macromolecular prodrugs of histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and panobinostat in particular are currently in the focus of intensive investigation as latency reversing agents against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Regretfully, HDACi have dose limiting side-effects making controlled, optimized methods for delivery of panobinostat highly warranted. This has proven to be highly challenging, predominantly because panobinostat has no readily available classic sites for bioconjugation. In this work, we address this challenge and present the first macromolecular prodrugs of panobinostat engineered using self immolative linkers (SIL) and a disulfide trigger for drug release upon cell entry. Synthetic methodology involved the development of a novel monomer with functionalities of SIL and activated ester for one-step polymer-analogous conjugation to drugs. In agreement with the design set forward, copolymers were stable in buffered solutions and released panobinostat at reducing conditions. Synthesized polymers were highly efficacious as latency reversing agents as monitored in three cell lines harboring latent HIV, at no expense to the cytotoxicity of treatment. The data presented herein provide broad pre-in vivo characterization of a promising prodrug system developed to address a global healthcare challenge, safe and efficient reversal of HIV latency.	0
Abstract2class: Antimicrobial metabolites from the Paracel Islands sponge Agelas mauritiana Abstract: Four new alkaloids, (-)-8'-oxo-agelasine D (2), ageloxime B (3), (+)-2-oxo-agelasidine C (4), and 4-bromo-N-(butoxymethyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide (5), and the known compound (-)-ageloxime D (1) were isolated from the marine sponge Agelas mauritiana. Their chemical structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 3 both showed antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani in vitro. Compound 3 also exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureusin vitro.	0
Abstract2class: Regulation of immunity to the two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, by the transcriptional repressor LtnR Abstract: Lacticin 3147 is a membrane-active, two-component lantibiotic produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis DPC3147. In this study, the promoters of the lacticin 3147 gene cluster were mapped to the intergenic region between ltnR and ltnA1 (the genes encoding the regulatory protein LtnR and the first structural gene, LtnA1), and Northern analyses revealed that the biosynthetic and immunity genes are divergently transcribed in two operons, ltnA1A2M1TM2D and ltnRIFE respectively. Although the promoter controlling biosynthesis (Pbac) appears to be constitutive, characterization of a downstream beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) fusion beyond an intragenic stem-loop structure in ltnM1 confirmed that this putative transcriptional attenuator allows limited readthrough to the downstream biosynthetic genes, thus maintaining the correct stoichiometry between structural peptides and biosynthetic machinery. The promoter of the ltnRIFE operon (Pimm) was shown to be regulated by the transcriptional repressor LtnR. A mutant with a truncated ltnR gene exhibited a hyperimmune phenotype, whereas overexpression of ltnR resulted in cells with increased sensitivity to lacticin 3147. Gel mobility shift analysis indicated that LtnR binds to the Pimm promoter region, and fusion of this promoter to the beta-gal gene of pAK80 revealed that expression from Pimm is significantly reduced in the presence of LtnR. Thus, we have demonstrated that lacticin 3147 uses a regulatory mechanism not previously identified in lantibiotic systems.	1
Abstract2class: Capture of uropathogenic E. coli by using synthetic glycan ligands specific for the pap-pilus Abstract: Biotinylated mono- and biantennary di-/trisaccharides were synthesized to evaluate their ability to capture E. coli strains that express pilus types with different receptor specificities. The synthesized biotinylated di-/trisaccharides contain Galα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)GalNHAc, GalNHAcα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and GalNHAcα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc as carbohydrate epitopes. These biotinylated oligosaccharides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and incubated with different strains of live E. coli. Capturing ability was assessed by using a luciferase assay that detects bacterial ATP. The trisaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and the disaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Gal as the epitopes exhibited strong capturing ability for uropathogenic E. coli strains with the pap pilus genotype, including CFT073, J96 and J96 pilE. The same ligands failed to capture E. coli strains with fim, prs, or foc genotypes. Uropathogenic CFT073 was also captured moderately by biantennary disaccharides containing a GalNHAc moiety at the reducing end; however, other saccharides containing GalNHAc at the nonreducing end did not capture the CFT073 strain. These synthetic glycoconjugates could potentially be adapted as rapid diagnostic agents to differentiate between different E. coli pathovars.	0
Abstract2class: Biochemical and structural insights of the early glycosylation steps in calicheamicin biosynthesis Abstract: The enediyne antibiotic calicheamicin (CLM) gamma(1)(I) is a prominent antitumor agent that is targeted to DNA by a novel aryltetrasaccharide comprised of an aromatic unit and four unusual carbohydrates. Herein we report the heterologous expression and the biochemical characterization of the two "internal" glycosyltransferases CalG3 and CalG2 and the structural elucidation of an enediyne glycosyltransferase (CalG3). In conjunction with the previous characterization of the "external" CLM GTs CalG1 and CalG4, this study completes the functional assignment of all four CLM GTs, extends the utility of enediyne GT-catalyzed reaction reversibility, and presents conclusive evidence of a sequential glycosylation pathway in CLM biosynthesis. This work also reveals the common GT-B structural fold can now be extended to include enediyne GTs.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous expression of the atypical tetracycline chelocardin reveals the full set of genes required for its biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Chelocardin (CHD) exhibits a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and showed promising results in a small phase II clinical study conducted on patients with urinary tract infections. Importantly, CHD was shown to be active also against tetracycline-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, which is gaining even more importance in today's antibiotic crisis. We have demonstrated that modifications of CHD through genetic engineering of its producer, the actinomycete Amycolatopsis sulphurea, are not only possible but yielded even more potent antibiotics than CHD itself, like 2-carboxamido-2-deacetyl-chelocardin (CD-CHD), which is currently in preclinical evaluation. A. sulphurea is difficult to genetically manipulate and therefore manipulation of the chd biosynthetic gene cluster in a genetically amenable heterologous host would be of high importance for further drug-discovery efforts.                  Results:                       We report heterologous expression of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster in the model organism Streptomyces albus del14 strain. Unexpectedly, we found that the originally defined CHD gene cluster fails to provide all genes required for CHD formation, including an additional cyclase and two regulatory genes. Overexpression of the putative pathway-specific streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein chdB in A. sulphurea resulted in an increase of both, CHD and CD-CHD production. Applying a metabolic-engineering approach, it was also possible to generate the potent CHD analogue, CD-CHD in S. albus. Finally, an additional yield increase was achieved in S. albus del14 by in-trans overexpression of the chdR exporter gene, which provides resistance to CHD and CDCHD.                  Conclusions:                       We identified previously unknown genes in the CHD cluster, which were shown to be essential for chelocardin biosynthesis by expression of the full biosynthetic gene cluster in S. albus as heterologous host. When comparing to oxytetracycline biosynthesis, we observed that the CHD gene cluster contains additional enzymes not found in gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of typical tetracyclines (such as oxytetracycline). This finding probably explains the different chemistries and modes of action, which make CHD/CD-CHD valuable lead structures for clinical candidates. Even though the CHD genes are derived from a rare actinomycete A. sulphurea, the yield of CHD in the heterologous host was very good. The corrected nucleotide sequence of the CHD gene cluster now contains all gene products required for the production of CHD in a genetically amenable heterologous host, thus opening new possibilities towards production of novel and potent tetracycline analogues with a new mode of action.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular networking as a dereplication strategy Abstract: A major goal in natural product discovery programs is to rapidly dereplicate known entities from complex biological extracts. We demonstrate here that molecular networking, an approach that organizes MS/MS data based on chemical similarity, is a powerful complement to traditional dereplication strategies. Successful dereplication with molecular networks requires MS/MS spectra of the natural product mixture along with MS/MS spectra of known standards, synthetic compounds, or well-characterized organisms, preferably organized into robust databases. This approach can accommodate different ionization platforms, enabling cross correlations of MS/MS data from ambient ionization, direct infusion, and LC-based methods. Molecular networking not only dereplicates known molecules from complex mixtures, it also captures related analogues, a challenge for many other dereplication strategies. To illustrate its utility as a dereplication tool, we apply mass spectrometry-based molecular networking to a diverse array of marine and terrestrial microbial samples, illustrating the dereplication of 58 molecules including analogues.	0
Abstract2class: Enantioselective Decarboxylative Arylation of α-Amino Acids via the Merger of Photoredox and Nickel Catalysis Abstract: An asymmetric decarboxylative Csp(3)-Csp(2) cross-coupling has been achieved via the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of naturally abundant α-amino acids and readily available aryl halides into valuable chiral benzylic amines in high enantiomeric excess, thereby producing motifs found in pharmacologically active agents.	0
Abstract2class: An antibody with a variable-region coiled-coil "knob" domain Abstract: The X-ray crystal structure of a bovine antibody (BLV1H12) revealed a unique structure in its ultralong heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3H) that folds into a solvent-exposed β-strand "stalk" fused to a disulfide crosslinked "knob" domain. We have substituted an antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil motif for the β-strand stalk in this antibody. The resulting antibody (Ab-coil) expresses in mammalian cells and has a stability similar to that of the parent bovine antibody. MS analysis of H-D exchange supports the coiled-coil structure of the substituted peptides. Substitution of the knob-domain of Ab-coil with bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (bGCSF) results in a stably expressed chimeric antibody, which proliferates mouse NFS-60 cells with a potency comparable to that of bGCSF. This work demonstrates the utility of this novel coiled-coil CDR3 motif as a means for generating stable, potent antibody fusion proteins with useful pharmacological properties.	0
Abstract2class: Nickel-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions of unactivated tertiary alkyl halides: Suzuki arylations Abstract: The first Suzuki cross-couplings of unactivated tertiary alkyl electrophiles are described. The method employs a readily accessible catalyst (NiBr(2)·diglyme/4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, both commercially available) and represents the initial example of the use of a group 10 catalyst to cross-couple unactivated tertiary electrophiles to form C-C bonds. This approach to the synthesis of all-carbon quaternary carbon centers does not suffer from isomerization of the alkyl group, in contrast with the umpolung strategy for this bond construction (cross-coupling of a tertiary alkylmetal with an aryl electrophile). Preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of a radical intermediate along the reaction pathway.	0
Abstract2class: Cryogenic Focused Ion Beam Enables Atomic-Resolution Imaging of Local Structures in Highly Sensitive Bulk Crystals and Devices Abstract: With the development of ultralow-dose (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques, atomic-resolution imaging of highly sensitive nanomaterials has recently become possible. However, applying these techniques to the study of sensitive bulk materials remains challenging due to the lack of suitable specimen preparation methods. We report that cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) can provide a solution to this challenge. We successfully extracted thin specimens from metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals and a hybrid halide perovskite single-crystal film solar cell using cryo-FIB without damaging the inherent structures. The high quality of the specimens enabled the subsequent (S)TEM and electron diffraction studies to reveal complex unknown local structures at an atomic resolution. The obtained structural information allowed us to resolve planar defects in MOF HKUST-1, three-dimensionally reconstruct a concomitant phase in MOF UiO-66, and discover a new CH3NH3PbI3 structure and locate its distribution in a single-crystal film perovskite solar cell. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that cryo-FIB has a unique ability to handle highly sensitive materials, which can substantially expand the range of applications for electron microscopy.	0
Abstract2class: Nicking endonucleases Abstract: Nicking endonucleases are a new type of enzymes. Like restriction endonucleases, they recognize short specific DNA sequence and cleave DNA at a fixed position relatively to the recognition sequence. However, unlike restriction endonucleases, nicking endonucleases cleave only one predetermined DNA strand. Until recently, nicking endonucleases were suggested to be naturally mutated restriction endonucleases which had lost their ability to dimerize and as a result the ability to cleave the second strand. We have shown that nicking endonucleases are one of the subunits of heterodimeric restriction endonucleases. Mechanisms used by various restriction endonucleases for double-stranded cleavage, designing of artificial nicking endonucleases on the basis of restriction endonucleases, and application of nicking endonucleases in molecular biology are reviewed.	0
Abstract2class: Direct cloning and refactoring of a silent lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster yields the antibiotic taromycin A Abstract: Recent developments in next-generation sequencing technologies have brought recognition of microbial genomes as a rich resource for novel natural product discovery. However, owing to the scarcity of efficient procedures to connect genes to molecules, only a small fraction of secondary metabolomes have been investigated to date. Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning takes advantage of the natural in vivo homologous recombination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to directly capture large genomic loci. Here we report a TAR-based genetic platform that allows us to directly clone, refactor, and heterologously express a silent biosynthetic pathway to yield a new antibiotic. With this method, which involves regulatory gene remodeling, we successfully expressed a 67-kb nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster from the marine actinomycete Saccharomonospora sp. CNQ-490 and produced the dichlorinated lipopeptide antibiotic taromycin A in the model expression host Streptomyces coelicolor. The taromycin gene cluster (tar) is highly similar to the clinically approved antibiotic daptomycin from Streptomyces roseosporus, but has notable structural differences in three amino acid residues and the lipid side chain. With the activation of the tar gene cluster and production of taromycin A, this study highlights a unique "plug-and-play" approach to efficiently gaining access to orphan pathways that may open avenues for novel natural product discoveries and drug development.	1
Abstract2class: Cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in an acidophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The cytoplasmic buffering capacity of Thiobacillus acidophilus (along with membrane properties) is responsible for the cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in metabolically compromised cells. When a large influx of H+ occurs, the cytoplasmic buffering capacity prevents drastic changes in pH; in addition, this influx, by increasing the positive membrane potential, eventually leads to a cessation of further H+ influx.	0
Abstract2class: Reverse β-oxidation pathways for efficient chemical production Abstract: Microbial production of fuels, chemicals, and materials has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a sustainable bioeconomy. While synthetic biology allows readjusting of native metabolic pathways for the synthesis of desired products, often these native pathways do not support maximum efficiency and are affected by complex regulatory mechanisms. A synthetic or engineered pathway that allows modular synthesis of versatile bioproducts with minimal enzyme requirement and regulation while achieving high carbon and energy efficiency could be an alternative solution to address these issues. The reverse β-oxidation (rBOX) pathways enable iterative non-decarboxylative elongation of carbon molecules of varying chain lengths and functional groups with only four core enzymes and no ATP requirement. Here, we describe recent developments in rBOX pathway engineering to produce alcohols and carboxylic acids with diverse functional groups, along with other commercially important molecules such as polyketides. We discuss the application of rBOX beyond the pathway itself by its interfacing with various carbon-utilization pathways and deployment in different organisms, which allows feedstock diversification from sugars to glycerol, carbon dioxide, methane, and other substrates.	0
Abstract2class: Precursor-centric genome-mining approach for lasso peptide discovery Abstract: Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized posttranslationally modified natural products found in bacteria. Currently known lasso peptides have a diverse set of pharmacologically relevant activities, including inhibition of bacterial growth, receptor antagonism, and enzyme inhibition. The biosynthesis of lasso peptides is specified by a cluster of three genes encoding a precursor protein and two enzymes. Here we develop a unique genome-mining algorithm to identify lasso peptide gene clusters in prokaryotes. Our approach involves pattern matching to a small number of conserved amino acids in precursor proteins, and thus allows for a more global survey of lasso peptide gene clusters than does homology-based genome mining. Of more than 3,000 currently sequenced prokaryotic genomes, we found 76 organisms that are putative lasso peptide producers. These organisms span nine bacterial phyla and an archaeal phylum. To provide validation of the genome-mining method, we focused on a single lasso peptide predicted to be produced by the freshwater bacterium Asticcacaulis excentricus. Heterologous expression of an engineered, minimal gene cluster in Escherichia coli led to the production of a unique lasso peptide, astexin-1. At 23 aa, astexin-1 is the largest lasso peptide isolated to date. It is also highly polar, in contrast to many lasso peptides that are primarily hydrophobic. Astexin-1 has modest antimicrobial activity against its phylogenetic relative Caulobacter crescentus. The solution structure of astexin-1 was determined revealing a unique topology that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between segments of the peptide.	1
Abstract2class: The Escherichia coli highly expressed entD gene complements the pfaE deficiency in a pfa gene clone responsible for the biosynthesis of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Abstract: The Escherichia coli entD gene, which encodes an Sfp-type phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that is involved in the biosynthesis of siderophore, is available as a high-expression ASKA clone (pCA24N::entD) constructed from the E. coli K-12 strain AG1. In E. coli DH5alpha, pCA24N::entD complemented a pfaE-deficient clone that comprised pfaA, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD, which are four of the five pfa genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid derived from Shewanella pneumatophori SCRC-2738. Sfp-type PPTases are classified into the EntD and PfaE groups, based on differences between their N-terminal-domain structures. Here, we showed that all Sfp-type PPTases may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	0
Abstract2class: Valorization of cheese whey using microbial fermentations Abstract: Cheese whey (CW), the liquid resulting from the precipitation and removal of milk casein during cheese-making, and the second cheese whey (SCW) derived from the production of cottage and ricotta cheeses are the main byproducts of dairy industry. The major constituent of CW and SCW is lactose, contributing to the high BOD and COD content. Because of this, CW and SCW are high-polluting agents and their disposal is still a problem for the dairy sector. CW and SCW, however, also consist of lipids, proteins, and minerals, making them useful for production of various compounds. In this paper, microbial processes useful to promote the bioremediation of CW and SCW are discussed, and an overview on the main whey-derived products is provided. Special focus was paid to the production of health-promoting whey drinks, vinegar, and biopolymers, which may be exploited as value-added products in different segments of food and pharmaceutical industries.	0
Abstract2class: A critical question for HIV vaccine development: which antibodies to induce? Abstract: A vaccine against HIV-1 must prevent infection against genetically diverse virus strains. Two approaches are currently being pursued to elicit antibody-mediated protection: vaccines that induce potent and broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) or vaccines that induce "conventional antibodies," which are less potent and broadly neutralizing in comparison. Although bnAbs may provide the greatest level of protection, their structural and genetic characteristics make their elicitation through vaccination a major challenge. In contrast, conventional HIV-1 antibodies have been induced by vaccination and correlated with reduced HIV-1 infection in a phase III vaccine trial. Here, I present evidence that both approaches should be pursued with equal vigor.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of vulnibactin biosynthesis in Vibrio vulnificus indicates the existence of an alternative siderophore Abstract: Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic estuarine bacterium that causes fatal septicemia and necrotizing wound infections in humans. Virulent V. vulnificus isolates produce a catechol siderophore called vulnibactin, made up of one residue of 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 3-DHBA) and two residues of salicylic acid (SA). Vulnibactin biosynthetic genes (VV2_0828 to VV2_0844) are clustered at one locus of chromosome 2, expression of which is significantly up-regulated in vivo. In the present study, we decipher the biosynthetic network of vulnibactin, focusing specifically on genes around SA and 2, 3-DHBA biosynthetic steps. Deletion mutant of isochorismate pyruvate lyase (VV2_0839) or 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoate-2, 3-dehydrogenase (VV2_0834) showed retarded growth under iron-limited conditions though the latter showed more significant growth defect than the former, suggesting a dominant role of 2, 3-DHBA in the vulnibactin biosynthesis. A double deletion mutant of VV2_0839 and VV2_0834 manifested additional growth defect under iron limitation. Though the growth defect of respective single deletion mutants could be restored by exogenous SA or 2, 3-DHBA, only 2, 3-DHBA could rescue the double mutant when supplied alone. However, double mutant could be rescued with SA only when hydrogen peroxide was supplied exogenously, suggesting a chemical conversion of SA to 2, 3-DHBA. Assembly of two SA and one 2, 3-DHBA into vulnibactin was mediated by two AMP ligase genes (VV2_0836 and VV2_0840). VV2_0836 deletion mutant showed more significant growth defect under iron limitation, suggesting its dominant function. In conclusion, using molecular genetic analytical tools, we confirm that vulnibactin is assembled of both 2, 3-DHBA and SA. However, conversion of SA to 2, 3-DHBA in presence of hydrogen peroxide and growth profile of AMP ligase mutants suggest a plausible existence of yet unidentified alternative siderophore that may be composed solely of 2, 3-DHBA.	1
Abstract2class: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of fumonisin mycotoxins in Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A Abstract: Fumonisins are toxins associated with several mycotoxicoses and are produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A (MP-A). Biochemical analyses indicate that fumonisins are a product of either polyketide or fatty acid biosynthesis. To isolate a putative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, we employed PCR with degenerate PKS primers and a cDNA template prepared from a fumonisin-producing culture of G. fujikuroi. Sequence analysis of the single PCR product and its flanking DNA revealed a gene (FUM5) with a 7.8-kb coding region. The predicted FUM5 translation product was highly similar to bacterial and fungal Type I PKSs. Transformation of a cosmid clone carrying FUM5 into G. fujikuroi enhanced production in three strains and restored wild-type production in a fumonisin nonproducing mutant. Disruption of FUM5 reduced fumonisin production by over 99% in G. fujikuroi MP-A. Together, these results indicate that FUM5 is a PKS gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: The expanding roles and mechanisms of G protein-mediated presynaptic inhibition Abstract: Throughout the past five decades, tremendous advancements have been made in our understanding of G protein signaling and presynaptic inhibition, many of which were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry under the tenure of Herb Tabor as Editor-in-Chief. Here, we identify these critical advances, including the formulation of the ternary complex model of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and the discovery of Gβγ as a critical signaling component of the heterotrimeric G protein, along with the nature of presynaptic inhibition and its physiological role. We provide an overview for the discovery and physiological relevance of the two known Gβγ-mediated mechanisms for presynaptic inhibition: first, the action of Gβγ on voltage-gated calcium channels to inhibit calcium influx to the presynaptic active zone and, second, the direct binding of Gβγ to the SNARE complex to displace synaptotagmin downstream of calcium entry, which has been demonstrated to be important in neurons and secretory cells. These two mechanisms act in tandem with each other in a synergistic manner to provide more complete spatiotemporal control over neurotransmitter release.	0
Abstract2class: Para-position derivatives of fungal anthelmintic cyclodepsipeptides engineered with Streptomyces venezuelae antibiotic biosynthetic genes Abstract: PF1022A, a cyclooctadepsipeptide possessing strong anthelmintic properties and produced by the filamentous fungus Rosellinia sp. PF1022, consists of four alternating residues of N-methyl-L-leucine and four residues of D-lactate or D-phenyllactate. PF1022A derivatives obtained through modification of their benzene ring at the para-position with nitro or amino groups act as valuable starting materials for the synthesis of compounds with improved anthelmintic activities. Here we describe the production of such derivatives by fermentation through metabolic engineering of the PF1022A biosynthetic pathway in Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Three genes cloned from Streptomyces venezuelae, and required for the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylpyruvate from chorismate in the chloramphenicol biosynthetic pathway, were expressed in a chorismate mutase-deficient strain derived from Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analyses confirmed that this approach facilitated the production of PF1022A derivatives specifically modified at the para-position. This fermentation method is environmentally safe and can be used for the industrial scale production of PF1022A derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Skeletal Editing-Nitrogen Deletion of Secondary Amines by Anomeric Amide Reagents Abstract: Late-stage modification is highly desirable for the diversification and modification of biologically active compounds. Peripheral editing (e.g., C-H activation) has been the predominant methodology, whereas skeletal editing is in its infancy. The single-atom N-deletion using anomeric amide reagents constitutes a powerful tool to modify the underlying molecular skeletons of secondary amines. N-pivaloyloxy-N-alkoxyamide is easily prepared on a large scale and promotes C-C bond formation in good yields under the extrusion of N2 for a variety of (cyclic) aliphatic amines. The exploitation of widely available amines allows the use of existing amine synthesis protocols to translate into the construction of new C-C bonds, enabling ring contraction and the potential for structure optimization of biologically active compounds.	0
Abstract2class: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of Rifapentine and 25-Desacetyl Rifapentine Disposition in Humans Abstract: Rifapentine (RPT) is a rifamycin antimycobacterial and, as part of a combination therapy, is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Although the results from a number of studies indicate that rifapentine has the potential to shorten treatment duration and enhance completion rates compared to other rifamycin agents utilized in antituberculosis drug regimens (i.e., regimens 1 to 4), its optimal dose and exposure in humans are unknown. To help inform such an optimization, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict time course, tissue-specific concentrations of RPT and its active metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine (dRPT), in humans after specified administration schedules for RPT. Starting with the development and verification of a PBPK model for rats, the model was extrapolated and then tested using human pharmacokinetic data. Testing and verification of the models included comparisons of predictions to experimental data in several rat tissues and time course RPT and dRPT plasma concentrations in humans from several single- and repeated-dosing studies. Finally, the model was used to predict RPT concentrations in the lung during the intensive and continuation phases of a current recommended TB treatment regimen. Based on these results, it is anticipated that the PBPK model developed in this study will be useful in evaluating dosing regimens for RPT and for characterizing tissue-level doses that could be predictors of problems related to efficacy or safety.	0
Abstract2class: In situ activity of NAC11-7 roseobacters in coastal waters off the Chesapeake Bay based on ftsZ expression Abstract: Determining in situ growth rates for specific bacterioplankton is of critical importance to understanding their contributions to energy and matter flow in the Ocean. Quantifying expression of genes central to cell division is a plausible approach for obtaining these measurements. In order to test this approach's assumptions, a quantitative PCR assay targeting the cell division gene ftsZ in the ubiquitous NAC11-7 group of the Rhodobacterales order of marine bacteria was developed. ftsZ genes and their corresponding mRNAs were measured in diel in situ samples and in parallel on-deck incubations. Strong correlations between ftsZ expression and gene abundance (R-squared = 0.62) were observed in situ. Rapid changes in NAC11-7 ftsZ gene copies suggested that different populations from different water types were sampled with a significant positive correlation between ftsZ expression and water temperature (R-squared = 0.68, P < 0.001). An outlier to this trend occurred at a single time point (9:00), which was remarkably consistent with a concomitant peak in ftsZ expression in on-deck incubations, suggesting the possibility of synchronous population growth.	0
Abstract2class: Protein synthesis by intact Coxiella burnetii cells Abstract: Coxiella burnetii was isolated from persistently infected fibroblast host cells by a rapid mechanical lysis technique. Macromolecular synthesis was initiated in these otherwise dormant cells by incubation at pH 4.5. The synthesis of protein proceeded for as long as 24 h. Initiation of protein synthesis in C. burnetii was dependent upon RNA synthesis. Approximately 24 species of polypeptides were synthesized, and some of these appeared to be major synthetic products. Increases in protein biomass of 15 to 30% were calculated to occur during incubation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis affected protein synthesis after 12 h of incubation. The results suggest that although these parasitic bacteria did not grow in the axenic media devised, significant biosynthetic processes occurred.	0

Abstract2class: Identification of the chelocardin biosynthetic gene cluster from Amycolatopsis sulphurea: a platform for producing novel tetracycline antibiotics Abstract: Tetracyclines (TCs) are medically important antibiotics from the polyketide family of natural products. Chelocardin (CHD), produced by Amycolatopsis sulphurea, is a broad-spectrum tetracyclic antibiotic with potent bacteriolytic activity against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative multi-resistant pathogens. CHD has an unknown mode of action that is different from TCs. It has some structural features that define it as 'atypical' and, notably, is active against tetracycline-resistant pathogens. Identification and characterization of the chelocardin biosynthetic gene cluster from A. sulphurea revealed 18 putative open reading frames including a type II polyketide synthase. Compared to typical TCs, the chd cluster contains a number of features that relate to its classification as 'atypical': an additional gene for a putative two-component cyclase/aromatase that may be responsible for the different aromatization pattern, a gene for a putative aminotransferase for C-4 with the opposite stereochemistry to TCs and a gene for a putative C-9 methylase that is a unique feature of this biosynthetic cluster within the TCs. Collectively, these enzymes deliver a molecule with different aromatization of ring C that results in an unusual planar structure of the TC backbone. This is a likely contributor to its different mode of action. In addition CHD biosynthesis is primed with acetate, unlike the TCs, which are primed with malonamate, and offers a biosynthetic engineering platform that represents a unique opportunity for efficient generation of novel tetracyclic backbones using combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA as a powerful dereplication tool to facilitate compound identification from small-molecule natural product libraries Abstract: The generation of natural product libraries containing column fractions, each with only a few small molecules, using a high-throughput, automated fractionation system, has made it possible to implement an improved dereplication strategy for selection and prioritization of leads in a natural product discovery program. Analysis of databased UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA information of three leads from a biological screen employing the ependymoma cell line EphB2-EPD generated details on the possible structures of active compounds present. The procedure allows the rapid identification of known compounds and guides the isolation of unknown compounds of interest. Three previously known flavanone-type compounds, homoeriodictyol (1), hesperetin (2), and sterubin (3), were identified in a selected fraction derived from the leaves of Eriodictyon angustifolium. The lignan compound deoxypodophyllotoxin (8) was confirmed to be an active constituent in two lead fractions derived from the bark and leaves of Thuja occidentalis. In addition, two new but inactive labdane-type diterpenoids with an uncommon triol side chain were also identified as coexisting with deoxypodophyllotoxin in a lead fraction from the bark of T. occidentalis. Both diterpenoids were isolated in acetylated form, and their structures were determined as 14S,15-diacetoxy-13R-hydroxylabd-8(17)-en-19-oic acid (9) and 14R,15-diacetoxy-13S-hydroxylabd-8(17)-en-19-oic acid (10), respectively, by spectroscopic data interpretation and X-ray crystallography. This work demonstrates that a UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA database produced during fractionation may be used as a powerful dereplication tool to facilitate compound identification from chromatographically tractable small-molecule natural product libraries.	0
Abstract2class: An Unusual Extender Unit Is Incorporated into the Modular Polyketide Synthase of Scopranones Biosynthesis Abstract: Scopranones, produced by Streptomyces sp. BYK-11038, are the novel bone morphogenetic protein inhibitors characterized by atypical two scoop-like moieties and a 3-furanone moiety. Two scoop-like moieties connected to a 3-furanone have not previously been reported in natural products, and their biosynthesis must occur via a unique pathway. Feeding experiments using 13C-labeled precursors indicated that scopranones were synthesized from three acetates and three butyrates in polyketide-type biosynthesis. Genome mining of Streptomyces sp. BYK-11038 revealed that the candidate biosynthetic gene cluster contains 21 open reading frames (ORFs), including three modular polyketide synthases (PKSs; SprA, SprB, and SprC), which were composed of 4 modules with one loading module and 18 additional ORFs (SprD to SprU) spanning a distance of 55 kbp. The characterization of in-frame deletion mutants and feeding experiments with the predicted extender units indicated that two genes, sprP and sprR, encoding discrete 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthases, and a gene, sprO, encoding crotonyl-CoA reductase, were involved in assembling an unusual C8 branched extender unit, 2-(2-ethylbutyl)malonyl-CoA. Additionally, three ORFs, sprM, sprN, and sprT, encoding cytochrome P450s and a monooxygenase, are important tailoring enzymes in post-PKS modification. SprT is an essential enzyme for decarboxylative ring contraction via oxidation, which converts the 2-pyranone to a 3-furanone.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic and biochemical characterization of hyicin 3682, the first bacteriocin reported for Staphylococcus hyicus Abstract: Hyicin 3682, the first bacteriocin reported for Staphylococcus hyicus, is a BsaCOL variant produced by S. hyicus 3682, a strain isolated from bovine milk. Hyicin 3682 is found in the culture supernatant, is bactericidal and its producing strain exhibits a much broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity than the producing strain of BsaCOL against several Gram-positive bacteria, which include foodborne pathogens, food-spoilage microorganisms and bacterial species of medical and veterinary importance. Sequencing of the genome of S. hyicus 3682 provided the nucleotide sequence of the entire gene cluster involved in hyicin 3682 production, which seems to be located on pRJ109, the single plasmid carried by this strain. This gene cluster is expressed and consists of 8525bp and of eight genes (hyiA, hyiB, hyiC, hyiD, hyiP, hyiF, hyiE and hyiG) encoded on the same DNA strand. The mature lantibiotic exhibits 91% identity to BsaCOL and its molecular mass was found to be ∼26Da higher due to two amino acid substitutions. S. hyicus 3682 proved to be only partially immune to its cognate bacteriocin up to 1024 AU/ml. Therefore, hyicin 3682, the first Bsa variant reported in coagulase-negative staphylococci, does exhibit antimicrobial and siblicidal activities.	1
Abstract2class: Expression and functional analysis of a gene cluster involved in the synthesis of decaprenoxanthin reveals the mechanisms for C50 carotenoid formation Abstract: Corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates the C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. Rescued DNA from transposon color mutants of this Gram-positive bacterium was used to clone the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster. By sequence comparison and functional complementation, the genes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids with 50 carbon atoms were identified. The genes crtE, encoding a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, crtB, encoding a phytoene synthase, and crtI, encoding a phytoene desaturase, are responsible for the formation of lycopene. The products of three novel genes, crtYe and crtYf, with sequence similarities to heterodimeric lycopene cyclase crtYc and crtYd, together with crtEb which exhibits a prenyl transferase motif, were involved in the conversion of C40 acyclic lycopene to cyclic C50 carotenoids. Using functional complementation in Escherichia coli, it could be shown that the elongation of lycopene to the acyclic C50 carotenoid flavuxanthin by the addition of C5 isoprenoid units at positions C-2 and C-2' is catalyzed by the crtEb gene product. Subsequently, the gene products of crtYe and crtYf in a concerted action convert the acyclic flavuxanthin into the cyclic C50 carotene, decaprenoxanthin, forming two epsilon-ionone groups. The mechanisms, involving two individual steps for the formation of cyclic C50 carotenoids from lycopene, are proposed on the basis of these results.	1
Abstract2class: Bioactive phenazines from an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp Abstract: Three new phenazine-type compounds, named phenazines SA-SC (1-3), together with four new natural products (4-7), were isolated from the fermentation broth of an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp. NA04227. The structures of these compounds were determined by extensive analyses of NMR, high resolution mass spectroscopic data, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. Sequencing and analysis of the genome data allowed us to identify the gene cluster (spz) and propose a biosynthetic pathway for these phenazine-type compounds. Additionally, compounds 1-5 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and compound 3 showed antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis and Evaluation of Spumigin Analogues Library with Thrombin Inhibitory Activity Abstract: Spumigins are marine natural products derived from cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena, which mimics the structure of the d-Phe-Pro-Arg sequence and is crucial for binding to the active site of serine proteases thrombin and factor Xa. Biological evaluation of spumigins showed that spumigins with a (2S,4S)-4-methylproline central core represent potential lead compounds for the development of a new structural type of direct thrombin inhibitors. Herein, we represent synthesis and thrombin inhibitory activity of a focused library of spumigins analogues with indoline ring or l-proline as a central core. Novel compounds show additional insight into the structure and biological effects of spumigins. The most active analogue was found to be a derivative containing l-proline central core with low micromolar thrombin inhibitory activity.	0
Abstract2class: GriC and GriD constitute a carboxylic acid reductase involved in grixazone biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: In grixazone biosynthesis by Streptomyces griseus, a key intermediate 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) is converted to another key intermediate 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AHBAL). Two genes griC and griD in the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster were found to be responsible for this conversion, because disruption of each gene resulted in the extracellular accumulation of 3-acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a shunt product from 3,4-AHBA. Significant sequence similarity of GriC to AMP-binding proteins and of GriD to NAD(P)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases suggested that GriC and GriD constituted an ATP- and NAD(P)-dependent carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) catalyzing reduction of 3,4-AHBA to produce 3,4-AHBAL through acyl-AMP formation, as is found for the reactions catalyzed by some CARs. griG encoding a benzoate transporter homologue in the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster was nonessential for grixazone biosynthesis but probably enhanced the membrane permeability for 3,4-AHBA. Simultaneous overexpression of griC, griD, and griG in S. griseus mutant cells deficient in an acetyltransferase responsible for N-acetylation of 3,4-AHBA led to efficient bioconversion of exogenously added 3,4-AHBA to 3,4-AHBAL. This system also turned out to be useful for reduction of some aryl carboxylates to the corresponding aryl aldehydes.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of the carbapenem gene cluster of Erwinia carotovora: definition of the antibiotic biosynthetic genes and evidence for a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism Abstract: Members of two genera of Gram-negative bacteria, Serratia and Erwinia, produce a beta-lactam antibiotic, 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid. We have reported previously the cloning and sequencing of the genes responsible for production of this carbapenem in Erwinia carotovora. These genes are organized as an operon, carA--H, and are controlled by a LuxR-type transcriptional activator, encoded by the linked carR gene. We report in this paper the genetic dissection of this putative operon to determine the function of each of the genes. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the products of the first five genes of the operon are involved in the synthesis of the carbapenem molecule. Three of these, carABC, are absolutely required. In addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel carbapenem resistance mechanism, encoded by the CarF and carG genes. Both products of these overlapping and potentially translationally coupled genes have functional, N-terminal signal peptides. Removal of these genes from the Erwinia chromosome results in a carbapenem-sensitive phenotype. We assume that these novel beta-lactam resistance genes have evolved in concert with the biosynthetic genes to ensure 'self-resistance' in the Erwinia carbapenem producer.	1
Abstract2class: Alternative Biosynthetic Starter Units Enhance the Structural Diversity of Cyanobacterial Lipopeptides Abstract: Puwainaphycins (PUWs) and minutissamides (MINs) are structurally analogous cyclic lipopeptides possessing cytotoxic activity. Both types of compound exhibit high structural variability, particularly in the fatty acid (FA) moiety. Although a biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for synthesis of several PUW variants has been proposed in a cyanobacterial strain, the genetic background for MINs remains unexplored. Herein, we report PUW/MIN biosynthetic gene clusters and structural variants from six cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of biosynthetic gene clusters indicates a common origin of the PUW/MIN hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase. Surprisingly, the biosynthetic gene clusters encode two alternative biosynthetic starter modules, and analysis of structural variants suggests that initiation by each of the starter modules results in lipopeptides of differing lengths and FA substitutions. Among additional modifications of the FA chain, chlorination of minutissamide D was explained by the presence of a putative halogenase gene in the PUW/MIN gene cluster of Anabaena minutissima strain UTEX B 1613. We detected PUW variants bearing an acetyl substitution in Symplocastrum muelleri strain NIVA-CYA 644, consistent with an O-acetyltransferase gene in its biosynthetic gene cluster. The major lipopeptide variants did not exhibit any significant antibacterial activity, and only the PUW F variant was moderately active against yeast, consistent with previously published data suggesting that PUWs/MINs interact preferentially with eukaryotic plasma membranes.IMPORTANCE Herein, we deciphered the most important biosynthetic traits of a prominent group of bioactive lipopeptides. We reveal evidence for initiation of biosynthesis by two alternative starter units hardwired directly in the same gene cluster, eventually resulting in the production of a remarkable range of lipopeptide variants. We identified several unusual tailoring genes potentially involved in modifying the fatty acid chain. Careful characterization of these biosynthetic gene clusters and their diverse products could provide important insight into lipopeptide biosynthesis in prokaryotes. Some of the variants identified exhibit cytotoxic and antifungal properties, and some are associated with a toxigenic biofilm-forming strain. The findings may prove valuable to researchers in the fields of natural product discovery and toxicology.	1
Abstract2class: The PhoB regulatory system modulates biofilm formation and stress response in El Tor biotype Vibrio cholerae Abstract: The PhoBR regulatory system is required for the induction of multiple genes under conditions of phosphate limitation. Here, we examine the role of PhoB in biofilm formation and environmental stress response in Vibrio cholerae of the El Tor biotype. Deletion of phoB or hapR enhanced biofilm formation in a phosphate-limited medium. Planktonic and redispersed biofilm cells of the DeltaphoB mutant did not differ from wild type for the expression of HapR, suggesting that PhoB negatively affects biofilm formation through an HapR-independent pathway. The DeltaphoB mutant exhibited elevated expression of exopolysaccharide genes vpsA and vpsL compared with the wild type. Deletion of hapR enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsT, but had no effect on the expression of vpsR. In contrast, deletion of phoB enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsR, but had no effect on the expression of hapR and vpsT. The DeltaphoB mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild type and with an isogenic DeltarpoS mutant. Conversely, the DeltaphoB mutant was more resistant to acidic conditions and high osmolarity compared with the wild type and with an isogenic DeltarpoS mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that phosphate limitation induces V. cholerae to adopt a free-swimming life style in which PhoB modulates environmental stress response in a manner that differs from the general stress response regulator RpoS.	0
Abstract2class: Rational construction of genome-reduced Burkholderiales chassis facilitates efficient heterologous production of natural products from proteobacteria Abstract: Heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) avails yield improvements and mining of natural products, but it is limited by lacking of more efficient Gram-negative chassis. The proteobacterium Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 7029 exhibits potential for heterologous BGC expression, but its cells undergo early autolysis, hindering further applications. Herein, we rationally construct DC and DT series genome-reduced S. brevitalea mutants by sequential deletions of endogenous BGCs and the nonessential genomic regions, respectively. The DC5 to DC7 mutants affect growth, while the DT series mutants show improved growth characteristics with alleviated cell autolysis. The yield improvements of six proteobacterial natural products and successful identification of chitinimides from Chitinimonas koreensis via heterologous expression in DT mutants demonstrate their superiority to wild-type DSM 7029 and two commonly used Gram-negative chassis Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Our study expands the panel of Gram-negative chassis and facilitates the discovery of natural products by heterologous expression.	1
Abstract2class: Metformin Changes the Relationship between Blood Monocyte Toll-Like Receptor 4 Levels and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease-Ex Vivo Studies Abstract: Background:                       Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to the development of NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and MetS (metabolic syndrome). It is unclear whether anti-diabetic metformin affects TLR4 expression on blood monocytes, thereby protecting or improving inflammatory parameters. Therefore, we investigated TLR4 in patients with NAFLD meeting different sets of MetS criteria and linked the results with the disease burden.                  Methods:                       70 subjects were characterized and divided into three groups: (I) healthy individuals, (II) nonobese with NAFLD and without MetS, and (III) prediabetic, obese with NAFLD and MetS. We determined the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and monocyte TLR4 levels in fresh blood as well as in blood cultures with or without metformin supplementation.                  Results:                       The characteristics of the study groups revealed a significant association between NAFLD and BMI, MetS and inflammatory parameters, and TLR4. In ex vivo studies, 100 μM of metformin decreased the TLR4 level by 19.9% (II group) or by 35% (III group) as well as IL-1β and TNFα production. A stepwise multiple regression analysis highlighted a strong effect of metformin on attenuation of the link between TLR4 and NAFLD, and TNFα.                  Conclusion:                       We concluded that, by attenuation of the blood monocyte TLR4 level, metformin reduced their inflammatory potential-critical after recruitment these cells into liver. However, this finding should be confirmed after in vivo metformin administration.	0
Abstract2class: Functional genomics analysis of free fatty acid production under continuous phosphate limiting conditions Abstract: Free fatty acids (FFA) are an attractive platform chemical that serves as a functional intermediate in metabolic pathways for producing oleochemicals. Many groups have established strains of Escherichia coli capable of producing various chain-length mixtures of FFA by heterologous expression of acyl-ACP thioesterases. For example, high levels of dodecanoic acid are produced by an E. coli strain expressing the Umbellularia californica FatB2 thioesterase, BTE. Prior studies achieved high dodecanoic acid yields and productivities under phosphate-limiting media conditions. In an effort to understand the metabolic and physiological changes that led to increased FFA production, the transcriptome of this strain was assessed as a function of nutrient limitation and growth rate. FFA generation under phosphate limitation led to consistent changes in transporter expression, osmoregulation, and central metabolism. Guided by these results, targeted knockouts led to a further ~11 % in yield in FFA.	0
Abstract2class: Generation of Fluorinated Amychelin Siderophores against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections by a Combination of Genome Mining and Mutasynthesis Abstract: Pioneering microbial genomic surveys have revealed numerous untapped biosynthetic gene clusters, unveiling the great potential of new natural products. Here, using a combination of genome mining, mutasynthesis, and activity screening in an infection model comprising Caenorhabditis elegans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified candidate virulence-blocking amychelin siderophore compounds from actinomycetes. Subsequently, we developed unreported analogs of these virulence-blocking siderophores with improved potency by exploiting an Amycolatopsis methanolica strain 239T chorismate to salicylate a biosynthetic subpathway for mutasynthesis. This allowed us to generate the fluorinated amychelin, fluoroamychelin I, which rescued C. elegans from P. aeruginosa-mediated killing with an EC50 value of 1.4 μM, outperforming traditional antibiotics including ceftazidime and meropenem. In general, this paper describes an efficient platform for the identification and production of classes of anti-microbial compounds with potential unique modes of action.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of a novel, potent, and specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase Abstract: We have examined the mechanism of action of two natural products identified as broad spectrum antifungal agents (VanMiddlesworth, F., Dufresne, C., Wincott, F. E., Mosley, R. T., and Wilson, K. E. (1992) Tetrahedron Lett., in press; VanMiddlesworth, F., Giacobbe, R. A., Lopez, M. Garrity, G., Bland, J. A., Bartizal, K., Fromtling, R. A., Polishook, J., Zweerink, M. M., Edison, A. M., Rozdilsky, W., Wilson, K. E., and Monaghan, R. L. (1992) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 45, 861-867), designated sphingofungin B (2S-amino-3R,4R,5S,14-tetrahydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid) and sphingofungin C (2S-amino-5S-acetoxy-3R,4R,14-trihydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid), and find they are potent specific inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyze the committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to investigate the mechanism of the antifungal activity of these compounds. Macromolecular synthesis was not immediately affected by either sphingofungin B or C, synthesis continued for 60-90 min following the addition of drug to growing cultures. Significant loss of viability with sphingofungins required growing cultures and began only after several hours, with greater than 99.9% of drug-treated cells non-viable after 24 h. No lysis or other gross changes in cell morphology were observed in drug-treated cells. The structural similarity of sphingofungin B and C to sphingosine and phytosphingosine prompted us to investigate their effects on sphingolipid synthesis. Nanomolar levels of the drugs inhibited the incorporation of [3H]inositol into sphingolipid before incorporation into the sphingolipid precursor, phosphatidylinositol was affected, suggesting specific inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments in which the growth inhibitory activity of both drugs was completely ablated by the addition of phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or ketodihydrosphingosine to the culture medium. Reversal of antifungal activity by ketodihydrosphingosine suggested that serine palmitoyltransferase could be the actual target of these compounds. Direct evidence for this hypothesis was the observation of inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase activity in crude membrane preparations at nanomolar concentrations of each drug. The potent inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase coupled with the apparent lack of effect of these compounds on other cellular functions suggests that sphingofungin B and C will prove to be important new tools for studying the role of sphingolipids in yeast and perhaps in other organisms.	0
Abstract2class: Facile Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of anilines to azo compounds and hydrazines with diaziridinone under mild conditions Abstract: A mild and highly efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of anilines is described.

Abstract2class: Identification and properties of the genes encoding microcin E492 and its immunity protein Abstract: The gene coding for the immunity protein (mceB) and the structural gene of microcin E492 (mceA), a low-molecular-weight channel-forming bacteriocin produced by a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been characterized. The microcin gene codes for a precursor protein of either 99 or 103 amino acids. Protein sequencing of the N-terminal region of microcin E492 unequivocally identified this gene as the microcin structural gene and indicated that this microcin is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved at either amino acid 15 or 19, at a site resembling the double-glycine motif. The gene encoding the 95-amino-acid immunity protein (mceB) was identified by cloning the DNA segment that encodes only this polypeptide into an expression vector and demonstrating the acquisition of immunity to microcin E492. As expected, the immunity protein was found to be associated with the inner membrane. Analysis of the DNA sequence indicates that these genes belong to the same family as microcin 24, and they do not share structural motifs with any other known channel-forming bacteriocin. The organization of the microcin- and immunity protein-encoding genes suggests that they are coordinately expressed.	1
Abstract2class: Activities of ten essential oils towards Propionibacterium acnes and PC-3, A-549 and MCF-7 cancer cells Abstract: Ten essential oils, namely, mint (Mentha spicata L., Lamiaceae), ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc., Zingiberaceae), lemon (Citrus limon Burm.f., Rutaceae), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf., Rutaceae), jasmine (Jasminum grandiflora L., Oleaceae), lavender (Mill., Lamiaceae), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L., Compositae), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L., Lamiaceae), rose (Rosa damascena Mill., Rosaceae) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum N. Lauraceae) were tested for their antibacterial activities towards Propionibacterium acnes and in vitro toxicology against three human cancer cell lines. Thyme, cinnamon and rose essential oils exhibited the best antibacterial activities towards P. acnes, with inhibition diameters of 40 +/- 1.2 mm, 33.5 +/- 1.5 mm and 16.5 +/- 0.7 mm, and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.016% (v/v), 0.016% (v/v) and 0.031% (v/v), respectively. Time-kill dynamic procedures showed that thyme, cinnamon, rose, and lavender essential oils exhibited the strongest bactericidal activities at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v), and P. acnes was completely killed after 5 min. The thyme essential oil exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards three human cancer cells. Its inhibition concentration 50% (IC(50)) values on PC-3, A549 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines were 0.010% (v/v), 0.011% (v/v) and 0.030% (v/v), respectively. The cytotoxicity of 10 essential oils on human prostate carcinoma cell (PC-3) was significantly stronger than on human lung carcinoma (A549) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines.	0
Abstract2class: Macrophilones from the Marine Hydroid Macrorhynchia philippina Can Inhibit ERK Cascade Signaling Abstract: Six new macrophilone-type pyrroloiminoquines were isolated and identified from an extract of the marine hydroid Macrorhynchia philippina. The proton-deficient and heteroatom-rich structures of macrophilones B-G (2-7) were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and comparison of their data with those of the previously reported metabolite macrophilone A (1). Compounds 1-7 are the first pyrroloiminoquines to be reported from a hydroid. The macrophilones were shown to inhibit the enzymatic conjugation of SUMO to peptide substrates, and macrophilones A (1) and C (3) exhibit potent and selective cytotoxic properties in the NCI-60 anticancer screen. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a close association of the cytotoxicity profiles of 1 and 3 with two known B-Raf kinase inhibitory drugs. While compounds 1 and 3 showed no kinase inhibitory activity, they resulted in a dramatic decrease in cellular protein levels of selected components of the ERK signal cascade. As such, the chemical scaffold of the macrophilones could provide small-molecule therapeutic leads that target the ERK signal transduction pathway.	0
Abstract2class: Constitution of the cell envelope of Haemophilus influenzae in relation to competence for genetic transformation Abstract: Cell envelopes of Haemophilus influenzae have been prepared by breakage in a French pressure cell followed by differential centrifugation. The envelope fraction may be resolved into an inner-membrane (light) and an outer-membrane (heavy) fraction on density gradients. Envelopes from competent cells possess elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide with a composition different from that of log-phase cell envelopes. Three apparently new polypeptides have been observed in envelopes from competent cells by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; additional quantitative alterations in the profiles of membrane polypeptides also company the development of the capacity to transport deoxyribonucleic acid. Most of the polypeptide changes are confined to the outer membrane; one new polypeptide is associated with the inner cytoplasmic membrane of competent cells. Protein synthesis during competence developement is rquired for the change in lipopolysaccharides and in the envelope polypeptides to occur.	0
Abstract2class: Heme-biosynthetic porphobilinogen deaminase protects Aspergillus nidulans from nitrosative stress Abstract: Microorganisms have developed mechanisms to combat reactive nitrogen species (RNS); however, only a few of the fungal genes involved have been characterized. Here we screened RNS-resistant Aspergillus nidulans strains from fungal transformants obtained by introducing a genomic DNA library constructed in a multicopy vector. We found that the AN0121.3 gene (hemC) encodes a protein similar to the heme biosynthesis enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) and facilitates RNS-tolerant fungal growth. The overproduction of PBG-D in A. nidulans promoted RNS tolerance, whereas PBG-D repression caused growth that was hypersensitive to RNS. PBG-D levels were comparable to those of cellular protoheme synthesis as well as flavohemoglobin (FHb; encoded by fhbA and fhbB) and nitrite reductase (NiR; encoded by niiA) activities. Both FHb and NiR are hemoproteins that consume nitric oxide and nitrite, respectively, and we found that they are required for maximal growth in the presence of RNS. The transcription of hemC was upregulated by RNS. These results demonstrated that PBG-D is a novel NO-tolerant protein that modulates the reduction of environmental NO and nitrite levels by FHb and NiR.	0
Abstract2class: Phosphine-Activated Lysine Analogues for Fast Chemical Control of Protein Subcellular Localization and Protein SUMOylation Abstract: The Staudinger reduction and its variants have exceptional compatibility with live cells but can be limited by slow kinetics. Herein we report new small-molecule triggers that turn on proteins through a Staudinger reduction/self-immolation cascade with substantially improved kinetics and yields. We achieved this through site-specific incorporation of a new set of azidobenzyloxycarbonyl lysine derivatives in mammalian cells. This approach allowed us to activate proteins by adding a nontoxic, bioorthogonal phosphine trigger. We applied this methodology to control a post-translational modification (SUMOylation) in live cells, using native modification machinery. This work significantly improves the rate, yield, and tunability of the Staudinger reduction-based activation, paving the way for its application in other proteins and organisms.	0
Abstract2class: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium, which causes algal blooms and poisoning of shellfish Abstract: The marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium includes a number of species that produce potent neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which in humans may cause muscular paralysis, neurological symptoms and, in extreme cases, death. Because of the genetic diversity of different genera and species, molecular tools may help to detect the presence of target microorganisms in marine field samples. Here we employed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and simple detection of toxic Alexandrium species. A set of four primers were designed based upon the conserved region of the 5.8S rRNA gene of members of the genus Alexandrium. Using this detection system, toxic Alexandrium genes were amplified and visualized as a ladder-like pattern of bands on agarose gels under isothermal condition within 60 min. The LAMP amplicons were also directly visualized by eye in the reaction tube by the addition of SYBR Green I. This LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR method with a detection limit of 5 cells per tube when targeting DNA from Alexandrium minutum. The LAMP assay reported here indicates the potential usefulness of the technique as a valuable simple, rapid alternative procedure for the detection of target toxic Alexandrium species during coastal water monitoring.	0
Abstract2class: Mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase and Yap1p Act as a Signaling Module Contributing to Ethanol Tolerance of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: There are two superoxide dismutases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae-cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes. Inactivation of the cytoplasmic enzyme, Sod1p, renders the cells sensitive to a variety of stresses, while inactivation of the mitochondrial isoform, Sod2p, typically has a weaker effect. One exception is ethanol-induced stress. Here we studied the role of Sod2p in ethanol tolerance of yeast. First, we found that repression of SOD2 prevents ethanol-induced relocalization of yeast hydrogen peroxide-sensing transcription factor Yap1p, one of the key stress resistance proteins. In agreement with this, the levels of Trx2p and Gsh1p, proteins encoded by Yap1 target genes, were decreased in the absence of Sod2p. Analysis of the ethanol sensitivities of the cells lacking Sod2p, Yap1p, or both indicated that the two proteins act in the same pathway. Moreover, preconditioning with hydrogen peroxide restored the ethanol resistance of yeast cells with repressed SOD2 Interestingly, we found that mitochondrion-to-nucleus signaling by Rtg proteins antagonizes Yap1p activation. Together, our data suggest that hydrogen peroxide produced by Sod2p activates Yap1p and thus plays a signaling role in ethanol tolerance.                  Importance:                       Baker's yeast harbors multiple systems that ensure tolerance to high concentrations of ethanol. Still, the role of mitochondria under severe ethanol stress in yeast is not completely clear. Our study revealed a signaling function of mitochondria which contributes significantly to the ethanol tolerance of yeast cells. We found that mitochondrial superoxide dismutase Sod2p and cytoplasmic hydrogen peroxide sensor Yap1p act together as a module of the mitochondrion-to-nucleus signaling pathway. We also report cross talk between this pathway and the conventional retrograde signaling cascade activated by dysfunctional mitochondria.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene cluster for biosynthesis of mannosylerythritol lipids in the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis Abstract: Many microorganisms produce surface-active substances that enhance the availability of water-insoluble substrates. Although many of these biosurfactants have interesting potential applications, very little is known about their biosynthesis. The basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis secretes large amounts of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) under conditions of nitrogen starvation. We recently described a putative glycosyltransferase, Emt1, which is essential for MEL biosynthesis and whose expression is strongly induced by nitrogen limitation. We used DNA microarray analysis to identify additional genes involved in MEL biosynthesis. Here we show that emt1 is part of a gene cluster which comprises five open reading frames. Three of the newly identified proteins, Mac1, Mac2, and Mat1, contain short sequence motifs characteristic for acyl- and acetyltransferases. Mutational analysis revealed that Mac1 and Mac2 are essential for MEL production, which suggests that they are involved in the acylation of mannosylerythritol. Deletion of mat1 resulted in the secretion of completely deacetylated MELs, as determined by mass spectrometry. We overexpressed Mat1 in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that this enzyme acts as an acetyl coenzyme A-dependent acetyltransferase. Remarkably, Mat1 displays relaxed regioselectivity and is able to acetylate mannosylerythritol at both the C-4 and C-6 hydroxyl groups. Based on these results, we propose a biosynthesis pathway for the generation of mannosylerythritol lipids in U. maydis.	1
Abstract2class: Convergent diversity-oriented side-chain macrocyclization scan for unprotected polypeptides Abstract: Here we describe a general synthetic platform for side-chain macrocyclization of an unprotected peptide library based on the SNAr reaction between cysteine thiolates and a new generation of highly reactive perfluoroaromatic small molecule linkers. This strategy enabled us to simultaneously "scan" two cysteine residues positioned from i, i + 1 to i, i + 14 sites in a polypeptide, producing 98 macrocyclic products from reactions of 14 peptides with 7 linkers. A complementary reverse strategy was developed; cysteine residues within the polypeptide were first modified with non-bridging perfluoroaryl moieties and then commercially available dithiol linkers were used for macrocyclization. The highly convergent, site-independent, and modular nature of these two strategies coupled with the unique chemoselectivity of a SNAr transformation allows for the rapid diversity-oriented synthesis of hybrid macrocyclic peptide libraries with varied chemical and structural complexities.	0
Abstract2class: Structural insight into the mechanism of substrate specificity and catalytic activity of an HD-domain phosphohydrolase: the 5'-deoxyribonucleotidase YfbR from Escherichia coli Abstract: HD-domain phosphohydrolases have nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase activities and play important roles in the metabolism of nucleotides and in signaling. We present three 2.1-A-resolution crystal structures (one in the free state and two complexed with natural substrates) of an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, the Escherichia coli 5'-nucleotidase YfbR. The free-state structure of YfbR contains a large cavity accommodating the metal-coordinating HD motif (H33, H68, D69, and D137) and other conserved residues (R18, E72, and D77). Alanine scanning mutagenesis confirms that these residues are important for activity. Two structures of the catalytically inactive mutant E72A complexed with Co(2+) and either thymidine-5'-monophosphate or 2'-deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate disclose the novel binding mode of deoxyribonucleotides in the active site. Residue R18 stabilizes the phosphate on the Co(2+), and residue D77 forms a strong hydrogen bond critical for binding the ribose. The indole side chain of W19 is located close to the 2'-carbon atom of the deoxyribose moiety and is proposed to act as the selectivity switch for deoxyribonucleotide, which is supported by comparison to YfdR, another 5'-nucleotidase in E. coli. The nucleotide bases of both deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate and thymidine-5'-monophosphate make no specific hydrogen bonds with the protein, explaining the lack of nucleotide base selectivity. The YfbR E72A substrate complex structures also suggest a plausible single-step nucleophilic substitution mechanism. This is the first proposed molecular mechanism for an HD-domain phosphohydrolase based directly on substrate-bound crystal structures.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidating the Rimosamide-Detoxin Natural Product Families and Their Biosynthesis Using Metabolite/Gene Cluster Correlations Abstract: As microbial genome sequencing becomes more widespread, the capacity of microorganisms to produce an immense number of metabolites has come into better view. Utilizing a metabolite/gene cluster correlation platform, the biosynthetic origins of a new family of natural products, the rimosamides, were discovered. The rimosamides were identified in Streptomyces rimosus and associated with their NRPS/PKS-type gene cluster based upon their high frequency of co-occurrence across 179 strains of actinobacteria. This also led to the discovery of the related detoxin gene cluster. The core of each of these families of natural products contains a depsipeptide bond at the point of bifurcation in their unusual branched structures, the origins of which are definitively assigned to nonlinear biosynthetic pathways via heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans. The rimosamides were found to antagonize the antibiotic activity of blasticidin S against Bacillus cereus.	1
Abstract2class: A single Streptomyces symbiont makes multiple antifungals to support the fungus farming ant Acromyrmex octospinosus Abstract: Attine ants are dependent on a cultivated fungus for food and use antibiotics produced by symbiotic Actinobacteria as weedkillers in their fungus gardens. Actinobacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis have been isolated from attine ant nests and shown to confer protection against a range of microfungal weeds. In previous work on the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus we isolated a Streptomyces strain that produces candicidin, consistent with another report that attine ants use Streptomyces-produced candicidin in their fungiculture. Here we report the genome analysis of this Streptomyces strain and identify multiple antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate, using gene disruptions and mass spectrometry, that this single strain has the capacity to make candicidin and multiple antimycin compounds. Although antimycins have been known for >60 years we report the sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the first time. Crucially, disrupting the candicidin and antimycin gene clusters in the same strain had no effect on bioactivity against a co-evolved nest pathogen called Escovopsis that has been identified in ∼30% of attine ant nests. Since the Streptomyces strain has strong bioactivity against Escovopsis we conclude that it must make additional antifungal(s) to inhibit Escovopsis. However, candicidin and antimycins likely offer protection against other microfungal weeds that infect the attine fungal gardens. Thus, we propose that the selection of this biosynthetically prolific strain from the natural environment provides A. octospinosus with broad spectrum activity against Escovopsis and other microfungal weeds.	1
Abstract2class: Histone H2A.Z cooperates with RNAi and heterochromatin factors to suppress antisense RNAs Abstract: Eukaryotic transcriptomes are characterized by widespread transcription of noncoding and antisense RNAs, which is linked to key chromosomal processes, such as chromatin remodelling, gene regulation and heterochromatin assembly. However, these transcripts can be deleterious, and their accumulation is suppressed by several mechanisms including degradation by the nuclear exosome. The mechanisms by which cells differentiate coding RNAs from transcripts targeted for degradation are not clear. Here we show that the variant histone H2A.Z, which is loaded preferentially at the 5' ends of genes by the Swr1 complex containing a JmjC domain protein, mediates suppression of antisense transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. H2A.Z is partially redundant in this regard with the Clr4 (known as SUV39H in mammals)-containing heterochromatin silencing complex that is also distributed at euchromatic loci, and with RNA interference component Argonaute (Ago1). Loss of Clr4 or Ago1 alone has little effect on antisense transcript levels, but cells lacking either of these factors and H2A.Z show markedly increased levels of antisense RNAs that are normally degraded by the exosome. These analyses suggest that as well as performing other functions, H2A.Z is a component of a genome indexing mechanism that cooperates with heterochromatin and RNAi factors to suppress read-through antisense transcripts.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering of New Pneumocandin Side-Chain Analogues from Glarea lozoyensis by Mutasynthesis and Evaluation of Their Antifungal Activity Abstract: Pneumocandins are lipohexapeptides of the echinocandin family that inhibit fungal 1,3-β-glucan synthase. Most of the pathway steps have been identified previously. However, the lipoinitiation reaction has not yet been experimentally verified. Herein, we investigate the lipoinitiation step of pneumocandin biosynthesis in Glarea lozoyensis and demonstrate that the gene product, GLligase, catalyzes this step. Disruption of GLHYD, a gene encoding a putative type II thioesterase and sitting upstream of the pneumocandin acyl side chain synthase gene, GLPKS4, revealed that GLHYD was necessary for optimal function of GLPKS4 and to attain normal levels of pneumocandin production. Double disruption of GLHYD and GLPKS4 did not affect residual function of the GLligase or GLNRPS4. Mutasynthesis experiments with a gene disruption mutant of GLPKS4 afforded us an opportunity to test the substrate specificity of GLligase in the absence of its native polyketide side chain to diversify pneumocandins with substituted side chains. Feeding alternative side chain precursors yielded acrophiarin and four new pneumocandin congeners with straight C14, C15, and C16 side chains. A comprehensive biological evaluation showed that one compound, pneumocandin I (5), has elevated antifungal activity and similar hemolytic activity compared to pneumocandin B0, the starting molecule for caspofungin. This study demonstrates that the lipoinitiation mechanism in pneumocandin biosynthesis involves interaction among a highly reducing PKS, a putative type II thioesterase, and an acyl AMP-ligase. A comparison of the SAR among pneumocandins with different-length acyl side chains demonstrated the potential for using GLligase for future engineering of new echinocandin analogues.	1
Abstract2class: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. DSM 4137 for the novel neuroprotectant polyketide meridamycin Abstract: Meridamycin is a non-immunosuppressant, FKBP-binding macrocyclic polyketide, which has major potential as a neuroprotectant in a range of neurodegenerative disorders including dementia, Parkinson's disease and ischaemic stroke. A biosynthetic cluster predicted to encode biosynthesis of meridamycin was cloned from the prolific secondary-metabolite-producing strain Streptomyces sp. DSM 4137, not previously known to produce this compound, and specific gene deletion was used to confirm the role of this cluster in the biosynthesis of meridamycin. The meridamycin modular polyketide synthase consists of 14 extension modules distributed between three giant multienzyme proteins. The terminal module is flanked by a highly unusual cytochrome P450-like domain. The characterization of the meridamycin biosynthetic locus in this readily manipulated streptomycete species opens the way to the engineering of new, altered meridamycins of potential therapeutic importance.	1
Abstract2class: LC-MS-based metabolomics Abstract: Metabolomics aims at identification and quantitation of small molecules involved in metabolic reactions. LC-MS has enjoyed a growing popularity as the platform for metabolomic studies due to its high throughput, soft ionization, and good coverage of metabolites. The success of a LC-MS-based metabolomic study often depends on multiple experimental, analytical, and computational steps. This review presents a workflow of a typical LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis for identification and quantitation of metabolites indicative of biological/environmental perturbations. Challenges and current solutions in each step of the workflow are reviewed. The review intends to help investigators understand the challenges in metabolomic studies and to determine appropriate experimental, analytical, and computational methods to address these challenges.	0
Abstract2class: Five-membered cyclic metal carbyne: synthesis of osmapentalynes by the reactions of osmapentalene with allene, alkyne, and alkene Abstract: The synthesis of small cyclic metal carbynes is challenging due to the large angle strain associated with the highly distorted nonlinear triple bonds. Herein, we report a general route for the synthesis of five-membered cyclic metal carbyne complexes, osmapentalynes, by the reactions of an osmapentalene derivative with allene, alkyne, and alkene. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations document the aromaticity in the fused five-membered rings of osmapentalynes. The realization of transforming osmapentalene to osmapentalyne through this general route would not only allow further exploration of metallapentalyne chemistry but also show promising applications of this novel aromatic system with broad absorption band and high molar absorption coefficient.	0
Abstract2class: An antibody-based proximity labeling map reveals mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of antiviral immunity Abstract: The global epidemic caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the infection of over 200 million people. To extend the knowledge of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we systematically investigate the interactome of 29 viral proteins in human cells by using an antibody-based TurboID assay. In total, 1,388 high-confidence human proximal proteins with biotinylated sites are identified. Notably, we find that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the antiviral and immune responses. We validate that the membrane protein ITGB1 associates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit activation of the interferon pathway through the mitochondrial protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the methyltransferase SET domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD2). We propose 111 potential drugs for the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify three compounds that significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and humans provides a resource for elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection and developing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of the role of the type III effector inventory of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a in interaction with the plant Abstract: In Pseudomonas syringae, the type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential for disease in compatible hosts and for eliciting the hypersensitive response in incompatible hosts. P. syringae pathovars secrete a variable number of type III effectors that form their secretomes. The secretome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a (Pph1448a) currently includes 22 experimentally validated effectors, one HrpL-regulated candidate for which translocation results have been inconsistent, two translocated candidates for which in planta expression has not been established, one bioinformatically identified candidate, and six candidates that have been experimentally discarded. We analyzed the translocation and/or expression of these and other candidates to complete the Pph1448a effector inventory, bringing this inventory to 27 bona fide effectors, including a new one that does not belong to any of the previously described effector families. We developed a simple process for rapidly making single and double knockout mutants and apply it to the generation of an effector mutant collection that includes single knockouts for the majority of the Pph1448a effector inventory. We also generated two double mutant strains containing effectors with potentially redundant functions and analyzed the virulence of the single and double mutant strains as well as strains expressing each of the effectors from a plasmid. We demonstrate that AvrB4-1 and AvrB4-2, as well as HopW1-1 and HopW1-2, are fully redundant and contribute to virulence in bean plants, thus validating this approach for dissecting the contribution of the Pph1448a type III effector inventory to virulence. We also analyzed the effect that the expression of these four effectors from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) has during its interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing that AvrB4-1, but not the others, determines a restriction of bacterial growth that takes place mostly independently of the salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway.	0
Abstract2class: In vitro synergistic activity of ethambutol, isoniazid, kanamycin, rifampin, and streptomycin against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex Abstract: Strains of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex often exhibit in vitro resistance to common antimycobacterial agents. Combinations of etambutol, isoniazid, kanamycin, rifampin, and streptomycin were tested to determine if synergism occurred. Ninety-six percent of the strains were susceptible to a combination of ethambutol and rifampin at concentrations attainable clinically. Other combinations of antimycobacterial agents inhibited 4 to 82% of the isolates tested.	0
Abstract2class: Dominance of blaCTX-M within an Australian extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene pool Abstract: bla(CTX-M) genes, particularly bla(CTX-M-15), are the dominant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Sydney, Australia, where we also found one example of bla(CTX-M-62), encoding a novel enzyme conferring ceftazidime resistance. ESBL genes were present in diverse community isolates and in a variety of associated conjugative plasmids.	0
Abstract2class: Genome Mining and Activation of a Silent PKS/NRPS Gene Cluster Direct the Production of Totopotensamides Abstract: A 92 kb silent hybrid polyketide and nonribosomal peptide gene cluster in marine-derived Streptomyces pactum SCSIO 02999 was activated by genetically manipulating the regulatory genes, including the knockout of two negative regulators (totR5 and totR3) and overexpression of a positive regulator totR1, to direct the production of the known totopotensamides (TPMs) A (1) and B (3) and a novel sulfonate-containing analogue TPM C (2). Inactivation of totG led to accumulation of TPM B (3) lacking the glycosyl moiety, which indicated TotG as a dedicated glycosyltransferase in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2.	1
Abstract2class: Two surfaces on the histone chaperone Rtt106 mediate histone binding, replication, and silencing Abstract: The histone chaperone Rtt106 binds histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3K56ac) and facilitates nucleosome assembly during several molecular processes. Both the structural basis of this modification-specific recognition and how this recognition informs Rtt106 function are presently unclear. Guided by our crystal structure of Rtt106, we identified two regions on its double-pleckstrin homology domain architecture that mediated histone binding. When histone binding was compromised, Rtt106 localized properly to chromatin but failed to deliver H3K56ac, leading to replication and silencing defects. By mutating analogous regions in the structurally homologous chromatin-reorganizer Pob3, we revealed a conserved histone-binding function for a basic patch found on both proteins. In contrast, a loop connecting two β-strands was required for histone binding by Rtt106 but was dispensable for Pob3 function. Unlike Rtt106, Pob3 histone binding was modification-independent, implicating the loop of Rtt106 in H3K56ac-specific recognition in vivo. Our studies described the structural origins of Rtt106 function, identified a conserved histone-binding surface, and defined a critical role for Rtt106:H3K56ac-binding specificity in silencing and replication-coupled nucleosome turnover.	0
Abstract2class: Structural and functional characterization of three polyketide synthase gene clusters in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42 Abstract: Although bacterial polyketides are of considerable biomedical interest, the molecular biology of polyketide biosynthesis in Bacillus spp., one of the richest bacterial sources of bioactive natural products, remains largely unexplored. Here we assign for the first time complete polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters to Bacillus antibiotics. Three giant modular PKS systems of the trans-acyltransferase type were identified in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42. One of them, pks1, is an ortholog of the pksX operon with a previously unknown function in the sequenced model strain Bacillus subtilis 168, while the pks2 and pks3 clusters are novel gene clusters. Cassette mutagenesis combined with advanced mass spectrometric techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that the pks1 (bae) and pks3 (dif) gene clusters encode the biosynthesis of the polyene antibiotics bacillaene and difficidin or oxydifficidin, respectively. In addition, B. subtilis OKB105 (pheA sfp(0)), a transformant of the B. subtilis 168 derivative JH642, was shown to produce bacillaene, demonstrating that the pksX gene cluster directs the synthesis of that polyketide. The GenBank accession numbers for gene clusters pks1(bae), pks2, and pks3(dif) are AJ 634060.2, AJ 6340601.2, and AJ 6340602.2, respectively.	1
Abstract2class: Closely related viruses of the marine picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus exhibit different ecological strategies Abstract: In marine ecosystems, viruses are major disrupters of the direct flow of carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Although the genetic diversity of several eukaryotic phytoplankton virus groups has been characterized, their infection dynamics are less understood, such that the physiological and ecological implications of their diversity remain unclear. We compared genomes and infection phenotypes of the two most closely related cultured phycodnaviruses infecting the widespread picoprasinophyte Ostreococcus lucimarinus under standard- (1.3 divisions per day) and limited-light (0.41 divisions per day) nutrient replete conditions. OlV7 infection caused early arrest of the host cell cycle, coinciding with a significantly higher proportion of infected cells than OlV1-amended treatments, regardless of host growth rate. OlV7 treatments showed a near-50-fold increase of progeny virions at the higher host growth rate, contrasting with OlV1's 16-fold increase. However, production of OlV7 virions was more sensitive than OlV1 production to reduced host growth rate, suggesting fitness trade-offs between infection efficiency and resilience to host physiology. Moreover, although organic matter released from OlV1- and OlV7-infected hosts had broadly similar chemical composition, some distinct molecular signatures were observed. Collectively, these results suggest that current views on viral relatedness through marker and core gene analyses underplay operational divergence and consequences for host ecology.	0
Abstract2class: A molecular genetic map and electrophoretic karyotype of the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus sativus Abstract: A molecular genetic map was constructed and an electrophoretic karyotype was resolved for Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch of barley and wheat. The genetic map consists of 27 linkage groups with 97 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 31 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, two polymerase chain reaction amplified markers, the mating type locus (CsMAT), and a gene (VHv1) conditioning high virulence on barley cv. Bowman. These linkage groups covered a map distance of 849 cM. The virulence gene VHv1 cosegregated with six AFLP markers and was mapped on one of the major linkage groups. Fifteen chromosome-sized DNAs were resolved in C. sativus isolates ND93-1 and ND9OPr with contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis combined with telomere probe analysis of comigrating chromosome-sized DNAs. The chromosome sizes ranged from 1.25 to 3.80 Mbp, and the genome size of the fungus was estimated to be approximately 33 Mbp. By hybridizing genetically mapped RFLP and AFLP markers to CHEF blots, 25 of the 27 linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes. The barley-specific virulence locus VHv1 was localized on a chromosome of 2.80 Mbp from isolate ND9OPr in the CHEF gel. The total map length of the fungus was estimated to be at least 1,329 cM based on the map distance covered by the linked markers and the estimated gaps. Therefore, the physical to genetic distance ratio is approximately 25 kb/cM. Construction of a high-resolution map around target loci will facilitate the cloning of the genes conferring virulence and other characters in C. sativus by a map-based cloning strategy.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase McyI, encoded within the microcystin biosynthesis gene cluster of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 Abstract: The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa is widely known for its production of the potent hepatotoxin microcystin. This cyclic heptapeptide is synthesized non-ribosomally by the thio-template function of a large modular enzyme complex encoded within the 55-kb microcystin synthetase gene (mcy) cluster. The mcy gene cluster also encodes several stand-alone enzymes, putatively involved in the tailoring and export of microcystin. This study describes the characterization of the 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase McyI, putatively involved in the production of d-methyl aspartate at position 3 within the microcystin cyclic structure. A combination of bioinformatics, molecular, and biochemical techniques was used to elucidate the structure, function, regulation, and evolution of this unique enzyme. The recombinant McyI enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and enzymatically characterized. The hypothesized native activity of McyI, the interconversion of 3-methyl malate to 3-methyl oxalacetate, was demonstrated using an in vitro spectrophotometric assay. The enzyme was also able to reduce alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate and to catalyze the interconversion of malate and oxalacetate. Although NADP(H) was the preferred cofactor of the McyI-catalyzed reactions, NAD(H) could also be utilized, although rates of catalysis were significantly lower. The combined results of this study suggest that hepatotoxic cyanobacteria such as M. aeruginosa PCC7806 are capable of producing methyl aspartate via a novel glutamate mutase-independent pathway, in which McyI plays a pivotal role.	1

Abstract2class: Cupric Ions Selectively Modulate TRAAK-Phosphatidylserine Interactions Abstract: TRAAK and TREK2 are two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels and are modulated by diverse factors including temperature, membrane stretching, and lipids, such as phosphatidic acid. In addition, copper and zinc, both of which are essential for life, are known to regulate TREK2 and a number of other ion channels. However, the role of ions in the association of lipids with integral membrane proteins is poorly understood. Here, we discover cupric ions selectively modulate the binding of phosphatidylserine (PS) to TRAAK but not TREK2. Other divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) bind both channels but have no impact on binding PS and other lipids. Additionally, TRAAK binds more avidly to Cu2+ and Zn2+ than TREK2. In the presence of Cu2+, TRAAK binds similarly to PS with different acyl chains, indicating a crucial role of the serine headgroup in coordinating Cu2+. High-resolution native mass spectrometry (MS) enables the determination of equilibrium binding constants for distinct Cu2+-bound stoichiometries and uncovered the highest coupling factor corresponds to a 1:1 PS-to-Cu2+ ratio. Interestingly, the next three highest coupling factors had a ∼1.5:1 PS-to-Cu2+ ratio. Our findings bring forth the role of cupric ions as an essential cofactor in selective TRAAK-PS interactions.	0
Abstract2class: Identification, heterologous production and bioactivity of lentinulin A and dendrothelin A, two natural variants of backbone N-methylated peptide macrocycle omphalotin A Abstract: Backbone N-methylation and macrocyclization improve the pharmacological properties of peptides by enhancing their proteolytic stability, membrane permeability and target selectivity. Borosins are backbone N-methylated peptide macrocycles derived from a precursor protein which contains a peptide α-N-methyltransferase domain autocatalytically modifying the core peptide located at its C-terminus. Founding members of borosins are the omphalotins from the mushroom Omphalotus olearius (omphalotins A-I) with nine out of 12 L-amino acids being backbone N-methylated. The omphalotin biosynthetic gene cluster codes for the precursor protein OphMA, the protease prolyloligopeptidase OphP and other proteins that are likely to be involved in other post-translational modifications of the peptide. Mining of available fungal genome sequences revealed the existence of highly homologous gene clusters in the basidiomycetes Lentinula edodes and Dendrothele bispora. The respective borosins, referred to as lentinulins and dendrothelins are naturally produced by L. edodes and D. bispora as shown by analysis of respective mycelial extracts. We produced all three homologous peptide natural products by coexpression of OphMA hybrid proteins and OphP in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant peptides differ in their nematotoxic activity against the plant pathogen Meloidogyne incognita. Our findings pave the way for the production of borosin peptide natural products and their potential application as novel biopharmaceuticals and biopesticides.	1
Abstract2class: Simultaneous Identification of Neutral and Anionic Species in Complex Mixtures without Separation Abstract: A chemosensory system is reported that operates without the need for separation techniques and is capable of identifying anions and structurally similar bioactive molecules. In this strategy, the coordination of analytes to a metal complex with an open binding cleft generates "static structures" on the NMR timescale. Unique signals are created by strategically placing fluorine atoms in close proximity to bound analytes so that small structural differences induce distinct (19)F NMR shifts that can be used to identify each analyte. The utility of this method is illustrated by quantifying caffeine levels in coffee, by identifying ingredients in tea and energy drinks, and by discriminating between multiple biogenic amines with remote structural differences six carbon atoms away from the binding site. We further demonstrate the simultaneous identification of multiple neutral and anionic species in a complex mixture.	0
Abstract2class: Gamma-aminobutyric acid binding to receptor sites in the rat central nervous system Abstract: [(3)H]Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binds to synaptic membrane fractions of rat brain in a selective fashion representing an interaction with postsynaptic GABA receptors. Inhibition of [(3)H]GABA binding by a variety of amino acids closely parallels their ability to mimic the synaptic inhibitory actions of GABA and does not correlate with their relative affinity for the presynaptic synaptosomal GABA uptake system. [(3)H]GABA binding is saturable with an affinity constant of about 0.1 muM. The GABA antagonist bicuculline inhibits [(3)H]GABA binding with half maximal effects at 5 muM, whereas it requires a concentration of 0.5 mM to reduce synaptosomal GABA uptake by 50%. In subcellular fractionation experiments [(3)H]GABA binding is most enriched in crude synaptic membranes. [(3)H]GABA binding is greatest in the cerebellum, least in the spinal cord and medulla oblongatapons, with intermediate values in the thalamus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, midbrain, and corpus striatum.	0
Abstract2class: A tricyclic pyrrolobenzodiazepine produced by Klebsiella oxytoca is associated with cytotoxicity in antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis Abstract: Cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca is the causative agent of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). Recently, the cytotoxin associated with AAHC was identified as tilivalline, a known pentacyclic pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) metabolite produced by K. oxytoca Although this assertion of tilivalline's role in AAHC is supported by evidence from animal experiments, some key aspects of this finding appear to be incompatible with toxicity mechanisms of known PBD toxins. We therefore hypothesized that K. oxytoca may produce some other uncharacterized cytotoxins. To address this question, we investigated whether tilivalline alone is indeed necessary and sufficient to induce cytotoxicity or whether K. oxytoca also produces other cytotoxins. LC-MS- and NMR-based metabolomic analyses revealed the presence of an abundant tricyclic PBD, provisionally designated kleboxymycin, in the supernatant of toxigenic K. oxytoca strains. Moreover, by generating multiple mutants with gene deletions affecting tilivalline biosynthesis, we show that a tryptophanase-deficient, tilivalline-negative K. oxytoca mutant induced cytotoxicity in vitro similar to tilivalline-positive K. oxytoca strains. Furthermore, synthetic kleboxymycin exhibited greater than 9-fold higher cytotoxicity than tilivalline in TC50 cell culture assays. We also found that the biosynthetic pathways for kleboxymycin and tilivalline appear to overlap, as tilivalline is an indole derivative of kleboxymycin. In summary, our results indicate that tilivalline is not essential for inducing cytotoxicity observed in K. oxytoca-associated AAHC and that kleboxymycin is a tilivalline-related bacterial metabolite with even higher cytotoxicity.	1
Abstract2class: Dietary choice affects Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 colonization and disease Abstract: The likelihood that a single individual infected with the Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing, food-borne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 will develop a life-threatening sequela called the hemolytic uremic syndrome is unpredictable. We reasoned that conditions that enhance Stx binding and uptake within the gut after E. coli O157:H7 infection should result in greater disease severity. Because the receptor for Stx, globotriaosylceramide, is up-regulated in the presence of butyrate in vitro, we asked whether a high fiber diet (HFD) that reportedly enhances butyrate production by normal gut flora can influence the outcome of an E. coli O157 infection in mice. To address that question, groups of BALB/c mice were fed high (10%) or low (2%) fiber diets and infected with E. coli O157:H7 strain 86-24 (Stx2+). Mice fed an HFD exhibited a 10- to 100-fold increase in colonization, lost 15% more body weight, exhibited signs of morbidity, and had 25% greater mortality relative to the low fiber diet (LFD)-fed group. Additionally, sections of intestinal tissue from HFD-fed mice bound more Stx1 and expressed more globotriaosylceramide than did such sections from LFD-fed mice. Furthermore, the gut microbiota of HFD-fed mice compared with LFD-fed mice contained reduced levels of native Escherichia species, organisms that might protect the gut from colonization by incoming E. coli O157:H7. Taken together, these results suggest that susceptibility to infection and subsequent disease after ingestion of E. coli O157:H7 may depend, at least in part, on individual diet and/or the capacity of the commensal flora to produce butyrate.	0
Abstract2class: Modulation of polyketide synthase activity by accessory proteins during lovastatin biosynthesis Abstract: Polyketides, the ubiquitous products of secondary metabolism in microorganisms, are made by a process resembling fatty acid biosynthesis that allows the suppression of reduction or dehydration reactions at specific biosynthetic steps, giving rise to a wide range of often medically useful products. The lovastatin biosynthesis cluster contains two type I polyketide synthase genes. Synthesis of the main nonaketide-derived skeleton was found to require the previously known iterative lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), plus at least one additional protein (LovC) that interacts with LNKS and is necessary for the correct processing of the growing polyketide chain and production of dihydromonacolin L. The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J.	1
Abstract2class: Stereochemistry of Transition Metal Complexes Controlled by the Metallo-Anomeric Effect Abstract: The use of stereoelectronic interactions to control reactivity and selectivity has a long history in chemistry. The anomeric effect, one of the fundamental concepts in organic chemistry, describes the preferences of a substituent at the anomeric carbon in glycosides to adopt axial configuration when the anomeric group is an electronegative element such as oxygen or a halogen. The origin of the anomeric effect has been the subject of intense debate. Explanations capitalizing on either the delocalization of the endocyclic oxygen lone pair into the antibonding σ*(C-X) orbital or the minimization of the dipole-dipole interactions are currently the two leading theoretical models. Although the majority of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the elements from groups 6 and 7, little is known about conformational preferences of tetrahydropyran rings substituted with a transition metal at the anomeric carbon and the role of these interactions in stereoselective synthesis. Here, we report studies on conformational and configurational preferences of organometallic complexes stabilized by vicinal heteroatoms. We provide computational evidence that late transition metals adopt the axial position in heterocycles or synclinal geometry in acyclic systems. Furthermore, the anomeric preferences of late transition metals correlate with the oxidation state of the metal and can be explained by hyperconjugative interactions between endocyclic heteroatom and the σ* acceptor orbitals of the C-M bond. In a broader context, this discovery provides insight into the role of previously unanticipated stereoelectronic effects that can be harnessed in the design of stereoselective reactions, including chemical glycosylation and enantioselective catalysis.	0
Abstract2class: Variations in protein-flavin hydrogen bonding in a light, oxygen, voltage domain produce non-Arrhenius kinetics of adduct decay Abstract: Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains utilize a conserved blue light-dependent mechanism to control a diverse array of effector domains in biological and engineered proteins. Variations in the kinetics and efficiency of LOV photochemistry fine-tune various aspects of the photic response. Characterization of the kinetics of a key aspect of this photochemical mechanism in EL222, a blue light responsive DNA binding protein from Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, reveals unique non-Arrhenius behavior in the rate of dark-state cleavage of the photochemically generated adduct. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis studies establish that this effect stems from a Gln to Ala mutation unique to EL222 and homologous proteins from marine bacteria. Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses reveal that hydrogen bonding interactions between the FMN N1, O2, and ribityl hydroxyls and the surrounding protein regulate photocycle kinetics and stabilize the LOV active site from temperature-induced alteration in local structure. Substitution of residues interacting with the N1-O2 locus modulates adduct stability, structural flexibility, and sequestration of the active site from bulk solvent without perturbation of light-activated DNA binding. Together, these variants link non-Arrhenius behavior to specific alteration of an H-bonding network, while affording tunability of photocycle kinetics.	0
Abstract2class: Single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: dynamic change of gene expression during microsporogenesis Abstract: A sensitive and reliable single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed that requires little sample material and only a short sampling time and ensures template preservation. We propose that the assay provides a useful tool to study not only cell-cycle related events in developing pollen but also the molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility and mutants impaired in pollen development.	0
Abstract2class: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies on the putative dTDP sugar epimerase NovW from the novobiocin biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovW (subunit MW = 22 289 Da), a putative dTDP sugar epimerase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallizes in space group P4(3)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 59.20, c = 109.23 A. Native data to a resolution of 2.0 A were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on a rotating-anode X-ray generator. Preliminary analysis of these data indicated that the asymmetric unit corresponded to a monomer, whilst dynamic light scattering (DLS) suggested that NovW was a dimer in solution. NovW is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin, which targets the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, and represents the first enzyme to be crystallized from this biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular cloning and characterization of a locus responsible for O acetylation of the O polysaccharide of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 lipopolysaccharide Abstract: Complementation experiments, Tn5 mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing were used to identify a locus (lag-1) that participates in acetylation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 lipopolysaccharide. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of lipopolysaccharides from mutant and complemented strains suggest that lag-1 is responsible for O acetylation of serogroup 1 O polysaccharide.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and Verification of the Prodigiosin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (BGC) in Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059 Abstract: Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059 produces the red pigment prodigiosin, which has pharmaceutical and industrial potential. Here, we targeted a putative prodigiosin-synthesizing transferase PigC, and a pigC in-frame deletion mutant did not produce prodigiosin. However, extractions of the pigC mutant cultures retained antibacterial activity, and bioassay-guided fractionation found antibacterial activity in two fractions of blue color. A precursor of prodigiosin, 4-methoxy-2,2'-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde (MBC), was the dominant compound in both the fractions and likely caused the antibacterial activity. Also, a stable blue pigment, di-pyrrolyl-dipyrromethene prodigiosin, was identified from the two fractions. We also discovered antibacterial activity in the sterile filtered (nonextracted) culture supernatant of both wild type and mutant, and both contained a heat-sensitive compound between 30 and 100 kDa. Deletion of prodigiosin production did not affect growth rate or biofilm formation of P. rubra and did not change its fitness, as the mutant and wild type coexisted in equal levels in mixed cultures. In conclusion, a prodigiosin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and verified genetically and chemically in P. rubra S4059 and a stable blue pigment was isolated from the pigC mutant of S4059, suggesting that this strain may produce several prodigiosin-derived compounds of pharmaceutical and/or industrial potential. IMPORTANCE Pigmented Pseudoalteromonas strains are renowned for their production of secondary metabolites, and genome mining has revealed a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for which the chemistry is unknown. Identification of those BGCs is a prerequisite for linking products to gene clusters and for further exploitation through heterologous expression. In this study, we identified the BGCs for the red, bioactive pigment prodigiosin using genomic, genetic, and metabolomic approaches. We also report here for the first time the production of a stable blue pigment, di-pyrrolyl-dipyrromethene prodigiosin (Dip-PDG), being produced by the pigC mutant of Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059.	1
Abstract2class: Photoredox-Catalyzed Decarboxylative C-Terminal Differentiation for Bulk- and Single-Molecule Proteomics Abstract: Methods for the selective labeling of biogenic functional groups on peptides are being developed and used in the workflow of both current and emerging proteomics technologies, such as single-molecule fluorosequencing. To achieve successful labeling with any one method requires that the peptide fragments contain the functional group for which labeling chemistry is designed. In practice, only two functional groups are present in every peptide fragment regardless of the protein cleavage site, namely, an N-terminal amine and a C-terminal carboxylic acid. Developing a global-labeling technology, therefore, requires one to specifically target the N- and/or C-terminus of peptides. In this work, we showcase the first successful application of photocatalyzed C-terminal decarboxylative alkylation for peptide mass spectrometry and single-molecule protein sequencing that can be broadly applied to any proteome. We demonstrate that peptides in complex mixtures generated from enzymatic digests from bovine serum albumin, as well as protein mixtures from yeast and human cell extracts, can be site-specifically labeled at their C-terminal residue with a Michael acceptor. Using two distinct analytical approaches, we characterize C-terminal labeling efficiencies of greater than 50% across complete proteomes and document the proclivity of various C-terminal amino-acid residues for decarboxylative labeling, showing histidine and tryptophan to be the most disfavored. Finally, we combine C-terminal decarboxylative labeling with an orthogonal carboxylic acid-labeling technology in tandem to establish a new platform for fluorosequencing.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of sulfated glycopeptide antibiotics by using the sulfotransferase StaL Abstract: The unique glycopeptide antibiotic A47934, produced by Streptomyces toyocaensis, possesses a nonglycosylated heptapeptide core that is sulfated on the phenolic hydroxyl of the N-terminal 4-hydroxy-L-phenylglycine residue. Genetic and biochemical experiments confirmed that StaL is a sulfotransferase capable of sulfating the predicted crosslinked heptapeptide substrate to produce A47934 both in vivo and in vitro. Incubation of purified His(6)-StaL with various substrates in vitro revealed substrate specificity and yielded two sulfo-glycopeptide antibiotics: sulfo-teicoplanin aglycone and sulfo-teicoplanin. Quantification of the antibacterial activity of desulfo-A47934, A47934, teicoplanin, and sulfo-teicoplanin demonstrated that sulfation slightly increased the minimum inhibitory concentration. This unique modification by sulfation expands glycopeptide diversity with potential application for the development of new antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Deciphering the biosynthesis pathway of the antitumor thiocoraline from a marine actinomycete and its expression in two streptomyces species Abstract: Thiocoraline is a thiodepsipeptide antitumor compound produced by two actinomycetes Micromonospora sp. ACM2-092 and Micromonospora sp. ML1, isolated from two marine invertebrates (a soft coral and a mollusc) found of the Indian Ocean coast of Mozambique. By using oligoprimers derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) consensus sequences, six PCR fragments containing putative NRPS adenylation domains were amplified from the chromosome of Micromonospora sp. ML1. Insertional inactivation of each adenylation domain showed that two of them generated nonproducing mutants, thereby indicating that these domains were involved in thiocoraline biosynthesis. Sequencing of a 64.6 kbp DNA region revealed the presence of 36 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and two incomplete ones. Heterologous expression of a region of about 53 kbp, containing 26 of the ORFs, in Streptomyces albus and S. lividans led to the production of thiocoraline in these streptomycetes. Surprisingly, the identified gene cluster contains more NRPS modules than expected on the basis of the number of amino acids of thiocoraline. TioR and TioS would most probably constitute the NRPS involved in the biosynthesis of the thiocoraline backbone, according to the colinearity of the respective modules. It is proposed that two other NRPSs, TioY and TioZ, could be responsible for the biosynthesis of a small peptide molecule which could be involved in regulation of the biosynthesis of thicoraline in Micromonospora sp. ML1. In addition, a pathway is proposed for the biosynthesis of the unusual starter unit, 3-hydroxy-quinaldic acid.	1
Abstract2class: The mineral weathering ability of Collimonas pratensis PMB3(1) involves a Malleobactin-mediated iron acquisition system Abstract: Mineral weathering by microorganisms is considered to occur through a succession of mechanisms based on acidification and chelation. While the role of acidification is established, the role of siderophores is difficult to disentangle from the effect of the acidification. We took advantage of the ability of strain Collimonas pratensis PMB3(1) to weather minerals but not to acidify depending on the carbon source to address the role of siderophores in mineral weathering. We identified a single non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) responsible for siderophore biosynthesis in the PMB3(1) genome. By combining iron-chelating assays, targeted mutagenesis and chemical analyses (HPLC and LC-ESI-HRMS), we identified the siderophore produced as malleobactin X and how its production depends on the concentration of available iron. Comparison with the genome sequences of other collimonads evidenced that malleobactin production seems to be a relatively conserved functional trait, though some collimonads harboured other siderophore synthesis systems. We also revealed by comparing the wild-type strain and its mutant impaired in the production of malleobactin that the ability to produce this siderophore is essential to allow the dissolution of hematite under non-acidifying conditions. This study represents the first characterization of the siderophore produced by collimonads and its role in mineral weathering.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the microbial community and polyketide biosynthetic potential in the palmerolide-producing tunicate Synoicum adareanum Abstract: Palmerolide A (1) is a macrolide isolated from the Antarctic tunicate Synoicum adareanum that is of interest due to its potential as an antimelanoma drug. Biosynthesis is predicted to occur via a hybrid PKS-NRPS pathway within S. adareanum, but the identity of the palmerolide-producing organism (host or putative host-associated microorganism) has not been established. Microscopic observation revealed a dense microbial community inside the tunicate, and evidence from 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles and clone library sequences suggests that the bacterial community has moderate phylogenetic complexity. The alpha and gamma classes of Proteobacteria account for ∼75% of the cloned 16S rRNA genes, and the majority of these sequences are affiliated with the genera Pseudovibrio and Microbulbifer. DNA sequences encoding type I PKS ketosynthase (KS) domains were detected by PCR. The S. adareanum KS sequences, which affiliate with the trans-AT clade, are similar to portions of PKS proteins that lack integrated acyltransferase domains in pathways for generating bioactive polyketide compounds, including bryostatin, leinamycin, and pederin.	1
Abstract2class: Production of D-lactic acid containing polyhydroxyalkanoate polymers in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provide biodegradable and bio-based alternatives to conventional plastics. Incorporation of 2-hydroxy acid monomers into polymer, in addition to 3-hydroxy acids, offers possibility to tailor the polymer properties. In this study, poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) and copolymer P(LA-3HB) were produced and characterized for the first time in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of engineered PHA synthase PhaC1437Ps6-19, propionyl-CoA transferase Pct540Cp, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase PhaA, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase PhaB1 resulted in accumulation of 3.6% P(LA-3HB) and expression of engineered enzymes PhaC1Pre and PctMe resulted in accumulation of 0.73% PDLA of the cell dry weight (CDW). According to NMR, P(LA-3HB) contained D-lactic acid repeating sequences. For reference, expression of PhaA, PhaB1, and PHA synthase PhaC1 resulted in accumulation 11% poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) of the CDW. Weight average molecular weights of these polymers were comparable to similar polymers produced by bacterial strains, 24.6, 6.3, and 1 130 kDa for P(LA-3HB), PDLA, and PHB, respectively. The results suggest that yeast, as a robust and acid tolerant industrial production organism, could be suitable for production of 2-hydroxy acid containing PHAs from sugars or from 2-hydroxy acid containing raw materials. Moreover, the wide substrate specificity of PHA synthase enzymes employed increases the possibilities for modifying copolymer properties in yeast in the future.	0
Abstract2class: Differentiation of epidemic-associated strains of Listeria monocytogenes by restriction fragment length polymorphism in a gene region essential for growth at low temperatures (4 degrees C) Abstract: The growth of Listeria monocytogenes in food stored in the cold has often been implicated in outbreaks of listeriosis. Many subtyping schemes have suggested that epidemic-associated strains belong to a unique genetic group. It has not yet been possible, however, to identify molecular or bacteriologic markers unique to epidemic-associated strains. Recently we cloned three genes of L. monocytogenes, ltrA, ltrB, and ltrC, which are essential for growth at low temperatures (4 degrees C). The use of a 1.2-kb PstI fragment derived from ltrB as a probe in Southern blots of HindIII-digested DNA revealed three hybridization patterns: the first (a 5.0-kb band) was observed in strains of serotypes 4b, 1/2b, and 3b; the second (a 3.1-kb band) was seen in strains of serotypes 1/2a, 3a, 1/2c, and 3c; and the third (a 9.5-kb band) was characteristic of epidemic-associated serotype 4b strains. These and other data suggest that probes derived from this gene region that is essential for growth at low temperatures can be useful molecular tools for the subtyping of strains implicated in food-borne listeriosis.	0
Abstract2class: Quantitative detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes in dental plaque Abstract: We developed quantitative fimA genotype assays and applied them in a pilot study investigating the fimbrial genotype distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis in European subjects with or without chronic periodontitis. P. gingivalis was found in 71% and 9% of the samples from patients and healthy subjects, respectively. Enumeration of total P. gingivalis cell numbers by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence showed excellent correspondence (r = 0.964). 73% of positive samples contained multiple fimA genotypes, but generally one genotype predominated by one to three orders of magnitude. Genotype II predominated in 60% of the samples. Genotype IV occurred with similar prevalence (73%) as genotype II but predominated in only 20% of the samples. Genotypes I, III and V were of much lower prevalence and cell densities of the latter two remained sparse. Our results suggest marked differences among the fimA genotypes' ability to colonize host sites with high cell numbers.	0
Abstract2class: Complexity generation in fungal peptidyl alkaloid biosynthesis: a two-enzyme pathway to the hexacyclic MDR export pump inhibitor ardeemin Abstract: Ardeemins are hexacyclic peptidyl alkaloids isolated from Aspergillus fischeri as agents that block efflux of anticancer drugs by MultiDrug Resistance (MDR) export pumps. To evaluate the biosynthetic logic and enzymatic machinery for ardeemin framework assembly, we sequenced the A. fischeri genome and identified the ardABC gene cluster. Through both genetic deletions and biochemical characterizations of purified ArdA and ArdB we show this ArdAB enzyme pair is sufficient to convert anthranilate (Ant), L-Ala, and L-Trp to ardeemin. ArdA is a 430 kDa trimodular nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) that converts the three building blocks into a fumiquinazoline (FQ) regioisomer termed ardeemin FQ. ArdB is a prenyltransferase that takes tricyclic ardeemin FQ and dimethylallyl diphosphate to the hexacyclic ardeemin scaffold via prenylation at C2 of the Trp-derived indole moiety with intramolecular capture by an amide NH of the fumiquinazoline ring. The two-enzyme ArdAB pathway reveals remarkable efficiency in construction of the hexacyclic peptidyl alkaloid scaffold.	1
Abstract2class: Bacilysin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 has specific bactericidal activity against harmful algal bloom species Abstract: Harmful algal blooms, caused by massive and exceptional overgrowth of microalgae and cyanobacteria, are a serious environmental problem worldwide : In the present study, we looked for Bacillus strains with sufficiently strong anticyanobacterial activity to be used as biocontrol agents. Among 24 strains, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 showed the strongest bactericidal activity against Microcystis aeruginosa, with a kill rate of 98.78%. The synthesis of the anticyanobacterial substance did not depend on Sfp, an enzyme that catalyzes a necessary processing step in the nonribosomal synthesis of lipopeptides and polyketides, but was associated with the aro gene cluster that is involved in the synthesis of the sfp-independent antibiotic bacilysin. Disruption of bacB, the gene in the cluster responsible for synthesizing bacilysin, or supplementation with the antagonist N-acetylglucosamine abolished the inhibitory effect, but this was restored when bacilysin synthesis was complemented. Bacilysin caused apparent changes in the algal cell wall and cell organelle membranes, and this resulted in cell lysis. Meanwhile, there was downregulated expression of glmS, psbA1, mcyB, and ftsZ-genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, photosynthesis, microcystin synthesis, and cell division, respectively. In addition, bacilysin suppressed the growth of other harmful algal species. In summary, bacilysin produced by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 has anticyanobacterial activity and thus could be developed as a biocontrol agent to mitigate the effects of harmful algal blooms.	1
Abstract2class: The Ustilago maydis Cys2His2-type zinc finger transcription factor Mzr1 regulates fungal gene expression during the biotrophic growth stage Abstract: The smut fungus Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host plant maize to progress through sexual development. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Cys(2)His(2)-type zinc finger protein Mzr1 that functions as a transcriptional activator during host colonization. Expression of the U. maydis mig2 cluster genes is tightly linked to this phase. Upon conditional overexpression, Mzr1 confers induction of a subset of mig2 genes during vegetative growth and this requires the same promoter elements that confer inducible expression in planta. Furthermore, expression of the mig2-4 and mig2-5 genes during biotrophic growth is strongly reduced in cells deleted in mzr1. DNA-array analysis led to the identification of additional Mzr1-induced genes. Some of these genes show a mig2-like plant-specific expression pattern and Mzr1 is responsible for their high-level expression during pathogenesis. Mzr1 function requires the b-dependently regulated Cys(2)His(2)-type cell cycle regulator Biz1, indicating that two stage-specific regulators mediate gene expression during host colonization. In spite of a role as transcriptional activator during biotrophic growth, mzr1 is not essential for pathogenesis; however, conditional overexpression interfered with proliferation during vegetative growth and mating ability, caused a cell separation defect, and triggered filamentous growth. We discuss the implications of these findings.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the coformycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces kaniharaensis Abstract: Coformycin and pentostatin are structurally related N-nucleoside inhibitors of adenosine deaminase characterized by an unusual 1,3-diazepine nucleobase. Herein, the cof gene cluster responsible for coformycin biosynthesis is identified. Reconstitution of the coformycin biosynthetic pathway in vitro demonstrates that it overlaps significantly with the early stages of l-histidine biosynthesis. Committed entry into the coformycin pathway takes place via conversion of a shared branch point intermediate to 8-ketocoformycin-[Formula: see text]-monophosphate catalyzed by CofB, which is a homolog of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) synthetase. This reaction appears to proceed via a Dieckmann cyclization and a retro-aldol elimination, releasing ammonia and D-erythronate-4-phosphate as coproducts. Completion of coformycin biosynthesis involves reduction and dephosphorylation of the CofB product, with the former reaction being catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase CofA. CofB also shows activation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) despite the reaction requiring neither a phosphorylated nor an adenylated intermediate. This may serve to help regulate metabolic partitioning between the l-histidine and coformycin pathways.	1
Abstract2class: Optogenetic control of kinetochore function Abstract: Kinetochores act as hubs for multiple activities during cell division, including microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint signaling. Each kinetochore can act autonomously, and activities change rapidly as proteins are recruited to, or removed from, kinetochores. Understanding this dynamic system requires tools that can manipulate kinetochores on biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales. Optogenetic approaches have the potential to provide temporal and spatial control with molecular specificity. Here we report new chemical inducers of protein dimerization that allow us to both recruit proteins to and release them from kinetochores using light. We use these dimerizers to manipulate checkpoint signaling and molecular motor activity. Our findings demonstrate specialized properties of the CENP-E (kinesin-7) motor for directional chromosome transport to the spindle equator and for maintenance of metaphase alignment. This work establishes a foundation for optogenetic control of kinetochore function, which is broadly applicable to experimental probing of other dynamic cellular processes.	0
Abstract2class: Genome mining reveals a minimum gene set for the biosynthesis of 32-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides lactazoles Abstract: Although >100 thiopeptides have been discovered, the number of validated gene clusters involved in their biosynthesis is lagging. We use genome mining to identify a silent thiopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of lactazoles. Lactazoles are structurally unique thiopeptides with a 32-membered macrocycle and a 2-oxazolyl-6-thiazolyl pyridine core. We demonstrate that lactazoles originate from the simplest cluster, containing only six unidirectional genes (lazA to lazF). We show that lazC is involved in the macrocyclization process, leading to central pyridine moiety formation. Substitution of the endogenous promoter with a strong promoter results in an approximately 30-fold increase in lactazole A production and mutagenesis of lazC precursor gene in production of two analogs. Lactazoles do not exhibit antimicrobial activity but may modulate signaling cascades triggered by bone morphogenetic protein. Our approach facilitates the production of a more diverse set of thiopeptide structures, increasing the semisynthetic repertoire for use in drug development.	1
Abstract2class: In Vitro Biosynthesis of the Core Scaffold of the Thiopeptide Thiomuracin Abstract: Thiopeptides are potent antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. They are made by a remarkable post-translational modification process that transforms a linear peptide into a polycyclic structure. We present here the in vitro biosynthesis of the core scaffold of thiomuracin catalyzed by six proteins. We show that cyclodehydration precedes dehydration, and that dehydration is catalyzed by two proteins in a tRNA(Glu)-dependent manner. The enzyme that generates the pyridine core from two dehydroalanines ejects the leader peptide as a C-terminal carboxamide. Mutagenesis studies of the enzyme TbtD identified important residues for a formal [4+2] cycloaddition process. The core structure of thiomuracin exhibits similar antimicrobial activity to other known congeners, illustrating that in vitro biosynthesis is a viable route to potent antibiotics that can be explored for the rapid and renewable generation of analogues.	1
Abstract2class: Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors OspB and OspF target the nucleus to downregulate the host inflammatory response via interactions with retinoblastoma protein Abstract: OspF, OspG and IpaH(9.8) are type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors of Shigella flexneri that downregulate the host innate immune response. OspF modifies mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration associated with Shigella invasion. OspF also localizes in the nucleus to mediate chromatin remodelling, resulting in reduced transcription of inflammatory cytokines. We now report that OspB can be added to the set of S. flexneri T3SS effectors required to modulate the innate immune response. T84 cells infected with a Delta ospB mutant resulted in reduced polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Tagged versions of OspB localized with endosomes and the nucleus. Further, T84 cells infected with the Delta ospB mutant showed increased levels of secreted IL-8 compared with wild-type infected cells. Both GST-OspB and GST-OspF coprecipitated retinoblastoma protein from host cell lysates. Because Delta ospB and Delta ospF mutants share similar phenotypes, and OspB and OspF share a host binding partner, we propose that OspB and OspF facilitate the remodelling of chromatin via interactions with retinoblastoma protein, resulting in diminished inflammatory cytokine production. The requirement of multiple T3SS effectors to modulate the innate immune response correlates to the complexity of the human immune system.	0
Abstract2class: Leinamycin biosynthesis revealing unprecedented architectural complexity for a hybrid polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase Abstract: A 135,638 bp DNA region that encompasses the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140. The boundaries of the lnm cluster were defined by systematic inactivation of open reading frames within the sequenced region. The lnm cluster spans 61.3 kb of DNA and consists of 27 genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS), hybrid NRPS-PKS, resistance, regulatory, and tailoring enzymes, as well as proteins of unknown function. A model for LNM biosynthesis is proposed, central to which is the LNM hybrid NRPS-PKS megasynthetase consisting of discrete (LnmQ and LnmP) and modular (LnmI) NRPS, acyltransferase-less PKS (LnmG, LnmI, and LnmJ), and PKS modules with unusual domain organization. These studies unveil an unprecedented architectural complexity for the LNM hybrid NRPS-PKS megasynthetase and set the stage to investigate the molecular basis for LNM biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Unveiling the CoA mediated salicylate catabolic mechanism in Rhizobium sp. X9 Abstract: Salicylate is a typical aromatic compound widely distributed in nature. Microbial degradation of salicylate has been well studied and salicylate hydroxylases play essential roles in linking the peripheral and ring-cleavage catabolic pathways. The direct hydroxylation of salicylate catalyzed by salicylate-1-hydroxylase or salicylate-5-hydroxylase has been well studied. However, the CoA mediated salicylate 5-hydroxylation pathway has not been characterized in detail. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of the reaction in the conversion of salicylate to gentisate in the carbaryl-degrading strain Rhizobium sp. X9. Three enzymes (salicylyl-CoA ligase CehG, salicylyl-CoA hydroxylase CehH and gentisyl-CoA thioesterase CehI) catalyzed the conversion of salicylate to gentisate via a route, including CoA thioester formation, hydroxylation and thioester hydrolysis. Further analysis indicated that genes cehGHI are also distributed in other bacteria from terrestrial environment and marine sediments. These genomic evidences highlight the role of this salicylate degradation pathway in the carbon cycle of soil organic compounds and marine sediments. Our findings of this three-step strategy enhanced the current understanding of CoA mediated degradation of salicylate.	0
Abstract2class: Sumoylation in Aspergillus nidulans: sumO inactivation, overexpression and live-cell imaging Abstract: Sumoylation, the reversible covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) peptides has emerged as an important regulator of target protein function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not in Schizosaccharyomes pombe, deletion of the gene encoding SUMO peptides is lethal. We have characterized the SUMO-encoding gene, sumO, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The sumO gene was deleted in a diploid and sumODelta haploids were recovered. The mutant was viable but exhibited impaired growth, reduced conidiation and self-sterility. Overexpression of epitope-tagged SumO peptides revealed multiple sumoylation targets in A. nidulans and SumO overexpression resulted in greatly increased levels of protein sumoylation without obvious phenotypic consequences. Using five-piece fusion PCR, we generated a gfp-sumO fusion gene expressed from the sumO promoter for live-cell imaging of GFP-SumO and GFP-SumO-conjugated proteins. Localization of GFP-SumO is dynamic, accumulating in punctate spots within the nucleus during interphase, lost at the onset of mitosis and re-accumulating during telophase.	0
Abstract2class: Activation modes in biocatalytic radical cyclization reactions Abstract: Radical cyclizations are essential reactions in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the chemical synthesis of societally valuable molecules. In this review, we highlight the general mechanisms utilized in biocatalytic radical cyclizations. We specifically highlight cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) involved in the biosynthesis of mycocyclosin and vancomycin, nonheme iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe/αKGDs) used in the biosynthesis of kainic acid, scopolamine, and isopenicillin N, and radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that facilitate the biosynthesis of oxetanocin A, menaquinone, and F420. Beyond natural mechanisms, we also examine repurposed flavin-dependent "ene"-reductases (ERED) for non-natural radical cyclization. Overall, these general mechanisms underscore the opportunity for enzymes to augment and enhance the synthesis of complex molecules using radical mechanisms.	0
Abstract2class: Efficient biosynthesis of nucleoside cytokinin angustmycin A containing an unusual sugar system Abstract: Angustmycin A has anti-mycobacterial and cytokinin activities, and contains an intriguing structure in which an unusual sugar with C5'-C6' dehydration is linked to adenine via an N-glycosidic bond. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of this molecule has long remained obscure. Here, we address angustmycin A biosynthesis by the full deciphering of its pathway. We demonstrate that AgmD, C, A, E, and B function as D-allulose 6-phosphate 3-epimerase, D-allulose 6-phosphate pyrophosphokinase, adenine phosphoallulosyltransferase, phosphoribohydrolase, and phosphatase, respectively, and that these collaboratively catalyze the relay reactions to biosynthesize angustmycin C. Additionally, we provide evidence that AgmF is a noncanonical dehydratase for the final step to angustmycin A via a self-sufficient strategy for cofactor recycling. Finally, we have reconstituted the entire six-enzyme pathway in vitro and in E. coli leading to angustmycin A production. These results expand the enzymatic repertoire regarding natural product biosynthesis, and also open the way for rational and rapid discovery of other angustmycin related antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Natural combinatorial peptide libraries in cyanobacterial symbionts of marine ascidians Abstract: A large family of cytotoxic cyclic peptides exemplified by the patellamides has been isolated from ascidians harboring the obligate cyanobacterial symbionts Prochloron spp.. Genome sequence analysis of these symbionts has revealed that Prochloron spp. synthesize patellamides by a ribosomal pathway. To understand how this pathway evolved to produce a suite of related metabolites, we analyzed 46 prochloron-containing ascidians from the tropical Pacific Ocean for the presence of patellamide biosynthetic genes and taxonomic markers. Here, we show that Prochloron spp. generate a diverse library of patellamides using small, hypervariable cassettes within a conserved genetic background. Each symbiont strain contains a single pathway, and mixtures of symbionts within ascidians lead to the accumulation of chemical libraries. We used this information to engineer the production of a new cyclic peptide in Escherichia coli, thereby demonstrating the power of comparative analysis of closely related symbiotic pathways to direct the genetic synthesis of new molecules.	1
Abstract2class: Quorum-Sensing Signals from Epibiont Mediate the Induction of Novel Microviridins in the Mat-Forming Cyanobacterial Genus Nostoc Abstract: The regulation of the production of oligopeptides is essential in understanding their ecological role in complex microbial communities, including harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The role of chemical communication between the cyanobacterium and the microbial community harbored as epibionts within its phycosphere is at an initial stage of research, and little is understood about its specificity. Here, we present insight into the role of a bacterial epibiont in regulating the production of novel microviridins isolated from Nostoc, an ecologically important cyanobacterial genus. Microviridins are well-known elastase inhibitors with presumed antigrazing effects. Heterologous expression and identification of specific signal molecules from the epibiont suggest the role of a quorum-sensing-based interaction. Furthermore, physiological experiments show an increase in microviridin production without affecting cyanobacterial growth and photosynthetic activity. Simultaneously, oligopeptides presenting a selective inhibition pattern provide support for their specific function in response to the presence of cohabitant epibionts. Thus, the chemical interaction revealed in our study provides an example of an interspecies signaling pathway monitoring the bacterial flora around the cyanobacterial filaments and the induction of intrinsic species-specific metabolic responses. IMPORTANCE The regulation of the production of cyanopeptides beyond microcystin is essential to understand their ecological role in complex microbial communities, e.g., harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The role of chemical communication between the cyanobacterium and the epibionts within its phycosphere is at an initial stage of research, and little is understood about its specificity. The frequency of cyanopeptide occurrence also demonstrates the need to understand the contribution of cyanobacterial peptides to the overall biological impact of cyanopeptides on aquatic organisms and vertebrates, including humans. Our results shed light on the epibiont control of microviridin production via quorum-sensing mechanisms, and we posit that such mechanisms may be widespread in natural cyanobacterial bloom community regulation.	1
Abstract2class: Adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid dynamics underlie mammary gland remodeling after lactation Abstract: Adipocytes undergo pronounced changes in size and behavior to support diverse tissue functions, but the mechanisms that control these changes are not well understood. Mammary gland-associated white adipose tissue (mgWAT) regresses in support of milk fat production during lactation and expands during the subsequent involution of milk-producing epithelial cells, providing one of the most marked physiological examples of adipose growth. We examined cellular mechanisms and functional implications of adipocyte and lipid dynamics in the mouse mammary gland (MG). Using in vivo analysis of adipocyte precursors and genetic tracing of mature adipocytes, we find mature adipocyte hypertrophy to be a primary mechanism of mgWAT expansion during involution. Lipid tracking and lipidomics demonstrate that adipocytes fill with epithelial-derived milk lipid. Furthermore, ablation of mgWAT during involution reveals an essential role for adipocytes in milk trafficking from, and proper restructuring of, the mammary epithelium. This work advances our understanding of MG remodeling and tissue-specific roles for adipocytes.	0
Abstract2class: Antibacterial Paramagnetic Quinones from Actinoallomurus Abstract: Four metabolites, designated paramagnetoquinone A, B, C, and D (1-4), were isolated from three strains belonging to the actinomycete genus Actinoallomurus. Compounds 1 and 2 showed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values lower than 0.015 μg/mL against Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Since compounds 1 and 2 were NMR-silent due to the presence of an oxygen radical, structure elucidation was achieved through a combination of derivatizations, oxidations, and analysis of 13C-labeled compounds. The paramagnetoquinones share the same carbon scaffold as tetracenomycin but carry two quinones and a five-membered lactone fused to the aromatic system. Compounds 2 and 1 are identical except for an unprecedented replacement of a methoxy in 2 by a methylamino group in 1. Related compounds devoid of methyl group(s) and of antibacterial activity were isolated from a different Actinoallomurus strain. The likely pmq biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from strain ID145113. While the cluster encodes many of the expected enzymes involved in the formation of aromatic polyketides, it also encodes a dedicated ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and an unusual acyl carrier protein transacylase, suggesting that an unusual starter unit might prime the polyketide synthase.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of thuggacins in myxobacteria: comparative cluster analysis reveals basis for natural product structural diversity Abstract: The thuggacins are macrolide antibiotics that are active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Distinct variants of these structures are produced by the myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum So ce895 and Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, which differ in side chain structure and modification by hydroxylation. We report here a comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters in these strains, which reveals the mechanistic basis for this architectural diversity. Although the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide cores of the molecules are highly similar, the underlying biosynthetic machineries exhibit an unexpected degree of divergence. Furthermore, the S. cellulosum gene cluster contains a crotonyl-CoA reductase (CCR) homolog not present in C. crocatus, which likely participates in assembling the unusual hexyl side chain of the So ce895 thuggacins, whereas the distinct hydroxylation pattern may result from variable action of a conserved FMN-dependent monooxygenase. Indeed, inactivation of the monooxygenase gene in C. crocatus resulted in production of both mono- and di-deshydroxy thuggacin derivatives, providing direct evidence for the role of this enzyme in the pathway. Finally, integration of a Tn5-derived npt promotor upstream of the thuggacin cluster in C. crocatus led to a significant increase in thuggacin production.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the gene cluster CYP264B1-geoA from Sorangium cellulosum So ce56: biosynthesis of (+)-eremophilene and its hydroxylation Abstract: Terpenoids can be found in almost all forms of life; however, the biosynthesis of bacterial terpenoids has not been intensively studied. This study reports the identification and functional characterization of the gene cluster CYP264B1-geoA from Sorangium cellulosum So ce56. Expression of the enzymes and synthesis of their products for NMR analysis and X-ray diffraction were carried out by employing an Escherichia coli whole-cell conversion system that provides the geoA substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate through simultaneous overexpression of the mevalonate pathway genes. The geoA product was identified as a novel sesquiterpene, and assigned NMR signals unambiguously proved that geoA is an (+)-eremophilene synthase. The very tight binding of (+)-eremophilene (∼0.40 μM), which is also available in S. cellulosum So ce56, and its oxidation by CYP264B1 suggest that the CYP264B1-geoA gene cluster is required for the biosynthesis of (+)-eremophilene derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Domoic acid biosynthesis in the red alga Chondria armata suggests a complex evolutionary history for toxin production Abstract: Domoic acid (DA), the causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning, is produced by select organisms within two distantly related algal clades: planktonic diatoms and red macroalgae. The biosynthetic pathway to isodomoic acid A was recently solved in the harmful algal bloom-forming diatom Pseudonitzschia multiseries, establishing the genetic basis for the global production of this potent neurotoxin. Herein, we sequenced the 507-Mb genome of Chondria armata, the red macroalgal seaweed from which DA was first isolated in the 1950s, identifying several copies of the red algal DA (rad) biosynthetic gene cluster. The rad genes are organized similarly to the diatom DA biosynthesis cluster in terms of gene synteny, including a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme critical to DA production that is notably absent in red algae that produce the simpler kainoid neurochemical, kainic acid. The biochemical characterization of the N-prenyltransferase (RadA) and kainoid synthase (RadC) enzymes support a slightly altered DA biosynthetic model in C. armata via the congener isodomoic acid B, with RadC behaving more like the homologous diatom enzyme despite higher amino acid similarity to red algal kainic acid synthesis enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis of the rad genes suggests unique origins for the red macroalgal and diatom genes in their respective hosts, with native eukaryotic CYP450 neofunctionalization combining with the horizontal gene transfer of N-prenyltransferases and kainoid synthases to establish DA production within the algal lineages.	1
Abstract2class: Involvement of β-Alkylation Machinery and Two Sets of Ketosynthase-Chain-Length Factors in the Biosynthesis of Fogacin Polyketides in Actinoplanes missouriensis Abstract: Fogacin and two novel fogacin derivatives, fogacins B and C, were isolated from the rare actinomycete Actinoplanes missouriensis. Biosynthesis of fogacin C apparently requires β alkylation of a polyketide chain. The fogacin biosynthetic type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster contains a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HCS) cassette, which is usually responsible for β alkylation in the type I PKS system. Another characteristic of the fog cluster is that it encodes two sets of ketosynthase (KS) and chain-length factor (CLF). Inactivation of either of the two KS genes in A. missouriensis and heterologous expression of the HCS cassette with either of the two KS-CLF genes in Streptomyces albus indicated that each KS-CLF had a different starter substrate specificity: one preferred an unusual β-alkylated starter and the other preferred a normal acetyl starter. This study expands knowledge of HCS cassette-dependent β alkylation into the type II PKS system and provides a natural example of combinatorial biosynthesis for producing diverse polyketides from different starter substrates.	1
Abstract2class: Mechanism of the Zn(II)Phthalocyanines' Photochemical Reactions Depending on the Number of Substituents and Geometry Abstract: In this work, the synthesis and the nonlinear absorption and population dynamics investigation of a series of zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) dissolved in chloroform are reported. In order to determine the relevant spectroscopic parameters, such as absorption cross-sections of singlet and triplet excited states, fluorescence relaxation times, intersystem crossing, radiative decay and internal conversion, different optical and spectroscopic techniques were used. By single pulse and pulse train Z-scan techniques, respectively, singlet and triplet excited states' absorption cross-section were determined at 532 nm. Furthermore, the intersystem crossing time was obtained by using both techniques combined with the fluorescence lifetime determined by time-resolved fluorescence. The radiative and internal conversion rates were determined from the fluorescence quantum yield of the samples. Such spectroscopy parameters are fundamental for selecting photosensitizers used in photodynamic therapy, as well as for many other applications.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of Axially Chiral 2,2'-Bisphosphobiarenes via a Nickel-Catalyzed Asymmetric Ullmann Coupling: General Access to Privileged Chiral Ligands without Optical Resolution Abstract: We report an asymmetric homocoupling of ortho-(iodo)arylphosphine oxides and ortho-(iodo)arylphosphonates resulting in highly enantioenriched axially chiral bisphosphine oxides and bisphosphonates. These products are readily converted to enantioenriched biaryl bisphosphines without need for chiral auxiliaries or optical resolution. This provides a practical route for the development of previously uninvestigated atroposelective biaryl bisphosphine ligands. The conditions have also proven effective for asymmetric dimerization of other, non-phosphorus-containing aryl halides.	0
Abstract2class: Growth of Toxoplasma gondii is inhibited by aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase Abstract: Aryloxyphenoxypropionates, inhibitors of the plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of grasses, also inhibit Toxoplasma gondii ACC. Clodinafop, the most effective of the herbicides tested, inhibits growth of T. gondii in human fibroblasts by 70% at 10 microM in 2 days and effectively eliminates the parasite in 2-4 days at 10-100 microM. Clodinafop is not toxic to the host cell even at much higher concentrations. Parasite growth inhibition by different herbicides is correlated with their ability to inhibit ACC enzyme activity, suggesting that ACC is a target for these agents. Fragments of genes encoding the biotin carboxylase domain of multidomain ACCs of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium knowlesi, and Cryptosporidium parvum were sequenced. One T. gondii ACC (ACC1) amino acid sequence clusters with P. falciparum ACC, P. knowlesi ACC, and the putative Cyclotella cryptica chloroplast ACC. Another sequence (ACC2) clusters with that of C. parvum ACC, probably the cytosolic form.	0
Abstract2class: A free-standing condensation enzyme catalyzing ester bond formation in C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) catalyze the biosynthesis of many biologically active peptides and typically are modular, with each extension module minimally consisting of a condensation, an adenylation, and a peptidyl carrier protein domain responsible for incorporation of an amino acid into the growing peptide chain. C-1027 is a chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic whose enediyne chromophore consists of an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a benzoxazolinate, and a beta-amino acid moiety. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the activation and incorporation of the beta-amino acid moiety into C-1027 follows an NRPS mechanism whereby biosynthetic intermediates are tethered to the peptidyl carrier protein SgcC2. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of SgcC5, an NRPS condensation enzyme that catalyzes ester bond formation between the SgcC2-tethered (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine and (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, a mimic of the enediyne core. SgcC5 uses (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-SgcC2 as the donor substrate and exhibits regiospecificity for the C-2 hydroxyl group of the enediyne core mimic as the acceptor substrate. Remarkably, SgcC5 is also capable of catalyzing amide bond formation, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency, between (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-(S)-SgcC2 and (R)-2-amino-1-phenyl-1-ethanol, an alternative enediyne core mimic bearing an amine at its C-2 position. Thus, SgcC5 is capable of catalyzing both ester and amide bond formation, providing an evolutionary link between amide- and ester-forming condensation enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Mutacin II, a bactericidal antibiotic from Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Mutacin II is an antibiotic that is produced by group II Streptococcus mutans. It inhibits the growth of other streptococci as well as many other gram-positive microorganisms by a hitherto unknown mechanism. Mutacin II possess bactericidal activity against susceptible cells. It transiently depolarizes the transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi) and the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH) and partially inhibits amino acid transport. However, it rapidly depletes the intracellular ATP pool in glucose-energized cells and prevents the generation of ATP. It is concluded that mutacin II does not belong to the group of pore-forming antibiotics (type A) or to the type B antibiotics, which inhibit phospholipases or interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Mutacin II acts by inhibiting essential enzyme functions at the level of metabolic energy generation, an activity that has not yet been classified for antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Highly Selective Cascade C-C Bond Formation via Palladium- Catalyzed Oxidative Carbonylation-Carbocyclization-Carbonylation-Alkynylation of Enallenes Abstract: A highly efficient palladium-catalyzed oxidative cascade reaction of enallenes undergoing overall four C-C bond formations has been developed. The insertion cascade proceeds via carbonylation-carbocyclization-carbonylation-alkynylation involving sequential insertion of carbon monoxide, olefin, and carbon monoxide. Furthermore, different types of terminal alkynes and functionalized enallenes have been investigated and found to undergo the cascade reaction under mild reaction conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Conformational Behaviour of Azasugars Based on Mannuronic Acid Abstract: A set of mannuronic-acid-based iminosugars, consisting of the C-5-carboxylic acid, methyl ester and amide analogues of 1deoxymannorjirimicin (DMJ), was synthesised and their pH-dependent conformational behaviour was studied. Under acidic conditions the methyl ester and the carboxylic acid adopted an "inverted" 1 C4 chair conformation as opposed to the "normal" 4 C1 chair at basic pH. This conformational change is explained in terms of the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents and it parallels the behaviour of the mannuronic acid ester oxocarbenium ion. Because of this solution-phase behaviour, the mannuronic acid ester azasugar was examined as an inhibitor for a Caulobacter GH47 mannosidase that hydrolyses its substrates by way of a reaction itinerary that proceeds through a 3 H4 transition state. No binding was observed for the mannuronic acid ester azasugar, but sub-atomic resolution data were obtained for the DMJ⋅CkGH47 complex, showing two conformations-3 S1 and 1 C4 -for the DMJ inhibitor.	0
Abstract2class: Nonlinear shear viscosity and long time tails Abstract: A theoretical connection between nonlinear shear viscosity and the long time tail of the equilibrium stress-stress correlation function is pointed out. The connection is a consequence of the Goddard-Miller rheological equation of state which takes into account the angular rotation of a fluid in steady uniform shear.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida type IV pilus Abstract: Francisella tularensis causes the disease tularaemia. Type IV pili (Tfp) genes are present in the genomes of all F. tularensis subspecies. We show that the wild-type F. tularensis subsp. novicida expresses pilus fibres on its surface, and mutations in the Tfp genes pilF and pilT disrupt pilus biogenesis. Mutations in other Tfp genes (pilQ and pilG) do not eliminate pilus expression. A mutation in pilE4 eliminates pilus expression, whereas mutations in the other pilin subunits pilE1-3 and pilE5 do not, suggesting that pilE4 is the major pilus structural subunit. The virulence regulator MglA is required for pilus expression, and it regulates the transcription of a putative Tfp glycosylation gene (FTN0431). However, MglA does not regulate transcription of pilF, pilT or pilE4, and a strain lacking FTN0431 still expresses pili; thus, it is unclear how MglA regulates pilus expression. Only pilF was also required for protein secretion, while pilE4 and pilT were not, indicating that there is very little overlap of the protein secretion/Tfp functions of the pil genes. The protein secretion component pilE1 was more important for in vitro intramacrophage growth and mouse virulence than the Tfp component pilE4. Our results provide the first genetic characterization of the novel Tfp system of F. tularensis.	0
Abstract2class: Application of an Acyl-CoA Ligase from Streptomyces aizunensis for Lactam Biosynthesis Abstract: ε-Caprolactam and δ-valerolactam are important commodity chemicals used in the manufacture of nylons, with millions of tons produced annually. Biological production of these highly valued chemicals has been limited due to a lack of enzymes that cyclize ω-amino fatty acid precursors to corresponding lactams under ambient conditions. In this study, we demonstrated production of these chemicals using ORF26, an acyl-CoA ligase involved in the biosynthesis of ECO-02301 in Streptomyces aizunensis. This enzyme has a broad substrate spectrum and can cyclize 4-aminobutyric acid into γ-butyrolactam, 5-aminovaleric acid into δ-valerolactam and 6-aminocaproic acid into ε-caprolactam. Recombinant E. coli expressing ORF26 produced valerolactam and caprolactam when 5-aminovaleric acid and 6-aminocaproic acid were added to the culture medium. Upon coexpressing ORF26 with a metabolic pathway that produced 5-aminovaleric acid from lysine, we were able to demonstrate production of δ-valerolactam from lysine.	0
Abstract2class: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei: characterization of the enzyme, cloning and sequencing of the gene, and expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei (optimal growth temperature, 100 to 103 degrees C) was purified to homogeneity. This enzyme was strictly phosphate dependent, utilized either NAD+ or NADP+, and was insensitive to pentalenolactone like the enzyme from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanothermus fervidus. The enzyme exhibited a considerable thermostability, with a 44-min half-life at 100 degrees C. The amino acid sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from P. woesei was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the coding gene. Compared with the enzyme homologs from mesophilic archaebacteria (Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanobacterium formicicum) and an extremely thermophilic archaebacterium (Methanothermus fervidus), the primary structure of the P. woesei enzyme exhibited a strikingly high proportion of aromatic amino acid residues and a low proportion of sulfur-containing residues. The coding gene of P. woesei was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, thus providing an ideal basis for detailed structural and functional studies of that enzyme.	0

Abstract2class: Dual-Color Optical Recording of Bioelectric Potentials by Polymer Electrochromism Abstract: Optical recording based on voltage-sensitive fluorescent reporters allows for spatial flexibility of measuring from desired cells, but photobleaching and phototoxicity of the fluorescent labels often limit their sensitivity and recording duration. Voltage-dependent optical absorption, rather than fluorescence, of electrochromic materials, would overcome these limitations to achieve long-term optical recording of bioelectrical signals. Electrochromic materials such as PEDOT:PSS possess the property that an applied voltage can either increase or decrease the light absorption depending on the wavelength. In this work, we harness this anticorrelated light absorption at two different wavelengths to significantly improve the signal detection. With dual-color detection, electrical activity from cells produces signals of opposite polarity, while artifacts, mechanical motions, and technical noises are uncorrelated or positively correlated. Using this technique, we are able to optically record cardiac action potentials with a high signal-to-noise ratio, 10 kHz sampling rate, >15 min recording duration, and no time-dependent degradation of the signal. Furthermore, we can reliably perform multiple recording sessions from the same culture for over 25 days.	0
Abstract2class: Geographic Impact on Genomic Divergence as Revealed by Comparison of Nine Citromicrobial Genomes Abstract: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPB) are thought to be important players in oceanic carbon and energy cycling in the euphotic zone of the ocean. The genus Citromicrobium, widely found in oligotrophic oceans, is a member of marine alphaproteobacterial AAPB. Nine Citromicrobium strains isolated from the South China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, or the tropical South Atlantic Ocean were found to harbor identical 16S rRNA sequences. The sequencing of their genomes revealed high synteny in major regions. Nine genetic islands (GIs) involved mainly in type IV secretion systems, flagellar biosynthesis, prophage, and integrative conjugative elements, were identified by a fine-scale comparative genomics analysis. These GIs played significant roles in genomic evolution and divergence. Interestingly, the coexistence of two different photosynthetic gene clusters (PGCs) was not only found in the analyzed genomes but also confirmed, for the first time, to our knowledge, in environmental samples. The prevalence of the coexistence of two different PGCs may suggest an adaptation mechanism for Citromicrobium members to survive in the oceans. Comparison of genomic characteristics (e.g., GIs, average nucleotide identity [ANI], single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], and phylogeny) revealed that strains within a marine region shared a similar evolutionary history that was distinct from that of strains isolated from other regions (South China Sea versus Mediterranean Sea). Geographic differences are partly responsible for driving the observed genomic divergences and allow microbes to evolve through local adaptation. Three Citromicrobium strains isolated from the Mediterranean Sea diverged millions of years ago from other strains and evolved into a novel group.                  Importance:                       Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are a widespread functional group in the upper ocean, and their abundance could be up to 15% of the total heterotrophic bacteria. To date, a great number of studies display AAPB biogeographic distribution patterns in the ocean; however, little is understood about the geographic isolation impact on the genome divergence of marine AAPB. In this study, we compare nine Citromicrobium genomes of strains that have identical 16S rRNA sequences but different ocean origins. Our results reveal that strains isolated from the same marine region share a similar evolutionary history that is distinct from that of strains isolated from other regions. These Citromicrobium strains diverged millions of years ago. In addition, the coexistence of two different PGCs is prevalent in the analyzed genomes and in environmental samples.	0
Abstract2class: Redundant synthesis of a conidial polyketide by two distinct secondary metabolite clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Filamentous fungi are renowned for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Typically, one distinct metabolite is generated from a specific secondary metabolite cluster. Here, we characterize the newly described trypacidin (tpc) cluster in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that this cluster as well as the previously characterized endocrocin (enc) cluster both contribute to the production of the spore metabolite endocrocin. Whereas trypacidin is eliminated when only tpc cluster genes are deleted, endocrocin production is only eliminated when both the tpc and enc non-reducing polyketide synthase-encoding genes, tpcC and encA, respectively, are deleted. EncC, an anthrone oxidase, converts the product released from EncA to endocrocin as a final product. In contrast, endocrocin synthesis by the tpc cluster likely results from incomplete catalysis by TpcK (a putative decarboxylase), as its deletion results in a nearly 10-fold increase in endocrocin production. We suggest endocrocin is likely a shunt product in all related non-reducing polyketide synthase clusters containing homologues of TpcK and TpcL (a putative anthrone oxidase), e.g. geodin and monodictyphenone. This finding represents an unusual example of two physically discrete secondary metabolite clusters generating the same natural product in one fungal species by distinct routes.	1
Abstract2class: Genome sequence of the bacterium Streptomyces davawensis JCM 4913 and heterologous production of the unique antibiotic roseoflavin Abstract: Streptomyces davawensis JCM 4913 synthesizes the antibiotic roseoflavin, a structural riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) analog. Here, we report the 9,466,619-bp linear chromosome of S. davawensis JCM 4913 and a 89,331-bp linear plasmid. The sequence has an average G+C content of 70.58% and contains six rRNA operons (16S-23S-5S) and 69 tRNA genes. The 8,616 predicted protein-coding sequences include 32 clusters coding for secondary metabolites, several of which are unique to S. davawensis. The chromosome contains long terminal inverted repeats of 33,255 bp each and atypical telomeres. Sequence analysis with regard to riboflavin biosynthesis revealed three different patterns of gene organization in Streptomyces species. Heterologous expression of a set of genes present on a subgenomic fragment of S. davawensis resulted in the production of roseoflavin by the host Streptomyces coelicolor M1152. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that S. davawensis is a close relative of Streptomyces cinnabarinus, and much to our surprise, we found that the latter bacterium is a roseoflavin producer as well.	1
Abstract2class: "FlashMap" - A Semi-Automatic Tool for Rapid and Accurate Spatial Analysis of Marker Expression in the Subventricular Zone Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a region of ongoing postnatal germinal activity that shows complex spatial heterogeneity. For instance, different SVZ microdomains contain neural stem cells that express distinct transcription factors and generate different glial and neuronal progenies. These unique characteristics call for the development of new methods to integrate a spatial dimension to histological analyses performed in this germinal region. We developed "FlashMap", a semi-automatic software that allows the segmentation and rapid measurement of optical densities throughout the full SVZ coordinates. "FlashMap" generates easily readable two-dimensional heatmaps that can be superimposed onto three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricular system for optimal spatial exploration. Accurate heatmaps can be obtained, even following serial section subsampling thereby reducing the amount of tissue and time required for histological analysis. We first illustrate the potential of "FlashMap" by spatially exploring the correlation of SVZ thickness and cellular density with germinal activity throughout its rostro-caudal coordinates. We then used "FlashMap" to analyse the spatial expression of the transcription factors Dlx2, Tbr2 and Hopx as well as of the immature neuronal marker Dcx, to demonstrate the suitability of this approach to explore the regional production of cells of distinct lineages by defined SVZ microdomains.	0
Abstract2class: Role of AbrB in Spo0A- and Spo0B-dependent utilization of a sporulation promoter in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Transcription of the Bacillus subtilis gene spoVG is induced at the onset of sporulation and is dependent on the products of the stage-0 regulatory genes spo0A, spo0B, and spo0H. We show here that the dependence of spoVG transcription on Spo0A and Spo0B (but not Spo0H) can be bypassed by a mutation at abrB, a previously identified locus at which mutations that suppress some of the phenotypes of spo0A are often located, or by a cis-acting mutation within the spoVG promoter. To explain the epistatis of abrB to spo0A and spo0B mutations, we propose that AbrB acts, directly or indirectly, to block transcription of spoVG and that Spo0A and Spo0B cause inactivation of the abrB gene product(s). Spo0A-Spo0B-dependent inactivation of AbrB could be a general explanation for the pleiotropic effects of spo0A and spo0B mutations on B. subtilis gene expression.	0
Abstract2class: DNA-Catalyzed Amide Hydrolysis Abstract: DNA catalysts (deoxyribozymes) for a variety of reactions have been identified by in vitro selection. However, for certain reactions this identification has not been achieved. One important example is DNA-catalyzed amide hydrolysis, for which a previous selection experiment instead led to DNA-catalyzed DNA phosphodiester hydrolysis. Subsequent efforts in which the selection strategy deliberately avoided phosphodiester hydrolysis led to DNA-catalyzed ester and aromatic amide hydrolysis, but aliphatic amide hydrolysis has been elusive. In the present study, we show that including modified nucleotides that bear protein-like functional groups (any one of primary amino, carboxyl, or primary hydroxyl) enables identification of amide-hydrolyzing deoxyribozymes. In one case, the same deoxyribozyme sequence without the modifications still retains substantial catalytic activity. Overall, these findings establish the utility of introducing protein-like functional groups into deoxyribozymes for identifying new catalytic function. The results also suggest the longer-term feasibility of deoxyribozymes as artificial proteases.	0
Abstract2class: Controllable hydrogen sulfide donors and their activity against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), known as an important cellular signaling molecule, plays critical roles in many physiological and/or pathological processes. Modulation of H2S levels could have tremendous therapeutic value. However, the study on H2S has been hindered due to the lack of controllable H2S releasing agents that could mimic the slow and moderate H2S release in vivo. In this work we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a new class of controllable H2S donors. Twenty-five donors were prepared and tested. Their structures were based on a perthiol template, which was suggested to be involved in H2S biosynthesis. H2S release mechanism from these donors was studied and proved to be thiol-dependent. We also developed a series of cell-based assays to access their H2S-related activities. H9c2 cardiac myocytes were used in these experiments. We tested lead donors' cytotoxicity and confirmed their H2S production in cells. Finally we demonstrated that selected donors showed potent protective effects in an in vivo murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, through a H2S-related mechanism.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and Heterologous Expression of Cacaoidin, the First Member of the Lanthidin Family of RiPPs Abstract: Cacaoidin is produced by the strain Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360 and represents the first member of the new lanthidin (class V lanthipeptides) RiPP family. In this work, we describe the complete identification, cloning and heterologous expression of the cacaoidin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows unique RiPP genes whose functions were not predicted by any bioinformatic tool. We also describe that the cacaoidin pathway is restricted to strains of the subspecies Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi found in public genome databases, where we have also identified the presence of other putative class V lanthipeptide pathways. This is the first report on the heterologous production of a class V lanthipeptide.	1
Abstract2class: Bipartite interactions, antibiotic production and biosynthetic potential of the Arabidopsis leaf microbiome Abstract: Plants are colonized by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms that affect plant growth and health. Representative genome-sequenced culture collections of bacterial isolates from model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, have recently been established. These resources provide opportunities for systematic interaction screens combined with genome mining to discover uncharacterized natural products. Here, we report on the biosynthetic potential of 224 strains isolated from the A. thaliana phyllosphere. Genome mining identified more than 1,000 predicted natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), hundreds of which are unknown compared to the MIBiG database of characterized BGCs. For functional validation, we used a high-throughput screening approach to monitor over 50,000 binary strain combinations. We observed 725 inhibitory interactions, with 26 strains contributing to the majority of these. A combination of imaging mass spectrometry and bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most potent inhibitor, the BGC-rich Brevibacillus sp. Leaf182, revealed three distinct natural product scaffolds that contribute to the observed antibiotic activity. Moreover, a genome mining-based strategy led to the isolation of a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase-derived antibiotic, macrobrevin, which displays an unprecedented natural product structure. Our findings demonstrate that the phyllosphere is a valuable environment for the identification of antibiotics and natural products with unusual scaffolds.	1
Abstract2class: Cereulide synthetase gene cluster from emetic Bacillus cereus: structure and location on a mega virulence plasmid related to Bacillus anthracis toxin plasmid pXO1 Abstract: Background:                       Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that this toxin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), but its exact genetic organization and biochemical synthesis is unknown.                  Results:                       The complete sequence of the cereulide synthetase (ces) gene cluster, which encodes the enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of cereulide, was dissected. The 24 kb ces gene cluster comprises 7 CDSs and includes, besides the typical NRPS genes like a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and two CDSs encoding enzyme modules for the activation and incorporation of monomers in the growing peptide chain, a CDS encoding a putative hydrolase in the upstream region and an ABC transporter in the downstream part. The enzyme modules responsible for incorporation of the hydroxyl acids showed an unusual structure while the modules responsible for the activation of the amino acids Ala and Val showed the typical domain organization of NRPS. The ces gene locus is flanked by genetic regions with high homology to virulence plasmids of B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis. PFGE and Southern hybridization showed that the ces genes are restricted to emetic B. cereus and indeed located on a 208 kb megaplasmid, which has high similarities to pXO1-like plasmids.                  Conclusion:                       The ces gene cluster that is located on a pXO1-like virulence plasmid represents, beside the insecticidal and the anthrax toxins, a third type of B. cereus group toxins encoded on megaplasmids. The ces genes are restricted to emetic toxin producers, but pXO1-like plasmids are also present in emetic-like strains. These data might indicate the presence of an ancient plasmid in B. cereus which has acquired different virulence genes over time. Due to the unusual structure of the hydroxyl acid incorporating enzyme modules of Ces, substantial biochemical efforts will be required to dissect the complete biochemical pathway of cereulide synthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Localization of the ActIII actinorhodin polyketide ketoreductase to the cell wall Abstract: Structurally diverse polyketides provide a rich reservoir of bioactive molecules. Actinorhodin, a model aromatic polyketide, is synthesized by minimal type II polyketide synthase and tailoring enzymes. The ActIII actinorhodin ketoreductase is a key tailoring enzyme in actinorhodin biosynthesis. With purified antibodies against actinorhodin polyketide synthase alpha subunit (KSalpha) and ketoreductase, we conducted systematic localization experiments of the two proteins in Streptomyces coelicolor subproteomes. The results support the membrane location of KSalpha and cell-wall location of ketoreductase. Considering previous evidence that some other tailoring enzymes of actinorhodin biosynthesis may be located outside the cytoplasm, a picture is emerging of an extensive role for extracellular biochemistry in the synthesis of type II polyketide antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Total synthesis of natural (+)- [corrected] and ent-(-)-4-desacetoxy-6,7-dihydrovindorosine [corrected] and natural and ent-minovine: oxadiazole tandem intramolecular Diels-Alder/1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction Abstract: Efficient and unusually concise total syntheses of both enantiomers of the Aspidosperma alkaloids 4-desacetoxy-6,7-dihydrovindorosine (12) and minovine (1) are detailed. A tandem intramolecular Diels-Alder/1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of the 1,3,4-oxadiazole 8, in which three new rings, four new C-C bonds, and five stereocenters are formed, is a key step in the sequence. The availability of optically active material permitted an assessment of the enantiomeric integrity of minovine and the source of its reported unusual optical rotation. [Reaction: see text]	0
Abstract2class: Trypsin mediates growth phase-dependent transcriptional tegulation of genes involved in biosynthesis of ruminococcin A, a lantibiotic produced by a Ruminococcus gnavus strain from a human intestinal microbiota Abstract: Ruminococcin A (RumA) is a trypsin-dependent lantibiotic produced by Ruminococcus gnavus E1, a gram-positive strict anaerobic strain isolated from a human intestinal microbiota. A 12.8-kb region from R. gnavus E1 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of RumA, has been cloned and sequenced. It consisted of 13 open reading frames, organized in three operons with predicted functions in lantibiotic biosynthesis, signal transduction regulation, and immunity. One unusual feature of the locus is the presence of three almost identical structural genes, all of them encoding the RumA precursor. In order to determine the role of trypsin in RumA production, the transcription of the rum genes has been investigated under inducing and noninducing conditions. Trypsin activity is needed for the growth phase-dependent transcriptional activation of RumA operons. Our results suggest that bacteriocin production by R. gnavus E1 is controlled through a complex signaling mechanism involving the proteolytic processing of a putative extracellular inducer-peptide by trypsin, a specific environmental cue of the digestive ecosystem.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the alnumycin gene cluster reveals unusual gene products for pyran ring formation and dioxan biosynthesis Abstract: Alnumycin is closely related to the benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) polyketides such as actinorhodin. Exceptional structural features include differences in aglycone tailoring that result in the unique alnumycin chromophore and the existence of an unusual 4-hydroxymethyl-5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxan moiety. Cloning and sequencing of the alnumycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. CM020 revealed expected biosynthesis genes for polyketide assembly, but several genes encoding subsequent tailoring enzymes were highly atypical. Heterologous expression studies confirmed that all of the genes required for alnumycin biosynthesis resided within the sequenced clone. Inactivation of genes aln4 and aln5 showed that the mechanism of pyran ring formation differs from actinorhodin and granaticin pathways. Further inactivation studies identified two genes, alnA and alnB, involved in the synthesis and attachment of the dioxan moiety, and resulted in the production of the polyketide prealnumycin.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for maklamicin, a spirotetronate-class antibiotic of the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955 Abstract: Maklamicin, which is produced by the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955, is a spirotetronate-class antibiotic possessing anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and has several unique structural features different from other spirotetronates. Here we describe identification and characterization of the maklamicin biosynthetic (mak) gene cluster through draft genome sequencing, genomic library screening, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis revealed that a plausible maklamicin cluster resides in a 152 kb DNA region encoding 46 open reading frames, 24 of which can be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of polyketide backbone, spirotetronate or peripheral moieties, self-resistance and the regulation of maklamicin production. Disruption of the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes makA1 or makA4 resulted in a complete loss of maklamicin production, indicating that the type I modular PKS system is responsible for the biosynthesis of maklamicin. The mak gene cluster contained a set of biosynthetic genes for the formation of a tetronate moiety, which were found to be highly conserved in the gene clusters for spirotetronate antibiotics. Based on the estimated biosynthetic genes, we propose the biosynthetic pathway for maklamicin. Our findings provide not only insights on the biosynthetic mechanism of the unique structures in maklamicin, but also useful information to facilitate a comparative analysis of the spirotetronate biosynthetic pathways to expand the structural repertoire.	1
Abstract2class: Precise Formation of a Hollow Carbon Nitride Structure with a Janus Surface To Promote Water Splitting by Photoredox Catalysis Abstract: The precise modification of redox species on the inner and outer surfaces of hollow nanostructures is relevant in catalysis, surface science, and nanotechnology, but has proven difficult to achieve. Herein, we develop a facile approach to specifically fabricate Pt and Co3 O4 nanoparticles (NPs) onto the interior and exterior surface of hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNS), respectively, to promote the surface redox functions of the polymer semiconductors. The photocatalytic water splitting activities of HCNS with spatially separated oxidation and reduction centers at their nanodomains were enhanced. The origin of the enhanced activity was attributed to the spatially separated reactive sites for the evolution of H2 and O2 and also to the unidirectional migration of the electron and hole on the Janus surfaces, thereby preventing the unwanted reverse reaction of water splitting and decreasing charge recombination.	0
Abstract2class: Ionic liquid-tolerant microorganisms and microbial communities for lignocellulose conversion to bioproducts Abstract: Chemical and physical pretreatment of biomass is a critical step in the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels and bioproducts. Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment has attracted significant attention due to the unique ability of certain ILs to solubilize some or all components of the plant cell wall. However, these ILs inhibit not only the enzyme activities but also the growth and productivity of microorganisms used in downstream hydrolysis and fermentation processes. While pretreated biomass can be washed to remove residual IL and reduce inhibition, extensive washing is costly and not feasible in large-scale processes. IL-tolerant microorganisms and microbial communities have been discovered from environmental samples and studies begun to elucidate mechanisms of IL tolerance. The discovery of IL tolerance in environmental microbial communities and individual microbes has lead to the proposal of molecular mechanisms of resistance. In this article, we review recent progress on discovering IL-tolerant microorganisms, identifying metabolic pathways and mechanisms of tolerance, and engineering microorganisms for IL tolerance. Research in these areas will yield new approaches to overcome inhibition in lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion processes and increase opportunities for the use of ILs in biomass pretreatment.	0
Abstract2class: Investigations into the Biosynthesis, Regulation, and Self-Resistance of Toxoflavin in Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 Abstract: Pseudomonas spp. are prolific producers of natural products from many structural classes. Here we show that the soil bacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 is capable of producing trace levels of the triazine natural product toxoflavin (1) under microaerobic conditions. We evaluated toxoflavin production by derivatives of Pf-5 with deletions in specific biosynthesis genes, which led us to propose a revised biosynthetic pathway for toxoflavin that shares the first two steps with riboflavin biosynthesis. We also report that toxM, which is not present in the well-characterized cluster of Burkholderia glumae, encodes a monooxygenase that degrades toxoflavin. The toxoflavin degradation product of ToxM is identical to that of TflA, the toxoflavin lyase from Paenibacillus polymyxa. Toxoflavin production by P. protegens causes inhibition of several plant-pathogenic bacteria, and introduction of toxM into the toxoflavin-sensitive strain Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 results in resistance to toxoflavin.	1
Abstract2class: FACS-based selection of tandem tetracysteine peptides with improved ReAsH brightness in live cells Abstract: Non-perturbing and site-specific in vivo protein labeling methods are highly desired as they allow researchers to probe complex cellular functions. The biarsenical/tetracysteine labeling system allows in situ fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins which have been appended with small (12 amino acids) genetically encoded peptide tags. In this work we present the in vivo selection of semi-randomized tandem tetracysteine peptides with improved biarsenical (ReAsH) fluorescent brightness (~2-fold) relative to a single tetracysteine motif or rationally designed 3-fold tetracysteine repeat. We found that Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting by direct ReAsH excitation as opposed to FRET-mediated ReAsH excitation was optimal for selecting 3×Tetracysteine peptides with enhanced brightness. The selected multimer-tetracysteine peptides display enhanced properties due to higher order ReAsH/3×Tetracysteine dye stoichiometries as opposed to enhancement of the individual core tetracysteine photophysical properties. In summary, we have isolated new 3×Tetracysteine motifs with improved ReAsH brightness in live cells. These modular tags should provide enhanced contrast for live cell imaging applications where small tag size (~4.8 KDa) is a requisite for protein labeling.	0
Abstract2class: Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalyzed Ring-Opening of Aryl Cyclopropanes to 1-Aroyloxylated-3-Acylated Alkanes Abstract: Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring-opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3-difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor-acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal-free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.	0
Abstract2class: Unusual chemistry in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic chondrochlorens Abstract: The antibiotic chondrochlorens A and B from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 incorporate several unusual structural features, notable among them a shared chloro-hydroxy-styryl functionality and the ethoxy group of chondrochloren B. Our analysis of the chondrochloren gene cluster by targeted gene inactivation coupled with assays in vitro has shed significant light on the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Chlorination of tyrosine occurs early in the pathway, likely on a peptidyl carrier protein-bound intermediate, whereas decarboxylation to the styryl moiety appears to be accomplished by an unprecedented oxidative decarboxylase. We also show that the chondrochloren B ethoxy group arises from initial incorporation by the polyketide synthase of hydroxy malonate as an extender unit, methylation in cis by an O-methyltransferase, followed by a second methylation. This report therefore constitutes a direct demonstration of the involvement of a radical S-adenosylmethionine methylase in bacterial secondary metabolism.	1
Abstract2class: A Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutation impairs the ORC1-nucleosome association Abstract: Recent studies have identified several genetic mutations within the BAH domain of human Origin Recognition Complex subunit 1 (hORC1BAH), including the R105Q mutation, implicated in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). However, the pathological role of the hORC1 R105Q mutation remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated the interactions of the hORC1BAH domain with histone H4K20me2, DNA, and the nucleosome core particle labeled with H4Kc20me2, a chemical analog of H4K20me2. Our study revealed a nucleosomal DNA binding site for hORC1BAH. The R105Q mutation reduces the hORC1BAH-DNA binding affinity, leading to impaired hORC1BAH-nucleosome interaction, which likely influences DNA replication initiation and MGS pathogenesis. This study provides an etiologic link between the hORC1 R105Q mutation and MGS.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a novel two-peptide lantibiotic, haloduracin, produced by the alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans C-125 Abstract: Complete genome sequencing of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans C-125 revealed the presence of several genes homologous to those involved in the production of lantibiotic peptides. Additional bioinformatic analysis identified a total of eleven genes, spanning a 15 kbp region, potentially involved in the production, modification, immunity and transport of a two-peptide lantibiotic. Having established that strain C-125 exhibited antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, it was demonstrated through peptide purification, MS and site-directed mutagenesis that this activity was indeed attributable to the production of a lantibiotic encoded by these genes. This antimicrobial has been designated haloduracin and represents the first occasion wherein production of two-peptide lantibiotic has been associated with a Bacillus sp. It is also the first example of a lantibiotic of any kind to be produced by an alkaliphilic species.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning, sequencing, analysis, and heterologous expression of the fredericamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Fredericamycin (FDM) A, a pentadecaketide featuring two sets of peri-hydroxy tricyclic aromatic moieties connected through a unique chiral spiro carbon center, exhibits potent cytotoxicity and has been studied as a new type of anticancer drug lead because of its novel molecular architecture. The fdm gene cluster was localized to 33-kb DNA segment of Streptomyces griseus ATCC 49344, and its involvement in FDM A biosynthesis was proven by gene inactivation, complementation, and heterologous expression experiments. The fdm cluster consists of 28 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) and tailoring enzymes as well as several regulatory and resistance proteins. The FDM PKS features a KSalpha subunit with heretofore unseen tandem cysteines at its active site, a KSbeta subunit that is distinct phylogenetically from KSbeta of hexa-, octa-, or decaketide PKSs, and a dedicated phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Further study of the FDM PKS could provide new insight into how a type II PKS controls chain length in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. The availability of the fdm genes, in vivo characterization of the fdm cluster in S. griseus, and heterologous expression of the fdm cluster in Streptomyces albus set the stage to investigate FDM A biosynthesis and engineer the FDM biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel FDM A analogues.	1
Abstract2class: Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, as a suppressor of the sepH mutation in Aspergillus nidulans, is required for the proper timing of septation Abstract: Timely cytokinesis/septation is essential for hyphal growth and conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans. Genetic analyses have identified that A. nidulans has components of the septum initiation network (SIN) pathway; one of these, SEPH, is a key player for early events during cytokinesis. However, little is known about how the SEPH kinase cascade is regulated by other components. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase family acts antagonistically against the SIN so that the downregulation of AnPRS family can bypass the requirements of the SIN for septum formation and conidiation. The transcription defect of the Anprs gene family accompanied with the reduction of AnPRS activity causes the formation of hyper-septation as well as the restoration of septation and conidiation in the absence of SEPH. Clearly, the timing and positioning of septation is related to AnPRS activity. Moreover, with the extensive yeast two-hybrid analysis and rescue combination experiments, it demonstrated that AnPRS members are able to form the heterodimers for functional interacting entities but they appear to contribute so unequally that Anprs1 mutant display relatively normal septation, but Anprs2 deletion is lethal. Thus, compared to in yeast, the AnPRS family may have a unique regulation mechanism during septation in filamentous fungi.	0
Abstract2class: A New Critical Conformational Determinant of Multidrug Efflux by an MFS Transporter Abstract: Secondary multidrug (Mdr) transporters utilize ion concentration gradients to actively remove antibiotics and other toxic compounds from cells. The model Mdr transporter MdfA from Escherichia coli exchanges dissimilar drugs for protons. The transporter should open at the cytoplasmic side to enable access of drugs into the Mdr recognition pocket. Here we show that the cytoplasmic rim around the Mdr recognition pocket represents a previously overlooked important regulatory determinant in MdfA. We demonstrate that increasing the positive charge of the electrically asymmetric rim dramatically inhibits MdfA activity and sometimes even leads to influx of planar, positively charged compounds, resulting in drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that unlike the mutants with the electrically modified rim, the membrane-embedded wild-type MdfA exhibits a significant probability of an inward-closed conformation, which is further increased by drug binding. Since MdfA binds drugs from its inward-facing environment, these results are intriguing and raise the possibility that the transporter has a sensitive, drug-induced conformational switch, which favors an inward-closed state.	0
Abstract2class: Daptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces roseosporus: cloning and analysis of the gene cluster and revision of peptide stereochemistry Abstract: Daptomycin is a 13 amino acid, cyclic lipopeptide produced by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanism in Streptomyces roseosporus. A 128 kb region of S. roseosporus DNA was cloned and verified by heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans to contain the daptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (dpt). The cloned region was completely sequenced and three genes (dptA, dptBC, dptD) encoding the three subunits of an NRPS were identified. The catalytic domains in the subunits, predicted to couple five, six or two amino acids, respectively, included a novel activation domain and amino-acid-binding pocket for incorporating the unusual amino acid l-kynurenine (Kyn), three types of condensation domains and an extra epimerase domain (E-domain) in the second module. Novel genes (dptE, dptF) whose products likely work in conjunction with a unique condensation domain to acylate the first amino acid, as well as other genes (dptI, dptJ) probably involved in supply of the non-proteinogenic amino acids l-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn, were located next to the NRPS genes. The unexpected E-domain suggested that daptomycin would have d-Asn, rather than l-Asn, as originally assigned, and this was confirmed by comparing stereospecific synthetic peptides and the natural product both chemically and microbiologically.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biosynthesis of a Cysteate-Containing Nonribosomal Peptide in Streptomyces lincolnensis Abstract: The species Streptomyces lincolnensis is known as a producer of lincomycin A, a clinically important lincosamide antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report that S. lincolnensis produces a new cysteate-containing lactone product, cysteoamide (1), which arises from nonribosomal peptide synthetase-programmed sequential assembly of the monomers phenylacetic acid, valine, cysteate, threonine, β-hydroxyleucine, and β-alanine and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form a lactone ring. The structure of 1 was determined by combined analysis of NMR and MS spectra, while the amino acid absolute configurations in 1 were assigned by Marfey's analysis following acid hydrolysis. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 was defined in the genome of S. lincolnensis by bioinformatics analysis and in vivo genetic study. In addition, in vitro assay revealed that OrfA, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent protein, is responsible for the formation of the unusual cysteate unit. Cysteate-containing nonribosomal peptides appear to be widely present in various Streptomyces strains, and this study generates interest in their intrinsic functions that remain poorly understood.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Ohmyungsamycin Biosynthetic Pathway and Generation of Derivatives with Improved Antituberculosis Activity Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptides ohmyungsamycin (OMS) A (1) and B (2), isolated from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SNJ042, contain two non-proteinogenic amino acid residues, β-hydroxy-l-phenylalanine (β-hydroxy-l-Phe) and 4-methoxy-l-tryptophan (4-methoxy-l-Trp). Draft genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. SNJ042 revealed the OMS biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene and three genes for amino acid modification. By gene inactivation and analysis of the accumulated products, we found that OhmL, encoding a P450 gene, is an l-Phe β-hydroxylase. Furthermore, OhmK, encoding a Trp 2,3-dioxygenase homolog, and OhmJ, encoding an O-methyltransferase, are suggested to be involved in hydroxylation and O-methylation reactions, respectively, in the biosynthesis of 4-methoxy-l-Trp. In addition, the antiproliferative and antituberculosis activities of the OMS derivatives dehydroxy-OMS A (4) and demethoxy-OMS A (6) obtained from the mutant strains were evaluated in vitro. Interestingly, dehydroxy-OMS A (4) displayed significantly improved antituberculosis activity and decreased cytotoxicity compared to wild-type OMS A.	1
Abstract2class: Reconstitution of the iterative type II polyketide synthase for tetracenomycin F2 biosynthesis Abstract: The tetracenomycin polyketide synthase (TCM PKS), a type II complex, produces TCM F2, a precursor of TCM C in Streptomyces glaucescens, and consists of at least the TcmK, -L, -M, and -N proteins. The TcmK/TcmL ketosynthase subunits were purified from overexpression of their genes in Streptomyces lividans. TcmK (calculated molecular mass 45 kd) and TcmL (calculated molecular mass 42 kd) function as a heterodimeric alphabeta complex based on observing that only the purified complex complemented TCM PKS activity in protein extracts made from strains bearing tcmK or tcmL deletion mutants to make TCM F2 in vitro, and that the molecular mass of the purified complex was 90 kd as estimated by gel filtration chromatography. The TCM PKS activity was reconstituted with purified protein components, indicating that the minimal set of proteins required to make TCM F2 included the ketosynthase complex (TcmKL), an acyl carrier protein (TcmM), a malonyl CoA:ACP acyltransferase (MAT), and a cyclase (TcmN). The MAT was required to catalyze the transacylation between malonyl-CoA and TcmM, although a relatively slow spontaneous transacylation also occurred in a reaction without the MAT. Acetyl-CoA, the proposed starter unit for the TCM PKS, was not required for the production of TCM F2 in vitro, although it could be incorporated into this polyketide to a small extent. TcmJ, a PKS protein without a known function, greatly increased the production of TCM F2 but could not replace TcmN as a cyclase in the reconstituted system.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic angustmycins: identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster reveal unprecedented dehydratase required for exo-glycal formation Abstract: The nucleoside antibiotic angustmycin, produced by some Streptomyces strains, is composed of adenine and C6 sugar and shows antibiotic and antitumor activities. In this study, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for angustmycin using a heterologous expression experiment coupled with in silico analysis of the angustmycin biosynthetic gene (agm) cluster. The biochemical characterization of Agm6 demonstrated its role in angustmycin biosynthesis as an unprecedented dehydratase.	1
Abstract2class: A Single Gene Cluster for Chalcomycins and Aldgamycins: Genetic Basis for Bifurcation of Their Biosynthesis Abstract: Aldgamycins are 16-membered macrolide antibiotics with a rare branched-chain sugar d-aldgarose or decarboxylated d-aldgarose at C-5. In our efforts to clone the gene cluster for aldgamycins from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. HK-2006-1 capable of producing both aldgamycins and chalcomycins, we found that both are biosynthesized from a single gene cluster. Whole-genome sequencing combined with gene disruption established the entire gene cluster of aldgamycins: nine new genes are incorporated with the previously identified chalcomycin gene cluster. Functional analysis of these genes revealed that almDI/almDII, (encoding α/β subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase) triggers the biosynthesis of aldgamycins, whereas almCI (encoding an oxidoreductase) initiates chalcomycins biosynthesis. This is the first report that aldgamycins and chalcomycins are derived from a single gene cluster and of the genetic basis for bifurcation in their biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Fungal polyketide synthase product chain-length control by partnering thiohydrolase Abstract: Fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases (HRPKSs) are an enigmatic group of multidomain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of structurally diverse compounds. This variety stems from their intrinsic programming rules, which permutate the use of tailoring domains and determine the overall number of iterative cycles. From genome sequencing and mining of the producing strain Eupenicillium brefeldianum ATCC 58665, we identified an HRPKS involved in the biosynthesis of an important protein transport-inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA), followed by reconstitution of its activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Bref-PKS demonstrated an NADPH-dependent reductive tailoring specificity that led to the synthesis of four different octaketide products with varying degrees of reduction. Furthermore, contrary to what is expected from the structure of BFA, Bref-PKS is found to be a nonaketide synthase in the absence of an associated thiohydrolase Bref-TH. Such chain-length control by the partner thiohydrolase was found to be present in other HRPKS systems and highlights the importance of including tailoring enzyme activities in predicting fungal HRPKS functions and their products.	1
Abstract2class: The cyclochlorotine mycotoxin is produced by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase CctN in Talaromyces islandicus ('Penicillium islandicum') Abstract: Talaromyces islandicus ('Penicillium islandicum') is a widespread foodborne mold that produces numerous secondary metabolites, among them potent mycotoxins belonging to different chemical classes. A notable metabolite is the hepatotoxic and carcinogenic pentapeptide cyclochlorotine that contains the unusual amino acids β-phenylalanine, 2-aminobutyrate and 3,4-dichloroproline. Although the chemical structure has been known for over five decades, nothing is known about the biosynthetic pathway of cyclochlorotine. Bioinformatic analysis of the recently sequenced genome of T. islandicus identified a wealth of gene clusters potentially coding for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Here, we show by RNA interference-mediated gene silencing that a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, CctN, is responsible for the synthesis of cyclochlorotine. Moreover, we identified novel cyclochlorotine chemical variants, whose production also depended on cctN expression. Surprisingly, the halogenase required for cyclochlorotine biosynthesis is not encoded in the cct cluster. Nonetheless, our findings enabled us to propose a detailed model for cyclochlorotine biosynthesis. In addition, comparative genomics revealed that cct-like clusters are present in all of the sequenced Talaromyces strains indicating a high prevalence of cyclochlorotine production ability.	1
Abstract2class: Ketoreductase Domain Dysfunction Expands Chemodiversity: Malyngamide Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium Okeania hirsuta Abstract: Dozens of type A malyngamides, principally identified by a decorated six-membered cyclohexanone headgroup and methoxylated lyngbic acid tail, have been isolated over several decades. Their environmental sources include macro- and microbiotic organisms, including sea hares, red alga, and cyanobacterial assemblages, but the true producing organism has remained enigmatic. Many type A analogues display potent bioactivity in human-health related assays, spurring an interest in this molecular class and its biosynthetic pathway. Here, we present the discovery of the type A malyngamide biosynthetic pathway in the first sequenced genome of the cyanobacterial genus Okeania. Bioinformatic analysis of two cultured Okeania genome assemblies identified 62 and 68 kb polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) pathways with unusual loading and termination genes. NMR data of malyngamide C acetate derived from 13C-substrate-fed cultures provided evidence that an intact octanoate moiety is transferred to the first KS module via a LipM homologue originally associated with lipoic acid metabolism and implicated an inactive ketoreductase (KR0) as critical for six-membered ring formation, a hallmark of the malyngamide family. Phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling of the penultimate KR0 domain inferred structural cofactor binding and active site alterations as contributory to domain dysfunction, which was confirmed by recombinant protein expression and NADPH binding assay. The carbonyl retained from this KR0 ultimately enables an intramolecular Knoevenagel condensation to form the characteristic cyclohexanone ring. Understanding this critical step allows assignment of a biosynthetic model for all type A malyngamides, whereby well-characterized tailoring modifications explain the surprising proliferation and diversity of analogues.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation and structure determination of a new lantibiotic cinnamycin B from Actinomadura atramentaria based on genome mining Abstract: New lantibiotic cinnamycin B was isolated from the extract of Actinomadura atramentaria NBRC 14695(T), based on genome mining and chemical investigation. The partial structure of cinnamycin B was established by 2D NMR experiments, which indicated that cinnamycin B had same methyl lanthionine bridging pattern with cinnamycin. The reduction with NaBH4-NiCl2 afforded the reduced cinnamycin B, and MS/MS experiment indicated the presence of hydroxy asparatic acid in the molecule. Cinnamycin B showed an antibacterial activity against Streptomyces antibioticus with dosage of 5 μg (0.5μL, 10 mg/mL solution) at spot-on-lawn testing method. The gene cluster of cinnamycin B on the genome of A. atramentaria was identified and discussed in comparison with that of cinnamycin.	1
Abstract2class: Type II thioesterase ScoT is required for coelimycin production by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Type II thioesterases were shown to maintain efficiency of modular type I polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases by removing acyl residues blocking extension modules. We found that thioesterase ScoT from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is required for the production of the yellow-pigmented coelimycin by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk. No production of coelimycin was observed in cultures of scoT disruption mutant. Polyketide production was restored upon complementation with an intact copy of the scoT gene. An enzymatic assay showed that ScoT thioesterase can hydrolyse a 12-carbon acyl chain but the activity is too low to play a role in product release from the polyketide synthase. We conclude that ScoT is an editing enzyme necessary to maintain the activity of polyketide synthase Cpk. We provide a HPLC based method to measure the amount of coelimycin P2 in a culture medium.	1
Abstract2class: A minimalist substrate for enzymatic peptide and protein conjugation Abstract: Recently a number of nonnatural prenyl groups containing alkynes and azides have been developed as handles to perform click chemistry on proteins and peptides ending in the sequence "CAAX", where C is a cysteine that becomes alkylated, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid. When such molecules are modified, a tag containing a prenyl analogue and the "CAAX box" sequence remains. Here we report the synthesis of an alkyne-containing substrate comprised of only nine nonhydrogen atoms. This substrate was synthesized in six steps from 3-methylbut-2-en-1-ol and has been enzymatically incorporated into both proteins and peptides by using protein farnesyltransferase. After prenylation the final three amino acids required for enzymatic recognition can be removed by using carboxypeptidase Y, leaving a single residue (the cysteine from the "CAAX box") and the prenyl analogue as the only modifications. We also demonstrate that this small tag minimizes the impact of the modification on the solubility of the targeted protein. Hence, this new approach should be useful for applications in which the presence of a large tag hinders the modified protein's solubility, reactivity, or utility.	0
Abstract2class: Structure of trichamide, a cyclic peptide from the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum, predicted from the genome sequence Abstract: A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a new small cyclic peptide, dubbed trichamide, was discovered in the genome of the global, bloom-forming marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM101 because of striking similarities to the previously characterized patellamide biosynthesis cluster. The tri cluster consists of a precursor peptide gene containing the amino acid sequence for mature trichamide, a putative heterocyclization gene, an oxidase, two proteases, and hypothetical genes. Based upon detailed sequence analysis, a structure was predicted for trichamide and confirmed by Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Trichamide consists of 11 amino acids, including two cysteine-derived thiazole groups, and is cyclized by an N C terminal amide bond. As the first natural product reported from T. erythraeum, trichamide shows the power of genome mining in the prediction and discovery of new natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Ubericin K, a New Pore-Forming Bacteriocin Targeting mannose-PTS Abstract: Bovine mastitis infection in dairy cattle is a significant economic burden for the dairy industry globally. To reduce the use of antibiotics in treatment of clinical mastitis, new alternative treatment options are needed. Antimicrobial peptides from bacteria, also known as bacteriocins, are potential alternatives for combating mastitis pathogens. In search of novel bacteriocins against mastitis pathogens, we screened samples of Norwegian bovine raw milk and found a Streptococcus uberis strain with potent antimicrobial activity toward Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Listeria, and Lactococcus. Whole-genome sequencing of the strain revealed a multibacteriocin gene cluster encoding one class IIb bacteriocin, two class IId bacteriocins, in addition to a three-component regulatory system and a dedicated ABC transporter. Isolation and purification of the antimicrobial activity from culture supernatants resulted in the detection of a 6.3-kDa mass peak by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a mass corresponding to the predicted size of one of the class IId bacteriocins. The identification of this bacteriocin, called ubericin K, was further confirmed by in vitro protein synthesis, which showed the same inhibitory spectrum as the purified antimicrobial compound. Ubericin K shows highest sequence similarity to the class IId bacteriocins bovicin 255, lactococcin A, and garvieacin Q. We found that ubericin K uses the sugar transporter mannose phosphotransferase (PTS) as a target receptor. Further, by using the pHlourin sensor system to detect intracellular pH changes due to leakage across the membrane, ubericin K was shown to be a pore former, killing target cells by membrane disruption. IMPORTANCE Bacterial infections in dairy cows are a major burden to farmers worldwide because infected cows require expensive treatments and produce less milk. Today, infected cows are treated with antibiotics, a practice that is becoming less effective due to antibiotic resistance. Compounds other than antibiotics also exist that kill bacteria causing infections in cows; these compounds, known as bacteriocins, are natural products produced by other bacteria in the environment. In this work, we discover a new bacteriocin that we call ubericin K, which kills several species of bacteria known to cause infections in dairy cows. We also use in vitro synthesis as a novel method for rapidly characterizing bacteriocins directly from genomic data, which could be useful for other researchers. We believe that ubericin K and the methods described in this work will aid in the transition away from antibiotics in the dairy industry.	1
Abstract2class: Enterobactin: an archetype for microbial iron transport Abstract: Bacteria have aggressive acquisition processes for iron, an essential nutrient. Siderophores are small iron chelators that facilitate cellular iron transport. The siderophore enterobactin is a triscatechol derivative of a cyclic triserine lactone. Studies of the chemistry, regulation, synthesis, recognition, and transport of enterobactin make it perhaps the best understood of the siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems, displaying a lot of function packed into this small molecule. However, recent surprises include the isolation of corynebactin, a closely related trithreonine triscatechol derivative lactone first found in Gram-positive bacteria, and the crystal structure of a ferric enterobactin complex of a protein identified as an antibacterial component of the human innate immune system.	1
Abstract2class: Essential role of the iron-regulated outer membrane receptor FauA in alcaligin siderophore-mediated iron uptake in Bordetella species Abstract: Phenotypic analysis using heterologous host systems localized putative Bordetella pertussis ferric alcaligin transport genes and Fur-binding sequences to a 3.8-kb genetic region downstream from the alcR regulator gene. Nucleotide sequencing identified a TonB-dependent receptor family homolog gene, fauA, predicted to encode a polypeptide with high amino acid sequence similarity with known bacterial ferric siderophore receptors. In Escherichia coli, the fauA genes of both B. pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica directed the production of a 79-kDa polypeptide, approximating the predicted size of the mature FauA protein. B. bronchiseptica fauA insertion mutant BRM17 was unable to utilize ferric alcaligin, and in complementation analyses ferric alcaligin utilization was restored to this mutant by supplying the wild-type fauA gene in trans. Mutant BRM18, carrying a nonpolar in-frame fauA deletion mutation, was defective in ferric alcaligin utilization and (55)Fe-ferric alcaligin uptake and no longer produced a 79-kDa iron-regulated outer membrane protein. In complementation analyses, BRM18 merodiploids bearing the wild-type fauA gene in trans regained ferric alcaligin siderophore transport and utilization functions and produced the 79-kDa protein. Analysis of a plasmid-borne fauA-lacZ operon fusion confirmed that fauA is subject to iron regulation at the transcriptional level and that cis-acting transcriptional control elements mediating fauA iron repressibility reside within the 3.8-kb PstI fauA DNA region. Moreover, expression of the fauA-lacZ fusion gene under iron starvation conditions was shown to be alcR dependent. FauA is a 79-kDa iron-regulated outer membrane receptor protein required for transport and utilization of ferric alcaligin siderophore complexes by Bordetella species.	1
Abstract2class: Disruption of carotene biosynthesis leads to abnormal plastids and variegated leaves in Brassica napus Abstract: Leaf color is an important characteristic of normal chloroplast development. Variegated plants have green- and white-sectored leaves, which can be used to identify important pathways and molecular mechanisms of chloroplast development. We studied two Brassica napus variegation mutants from same one variegated ancestor, designated ZY-4 and ZY-8, which have different degrees of variegation. When grown in identical conditions, the ratio of white sectors in ZY-4 leaves is higher than in ZY-8. In both mutants, the cells in green sectors contain normal chloroplasts; while, the cells in white sectors contain abnormal plastids. Seedling chloroplasts ultrastructure of both mutants showed that the biogenesis of chloroplasts was blocked in early stages; delayed development and structual damage in ZY-4 were more serious than in ZY-8. Employing bulked segregant analysis(BSA), two bulks (BY142 and BY137) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-4 and ZS11, and one bulk (BY56) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-8 and ZS11, and screening by Brassica 60K SNP BeadChip Array, showed the candidate regions localized in chromosome A08 (BY142), C04 (BY137), and A08 (BY56), respectively. Transcriptome analysis of five seedling development stages of ZY-4, ZY-8, and ZS11 showed that photosynthesis, energy metabolism-related pathways and translation-related pathways were important for chloroplast biogenesis. The number of down- or up-regulated genes related to immune system process in ZY-4 was more than in ZY-8. The retrograde signaling pathway was mis-regulated in both mutants. DEG analysis indicated that both mutants showed photooxidative damages. By coupling transcriptome and BSA CHIP analyses, some candidate genes were identified. The gene expression pattern of carotene biosynthesis pathway was disrupted in both mutants. However, histochemical analysis of ROS revealed that there was no excessive accumulation of ROS in ZY-4 and ZY-8. Taken together, our data indicate that the disruption of carotene biosynthetic pathways leads to the variegation phenotypes of ZY-4 and ZY-8 and there are some functions that can compensate for the disruption of carotene biosynthesis in ZY-4 and ZY-8 to reduce ROS and prevent seedling mortality.	0
Abstract2class: Moso Bamboo Invasion Reshapes Community Structure of Denitrifying Bacteria in Rhizosphere of Alsophila spinulosa Abstract: The uncontrolled invasion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) dramatically alters soil nitrogen cycling and destroys the natural habitat of Alsophila spinulosa. Nevertheless, no clear evidence points out the role of denitrifying bacteria in the invasion of bamboo into the habitat of A. spinulosa. In the present study, we found that low (importance value 0.0008), moderate (0.6551), and high (0.9326) bamboo invasions dramatically altered the underground root biomass of both P. pubescens and A. spinulosa. The root biomass of A. spinulosa was maximal at moderate invasion, indicating that intermediate disturbance might contribute to the growth and survival of the colonized plant. Successful bamboo invasion significantly increased rhizospheric soil available nitrogen content of A. spinulosa, coupled with elevated denitrifying bacterial abundance and diversity. Shewanella, Chitinophaga, and Achromobacter were the primary genera in the three invasions, whereas high bamboo invasion harbored more denitrifying bacteria and higher abundance than moderate and low invasions. Further correlation analysis found that most soil denitrifying bacteria were positively correlated with soil organic matter and available nitrogen but negatively correlated with pH and water content. In addition, our findings illustrated that two denitrifying bacteria, Chitinophaga and Sorangium, might be essential indicators for evaluating the effects of bamboo invasion on the growth of A. spinulosa. Collectively, this study found that moso bamboo invasion could change the nitrogen cycling of colonized habitats through alterations of denitrifying bacteria and provided valuable perspectives for profound recognizing the invasive impacts and mechanisms of bamboo expansion.	0
Abstract2class: Thioholgamides: Thioamide-Containing Cytotoxic RiPP Natural Products Abstract: Thioviridamide is a structurally unique ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide that contains several thioamide bonds and is active against a number of cancer cell lines. In the search for naturally occurring thioviridamide analogs, we employed genome mining that led to the identification of several related gene clusters. Chemical screening followed by cultivation and isolation yielded thioholgamides A and B, two new additions to the thioviridamide family with several amino acid substitutions, a different N-capping moiety, and with one less thioamide bond. Thioholgamides display improved cytotoxicity in the submicromolar range against a range of cell lines and an IC50 of 30 nM for thioholgamide A against HCT-116 cells. Herein, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of thioholgamides A and B, a proposed biosynthetic cluster for their production, and their bioactivities against a larger panel of microorganisms and cancer cell lines.	1
Abstract2class: Optogenetic Amplification Circuits for Light-Induced Metabolic Control Abstract: Dynamic control of microbial metabolism is an effective strategy to improve chemical production in fermentations. While dynamic control is most often implemented using chemical inducers, optogenetics offers an attractive alternative due to the high tunability and reversibility afforded by light. However, a major concern of applying optogenetics in metabolic engineering is the risk of insufficient light penetration at high cell densities, especially in large bioreactors. Here, we present a new series of optogenetic circuits we call OptoAMP, which amplify the transcriptional response to blue light by as much as 23-fold compared to the basal circuit (OptoEXP). These circuits show as much as a 41-fold induction between dark and light conditions, efficient activation at light duty cycles as low as ∼1%, and strong homogeneous light-induction in bioreactors of at least 5 L, with limited illumination at cell densities above 40 OD600. We demonstrate the ability of OptoAMP circuits to control engineered metabolic pathways in novel three-phase fermentations using different light schedules to control enzyme expression and improve production of lactic acid, isobutanol, and naringenin. These circuits expand the applicability of optogenetics to metabolic engineering.	0
Abstract2class: Legonaridin, a new member of linaridin RiPP from a Ghanaian Streptomyces isolate Abstract: Linaridins are rare linear ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and only two, cypemycin and SGR-1832, in this family have been identified so far. Legonaridin 1 has been discovered as a new member of linaridins through chemical isolation, peptidogenomics, comprehensive 1- and 2-D NMR and advanced Marfey's analyses from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. CT34, an isolate collected from Legon, Ghana. Bioinformatics analysis of the gene cluster suggested that the biosynthesis of legonaridin 1 is different from those of cypemycin and SGR-1832. Consistent with bioinformatics and peptidogenomics analyses, 1 has a total of nine post-modifications, 8 dehydrobutyrine residues and a N,N-dimethylated N-terminus with a carboxylic acid at the C-terminus. Legonaridin 1 is structurally different from the two known linaridins comprising a new subfamily. This is the first time that NMR spectroscopy is used to establish the 2-D structure of a linaridin RiPP.	1
Abstract2class: Mutation of His-157 in the second pore loop drastically reduces the activity of the Synechocystis Ktr-type transporter Abstract: Mutation of a conserved His-157 in the second pore loop of KtrB drastically reduced the activity of the K+ transporter from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. This result suggests that His-157 plays an essential role in the K+ transport activity of the transporter system.	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptomic and proteomic approach for understanding the molecular basis of adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to wine fermentation Abstract: Throughout alcoholic fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have to cope with several stress conditions that could affect their growth and viability. In addition, the metabolic activity of yeast cells during this process leads to the production of secondary compounds that contribute to the organoleptic properties of the resulting wine. Commercial strains have been selected during the last decades for inoculation into the must to carry out the alcoholic fermentation on the basis of physiological traits, but little is known about the molecular basis of the fermentative behavior of these strains. In this work, we present the first transcriptomic and proteomic comparison between two commercial strains with different fermentative behaviors. Our results indicate that some physiological differences between the fermentative behaviors of these two strains could be related to differences in the mRNA and protein profiles. In this sense, at the level of gene expression, we have found differences related to carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen catabolite repression, and response to stimuli, among other factors. In addition, we have detected a relative increase in the abundance of proteins involved in stress responses (the heat shock protein Hsp26p, for instance) and in fermentation (in particular, the major cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6p) in the strain with better behavior during vinification. Moreover, in the case of the other strain, higher levels of enzymes required for sulfur metabolism (Cys4p, Hom6p, and Met22p) are observed, which could be related to the production of particular organoleptic compounds or to detoxification processes.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene cluster for the synthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid in the plant pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans Abstract: Leptosphaeria maculans is an ascomycetous fungus that causes the disease blackleg on Brassica napus (canola). In spite of the importance of the disease worldwide, the mechanisms of disease development are poorly understood. Secondary metabolites, which are one of the common virulence factors of pathogenic fungi, have not been extensively explored from this fungus. An RNA-seq dataset was examined to find genes responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis by this fungus during infection. One polyketide synthase gene, pks5, was found to be upregulated during the early biotrophic stage of development. In addition to pks5, six other genes adjacent to the pks5 gene, including one encoding a Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor abscisic acid-like 7 gene (abl7), were also upregulated during that time. A striking feature of the L. maculans genome is that it contains large AT-rich regions that are gene-poor and large GC-rich regions that are gene rich. This set of seven co-regulated genes is embedded within and separated by two such AT-rich regions. Three of the genes in the cluster have similarities to those known to be involved in the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) in other fungi. When L. maculans is grown in axenic culture the genes in this cluster are not expressed and ABA is not produced. Overexpressing abl7, encoding the putative transcription factor, resulted in the transcription of the six adjacent genes in axenic culture and in the production of ABA, as detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Mutation of two genes of the cluster using CRISPR/Cas9 did not affect pathogenicity on canola cotyledons. The characterization of the ABA gene cluster has led to the discovery of the co-regulation of genes within an AT-rich region by a transcription factor, and the first report of the plant hormone abscisic acid being produced by L. maculans.	1
Abstract2class: Selection of Lactiplantibacillus Strains for the Production of Fermented Table Olives Abstract: Lactiplantibacillus strains (n. 77) were screened for technological properties (e.g., xylose fermentation, EPS production, antimicrobial activity, tolerance to NaCl and phenolic compounds, oleuropein degradation and hydroxytyrosol formation) relevant for the production of fermented table olives. Survival to olive mill wastewater (OMW) and to simulated gastro-intestinal tract (GIT), the capability to grow at different combinations of NaCl and pH values, radical scavenging activities and biofilm formation were further investigated in 15 selected strains. The screening step revealed high diversity among Lactiplantibacillus strains. Most of the strains were able to ferment xylose, while only a few strains produced EPS and had inhibitory activity against Y. lipolytica. Resistance to phenolic compounds (gallic, protocatechuic, hydroxybenzoic and syringic acids), as well as the ability to release hydroxytyrosol from oleuropein, was strain-specific. OMWs impaired the survival of selected strains, while combinations of NaCl ≤ 6% and pH ≥ 4.0 were well tolerated. DPPH and hydroxyl radical degradation were strain-dependent, while the capability to form biofilm was affected by incubation time. Strains were very tolerant to the GIT. The genome of Lpb. pentosus O17 was sequenced and analysed to verify the presence of genes involved in the degradation and metabolism of phenolic compounds. O17 lacks carboxylesterase and gallate decarboxylase (subunits B and D) sequences, and its gene profile differs from that of other publicly available Lpb. pentosus genomes.	0
Abstract2class: Sculpting the maturation, softening and ethylene pathway: the influences of microRNAs on tomato fruits Abstract: Background:                       MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous class of short RNAs, play vital roles in physiological and biochemical processes in plants by mediating gene silencing at post-transcriptional (PTGS) level. Tomato is a model system to study molecular basis of fleshy fruit ripening and senescence, ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction owing to its genetic and molecular tractability. To study the functions of miRNAs in tomato fruit ripening and senescence, and their possible roles in ethylene response, the next generation sequencing method was employed to identify miRNAs in tomato fruit. Bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches were combined to profile the miRNAs expression patterns at three different fruit ripening stages and by exogenous ethylene treatment.                  Results:                       In addition to 7 novel miRNA families, 103 conserved miRNAs belonging to 24 families and 10 non-conserved miRNAs matching 9 families were identified in our libraries. The targets of many these miRNAs were predicted to be transcriptional factors. Other targets are known to play roles in the regulation of metabolic processes. Interestingly, some targets were predicted to be involved in fruit ripening and softening, such as Pectate Lyase, beta-galactosidase, while a few others were predicted to be involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway, such as ACS, EIN2 and CTR1. The expression patterns of a number of such miRNAs at three ripening stages were confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR, which showed a strong negative correlation with that of their targets. The regulation of exogenous ethylene on miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed simultaneously, and 3 down-regulated, 5 up-regulated miRNAs were found in this study.                  Conclusions:                       A combination of high throughput sequencing and molecular biology approaches was used to explore the involvement of miRNAs during fruit ripening. Several miRNAs showed differential expression profiles during fruit ripening, and a number of miRNAs were influenced by ethylene treatment. The results suggest the importance of miRNAs in fruit ripening and ethylene response.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) involved in biosynthesis of actinorhodin: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme Abstract: The oxidation of phenols to quinones is an important reaction in the oxidative tailoring of many aromatic polyketides from bacterial and fungal systems. Sequence similarity between ActVA-Orf6 protein from the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster and the previously characterized TcmH protein that is involved in tetracenomycin biosynthesis suggested that ActVA-Orf6 might catalyze this transformation as a step in actinorhodin biosynthesis. To investigate the role of ActVA-Orf6 in this oxidation, we have expressed the actVA-Orf6 gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVA-Orf6 was shown to catalyze the monooxygenation of the tetracenomycin intermediate TcmF1 to TcmD3, strongly suggesting that it catalyzes oxidation of a similar intermediate in actinorhodin biosynthesis. The monooxygenase obeys simple reaction kinetics and has a Km of 4.8 +/- 0.9 microM, close to the figure reported for the homologous enzyme TcmH. The enzyme contains no prosthetic groups and requires only molecular oxygen to catalyze the oxidation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of histidine residues thought to be important in the reaction; mutants lacking His-52 displayed much-reduced activity, consistent with the proposed mechanistic hypothesis that this histidine acts as a general base during catalysis.	1
Abstract2class: Genome Mining of Alkaloidal Terpenoids from a Hybrid Terpene and Nonribosomal Peptide Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Biosynthetic pathways containing multiple core enzymes have potential to produce structurally complex natural products. Here we mined a fungal gene cluster that contains two predicted terpene cyclases (TCs) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). We showed the flv pathway produces flavunoidine 1, an alkaloidal terpenoid. The core of 1 is a tetracyclic, cage-like, and oxygenated sesquiterpene that is connected to dimethylcadaverine via a C-N bond and is acylated with 5,5-dimethyl-l-pipecolate. The roles of all flv enzymes are established on the basis of metabolite analysis from heterologous expression.	1
Abstract2class: Development of a simvastatin selection marker for a hyperthermophilic acidophile, Sulfolobus islandicus Abstract: We report here a novel selectable marker for the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. The marker cassette is composed of the sac7d promoter and the hmg gene coding for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (P(sac7d)-hmg), which confers simvastatin resistance to this crenarchaeon. The basic plasmid vector pSSR was constructed by substituting the pyrEF gene of the expression vector pSeSD for P(sac7d)-hmg with which the Sulfolobus expression plasmids pSSRlacS, pSSRAherA, and pSSRNherA were constructed. Characterization of Sulfolobus transformants carrying pSSRlacS indicated that the plasmid was properly maintained under selection. High-level expression of the His(6)-tagged HerA helicase was obtained with the cells harboring pSSRAherA. The establishment of two efficient selectable markers (pyrEF and hmg) was subsequently exploited for genetic analysis. A herA merodiploid strain of S. islandicus was constructed using pyrEF marker and used as the host to obtain pSSRNherA transformant with simvastatin selection. While the gene knockout (ΔherA) cells generated from the herA merodiploid cells failed to form colonies in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), the mutant cells could be rescued by expression of the gene from a plasmid (pSSRNherA), because their transformants formed colonies on a solid medium containing 5-FOA and simvastatin. This demonstrates that HerA is essential for cell viability of S. islandicus. To our knowledge, this is the first application of an antibiotic selectable marker in genetic study for a hyperthermophilic acidophile and in the crenarchaeal lineage.	0
Abstract2class: A highly stereoselective synthesis of chiral alpha-amino-beta-lactams via the Kinugasa reaction employing ynamides Abstract: A highly stereoselective synthesis of chiral alpha-amino-beta-lactam through an ynamide-Kinugasa reaction is described. In addition, a mechanistic model is illustrated here to rationalize the observed diastereoselectivity, which depends on both the initial [3 + 2] cycloaddition step and the subsequent protonation for which both are highly selective.	0
Abstract2class: Organisation and functions of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Sequence analysis of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor revealed a succession of six open reading frames (ORFs), all running in the same direction and extending over 5.32 kb. The protein product of actVA-ORF1 strongly resembles that of another gene, elsewhere in the act cluster (actII-ORF2), which codes for a trans-membrane protein previously implicated in actinorhodin export from the mycelium. This suggests that the two gene products may co-operate in actinorhodin export, perhaps being sufficient for self-protection of the organism against suicide. At least four of the other five ORFs are implicated in the control of the C-6 and C-8 ring-hydroxylation reactions, lacking in actVA mutants, that occur at middle to late stages in the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway. This conclusion was reached by genetic mapping of actVA mutants to actVA-ORF3 and -ORF5 (and perhaps -ORF4), and by the finding of strong resemblances between the protein products of actVA-ORF2 and -ORF6 and the products of genes of the oxytetracycline or tetracenomycin gene clusters that have been implicated in ring-hydroxylation reactions in the biosynthesis of these other aromatic polyketide antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Engineering Haloferax mediterranei as an Efficient Platform for High Level Production of Lycopene Abstract: Lycopene attracts increasing interests in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries due to its anti-oxidative and anti-cancer properties. Compared with other lycopene production methods, such as chemical synthesis or direct extraction from plants, the biosynthesis approach using microbes is more economical and sustainable. In this work, we engineered Haloferax mediterranei, a halophilic archaeon, as a new lycopene producer. H. mediterranei has the de novo synthetic pathway for lycopene but cannot accumulate this compound. To address this issue, we reinforced the lycopene synthesis pathway, blocked its flux to other carotenoids and disrupted its competitive pathways. The reaction from geranylgeranyl-PP to phytoene catalyzed by phytoene synthase (CrtB) was identified as the rate-limiting step in H. mediterranei. Insertion of a strong promoter PphaR immediately upstream of the crtB gene, or overexpression of the heterologous CrtB and phytoene desaturase (CrtI) led to a higher yield of lycopene. In addition, blocking bacterioruberin biosynthesis increased the purity and yield of lycopene. Knock-out of the key genes, responsible for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biosynthesis, diverted more carbon flux into lycopene synthesis, and thus further enhanced lycopene production. The metabolic engineered H. mediterranei strain produced lycopene at 119.25 ± 0.55 mg per gram of dry cell weight in shake flask fermentation. The obtained yield was superior compared to the lycopene production observed in most of the engineered Escherichia coli or yeast even when they were cultivated in pilot scale bioreactors. Collectively, this work offers insights into the mechanism involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in haloarchaea and demonstrates the potential of using haloarchaea for the production of lycopene or other carotenoids.	0
Abstract2class: Specific Identification of Glycoproteins Bearing the Tn Antigen in Human Cells Abstract: Glycoproteins contain a wealth of valuable information regarding the development and disease status of cells. In cancer cells, some glycans (such as the Tn antigen) are highly up-regulated, but this remains largely unknown for glycoproteins with a particular glycan. Herein, an innovative method combining enzymatic and chemical reactions was first designed to enrich glycoproteins with the Tn antigen. Using synthetic glycopeptides with O-GalNAc (the Tn antigen) or O-GlcNAc, we demonstrated that the method is selective for glycopeptides with O-GalNAc and can distinguish between these two modifications. The diagnostic ions from the tagged O-GalNAc further confirmed the effectiveness of the method and confidence in the identification of glycopeptides with the Tn antigen by mass spectrometry. Using this method, we identified 96 glycoproteins with the Tn antigen in Jurkat cells. The method can be extensively applied in biological and biomedical research.	0

Abstract2class: The albonoursin gene Cluster of S noursei biosynthesis of diketopiperazine metabolites independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases Abstract: Albonoursin [cyclo(deltaPhe-DeltaLeu)], an antibacterial peptide produced by Streptomyces noursei, is one of the simplest representatives of the large diketopiperazine (DKP) family. Formation of alpha,beta unsaturations was previously shown to occur on cyclo(L-Phe-L-Leu), catalyzed by the cyclic dipeptide oxidase (CDO). We used CDO peptide sequence information to isolate a 3.8 kb S. noursei DNA fragment that directs albonoursin biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans. This fragment encompasses four complete genes: albA and albB, necessary for CDO activity; albC, sufficient for cyclic dipeptide precursor formation, although displaying no similarity to non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes; and albD, encoding a putative membrane protein. This first isolated DKP biosynthetic gene cluster should help to elucidate the mechanism of DKP formation, totally independent of NRPS, and to characterize novel DKP biosynthetic pathways that could be engineered to increase the molecular diversity of DKP derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Two sequence elements of glycosyltransferases involved in urdamycin biosynthesis are responsible for substrate specificity and enzymatic activity Abstract: Background:                       Two deoxysugar glycosyltransferases (GTs), UrdGT1b and UrdGT1c, involved in urdamycin biosynthesis share 91% identical amino acids. However, the two GTs show different specificities for both nucleotide sugar and acceptor substrate. Generally, it is proposed that GTs are two-domain proteins with a nucleotide binding domain and an acceptor substrate site with the catalytic center in an interface cleft between these domains. Our work aimed at finding out the region responsible for determination of substrate specificities of these two urdamycin GTs.                  Results:                       A series of 10 chimeric GT genes were constructed consisting of differently sized and positioned portions of urdGT1b and urdGT1c. Gene expression experiments in host strains Streptomyces fradiae Ax and XTC show that nine of 10 chimeric GTs are still functional, with either UrdGT1b- or UrdGT1c-like activity. A 31 amino acid region (aa 52-82) located close to the N-terminus of these enzymes, which differs in 18 residues, was identified to control both sugar donor and acceptor substrate specificity. Only one chimeric gene product of the 10 was not functional. Targeted stepwise alterations of glycine 226 (G226R, G226S, G226SR) were made to reintroduce residues conserved among streptomycete GTs. Alterations G226S and G226R restored a weak activity, whereas G226SR showed an activity comparable with other functional chimeras.                  Conclusions:                       A nucleotide sugar binding motif is present in the C-terminal moiety of UrdGT1b and UrdGT1c from S. fradiae. We could demonstrate that it is an N-terminal section that determines specificity for the nucleotide sugar and also the acceptor substrate. This finding directs the way towards engineering this class of streptomycete enzymes for antibiotic derivatization applications. Amino acids 226 and 227, located outside the putative substrate binding site, might be part of a larger protein structure, perhaps a solvent channel to the catalytic center. Therefore, they could play a role in substrate accessibility to it.	1
Abstract2class: Sequence and transcriptional analysis of the Streptomyces glaucescens tcmAR tetracenomycin C resistance and repressor gene loci Abstract: Sequence analysis of the tcmA tetracenomycin C resistance gene from Streptomyces glaucescens GLA.O (ETH 22794) identifies one large open reading frame whose deduced product has sequence similarity to the mmr methylenomycin resistance gene from Streptomyces coelicolor, the Streptomyces rimosus tet347 (otrB) tetracycline resistance gene, and the atr1 aminotriazole resistance gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These genes are thought to encode proteins that act as metabolite export pumps powered by transmembrane electrochemical gradients. A divergently transcribed gene, tcmR, is located in the region upstream of tcmA. The deduced product of tcmR resembles the repressor proteins encoded by tetR regulatory genes from Escherichia coli and the actII-orf1 gene from S. coelicolor. Transcriptional analysis of tcmA and tcmR indicates that these genes have back-to-back and overlapping promoter regions.	1
Abstract2class: An eight residue fragment of an acyl carrier protein suffices for post-translational introduction of fluorescent pantetheinyl arms in protein modification in vitro and in vivo Abstract: Genetically encoded tags for tracking a given protein continue to be of great interest in a multitude of in vitro and in vivo contexts. Acyl carrier proteins, both free-standing and as embedded 80-100 residue domains, contain a specific serine side chain that undergoes post-translational pantetheinylation from CoASH as donor substrate. We have previously used phage display methods to select a 12 residue fragment that retains recognition for modification by the Escherichia coli phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) AcpS. In this work, we have used (15)N-HSQC based NMR titration experiments of a 12-residue peptide substrate with AcpS to identify six specifically interacting residues (S3, L4, D5, M6, W9, and L11) without the formation of any notable secondary structure. Synthesis of a corresponding octapeptide containing 5 of the 6 interacting residues generated a minimal fragment capable of efficient post-translational phosphopantetheinylation. Genetic insertion of this eight residue coding sequence into the proteins sonic hedgehog and transferrin receptor enabled good in vitro and in vivo PPTase-mediated modification by a series of fluorescent CoAs, leading to a set of fluorescent proteins with a peptide tag minimally perturbant to protein folds.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the incednine biosynthetic gene cluster: characterization of novel β-glutamate-β-decarboxylase IdnL3 Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster for the 24-membered macrolactam antibiotic incednine was identified from the producer strain, Streptomyces sp. ML694-90F3. Among the putative incednine biosynthetic enzymes, a novel pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent β-glutamate-β-decarboxylase, IdnL3, was functionally characterized in vitro by demonstrating its (S)-3-aminobutyrate-forming activity with β-glutamate in the presence of PLP. Because (S)-3-aminobutyrate is known for the direct precursor of incednine, this enzyme supplies the unique β-amino acid starter unit. The identified gene cluster encodes five characteristic β-amino acid carrying enzymes, consisting of a pathway-specific ATP-dependent ligase, a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), β-aminoacyl-ACP β-amino group-protecting ATP-dependent ligase, dipeptidyl-ACP:PKS-loading ACP dipeptidyltransferase and a terminal amino acid peptidase, which are completely conserved in β-amino acid-containing macrolactam biosynthetic gene clusters. Overall, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for incednine was proposed.	1
Abstract2class: The ard1 gene from Streptomyces capreolus encodes a polypeptide of the ABC-transporters superfamily which confers resistance to the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A Abstract: A gene (ard1) encoding resistance to the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A was cloned from Streptomyces capreolus NRRL 3817, the producing organism, and expressed in Streptomyces lividans. The gene ard1 induced antibiotic resistance that was highly specific for A201A. The nucleotide sequence of ard1 contains an open reading frame of 1677 bp. Transcription initiation was found to take place approximately 86 nucleotides preceding the ATG translation-initiation codon, indicating that ard1 is transcribed from its own promoter. The deduced protein sequence (Ard1, 558 amino acids) presents two ATP-binding domains with significant similarities to those of the ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC-transporters) superfamily, including some that confer drug resistance in a variety of antibiotic-producing Streptomyces, other Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotic cells. As is probably the case for most of these proteins, the mechanism of A201A resistance conferred by Ard1 is an active efflux energized by ATP hydrolysis.	1
Abstract2class: The biology of vision of Drosophila Abstract: Phototransduction systems in vertebrates and invertebrates share a great deal of similarity in overall strategy but differ significantly in the underlying molecular machinery. Both are rhodopsin-based G protein-coupled signaling cascades displaying exquisite sensitivity and broad dynamic range. However, light activation of vertebrate photoreceptors leads to activation of a cGMP-phosphodiesterase effector and the generation of a hyperpolarizing response. In contrast, activation of invertebrate photoreceptors, like Drosophila, leads to stimulation of phospholipase C and the generation of a depolarizing receptor potential. The comparative study of these two systems of phototransduction offers the opportunity to understand how similar biological problems may be solved by different molecular mechanisms of signal transduction. The study of this process in Drosophila, a system ideally suited to genetic and molecular manipulation, allows us to dissect the function and regulation of such a complex signaling cascade in its normal cellular environment. In this manuscript I review some of our recent findings and the strategies used to dissect this process.	0
Abstract2class: Mechanistic studies on histone catalyzed cleavage of apyrimidinic/apurinic sites in nucleosome core particles Abstract: Duplex DNA containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lesion undergoes cleavage significantly more rapidly in nucleosome core particles (NCPs) than it does when free. The mechanism of AP cleavage within NCPs was studied through independently generating lesions within them. AP mediated DNA cleavage within NCPs is initiated by DNA-protein cross-link (DPC(un)) formation followed by β-elimination to give DPCs containing cleaved DNA (DPC(cl)). Hydrolysis of DPC(cl) produces a DNA single strand break (SSB). C2-dideuteration of AP showed that deprotonation from this position is involved in the rate-determining step. Experiments utilizing NCPs containing mutated histone H4 proteins indicated that lysine residues in the amino terminal tail are involved in both DPC formation and β-elimination steps. Lysines 16 and 20 seem to play a greater role in reacting with AP at superhelical location 1.5, but other amino acids (e.g., lysines 5, 8, and 12) compensate in their absence. The mechanism of rapid double strand breaks in bistranded, clustered AP lesions was studied by independently preparing reaction intermediates within model NCPs. A single strand break on one strand enhances the cleavage of a proximal AP on the opposite strand.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a gene cluster of Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1 encoding the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1 Abstract: We characterized a gene cluster in a plasmid designated pPI-1 of Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1 encoding the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lacticin-481 type lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1. The DNA sequence suggested that the nukacin ISK-1 gene cluster consists of at least six genes, nukA (a structural gene), -M, -T, -F, -E, -G, and two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF7. NukM and NukT were predicted to be involved in post-translational modification and secretion of nukacin ISK-1 respectively. NukF, -E, and -G were predicted to form a membrane complex which contributes to self-protection from nukacin ISK-1. Transcriptional analyses revealed that nukM through ORF7 comprises an operon, and that ORF1 is transcribed independently from downstream of nukA. The transcriptional levels of the nukA and nukM genes were enhanced by osmotic stress. The expression level of the nukA transcript was scarcely enhanced by nukacin ISK-1, suggesting that expression is not under the control of the autoregulatory circuit.	1
Abstract2class: Activatable Singlet Oxygen Generation from Lipid Hydroperoxide Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis is a widely practiced strategy for cancer therapy. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of the spatial-temporal control of ROS generation, the meticulous participation of light, photosensitizer, and oxygen greatly hinders the broad application of PDT as a first-line cancer treatment option. An activatable system has been developed that enables tumor-specific singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) generation for cancer therapy, based on a Fenton-like reaction between linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAHP) tethered on iron oxide nanoparticles (IO NPs) and the released iron(II) ions from IO NPs under acidic-pH condition. The IO-LAHP NPs are able to induce efficient apoptotic cancer cell death both in vitro and in vivo through tumor-specific 1 O2 generation and subsequent ROS mediated mechanism. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of modulating biochemical reactions as a ROS source to exert cancer death.	0
Abstract2class: In vitro and in vivo studies of three antibiotic combinations against gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: The activities of azlocillin, cefotaxime, and amikacin alone and in combination were evaluated in in vitro checkerboard studies, in infected neutropenic mice, and in human volunteers. The combination of cefotaxime plus amikacin was more synergistic in vitro than the others against the Enterobacteriaceae tested, and the combination of azlocillin plus amikacin was more synergistic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Survival of neutropenic mice infected with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, was greater with azlocillin plus amikacin (24 of 40 and 11 of 40) and with cefotaxime plus amikacin (21 of 40 and 17 of 40) than with azlocillin plus cefotaxime (22 of 40 and 3 of 40; P less than 0.05). Median serum bactericidal activity in volunteers receiving these antibiotics alone and in combination was greater than or equal to 1:8 with most agents and with all combinations tested against 10 strains each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. These data suggest that clinical trials with combinations of azlocillin or cefotaxime plus amikacin deserve further study in febrile neutropenic patients.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering robust microorganisms for organic acid production Abstract: Organic acids are an important class of compounds that can be produced by microbial conversion of renewable feedstocks and have huge demands and broad applications in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. An economically viable fermentation process for production of organic acids requires robust microbial cell factories with excellent tolerance to low pH conditions, high concentrations of organic acids, and lignocellulosic inhibitors. In this review, we summarize various strategies to engineer robust microorganisms for organic acid production and highlight their applications in a few recent examples.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a Novel Epoxyqueuosine Reductase Family by Comparative Genomics Abstract: The reduction of epoxyqueuosine (oQ) is the last step in the synthesis of the tRNA modification queuosine (Q). While the epoxyqueuosine reductase (EC 1.17.99.6) enzymatic activity was first described 30 years ago, the encoding gene queG was only identified in Escherichia coli in 2011. Interestingly, queG is absent from a large number of sequenced genomes that harbor Q synthesis or salvage genes, suggesting the existence of an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase in these organisms. By analyzing phylogenetic distributions, physical gene clustering, and fusions, members of the Domain of Unknown Function 208 (DUF208) family were predicted to encode for an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase. This prediction was validated with genetic methods. The Q modification is present in Lactobacillus salivarius, an organism missing queG but harboring the duf208 gene. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is one of the few organisms that harbor both QueG and DUF208, and deletion of both corresponding genes was required to observe the absence of Q and the accumulation of oQ in tRNA. Finally, the conversion oQ to Q was restored in an E. coli queG mutant by complementation with plasmids harboring duf208 genes from different bacteria. Members of the DUF208 family are not homologous to QueG enzymes, and thus, duf208 is a non-orthologous replacement of queG. We propose to name DUF208 encoding genes as queH. While QueH contains conserved cysteines that could be involved in the coordination of a Fe/S center in a similar fashion to what has been identified in QueG, no cobalamin was identified associated with recombinant QueH protein.	0
Abstract2class: Deletion analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae late competence genes distinguishes virulence determinants that are dependent or independent of competence induction Abstract: The competence regulon of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is crucial for genetic transformation. During competence development, the alternative sigma factor ComX is activated, which in turn, initiates transcription of 80 'late' competence genes. Interestingly, only 16 late genes are essential for genetic transformation. We hypothesized that these late genes that are dispensable for competence are beneficial to pneumococcal fitness during infection. These late genes were systematically deleted, and the resulting mutants were examined for their fitness during mouse models of bacteremia and acute pneumonia. Among these, 14 late genes were important for fitness in mice. Significantly, deletion of some late genes attenuated pneumococcal fitness to the same level in both wild-type and ComX-null genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the constitutive baseline expression of these genes was important for bacterial fitness. In contrast, some mutants were attenuated only in the wild-type genetic background but not in the ComX-null background, suggesting that specific expression of these genes during competence state contributed to pneumococcal fitness. Increased virulence during competence state was partially caused by the induction of allolytic enzymes that enhanced pneumolysin release. These results distinguish the role of basal expression versus competence induction in virulence functions encoded by ComX-regulated late competence genes.	0
Abstract2class: Asymmetric ATP hydrolysis cycle of the heterodimeric multidrug ABC transport complex TmrAB from Thermus thermophilus Abstract: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems translocate a wide range of solutes across cellular membranes. The thermophilic gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, a model organism for structural genomics and systems biology, discloses ∼46 ABC proteins, which are largely uncharacterized. Here, we functionally analyzed the first two and only ABC half-transporters of the hyperthermophilic bacterium, TmrA and TmrB. The ABC system mediates uptake of the drug Hoechst 33342 in inside-out oriented vesicles that is inhibited by verapamil. TmrA and TmrB form a stable heterodimeric complex hydrolyzing ATP with a K(m) of 0.9 mm and k(cat) of 9 s(-1) at 68 °C. Two nucleotides can be trapped in the heterodimeric ABC complex either by vanadate or by mutation inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Nucleotide trapping requires permissive temperatures, at which a conformational ATP switch is possible. We further demonstrate that the canonic glutamate 523 of TmrA is essential for rapid conversion of the ATP/ATP-bound complex into its ADP/ATP state, whereas the corresponding aspartate in TmrB (Asp-500) has only a regulatory role. Notably, exchange of this single noncanonic residue into a catalytic glutamate cannot rescue the function of the E523Q/D500E complex, implicating a built-in asymmetry of the complex. However, slow ATP hydrolysis in the newly generated canonic site (D500E) strictly depends on the formation of a posthydrolysis state in the consensus site, indicating an allosteric coupling of both active sites.	0
Abstract2class: CodY orchestrates the expression of virulence determinants in emetic Bacillus cereus by impacting key regulatory circuits Abstract: Bacillus cereus causes gastrointestinal diseases and local and systemic infections elicited by the depsipeptide cereulide, enterotoxins, phospholipases, cytolysins and proteases. The PlcR-PapR quorum sensing system activates the expression of several virulence factors, whereas the Spo0A-AbrB regulatory circuit partially controls the plasmid-borne cereulide synthetase (ces) operon. Here, we show that CodY, a nutrient-responsive regulator of Gram-positive bacteria, has a profound effect on both regulatory systems, which have been assumed to operate independently of each other. Deletion of codY resulted in downregulation of virulence genes belonging to the PlcR regulon and a concomitant upregulation of the ces genes. CodY was found to be a repressor of the ces operon, but did not interact with the promoter regions of PlcR-dependent virulence genes in vitro, suggesting an indirect regulation of the latter. Furthermore, CodY binds to the promoter of the immune inhibitor metalloprotease InhA1, demonstrating that CodY directly links B. cereus metabolism to virulence. In vivo studies using a Galleria mellonella infection model, showed that the codY mutant was substantially attenuated, highlighting the importance of CodY as a key regulator of pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate that CodY profoundly modulates the virulence of B. cereus, possibly controlling the development of pathogenic traits in suitable host environments.	1
Abstract2class: The type III protein secretion system contributes to Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri biofilm formation Abstract: Background:                       Several bacterial plant pathogens colonize their hosts through the secretion of effector proteins by a Type III protein secretion system (T3SS). The role of T3SS in bacterial pathogenesis is well established but whether this system is involved in multicellular processes, such as bacterial biofilm formation has not been elucidated. Here, the phytopathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) was used as a model to gain further insights about the role of the T3SS in biofilm formation.                  Results:                       The capacity of biofilm formation of different X. citri T3SS mutants was compared to the wild type strain and it was observed that this secretion system was necessary for this process. Moreover, the T3SS mutants adhered proficiently to leaf surfaces but were impaired in leaf-associated growth. A proteomic study of biofilm cells showed that the lack of the T3SS causes changes in the expression of proteins involved in metabolic processes, energy generation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production and bacterial motility as well as outer membrane proteins. Furthermore, EPS production and bacterial motility were also altered in the T3SS mutants.                  Conclusions:                       Our results indicate a novel role for T3SS in X. citri in the modulation of biofilm formation. Since this process increases X. citri virulence, this study reveals new functions of T3SS in pathogenesis.	0
Abstract2class: An IgE receptor mimetic peptide (PepE) protects mice from IgE mediated anaphylaxis Abstract: Crosslinking of receptor-bound Immunoglobulin E (IgE) triggers immediate hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Blocking the interaction of IgE with its high-affinity receptor, FcεRI, on mast cells and basophils is an attractive strategy for the treatment of allergies. This approach has seen clinical success using the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, omalizumab. We recently designed and characterized a novel FcεRI-mimetic peptide (PepE) which contains the two key FcεRI α-chain receptor loops known to interact with the ε-heavy chain of IgE, C'-E and B-C, with an optimized linker for joining them. PepE has high specificity and affinity for IgE, blocks IgE binding to FcεRI and prevents IgE-induced mediator release from RBL2H3 cells. We have now investigated the biological effects of this peptide in vivo using a line of mice (BALB/c Il4raF709) very sensitive to IgE-mediated systemic anaphylaxis. IgE-deficient (IgE-/-) Il4raF709 mice were passively sensitized with the anti-DNP IgE monoclonal antibody (SPE-7) and subsequently challenged i.v. with DNP-BSA. Mice receiving a single dose of PepE prior to sensitization with SPE-7 IgE were fully protected from anaphylaxis while vehicle control-treated mice displayed strong reactions with significant core body temperature drops and elevated levels of mouse mast cell protease-1 (mMCP-1) in the serum. However, PepE had no effect on IgE-mediated anaphylaxis if given after IgE administration in IgE-/- mice, suggesting that PepE can block binding of free IgE to FcεRI but cannot compete with the receptor for already bound IgE in vivo. A single dose of PepE treatment did not protect IgE sufficient mice from IgE mediated anaphylaxis. However, a 3 week long course of PepE treatment protected IgE sufficient Il4raF709 mice from body temperature drops and elevation of serum mMCP-1. Our findings establish the potential of this type of structure for blocking IgE binding to mast cells in vivo and suggest that related peptides might have the potential to attenuate clinical allergic reactions.	0
Abstract2class: Rational generation of lasso peptides based on biosynthetic gene mutations and site-selective chemical modifications Abstract: Lasso peptides are a unique family of natural products whose structures feature a specific threaded fold, which confers these peptides the resistance to thermal and proteolytic degradation. This stability gives lasso peptides excellent pharmacokinetic properties, which together with their diverse reported bioactivities have garnered extensive attention because of their drug development potential. Notably, the threaded fold has proven quite inaccessible by chemical synthesis, which has hindered efficient generation of structurally diverse lasso peptides. We herein report the discovery of a new lasso peptide stlassin (1) by gene activation based on a Streptomyces heterologous expression system. Site-directed mutagenesis on the precursor peptide-encoding gene is carried out systematically, generating 17 stlassin derivatives (2-17 and 21) with residue-replacements at specific positions of 1. The solution NMR structures of 1, 3, 4, 14 and 16 are determined, supporting structural comparisons that ultimately enabled the rational production of disulfide bond-containing derivatives 18 and 19, whose structures do not belong to any of the four classes currently used to classify lasso peptides. Several site-selective chemical modifications are first applied on 16 and 21, efficiently generating new derivatives (20, 22-27) whose structures bear various decorations beyond the peptidyl monotonicity. The high production yields of these stlassin derivatives facilitate biological assays, which show that 1, 4, 16, 20, 21 and 24 possess antagonistic activities against the binding of lipopolysaccharides to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These results demonstrate proof-of-concept for the combined mutational/chemical generation of lasso peptide libraries to support drug lead development.	1
Abstract2class: Saccharochelins A-H, Cytotoxic Amphiphilic Siderophores from the Rare Marine Actinomycete Saccharothrix sp. D09 Abstract: Siderophores are secreted by microorganisms to survive in iron-depleted conditions, and they also possess tremendous therapeutic potential. Genomic-inspired isolation facilitated the identification of eight amphiphilic siderophores, saccharochelins A-H (1-8), from a rare marine-derived Saccharothrix species. Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 μM. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of ambiguine indole alkaloids in cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua Abstract: Ambiguines belong to a family of hapalindole-type indole alkaloid natural products, with many of the members possessing up to eight consecutive carbon stereocenters in a fused pentacyclic 6-6-6-5-7 ring scaffold. Here, we report the identification of a 42 kbp ambiguine (amb) biosynthetic gene cluster that harbors 32 protein-coding genes in its native producer Fischerella ambigua UTEX1903. Association of the amb cluster with ambiguine biosynthesis was confirmed by both bioinformatic analysis and in vitro characterizations of enzymes responsible for 3-((Z)-2'-isocyanoethenyl) indole and geranyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis and a C-2 indole dimethylallyltransferase that regiospecifically tailors hapalindole G to ambiguine A. The presence of five nonheme iron-dependent oxygenase coding genes (including four Rieske-type oxygenases) within the amb cluster suggests late-stage C-H activations are likely responsible for the structural diversities of ambiguines by regio- and stereospecific chlorination, hydroxylation, epoxidation, and sp(2)-sp(3) C-C bond formation.	1
Abstract2class: Novel flavonol glycosides from the aerial parts of lentil (Lens culinaris) Abstract: While the phytochemical composition of lentil (Lens culinaris) seeds is well described in scientific literature, there is very little available data about secondary metabolites from lentil leaves and stems. Our research reveals that the aerial parts of lentil are a rich source of flavonoids. Six kaempferol and twelve quercetin glycosides were isolated, their structures were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and chemical methods. This group includes 16 compounds which have not been previously described in the scientific literature: quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-galactopyranoside-7-O-β-D-glucuropyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-galacto-pyranoside-7-O-β-D-glucuropyranoside (3), their derivatives 4-10,12-15,17,18 acylated with caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, or 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid and kaempferol 3-O-{[(6-O-E-p-coumaroyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)]-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)}-β-D-galactopyranoside-7-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (11). Their DPPH scavenging activity was also evaluated. This is probably the first detailed description of flavonoids from the aerial parts of lentil.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic characterization and chemoenzymatic assembly of the cryptophycins. Potent anticancer agents from cyanobionts Abstract: The lichen cyanobacterial symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 are prolific producers of natural products, generating >25 derivatives of the cryptophycin class of secondary metabolites. Cryptophycin 1, the prototypic member of the class, is a potent tubulin-depolymerizing agent, and several semisynthetic derivatives are being developed as anticancer therapeutics. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the cryptophycin metabolic pathway by stable-isotope labeling experiments and through cloning, sequencing, and annotating the cryptophycin biosynthetic gene cluster. A comparative secondary metabolomic analysis based on polyketide (PK)/non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters from the phylogenetically related, non-cryptophycin producing cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, was used to identify the cryptophycin biosynthetic genes that encompass approximately 40 kb within the lichen symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genome. The pathway encodes a collinear set of enzymes, including three modular PK synthases, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules, and an integrated adenylation/ketoreductase didomain for elaboration of the leucic acid subunit. In addition, genes encoding key tailoring steps, including a FAD-dependent halogenase and CYP450 epoxidase, were identified. The inherent flexibility of the cryptophycin biosynthetic enzymes was harnessed to generate a suite of new analogues by altering the pool of PK starter units and selected amino acid extender groups. Characterization of the cryptophycin CYP450 enabled development of the first stereospecific synthesis of cryptophycin 2, through a tandem chemoenzymatic synthesis from the natural seco-cryptophycin 4 chain elongation intermediate.	1
Abstract2class: Ustethylin Biosynthesis Implies Phenethyl Derivative Formation in Aspergillus ustus Abstract: A highly oxygenated phenethyl derivative ustethylin A was isolated from Aspergillus ustus. Gene deletion, isotope labeling, and heterologous expression proved that the phenethyl core structure is assembled from malonyl-CoA by a polyketide synthase harboring a methyltransferase domain. Propionate was converted via acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and incorporated into the molecule. Modifications on the core structure by three different oxidoreductases and one O-methyltransferase lead to the final product, ustethylin A.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the chaetoviridin and chaetomugilin gene cluster in Chaetomium globosum reveal dual functions of an iterative highly-reducing polyketide synthase Abstract: We report the identification and characterization of the caz biosynthetic cluster from Chaetomium globosum and the characterization of a highly reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) that acts in both a sequential and convergent manner with a nonreducing PKS to form the chaetomugilin and chaetoviridin azaphilones. Genetic inactivation studies verified the involvement of individual caz genes in the biosynthesis of the azaphilones. Through in vitro reconstitution, we demonstrated the in vitro synthesis of chaetoviridin A from the pyranoquinone intermediate cazisochromene using the highly reducing PKS and an acyltransferase.	1
Abstract2class: Single-cell FRET imaging of transferrin receptor trafficking dynamics by Sfp-catalyzed, site-specific protein labeling Abstract: Fluorescence imaging of living cells depends on an efficient and specific method for labeling the target cellular protein with fluorophores. Here we show that Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling is suitable for fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins that spend at least part of their membrane trafficking cycle at the cell surface. In this study, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was fused to peptide carrier protein (PCP), and the TfR1-PCP fusion protein was specifically labeled with fluorophore Alexa 488 by Sfp. The trafficking of transferrin-TfR1-PCP complex during the process of transferrin-mediated iron uptake was imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescently labeled transferrin ligand and TfR1 receptor. We thus demonstrated that Sfp-catalyzed small molecule labeling of the PCP tag represents a practical and efficient tool for molecular imaging studies in living cells.	0
Abstract2class: Proof that the ACTVI genetic region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is involved in stereospecific pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin Abstract: Pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was studied using the act cluster deficient strain, CH999, carrying pRM5-based plasmids harbouring combinations of the actVI genes. The strain, CH999/pIJ5660 (pRM5 + actVI-ORF1), produced a chiral intermediate, (S)-DNPA, suggesting that the actVI-ORF1 product is a reductase determining the C-3 stereochemical centre.	1
Abstract2class: Engineering viable foot-and-mouth disease viruses with increased acid stability facilitate the development of improved vaccines Abstract: Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the most acid-unstable virus among picornaviruses, tends to disassemble into pentamers at pH values slightly below neutrality. However, the structural integrity of intact virion is one of the most important factors that influence the induction of a protective antibody response. Thus, improving the acid stability of FMDV is required for the efficacy of vaccine preparations. According to the previous studies, a single substitution or double amino acid substitutions (VP1 N17D, VP2 H145Y, VP2 D86H, VP3 H142D, VP3 H142G, and VP1 N17D + VP2 H145Y) in the capsid were introduced into the full-length infectious clone of type O FMDV vaccine strain O/HN/CHN/93 to develop seed FMDV with improved acid stability. After the transfection into BSR/T7 cells of constructed plasmids, substitution VP1 N17D or VP2 D86H resulted in viable and genetically stable FMDVs, respectively. However, substitution VP2 H145Y or VP1 N17D + VP2 H145Y showed reverse mutation and additional mutations, and substitution VP3 H141G or VP3 H141D prevented viral viability. We found that substitution VP1 N17D or VP2 D86H could confer increased acid resistance, alkali stability, and thermostability on FMDV O/HN/CHN/93, whereas substitution VP1 N17D was observed to lead to a decreased replication ability in BHK-21 cells and mildly impaired virulence in suckling mice. In contrast, substitution VP2 D86H had no negative effect on viral infectivity. These results indicated that the mutant rD86H carrying substitution VP2 D86H firstly reported by us could be more adequate for the development of inactivated FMD vaccines with enhanced acid stability.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of lycosantalonol, a cis-prenyl derived diterpenoid Abstract: Terpenoid natural products are generally derived from isoprenyl diphosphate precursors with trans double-bond configuration, and no diterpenoid derived from the cisoid precursor (Z,Z,Z)-nerylneryl diphosphate (1) has yet been identified. Here further investigation of a terpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster from tomato is reported, which resulted in identification of a biosynthetic pathway from 1, in a pathway featuring a number of interesting transformations. Compound 1 is first cyclized to a tricyclene core ring structure analogous to that found in α-santalene, with the resulting diterpene termed here lycosantalene (2). Quantum chemical calculations indicate a role for the diphosphate anion coproduct in this cyclization reaction. Subsequently, the internal cis double bond of the neryl side chain in 2 is then further transformed to an α-hydroxy ketone moiety via an epoxide intermediate (3). Oxygen labeling studies indicate 3 undergoes oxidative conversion to lycosantalonol (4). Thus, in addition to elucidating the cisoid origins of 4, this work has further provided mechanistic insight into the interesting transformations required for its production.	0
Abstract2class: Small-molecule suppressors of Candida albicans biofilm formation synergistically enhance the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against clinical Candida isolates Abstract: A new class of fungal biofilm inhibitors represented by shearinines D (3) and E (4) were obtained from a Penicillium sp. isolate. The inhibitory activities of 3 and 4 were characterized using a new imaging flow-cytometer technique, which enabled the rapid phenotypic analysis of Candida albicans cell types (budding yeast cells, germ tube cells, pseudohyphae, and hyphae) in biofilm populations. The results were confirmed by experimental data obtained from three-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy and 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assays. These data indicate that 3 and 4 inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation by blocking the outgrowth of hyphae at a relatively late stage of biofilm development (IC50 = 8.5 and 7.6 μM, respectively). However, 3 and 4 demonstrated comparatively weak activity at disrupting existing biofilms. Compounds 3 and 4 also exhibited synergistic activities with amphotericin B against C. albicans and other clinical Candida isolates by enhancing the potency of amphotericin B up to 8-fold against cells in both developing and established biofilms. These data suggest that the Candida biofilm disruption and amphotericin B potentiating effects of 3 and 4 could be mediated through multiple biological targets. The shearinines are good tools for testing the potential advantages of using adjunctive therapies in combination with antifungals.	0
Abstract2class: Modulation and Visualization of EF-G Power Stroke During Ribosomal Translocation Abstract: During ribosome translocation, the elongation factor EF-G undergoes large conformational change while maintaining its contact with the moving tRNA. We previously measured a power stroke accompanying EF-G catalysis, which was consistent with structural studies. However, the role of power stroke in translocation fidelity remains unclear. Here, we report quantitative measurements of the power strokes of structurally modified EF-Gs by using two different techniques and reveal the correlation between power stroke and translocation efficiency and fidelity. We discovered that the reduced power stroke only lowered the percentage of translocation but did not introduce translocation error. The established force -structure-function correlation for EF-G indicates that power stroke drives ribosomal translocation, but the mRNA reading frame is probably maintained by ribosome itself. Furthermore, the microscope detection method reported here can be simply implemented for other biochemical applications.	0
Abstract2class: Ac-induced disruption of the double Ds structure in tomato Abstract: The maize doubleDs element is stably maintained in the tomato genome. Upon the subsequent introduction of Ac into a plant containing doubleDs, disruption of the doubleDs structure and DNA rearrangements at the site of the doubleDs element were observed. No indications were obtained for excision of the complete doubleDs structure. The consequences of transactivation of doubleDs in these experiments are different from those described for transactivation of single Ds elements in tomato. The mechanisms by which such rearrangements could have occurred in tomato are discussed in relation to complex insertions containing doubleDs in maize.	0
Abstract2class: Regulation of the biosynthesis of thiopeptide antibiotic cyclothiazomycin by the transcriptional regulator SHJG8833 in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 Abstract: Cyclothiazomycin is a member of the thiopeptide antibiotics, which are usually complicated derivatives of ribosomally synthesized peptides. A gene cluster containing 12 ORFs identical to the clt cluster encoding cyclothiazomycin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 was revealed by genome sequencing in S. hygroscopicus 5008. Genes SHJG8833 and SHJG8837 of the cluster and flanking gene SHJG8838 were predicted to encode regulatory proteins from different families. In this study, we showed that the newly identified cluster is functional and we investigated the roles of these regulatory genes in the regulation of cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis. We determined that SHJG8833, but not SHJG8837 or SHJG8838, is critical for cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis. The transcriptional start point of SHJG8833 was located to a thymidine 54 nt upstream of the start codon. Inactivation of SHJG8833 abrogated the production of cyclothiazomycin, and synthesis could be restored by reintroducing SHJG8833 into the mutant strain. Gene expression analyses indicated that SHJG8833 regulates a consecutive set of seven genes from SHJG8826 to SHJG8832, whose products are predicted to be involved in different steps in the construction of the main framework of cyclothiazomycin. Transcriptional analysis indicated that these seven genes may form two operons, SHJG8826-27 and SHJG8828-32. Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that the DNA-binding domain of SHJG8833 binds the promoters of SHJG8826 and SHJG8828 and sequences internal to SHJG8826 and SHJG8829, and a conserved binding sequence was deduced. These results indicate that SHJG8833 is a positive regulator that controls cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis by activating structural genes in the clt cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation of sabin-like polioviruses from wastewater in a country using inactivated polio vaccine Abstract: From 2001 to 2004, Switzerland switched from routine vaccination with oral polio vaccine (OPV) to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), using both vaccines in the intervening period. Since IPV is less effective at inducing mucosal immunity than OPV, this change might allow imported poliovirus to circulate undetected more easily in an increasingly IPV-immunized population. Environmental monitoring is a recognized tool for identifying polioviruses in a community. To look for evidence of poliovirus circulation following cessation of OPV use, two sewage treatment plants located in the Zurich area were sampled from 2004 to 2006. Following virus isolation using either RD or L20B cells, enteroviruses and polioviruses were identified by reverse transcription-PCR. A total of 20 out of 174 wastewater samples were positive for 62 Sabin-like isolates. One isolate from each poliovirus-positive sample was analyzed in more detail. Sequencing the complete viral protein 1 (VP1) capsid coding region, as well as intratypic differentiation (ITD), identified 3 Sabin type 1, 13 Sabin type 2, and 4 Sabin type 3 strains. One serotype 1 strain showed a discordant result in the ITD. Three-quarters of the strains showed mutations within the 5' untranslated region and VP1, known to be associated with reversion to virulence. Moreover, three strains showed heterotypic recombination (S2/S1 and S3/S2/S3). The low number of synonymous mutations and the partial temperature sensitivity are not consistent with extended circulation of these Sabin virus strains. Nevertheless, the continuous introduction of polioviruses into the community emphasizes the necessity for uninterrupted child vaccination to maintain high herd immunity.	0
Abstract2class: Genome Mining Reveals Neurospora crassa Can Produce the Salicylaldehyde Sordarial Abstract: A highly reducing polyketide synthase gene cluster from the Magnaporthe oryzae genome was previously identified to produce phytotoxic compounds including pyriculol. A homologous gene cluster was found in Neurospora crassa through bioinformatics analysis. Heterologous expression of this cluster led to the production of the salicylic aldehyde sordarial and related intermediates. A series of combinatorial gene expression experiments established the set of enzymes required to produce sordarial and the likely biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Versatile Interacting Peptide (VIP) Tags for Labeling Proteins with Bright Chemical Reporters Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool for the biosciences, enabling the direct observation of proteins in their cellular environment. New methods that facilitate attachment of photostable synthetic fluorophores with genetic specificity are needed to advance the frontiers of biological imaging. Here, we describe a new set of small, selective, genetically encoded tags for proteins based on a heterodimeric coiled-coil interaction between two peptides: CoilY and CoilZ. Proteins expressed as a fusion to CoilZ were selectively labeled with the complementary CoilY fluorescent probe peptide. Fluorophore-labeled target proteins were readily detected in cell lysates with high specificity and sensitivity. We found that these versatile interacting peptide (VIP) tags allowed rapid and specific delivery of bright organic dyes or quantum dots to proteins displayed on living cells. Additionally, we validated that either CoilY or CoilZ could serve as the VIP tag, which enabled us to observe two distinct cell-surface protein targets with this one heterodimeric pair.	0
Abstract2class: Carbohydrate post-glycosylational modifications Abstract: Carbohydrate modification is a common phenomenon in nature. Many carbohydrate modifications such as some epimerization, O-acetylation, O-sulfation, O-methylation, N-deacetylation, and N-sulfation, take place after the formation of oligosaccharide or polysaccharide backbones. These modifications can be categorized as carbohydrate post-glycosylational modifications (PGMs). Carbohydrate PGMs further extend the complexity of the structures and the synthesis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. They also increase the capacity of the biological regulation that is achieved by finely tuning the structures of carbohydrates. Developing efficient methods to obtain structurally defined naturally occurring oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates with carbohydrate PGMs is essential for understanding the biological significance of carbohydrate PGMs. Combined with high-throughput screening methods, synthetic carbohydrates with PGMs are invaluable probes in structure-activity relationship studies. We illustrate here several classes of carbohydrates with PGMs and their applications. Recent progress in chemical, enzymatic, and chemoenzymatic syntheses of these carbohydrates and their derivatives are also presented.	0
Abstract2class: A fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 and the genetic basis for B versus C fumonisin production Abstract: Most species of Fusarium that produce fumonisin mycotoxins produce predominantly B fumonisins (FBs). However, Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 produces predominantly C fumonisins (FCs). In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster in strain O-1890 was determined. The order and orientation of FUM genes were the same as in the previously described clusters in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum. Coding regions of F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides FUM genes were 88-92% identical, but regions flanking the clusters did not share significant identity. The FUM cluster gene FUM8 encodes an alpha-oxoamine synthase, and fum8 mutants of F. verticillioides do not produce fumonisins. Complementation of a fum8 mutant with the F. verticillioidesFUM8 restored FB production. Complementation with F. oxysporumFUM8 also restored production, but the fumonisins produced were predominantly FCs. These data indicate that different orthologues of FUM8 determine whether Fusarium produces predominantly FBs or FCs.	1
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster of Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 Abstract: Industrial strain improvement via classical mutagenesis is a black box approach. In an attempt to learn from and understand the mutations introduced, we cloned and characterized the amplified region of industrial penicillin production strains. Upon amplification of this region Penicillium chrysogenum is capable of producing an increased amount of antibiotics, as was previously reported [Barredo, J.L., Diez, B., Alvarez, E., Martín, J.F., 1989a. Large amplification of a 35-kb DNA fragment carrying two penicillin biosynthetic genes in high yielding strains of Penicillium chrysogenum. Curr. Genet. 16, 453-459; Newbert, R.W., Barton, B., Greaves, P., Harper, J., Turner, G., 1997. Analysis of a commercially improved Penicillium chrysogenum strain series, involvement of recombinogenic regions in amplification and deletion of the penicillin gene cluster. J. Ind. Microbiol. 19, 18-27]. Bioinformatic analysis of the central 56.9kb, present as six direct repeats in the strains analyzed in this study, predicted 15 Open Reading Frames (ORFs). Besides the three penicillin biosynthetic genes (pcbAB, pcbC and penDE) only one ORF has an orthologue of known function in the database: the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ERG25. Surprisingly, many genes known to encode direct or indirect steps beta-lactam biosynthesis like phenyl acetic acid CoA ligase and transporters are not present. Detailed analyses reveal a detectable transcript for most of the predicted ORFs under the conditions tested. We have studied the role of these in relation to penicillin production and amplification of the biosynthetic gene cluster. In contrast to what was expected, the genes encoding the three penicillin biosynthetic enzymes alone are sufficient to restore full beta-lactam synthesis in a mutant lacking the complete region. Therefore, the role of the other 12 ORFs in this region seems irrelevant for penicillin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Identification, Characterization, and Synthesis of Natural Parasitic Cysteine Protease Inhibitors: Pentacitidins Are More Potent Falcitidin Analogues Abstract: Protease inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as malaria and human African trypanosomiasis. Falcitidin was the first member of a new class of inhibitors of falcipain-2, a cysteine protease of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Using a metabolomics dataset of 25 Chitinophaga strains for molecular networking enabled identification of over 30 natural analogues of falcitidin. Based on MS/MS spectra, they vary in their amino acid chain length, sequence, acyl residue, and C-terminal functionalization; therefore, they were grouped into the four falcitidin peptide families A-D. The isolation, characterization, and absolute structure elucidation of two falcitidin-related pentapeptide aldehyde analogues by extensive MS/MS spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy in combination with advanced Marfey's analysis was in agreement with the in silico analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Total synthesis of chosen pentapeptide analogues followed by in vitro testing against a panel of proteases revealed selective parasitic cysteine protease inhibition and, additionally, low-micromolar inhibition of α-chymotrypsin. The pentapeptides investigated here showed superior inhibitory activity compared to falcitidin.	1
Abstract2class: The dnaK protein of Escherichia coli possesses an ATPase and autophosphorylating activity and is essential in an in vitro DNA replication system Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaK gene product, originally defined by mutations that blocked lambda phage DNA replication, is known to be necessary for E. coli viability. We have purified dnaK protein to homogeneity and have demonstrated that it possesses a weak DNA-independent ATPase activity, which results in the production of ADP and Pi. The proof that this ATPase activity is encoded by the dnaK+ gene relies primarily on the fact that the dnaK756 mutation results in the production of an ATPase activity with altered physical properties. The dnaK protein is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo, probably as a result of an autophosphorylation reaction. The lambda O and P replication proteins were shown to interact in vitro with the dnaK protein. The ATPase activity of the dnaK protein was inhibited by purified lambda P protein and stimulated by purified lambda O protein. Moreover, the dnaK protein participates in the initiation of DNA synthesis in an in vitro DNA replication system that is dependent on the O and P proteins. Anti-dnaK protein immunoglobulin specifically inhibited DNA synthesis in this system.	0
Abstract2class: Target-selected gene inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans by using a frozen transposon insertion mutant bank Abstract: To understand how genotype determines the phenotype of the animal Caenorhabditis elegans, one ideally needs to know the complete sequence of the genome and the contribution of genes to phenotype, which requires an efficient strategy for reverse genetics. We here report that the Tc1 transposon induces frequent deletions of flanking DNA, apparently resulting from Tc1 excision followed by imprecise DNA repair. We use this to inactivate genes in two steps. (i) We established a frozen library of 5000 nematode lines mutagenized by Tc1 insertion, from which insertion mutants of genes of interest can be recovered. Their address within the library is determined by PCR. (ii) Animals are then screened, again by PCR, to detect derivatives in which Tc1 and 1000-2000 base pairs of flanking DNA are deleted, and thus a gene of interest is inactivated. We have thus far isolated Tc1 insertions in 16 different genes and obtained deletion derivatives of 6 of those.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of genes required for biosynthesis and transport of the siderophore vibrioferrin in Vibrio parahaemolyticus Abstract: In response to low iron availability, Vibrio parahaemolyticus synthesizes and secretes a polyhydroxycarboxylate-type siderophore vibrioferrin which is composed of 1 mol each of 2-ketoglutaric acid, L-alanine, ethanolamine, and citric acid. We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of the pvuA gene, which encodes the 78-kDa outer membrane receptor protein for ferric vibrioferrin. In this study, nine genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of vibrioferrin have been identified in the genomic regions surrounding the pvuA gene. The genes were sequenced, and gene disruptants were constructed by insertion mutation for phenotype analysis. Five of the genes, named pvsABCDE, constitute an operon that is expressed under iron-limiting conditions. Homology searches of their predicted protein products suggested that the four genes pvsABDE are implicated in the biosynthesis of the siderophore. Another gene in the same operon, pvsC, encodes a putative exporter that is homologous to members of the major facilitator superfamily of multidrug efflux pumps. The remaining four genes, named pvuBCDE, encode proteins strongly homologous to Escherichia coli FecBCDE, respectively, which are components of the ATP-binding cassette transporter system for ferric dicitrate. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that these transport genes are transcribed as a single mRNA with the upstream genes, psuA and pvuA. Phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions for the respective operons that were expected on the basis of the homology search.	1
Abstract2class: Genomics-driven discovery of PKS-NRPS hybrid metabolites from Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: In the postgenomic era it has become increasingly apparent that the vast number of predicted biosynthesis genes of microorganisms is not reflected by the metabolic profile observed under standard fermentation conditions. In the absence of a particular (in most cases unknown) trigger these gene loci remain silent. Because these cryptic gene clusters may code for the biosynthesis of important virulence factors, toxins, or even drug candidates, new strategies for their activation are urgently needed to make use of this largely untapped reservoir of potentially bioactive compounds. The discovery of new microbial metabolites through genome mining has proven to be a very promising approach. Even so, the investigation of silent gene clusters is still a substantial challenge, particularly in fungi. Here we report a new strategy for the successful induction of a silent metabolic pathway in the important model organism Aspergillus nidulans, which led to the discovery of novel PKS-NRPS hybrid metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Plasticity and evolution of aeruginosin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria Abstract: Aeruginosins are bioactive oligopeptides that are produced in high structural diversity by strains of the bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera Microcystis and Planktothrix. A hallmark of aeruginosins is the unusual Choi moiety central to the tetrapeptides, while other positions are occupied by variable moieties in individual congeners. Here we report on three aeruginosin synthetase gene clusters (aer) of Microcystis aeruginosa (strains PCC 7806, NIES-98, and NIES-843). The analysis and comparison the aer gene clusters provide the first insight into the molecular basis of biosynthetic and structural plasticity in aeruginosin pathways. Major parts of the aer gene clusters are highly similar in all strains, particularly the genes coding for the first three nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules except for the region coding for the second adenylation domain. However, the gene clusters differ largely in genes coding for tailoring enzymes such as halogenases and sulfotransferases, reflecting structural peculiarities in aeruginosin congeners produced by the individual strains. Significant deviations were further observed in the C-terminal NRPS modules, suggesting two distinct release mechanisms. The architecture of the gene clusters is in agreement with the particular aeruginosin variants that are produced by individual strains, the structures of two of which (aeruginosins 686 A and 686 B) were elucidated. The aer gene clusters of Microcystis and Planktothrix are proposed to originate from a common ancestor and to have evolved to their present-day diversity largely through horizontal gene transfer and recombination events.	1
Abstract2class: Patterns of yeast diversity distribution and its drivers in rhizosphere soil of Hami melon orchards in different regions of Xinjiang Abstract: Background:                       The unique climatic conditions of the Xinjiang region nurture rich melon and fruit resources, the melon and fruit sugar sources provide sufficient nutrients for the survival of yeast, and the diverse habitats accompanied by extreme climatic conditions promote the production of yeast diversity and strain resources. However, the relationship between yeast species and their relationship with environmental factors in the soil of Xinjiang specialty cash crop Hami melon is not clear. Here, we aimed to characterize the diversity, community structure, and relationship between yeast species and environmental factors in Hami melon orchards soils in different regions of Xinjiang, China.                  Results:                       Based on Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing analysis of the D1 domain of the LSU rRNA genes, the community richness of yeast in the soil of Northern Xinjiang was higher than in the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang, but the community diversity was significantly lower in the Northern Xinjiang than in the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang. A total of 86 OTUs were classified into 59 genera and 86 species. Most OTUs (90.4%) belonged to the Basidiomycota; only a few (9.6%) belonged to Ascomycota. The most dominant species in the Southern, Eastern and Northern Xinjiang were Filobasidium magnum (17.90%), Solicoccozyma aeria (35.83%) and Filobasidium magnum (75.36%), respectively. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the yeast community composition in the soils of the three regions were obviously different, with the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang having more similar yeast community. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil factors such as conductivity (CO), total phosphorus (TP) and Total potassium (TK) and climate factors such as average annual precipitation (PRCP), relative humidity (RH) and net solar radiation intensity (SWGNT) were significantly correlated with yeast communities (P < 0.05).                  Conclusion:                       There are abundant yeast resources in the rhizosphere soil of Hami melon orchard in Xinjiang, and there are obvious differences in the diversity and community structure of yeast in the three regions of Xinjiang. Differences in climatic factors related to precipitation, humidity and solar radiation intensity and soil factors related to conductivity, total phosphorus and total potassium are key factors driving yeast diversity and community structure.	0
Abstract2class: Chiral gold nanowires with Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal structure Abstract: A Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal (BCB) helix is made of linearly stacked regular tetrahedra (tetrahelix). As such, it is chiral without nontrivial translational or rotational symmetries. We demonstrate here an example of the chiral BCB structure made of totally symmetrical gold atoms, created in nanowires by direct chemical synthesis. Detailed study by high-resolution electron microscopy illustrates their elegant chiral structure and the unique one-dimensional "pseudo-periodicity". The BCB-type atomic packing mode is proposed to be a result of the competition and compromise between the lattice and surface energy.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic and transcriptional analysis of the siderophore malleobactin biosynthesis and transport genes in the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen that causes melioidosis, an invasive disease of humans and animals. To address the response of this bacterium to iron-limiting conditions, we first performed a global transcriptional analysis of RNA extracted from bacteria grown under iron-limiting and iron-rich conditions by microarrays. We focused our study on those open reading frames (ORFs) induced under iron limitation, which encoded predicted proteins that could be involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of the siderophore malleobactin. We purified this siderophore and determined that it consisted of at least three compounds with different molecular weights. We demonstrated that ORFs BPSL1776 and BPSL1774, designated mbaA and mbaF, respectively, are involved in the biosynthesis of malleobactin, while BPSL1775, named fmtA, is involved in its transport. These genes are in an operon with two other ORFs (mbaJ and mbaI) whose transcription is under the control of MbaS, a protein that belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors. Interestingly, the transcription of the mbaA, fmtA, and mbaS genes is not controlled by the availability of the siderophore malleobactin.	1
Abstract2class: Expression and promoter characterization of BbPacC, a pH response transcription factor gene of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: To survive, the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, which shows promise as a biocontrol agent for a variety of pests, including agricultural and forestry pests and vectors of human pathogens, must tailor gene expression to the particular pH of its environment. The pH response transcription factor gene BbPacC and its flanking sequence were cloned from this fungus. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed that it is highly induced by alkaline pH and salt stress, and the expression level achieved twice that of the housekeeping gene γ-actin. A microfluorometric assay indicated that the 1479 bp promoter region could activate the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the same conditions. Truncation analysis showed that the 1479, 1274, 1040, 888 and 742 bp promoters have similar efficiencies in activating expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS). The GUS activities of corresponding transformants reached approximately 50 % that of those containing the strong constitutive promoter PtrpC. A truncation upstream at the -572 bp position (referenced to the translation start codon ATG), however, resulted in a significant loss of GUS activity. Both the upstream absences of the -502 and -387 bp positions caused almost complete loss of GUS activity. These results suggest that PPacC is an efficient, alkaline, and salt-inducible promoter, the core cis-elements are mainly located within the -742 to -502 bp region, and promoters equal to or longer than 742 bp may be feasible for regulating gene expression in response to an ambient pH or salt stress.	0
Abstract2class: From synthesis to biologics: preclinical data on a chemistry derived anticancer vaccine Abstract: A fully synthetic anticancer vaccine 2 has been prepared via bioconjugation of unimolecular pentavalent construct 1-containing five prostate and breast cancer associated carbohydrate antigens, Globo-H, GM2, STn, TF and Tn-to maleimide-modified carrier protein KLH. An improved conjugation protocol has been developed, which allowed us to obtain a higher epitope ratio of the unimolecular pentavalent glycopeptide antigen to the carrier protein (505/1 versus 228/1 for the previous version). KLH conjugate 2 has been subsequently submitted to preclinical immunogenic evaluation in mice in the presence of QS-21 as an adjuvant. Through standard ELISA assay, this vaccine candidate showed high promise in inducing IgG and IgM antibodies against each of the five individual carbohydrate antigens. In addition, FACS analysis indicated that these antibodies were able to react with MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines expressing these five carbohydrate antigens.	0
Abstract2class: Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation Abstract: Recent advances in peroxidase-mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high-resolution and subcellular compartment-specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2 O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence-independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.	0
Abstract2class: Analogues of the Potent Antitumor Compound Leiodermatolide from a Deep-Water Sponge of the Genus Leiodermatium Abstract: Two new analogues of the potent antitumor compound leiodermatolide, which we call leiodermatolides B and C, have been isolated from specimens of a deep-water sponge of the genus Leiodermatium collected off Florida. The compounds were purified using standard chromatographic methods, and the structures defined through interpretation of the HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR data. Leiodermatolide B (2) lacks the C-21 hydroxy group found in leiodermatolide and has equal potency as the parent compound, providing a simpler analogue for possible clinical development. It inhibits the proliferation of the AsPC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line with an IC50 of 43 nM. Leiodermatolide C (3) has a modified macrolide ring and is over 85-fold less potent with an IC50 of 3.7 μM against the same cell line. These compounds add to the knowledge of the pharmacophore of this class of potent antitumor agents.	0
Abstract2class: Glycogenomics as a mass spectrometry-guided genome-mining method for microbial glycosylated molecules Abstract: Glycosyl groups are an essential mediator of molecular interactions in cells and on cellular surfaces. There are very few methods that directly relate sugar-containing molecules to their biosynthetic machineries. Here, we introduce glycogenomics as an experiment-guided genome-mining approach for fast characterization of glycosylated natural products (GNPs) and their biosynthetic pathways from genome-sequenced microbes by targeting glycosyl groups in microbial metabolomes. Microbial GNPs consist of aglycone and glycosyl structure groups in which the sugar unit(s) are often critical for the GNP's bioactivity, e.g., by promoting binding to a target biomolecule. GNPs are a structurally diverse class of molecules with important pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Herein, O- and N-glycosyl groups are characterized in their sugar monomers by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and matched to corresponding glycosylation genes in secondary metabolic pathways by a MS-glycogenetic code. The associated aglycone biosynthetic genes of the GNP genotype then classify the natural product to further guide structure elucidation. We highlight the glycogenomic strategy by the characterization of several bioactive glycosylated molecules and their gene clusters, including the anticancer agent cinerubin B from Streptomyces sp. SPB74 and an antibiotic, arenimycin B, from Salinispora arenicola CNB-527.	1
Abstract2class: FW0622, a new siderophore isolated from marine Verrucosispora sp. by genomic mining Abstract: Using the draft genome sequence of Verrucosispora sp. FIM060022, we have identified a new desferrioxamine-like siderophore, FW0622. This is the first chemically characterized siderophore obtained from Verrucosispora. The structure was elucidated by extensive spectral analyses. The biosynthetic pathway of FW0622 was proposed to occur via the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent (NIS) synthetase pathway based on the putative biosynthetic siderophore gene cluster in FIM060022. The results demonstrate that marine-derived Verrucosispora species deserve recognition as an important source of new natural products. Furthermore, this study verified that genome mining is an effective way to identify compounds that may be overlooked by traditional methods.	1
Abstract2class: Assessing the regioselectivity of OleD-catalyzed glycosylation with a diverse set of acceptors Abstract: To explore the acceptor regioselectivity of OleD-catalyzed glucosylation, the products of OleD-catalyzed reactions with six structurally diverse acceptors flavones- (daidzein), isoflavones (flavopiridol), stilbenes (resveratrol), indole alkaloids (10-hydroxycamptothecin), and steroids (2-methoxyestradiol)-were determined. This study highlights the first synthesis of flavopiridol and 2-methoxyestradiol glucosides and confirms the ability of OleD to glucosylate both aromatic and aliphatic nucleophiles. In all cases, molecular dynamics simulations were consistent with the determined product distribution and suggest the potential to develop a virtual screening model to identify additional OleD substrates.	0
Abstract2class: Activation and Identification of a Griseusin Cluster in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by Employing Transcriptional Regulators and Multi-Omics Methods Abstract: Streptomyces are well-known producers of a range of different secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. Recently, it has been demonstrated that "silent" biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be activated by heterologously expressing transcriptional regulators from other BGCs. Here, we have activated a silent BGC in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by overexpression of a set of SARP family transcriptional regulators. The structure of the produced compound was elucidated by NMR and found to be an N-acetyl cysteine adduct of the pyranonaphtoquinone polyketide 3'-O-α-d-forosaminyl-(+)-griseusin A. Employing a combination of multi-omics and metabolic engineering techniques, we identified the responsible BGC. These methods include genome mining, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, in combination with CRISPR induced gene inactivations and expression of the BGC in a heterologous host strain. This work demonstrates an easy-to-implement workflow of how silent BGCs can be activated, followed by the identification and characterization of the produced compound, the responsible BGC, and hints of its biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous expression of the avirulence gene ACE1 from the fungal rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: The ACE1 and RAP1 genes from the avirulence signalling gene cluster of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae were expressed in Aspergillus oryzae and M. oryzae itself. Expression of ACE1 alone produced a polyenyl pyrone (magnaporthepyrone), which is regioselectively epoxidised and hydrolysed to give different diols, 6 and 7, in the two host organisms. Analysis of the three introns present in ACE1 determined that A. oryzae does not process intron 2 correctly, while M. oryzae processes all introns correctly in both appressoria and mycelia. Co-expression of ACE1 and RAP1 in A. oryzae produced an amide 8 which is similar to the PKS-NRPS derived backbone of the cytochalasans. Biological testing on rice leaves showed that neither the diols 6 and 7, nor amide 8 was responsible for the observed ACE1 mediated avirulence, however, gene cluster analysis suggests that the true avirulence signalling compound may be a tyrosine-derived cytochalasan compound.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of a female genital complex cDNA from the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica Abstract: A cDNA clone whose RNA is abundant in the female genital complex of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica has been isolated from a cDNA library in lambda gt10 by differential screening. The pattern of expression in different fluke tissues and at different stages of miracidium formation suggests that this gene is expressed in the F. hepatica vitelleria. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA was determined and the primary structure of the putative protein was deduced. The proposed protein is rich in glycine, lysine, and tyrosine and its overall amino acid composition agrees with that reported for the F. hepatica egg shell. The clone has homology with DNA from other trematodes; this homology is higher in organisms in which egg development is similar to that of F. hepatica and suggests that the protein is conserved in organisms in which miracidium formation occurs in fresh water.	0
Abstract2class: Effect of increased dosage of the ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster on ML-236B production in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis has recently been characterized from P. citrinum No. 41520. Here, we describe how the ML-236B-producing strain was improved using a cosmid-mediated recombination technique. The introduction of the cosmid pML48, which contains seven of the nine ML-236B biosynthetic genes, into P. citrinum No. 41520 resulted in transformants which produced increased amounts of ML-236B. Southern analysis showed that pML48 had been incorporated by a homologous recombination event, and all high producers possessed two copies of each of the seven genes, mlcA- mlcF and mlcR, suggesting that increased dosage of the biosynthetic gene cluster was responsible for the enhanced production of ML-236B. On the other hand, various kinds of mutants with decreased titers of ML-236B were also obtained. Characterization of one such mutant, designated as T48.28, which was more sensitive to ML-236B than the parental strain, suggested that one of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes, mlcD, which encodes a putative HMG-CoA reductase, was involved in conferring resistance to ML-236B.	1
Abstract2class: Cacaoidin, First Member of the New Lanthidin RiPP Family Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) characterized by the presence of lanthionine or methyllanthionine rings and their antimicrobial activity. Cacaoidin, a novel glycosylated lantibiotic, was isolated from a Streptomyces cacaoi strain and fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, chemical derivatization approaches and genome analysis. The new molecule combines outstanding structural features, such as a high number of d-amino acids, an uncommon glycosylated tyrosine residue and an unprecedented N,N-dimethyl lanthionine. This latter feature places cacaoidin within a new RiPP family located between lanthipeptides and linaridins, here termed lanthidins. Cacaoidin displayed potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Clostridium difficile. The biosynthetic gene cluster showed low homology with those of other known lanthipeptides or linaridins, suggesting a new RiPP biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Caelestines A-D, brominated quinolinecarboxylic acids from the Australian ascidian Aplidium caelestis Abstract: Four new brominated natural products, caelestines A-D (1-4), have been isolated from the Australian ascidian Aplidium caelestis. The structures of 1-4 were determined by analysis of their NMR and MS data. This is the first report of brominated quinolinecarboxylic acids from nature. Compound 1 has been previously synthesized but not spectroscopically characterized. Compounds 1-4 were tested against three mammalian cell lines (MCF-7, NFF, and MM96L) and a panel of microbial strains and showed only minor cytotoxicity.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular resolution imaging by post-labeling expansion single-molecule localization microscopy (Ex-SMLM) Abstract: Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables super-resolution fluorescence imaging of physically expanded biological samples with conventional microscopes. By combining ExM with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) it is potentially possible to approach the resolution of electron microscopy. However, current attempts to combine both methods remained challenging because of protein and fluorophore loss during digestion or denaturation, gelation, and the incompatibility of expanded polyelectrolyte hydrogels with photoswitching buffers. Here we show that re-embedding of expanded hydrogels enables dSTORM imaging of expanded samples and demonstrate that post-labeling ExM resolves the current limitations of super-resolution microscopy. Using microtubules as a reference structure and centrioles, we demonstrate that post-labeling Ex-SMLM preserves ultrastructural details, improves the labeling efficiency and reduces the positional error arising from linking fluorophores into the gel thus paving the way for super-resolution imaging of immunolabeled endogenous proteins with true molecular resolution.	0
Abstract2class: Putative sigma factor SigI (YkoZ) of Bacillus subtilis is induced by heat shock Abstract: A Bacillus subtilis disruption mutant with a mutation in sigI (formerly ykoZ) shows a temperature-sensitive growth on agar plates. The transcription of the sigI gene is heat shock induced in rich medium but not in minimal medium. Proteome studies revealed a reduced amount of GsiB protein in the sigI mutant under heat shock conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Evolution of vitamin B2 biosynthesis: 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases of Brucella Abstract: The penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2) involves the condensation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate with 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, which is catalyzed by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (lumazine synthase). Pathogenic Brucella species adapted to an intracellular lifestyle have two genes involved in riboflavin synthesis, ribH1 and ribH2, which are located on different chromosomes. The ribH2 gene was shown previously to specify a lumazine synthase (type II lumazine synthase) with an unusual decameric structure and a very high Km for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. Moreover, the protein was found to be an immunodominant Brucella antigen and was able to generate strong humoral as well as cellular immunity against Brucella abortus in mice. We have now cloned and expressed the ribH1 gene, which is located inside a small riboflavin operon, together with two other putative riboflavin biosynthesis genes and the nusB gene, specifying an antitermination factor. The RibH1 protein (type I lumazine synthase) is a homopentamer catalyzing the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at a rate of 18 nmol mg(-1) min(-1). Sequence comparison of lumazine synthases from archaea, bacteria, plants, and fungi suggests a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases.	0
Abstract2class: The paralogous pairs of genes involved in clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis are differently regulated in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Carboxyethylarginine synthase, encoded by the paralogous ceaS1 and ceaS2 genes, catalyzes the first reaction in the shared biosynthetic pathway leading to clavulanic acid and the other clavam metabolites in Streptomyces clavuligerus. The nutritional regulation of ceaS1 and ceaS2 expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR and by the use of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-encoding gene (egfp) as a reporter. ceaS1 was transcribed in complex soy medium only, whereas ceaS2 was transcribed in both soy and defined starch-asparagine (SA) media. The transcriptional start points of the two genes were also mapped to a C residue 98 bp upstream of ceaS1 and a G residue 51 bp upstream of the ceaS2 start codon by S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses. Furthermore, transcriptional mapping of the genes encoding the beta-lactam synthetase (bls1) and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah1) isoenzymes from the paralogue gene cluster indicated that a single polycistronic transcript of approximately 4.9 kb includes ceaS1, bls1, and pah1. The expression of ceaS1 and ceaS2 in a mutant strain defective in the regulatory protein CcaR was also examined. ceaS1 transcription was not affected in the ccaR mutant, whereas that of ceaS2 was greatly reduced compared to the wild-type strain. Overall, our results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in regulating the expression of ceaS1 and ceaS2, and presumably also of other paralogous genes that encode proteins involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Facile synthesis of the trans-fused azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane core of the palau'amines and the tricyclic core of the axinellamines from a common intermediate Abstract: A facile synthesis of the trans-fused azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane core of palau'amine and related pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids is described. Following gamma-lactam cleavage with concomitant epimerization at C12 of a previously reported tricycle, a facile intramolecular Mitsunobu reaction delivered the fully functionalized tricyclic core common to several members of the oroidin-derived alkaloids including palau'amine. An alternative cyclization of a related intermediate provides the tricyclic "aza-angular triquinane" core of the axinellamines.	0
Abstract2class: High order quaternary arrangement confers increased structural stability to Brucella sp. lumazine synthase Abstract: The penultimate step in the pathway of riboflavin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase (LS). One of the most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is the structural quaternary divergence found in different species. The protein exists as pentameric and icosahedral forms, built from practically the same structural monomeric unit. The pentameric structure is formed by five 18-kDa monomers, each extensively contacting neighboring monomers. The icosahedrical structure consists of 60 LS monomers arranged as 12 pentamers giving rise to a capsid exhibiting icosahedral 532 symmetry. In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. The Brucella sp. lumazine synthase (BLS) sequence clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate its quaternary arrangement. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analyses that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for lumazine synthases. We also describe by spectroscopic studies the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of this macromolecular assembly. The higher molecular order of BLS increases its stability 20 degrees C compared with pentameric lumazine synthases. The decameric arrangement described in this work highlights the importance of quaternary interactions in the stabilization of proteins.	0
Abstract2class: Hypotension, autonomic failure, and cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice overexpressing the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor Abstract: alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D)) are regulators of systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow. Whereas vasoconstrictory action of the alpha(1A) and alpha(1D) subtypes is thought to be mainly responsible for this activity, the role of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1B)AR) in this process is controversial. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress either wild type or constitutively active alpha(1B)ARs. Transgenic expression was under the control of the isogenic promoter, thus assuring appropriate developmental and tissue-specific expression. Cardiovascular phenotypes displayed by transgenic mice included myocardial hypertrophy and hypotension. Indicative of cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mice displayed an increased heart to body weight ratio, which was confirmed by the echocardiographic finding of an increased thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall. Functional deficits included an increased isovolumetric relaxation time, a decreased heart rate, and cardiac output. Transgenic mice were hypotensive and exhibited a decreased pressor response. Vasoconstrictory regulation by alpha(1B)AR was absent as shown by the lack of phenylephrine-induced contractile differences between ex vivo mesenteric artery preparations. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels were also reduced in transgenic mice, suggesting a loss of sympathetic nerve activity. Reduced catecholamine levels together with basal hypotension, bradycardia, reproductive problems, and weight loss suggest autonomic failure, a phenotype that is consistent with the multiple system atrophy-like neurodegeneration that has been reported previously in these mice. These results also suggest that this receptor subtype is not involved in the classic vasoconstrictory action of alpha(1)ARs that is important in systemic regulation of blood pressure.	0
Abstract2class: A whole-genome shotgun optical map of Yersinia pestis strain KIM Abstract: Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plagues (also known as black death) and has been responsible for recurrent devastating pandemics throughout history. To further understand this virulent bacterium and to accelerate an ongoing sequencing project, two whole-genome restriction maps (XhoI and PvuII) of Y. pestis strain KIM were constructed using shotgun optical mapping. This approach constructs ordered restriction maps from randomly sheared individual DNA molecules directly extracted from cells. The two maps served different purposes; the XhoI map facilitated sequence assembly by providing a scaffold for high-resolution alignment, while the PvuII map verified genome sequence assembly. Our results show that such maps facilitated the closure of sequence gaps and, most importantly, provided a purely independent means for sequence validation. Given the recent advancements to the optical mapping system, increased resolution and throughput are enabling such maps to guide sequence assembly at a very early stage of a microbial sequencing project.	0
Abstract2class: Metabolic coupling of dehydration and decarboxylation in the curacin A pathway: functional identification of a mechanistically diverse enzyme pair Abstract: This study describes the functional identification of a pair of mechanistically diverse enzymes that catalyze the successive dehydration (CurE ECH1) and decarboxylation (CurF ECH2) of (S)-HMG-ACP to generate a 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP intermediate, the presumed precursor of the cyclopropyl ring in curacin A. The reactions catalyzed by ECH1 and ECH2 are found in a broad cross-section of microbial natural product gene clusters and participate in the introduction of carbon chain branch points and functional group diversity as key steps in the HMG-CoA synthase mediated addition of C-2 from acetate to the beta-carbonyl group of polyketide chains.	1
Abstract2class: Clustered genes involved in cyclopiazonic acid production are next to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in Aspergillus flavus Abstract: Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), an indole-tetramic acid mycotoxin, is produced by many species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. In addition to CPA Aspergillus flavus produces polyketide-derived carcinogenic aflatoxins. Aflatoxin biosynthesis genes form a gene cluster in a subtelomeric region. Isolates of A. flavus lacking aflatoxin production due to the loss of the entire aflatoxin gene cluster and portions of the subtelomeric region are often unable to produce CPA, which suggests a physical link of genes involved in CPA biosynthesis to the aflatoxin gene cluster. Examining the subtelomeric region in A. flavus isolates of different chemotypes revealed a region possibly associated with CPA production. Disruption of three of the four genes present in this region predicted to encode a monoamine oxidase, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase, and a hybrid polyketide non-ribosomal peptide synthase abolished CPA production in an aflatoxigenic A. flavus strain. Therefore, some of the CPA biosynthesis genes are organized in a mini-gene cluster that is next to the aflatoxin gene cluster in A. flavus.	1
Abstract2class: Cylindrical superparticles from semiconductor nanorods Abstract: In this communication, we report a synthesis of anisotropic colloidal superparticles (SPs) from CdSe/CdS semiconductor nanorods. These anisotropic SPs are cylindrical disks or stacked-disk arrays. We attribute the major driving forces controlling the SP shape to interparticle interactions between nanorods and solvophobic interactions between a superparticle and its surrounding solvent. According to their sizes (or volumes), the SPs adopt either single- or multilayered structures. In addition, these SPs exhibit linearly polarized emissions, demonstrating their potential role as useful components in devices such as polarized light-emitting diodes and electrooptical modulators.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of four beta-lactamases produced by Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus produces four types of beta-lactamase (A, B, C, and D). To investigate the effect of specific beta-lactamase type upon staphylococcal resistance, each beta-lactamase was purified to homogeneity, and the Michaelis constants (Km values) and turnover numbers (kcat values) for various penicillin and cephalosporin substrates were determined. Whereas Km values of the four beta-lactamases were comparable for penicillin G, cephalothin, and cefamandole, the type A and D enzymes exhibited greater affinity than the type B and C beta-lactamases for nitrocefin, cefazolin, and cephapirin. Conversely, the type B and C beta-lactamases exhibited greater kcat values than the type A and D enzymes against most of the cephalosporin agents, excluding nitrocefin. In contrast to earlier reports suggesting that the type B beta-lactamase is relatively inefficient in hydrolyzing penicillin G, we found only minor differences in the specific activities and kcat values of the type A, B, and C beta-lactamases. The type D beta-lactamase was distinctly less active against penicillin G, however, exhibiting only 15 to 25% of the kcat values of the other beta-lactamases. More than a 2,000-fold difference between the relative efficiencies of hydrolysis (kcat/Km) of cefazolin and cefuroxime by the type A beta-lactamase exists. This greatly exceeds the 60-fold difference in the stability of penicillin G and cefazolin with the same enzyme. Whereas the isoelectric points of the type A, B, and C beta-lactamases were similar, the value for the type D beta-lactamase was distinguishably lower (10.1 for types A, B, and C and 9.7 for type D). We conclude that marked differences in the stability of commonly used beta-lactams to hydrolysis by the staphylococcal beta-lactamases are present. This heterogeneity and the clinical implication thereof need to be considered in the antibiotic management of staphylococcal infection.	0
Abstract2class: Pyrazinoic acid and its n-propyl ester inhibit fatty acid synthase type I in replicating tubercle bacilli Abstract: The activity of different analogs of pyrazinamide on Mycobacterium tuberculosis fatty acid synthase type I (FASI) in replicating bacilli was studied. Palmitic acid biosynthesis was diminished by 96% in bacilli treated with n-propyl pyrazinoate, 94% in bacilli treated with 5-chloro-pyrazinamide, and 97% in bacilli treated with pyrazinoic acid, the pharmacologically active agent of pyrazinamide. We conclude that the minimal structure of pyrazine ring with an acyl group is sufficient for FASI inhibition and antimycobacterial activity.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous reconstitution of the intact geodin gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans through a simple and versatile PCR based approach Abstract: Fungal natural products are a rich resource for bioactive molecules. To fully exploit this potential it is necessary to link genes to metabolites. Genetic information for numerous putative biosynthetic pathways has become available in recent years through genome sequencing. However, the lack of solid methodology for genetic manipulation of most species severely hampers pathway characterization. Here we present a simple PCR based approach for heterologous reconstitution of intact gene clusters. Specifically, the putative gene cluster responsible for geodin production from Aspergillus terreus was transferred in a two step procedure to an expression platform in A. nidulans. The individual cluster fragments were generated by PCR and assembled via efficient USER fusion prior to transformation and integration via re-iterative gene targeting. A total of 13 open reading frames contained in 25 kb of DNA were successfully transferred between the two species enabling geodin synthesis in A. nidulans. Subsequently, functions of three genes in the cluster were validated by genetic and chemical analyses. Specifically, ATEG_08451 (gedC) encodes a polyketide synthase, ATEG_08453 (gedR) encodes a transcription factor responsible for activation of the geodin gene cluster and ATEG_08460 (gedL) encodes a halogenase that catalyzes conversion of sulochrin to dihydrogeodin. We expect that our approach for transferring intact biosynthetic pathways to a fungus with a well developed genetic toolbox will be instrumental in characterizing the many exciting pathways for secondary metabolite production that are currently being uncovered by the fungal genome sequencing projects.	1
Abstract2class: A novel photoredox-active group for the generation of fluorinated radicals from difluorostyrenes Abstract: A 4-tetrafluoropyridinylthio group was suggested as a new photoredox-active moiety. The group can be directly installed on difluorostyrenes in a single step by the thiolene click reaction. It proceeds upon visible light catalysis with 9-phenylacridine providing various difluorinated sulfides as radical precursors. Single electron reduction of the C-S bond with the formation of fluoroalkyl radicals is enabled by the electron-poor azine ring. The intermediate difluorinated sulfides were involved in a series of photoredox reactions with silyl enol ethers, alkenes, nitrones and an alkenyl trifluoroborate.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF), a broad-spectrum antimycotic with a novel mode of action Abstract: A screen for antifungal compounds from Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3, a bacterial biological control agent of fungal diseases, has previously led to the isolation of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF). HSAF exhibits inhibitory activities against a wide range of fungal species and shows a novel mode of antifungal action by disrupting the biosynthesis of a distinct group of sphingolipids. We have now determined the chemical structure of HSAF, which is identical to that of dihydromaltophilin, an antifungal metabolite with a unique macrocyclic lactam system containing a tetramic acid moiety and a 5,5,6-tricyclic skeleton. We have also identified the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis of HSAF in strain C3. DNA sequencing of this locus revealed genes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), a sterol desaturase, a ferredoxin reductase, and an arginase. The disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene generated C3 mutants that lost the ability to produce HSAF and to inhibit fungal growth, demonstrating a hybrid PKS-NRPS that catalyzed the biosynthesis of the unique macrolactam system that is found in many biologically active natural products isolated from marine organisms. In addition, we have generated mutants with disrupted sterol desaturase, ferredoxin reductase, and arginase and examined the metabolites produced in these mutants. The work represents the first study of the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid-containing macrolactams. The elucidation of the chemical structure of HSAF and the identification of the genetic locus for its biosynthesis establish the foundation for future exploitation of this group of compounds as new fungicides or antifungal drugs.	1
Abstract2class: The structural view of bacterial translocation-specific chaperone SecB: implications for function Abstract: SecB is a molecular chaperone that functions in bacterial post-translational protein translocation pathway. It maintains newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in a translocation-competent state and guides them to the translocon via its high-affinity binding to the ligand as well as to the membrane-embedded ATPase SecA. Recent advances in elucidating the structures of SecB have enabled the examination of protein function in the structural context. Structures of SecB from both Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli support the early two-subsite polypeptide-binding model. In addition, the detailed molecular interaction between SecB and SecA was revealed by a structure of SecB in complex with the C-terminal zinc-containing domain of SecA. These observations explain the dual role of SecB plays in the translocation pathway, as a molecular chaperone and a specific targeting factor. A model of SecB-SecA complex suggests that the binding of SecA to SecB changes the conformation of the polypeptide binding sites in the chaperone, enabling transfer of precursor polypeptides from SecB to SecA. Recent studies also show the presence of a second zinc-independent SecB binding site in SecA and the new interaction might contribute to the function of SecB.	0
Abstract2class: Structure elucidation and biosynthetic gene cluster analysis of caniferolides A-D, new bioactive 36-membered macrolides from the marine-derived Streptomyces caniferus CA-271066 Abstract: Bioassay-guided isolation based on the antifungal activity of a culture broth of the marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces caniferus CA-271066 led to the discovery of new 36-membered polyol macrolides, caniferolides A-D (1-4). Their connectivity was determined by spectroscopic methods including ESITOF-MS and 1D/2D NMR. The relative stereochemistry of each stereocluster in these compounds was established using NOE analysis, the universal database method and J-based configuration analysis, further assisted by comparisons with NMR data of structurally related macrolides. Genome sequencing followed by detailed bioinformatics analysis led to the identification of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster and allowed the prediction of the stereochemical outcome of their biosynthesis, confirming the relative stereochemistry of each stereocluster already determined by NMR and establishing their stereochemical relationship, ultimately rendering the absolute configuration of all chiral centers. Furthermore, based on our results and already published data, it has been possible to derive the complete absolute configuration of the related macrolides PM100117 and PM100118, astolides A and B, and deplelides A and B. Caniferolides A-D have shown pronounced antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus alongside antiproliferative activity against five human tumoral cell lines.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular dynamics of β-hairpin models of epigenetic recognition motifs Abstract: The conformations and stabilities of the β-hairpin model peptides of Waters (Riemen, A. J.; Waters, M. L. Biochemistry 2009, 48, 1525; Hughes, R. M.; Benshoff, M. L.; Waters, M. L. Chemistry 2007, 13, 5753) have been experimentally characterized as a function of lysine ε-methylation. These models were developed to explore molecular recognition of known epigenetic recognition motifs. This system offered an opportunity to computationally examine the role of cation-π interactions, desolvation of the ε-methylated ammonium groups, and aromatic/aromatic interactions on the observed differences in NMR spectra. AMOEBA, a second-generation force field (Ponder, J. W.; Wu, C.; Ren, P.; Pande, V. S.; Chodera, J. D.; Schnieders, M. J.; Haque, I.; Mobley, D. L.; Lambrecht, D. S.; DiStasio, R. A., Jr.; Head-Gordon, M.; Clark, G. N.; Johnson, M. E.; Head-Gordon, T. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 2549), was chosen as it includes both multipole electrostatics and polarizability thought to be essential to accurately characterize such interactions. Independent parametrization of ε-methylated amines was required from which aqueous solvation free energies were estimated and shown to agree with literature values. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) using the derived parameters with model peptides, such as Ac-R-W-V-W-V-N-G-Orn-K(Me)(n)-I-L-Q-NH(2), where n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, were conducted in explicit solvent. Distances between the centers of the indole rings of the two-tryptophan residues, 2 and 4, and the ε-methylated ammonium group on Lys-9 as well as the distance between the N- and C-termini were monitored to estimate the strength and orientation of the cation-π and aromatic/aromatic interactions. In agreement with the experimental data, the stability of the β-hairpin increased significantly with lysine ε-methylation. The ability of MD simulations to reproduce the observed NOEs for the four peptides was further estimated for the monopole-based force fields, AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLSAA. AMOEBA correctly predicted over 80% of the observed NOEs for all 4 peptides, while the three-monopole force fields were 40-50% predictive in only 2 cases and approximately 10% in the other 10 examples. Preliminary analysis suggests that the decreased cost of desolvation of the substituted ammonium group significantly compensated for the reduced cation-π interaction resulting from the increased separation due to steric bulk of the ε-methylated amines.	0
Abstract2class: A new family of iron-dependent halogenases acts on freestanding substrates Abstract: Regio- and stereospecific incorporation of a halogen atom to an unactivated sp(3) carbon in a freestanding molecule is a challenging transformation that is currently missing in the inventory of enzyme-mediated reactions. Here we report what is to our knowledge the first example of a nonheme iron enzyme (WelO5) in the welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathway that can monochlorinate an aliphatic carbon in 12-epi-fischerindole U and 12-epi-hapalindole C, substrates that are free from peptidyl or acyl carrier protein.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of a regulatory gene essential for the production of the angucycline-like polyketide antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: A gene, aur1P, encoding a protein similar to the response regulators of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, was identified upstream of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Expression of the gene was directed by a single promoter, aur1Pp, which was transcribed at low levels during the exponential phase and induced just before the stationary phase. A divergently transcribed gene, aur1R, has been identified upstream of aur1P, encoding a protein homologous to transcriptional repressors of the TetR family. The aur1P gene was disrupted in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 chromosome by homologous recombination. The mutation in the aur1P gene had no effect on growth and differentiation. However, biochromatographic analysis of culture extracts from the S. aureofaciens aur1P-disrupted strain revealed that auricin was not produced in the mutant. This indicated that aur1P is essential for auricin production. Transcription from the previously characterized aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of the first gene, aur1A, in the auricin gene cluster, was dramatically decreased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1P mutant strain. Moreover, the Aur1P protein, overproduced in Escherichia coli, was shown to bind specifically upstream of the aur1Ap promoter region. The results indicated that the Aur1P regulator activates expression of the auricin biosynthesis genes.	1
Abstract2class: The Integrity of the Intradimer Interface of the Hepatitis B Virus Capsid Protein Dimer Regulates Capsid Self-Assembly Abstract: During the hepatitis B virus lifecycle, 120 copies of homodimeric capsid protein assemble around a copy of reverse transcriptase and viral RNA and go on to produce an infectious virion. Assembly needs to be tightly regulated by protein conformational change to ensure symmetry, fidelity, and reproducibility. Here, we show that structures at the intradimer interface regulate conformational changes at the distal interdimer interface and so regulate assembly. A pair of interacting charged residues, D78 from each monomer, conspicuously located at the top of a four-helix bundle that forms the intradimer interface, were mutated to serine to disrupt communication between the two monomers. The mutation slowed assembly and destabilized the dimer to thermal and chemical denaturation. Mutant dimers showed evidence of transient partial unfolding based on the appearance of new proteolytically sensitive sites. Though the mutant dimer was less stable, the resulting capsids were as stable as the wildtype, based on assembly and thermal denaturation studies. Cryo-EM image reconstructions of capsid indicated that the subunits adopted an "open" state more usually associated with a free dimer and that the spike tips were either disordered or highly flexible. Molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic explanations for these results, suggesting that D78 stabilizes helix 4a, which forms part of the intradimer interface, by capping its N-terminus and hydrogen-bonding to nearby residues, whereas the D78S mutation disrupts these interactions, leading to partial unwinding of helix 4a. This in turn weakens the connection from helix 4 and the intradimer interface to helix 5, which forms the interdimer interface.	0
Abstract2class: Intermolecular Anti-Markovnikov Hydroamination of Unactivated Alkenes with Sulfonamides Enabled by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Abstract: Here we report a catalytic method for the intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated alkenes using primary and secondary sulfonamides. These reactions occur at room temperature under visible light irradiation and are jointly catalyzed by an iridium(III) photocatalyst, a dialkyl phosphate base, and a thiol hydrogen atom donor. Reaction outcomes are consistent with the intermediacy of an N-centered sulfonamidyl radical generated via proton-coupled electron transfer activation of the sulfonamide N-H bond. Studies outlining the synthetic scope (>60 examples) and mechanistic features of the reaction are presented.	0
Abstract2class: Inactivation of Escherichia coli Cells in Aqueous Solution by Atmospheric-Pressure N2, He, Air, and O2 Microplasmas Abstract: Atmospheric-pressure N2, He, air, and O2 microplasma arrays have been used to inactivate Escherichia coli cells suspended in aqueous solution. Measurements show that the efficiency of inactivation of E. coli cells is strongly dependent on the feed gases used, the plasma treatment time, and the discharge power. Compared to atmospheric-pressure N2 and He microplasma arrays, air and O2 microplasma arrays may be utilized to more efficiently kill E. coli cells in aqueous solution. The efficiencies of inactivation of E. coli cells in water can be well described by using the chemical reaction rate model, where reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in the inactivation process. Analysis indicates that plasma-generated reactive species can react with E. coli cells in water by direct or indirect interactions.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of wall teichoic acid inhibitors as potential anti-MRSA β-lactam combination agents Abstract: Innovative strategies are needed to combat drug resistance associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we investigate the potential of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis inhibitors as combination agents to restore β-lactam efficacy against MRSA. Performing a whole-cell pathway-based screen, we identified a series of WTA inhibitors (WTAIs) targeting the WTA transporter protein, TarG. Whole-genome sequencing of WTAI-resistant isolates across two methicillin-resistant Staphylococci spp. revealed TarG as their common target, as well as a broad assortment of drug-resistant bypass mutants mapping to earlier steps of WTA biosynthesis. Extensive in vitro microbiological analysis and animal infection studies provide strong genetic and pharmacological evidence of the potential effectiveness of WTAIs as anti-MRSA β-lactam combination agents. This work also highlights the emerging role of whole-genome sequencing in antibiotic mode-of-action and resistance studies.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster encoding a novel enzyme, 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, from Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 and combinatorial biosynthesis of new or rare xanthophylls Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster mediating the production of 2-hydroxyastaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 by using a common crtI sequence as the probe DNA. A sequence analysis revealed this cluster to contain 12 open reading frames (ORFs), including the 7 known genes, crtW, crtY, crtI, crtB, crtE, idi, and crtZ. The individual ORFs were functionally analyzed by complementation studies using Escherichia coli that accumulated various carotenoid precursors due to the presence of other bacterial crt genes. In addition to functionally identifying the known crt genes, we found that one (ORF11, named crtG) coded for a novel enzyme, carotenoid 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, which showed intriguingly partial homology with animal sterol-C5-desaturase. When this crtG gene was introduced into E. coli accumulating zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, the resulting transformants produced their 2-hydroxylated and 2,2'-dihydroxylated products which were structurally novel or rare xanthophylls, as determined by their nuclear magnetic resonance and high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry spectral data. The new carotenoid produced was suggested to have a strong inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation.	1
Abstract2class: Automated structure prediction of trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase products Abstract: Bacterial trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are among the most complex known enzymes from secondary metabolism and are responsible for the biosynthesis of highly diverse bioactive polyketides. However, most of these metabolites remain uncharacterized, since trans-AT PKSs frequently occur in poorly studied microbes and feature a remarkable array of non-canonical biosynthetic components with poorly understood functions. As a consequence, genome-guided natural product identification has been challenging. To enable de novo structural predictions for trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides, we developed the trans-AT PKS polyketide predictor (TransATor). TransATor is a versatile bio- and chemoinformatics web application that suggests informative chemical structures for even highly aberrant trans-AT PKS biosynthetic gene clusters, thus permitting hypothesis-based, targeted biotechnological discovery and biosynthetic studies. We demonstrate the applicative scope in several examples, including the characterization of new variants of bioactive natural products as well as structurally new polyketides from unusual bacterial sources.	1
Abstract2class: Atypical Listeria innocua strains possess an intact LIPI-3 Abstract: Background:                       Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen which is the causative agent of listeriosis and can be divided into three evolutionary lineages I, II and III. While all strains possess the well established virulence factors associated with the Listeria pathogenicity island I (LIPI-1), lineage I strains also possess an additional pathogenicity island designated LIPI-3 which encodes listeriolysin S (LLS), a post-translationally modified cytolytic peptide. Up until now, this pathogenicity island has been identified exclusively in a subset of lineage I isolates of the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.                  Results:                       In total 64 L. innocua strains were screened for the presence of LIPI-3. Here we report the identification of an intact LIPI-3 in 11 isolates of L. innocua and the remnants of the cluster in several others. Significantly, we can reveal that placing the L. innocua lls genes under the control of a constitutive promoter results in a haemolytic phenotype, confirming that the cluster is capable of encoding a functional haemolysin.                  Conclusions:                       Although the presence of the LIPI-3 gene cluster is confined to lineage I isolates of L. monocytogenes, a corresponding gene cluster or its remnants have been identified in many L. innocua strains.	1
Abstract2class: Automated Assembly of Starch and Glycogen Polysaccharides Abstract: Polysaccharides are Nature's most abundant biomaterials essential for plant cell wall construction and energy storage. Seemingly minor structural differences result in entirely different functions: cellulose, a β (1-4) linked glucose polymer, forms fibrils that can support large trees, while amylose, an α (1-4) linked glucose polymer forms soft hollow fibers used for energy storage. A detailed understanding of polysaccharide structures requires pure materials that cannot be isolated from natural sources. Automated Glycan Assembly provides quick access to trans-linked glycans analogues of cellulose, but the stereoselective installation of multiple cis-glycosidic linkages present in amylose has not been possible to date. Here, we identify thioglycoside building blocks with different protecting group patterns that, in concert with temperature and solvent control, achieve excellent stereoselectivity during the synthesis of linear and branched α-glucan polymers with up to 20 cis-glycosidic linkages. The molecules prepared with the new method will serve as probes to understand the biosynthesis and the structure of α-glucans.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Encoding the Lasso Peptide Humidimycin, a Caspofungin Activity Potentiator Abstract: Humidimycin (MDN-0010) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) belonging to class I lasso peptides, and is structurally related to siamycins, which have been shown to have strong antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria and to possess anti-HIV activity. Humidimycin was isolated from the strain Streptomyces humidus CA-100629, and was shown to synergize the activity of the fungal cell wall inhibitor caspofungin. In this work, the biosynthetic gene cluster of humidimycin was identified by genome mining of S. humidus CA-100629, cloned by Gibson assembly, and heterologously expressed.	1
Abstract2class: Insights on Escherichia coli biofilm formation and inhibition from whole-transcriptome profiling Abstract: Biofilms transform independent cells into specialized cell communities. Here are presented some insights into biofilm formation ascertained with the best-characterized strain, Escherichia coli. Investigations of biofilm formation and inhibition with this strain using whole-transcriptome profiling coupled to phenotypic assays, in vivo DNA binding studies and isogenic mutants have led to discoveries related to the role of stress, to the role of intra- and interspecies cell signalling, to the impact of the environment on cell signalling, to biofilm inhibition by manipulating cell signalling, to the role of toxin/antitoxin genes in biofilm formation, and to the role of small RNAs on biofilm formation and dispersal. Hence, E. coli is an excellent resource for determining paradigms in biofilm formation and biofilm inhibition.	0
Abstract2class: The granaticin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22: sequence analysis and expression in a heterologous host Abstract: Background:                       The granaticins are members of the benzoisochromanequinone class of aromatic polyketides, the best known member of which is actinorhodin made by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Genetic analysis of this class of compounds has played a major role in the development of hypotheses about the way in which aromatic polyketide synthases (PKSs) control product structure. Although the granaticin nascent polyketide is identical to that of actinorhodin, post-PKS steps involve different pyran-ring stereochemistry and glycosylation. Comparison of the complete gene clusters for the two metabolites is therefore of great interest.                  Results:                       The entire granaticin gene cluster (the gra cluster) from Streptomyces violaceoruber T-22 was cloned on either of two overlapping cosmids and expressed in the heterologous host, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), strain CH999. Chemical analysis of the recombinant strains demonstrated production of granaticin, granaticin B, dihydrogranaticin and dihydrogranaticin B, which are the four known metabolites of S. violaceoruber. Analysis of the complete 39,250 base pair sequence of the insert of one of the cosmids, pOJ466-22-24, revealed 37 complete open reading frames (ORFs), 15 of which resemble ORFs from the act (actinorhodin) gene cluster of S. coelicolor A3(2). Among the rest, nine resemble ORFs potentially involved in deoxysugar metabolism from Streptomyces spp. and other bacteria, and six resemble regulatory ORFs.                  Conclusions:                       On the basis of these resemblances, putative functional assignments of the products of most of the newly discovered ORFs were made, including those of genes involved in the PKS and tailoring steps in the biosynthesis of the granaticin aglycone, steps in the deoxy sugar pathway, and putative regulatory and export functions.	1
Abstract2class: Target-selective phototherapy using a ligand-based photosensitizer for type 2 cannabinoid receptor Abstract: Phototherapy is a powerful, noninvasive approach for cancer treatment, with several agents currently in clinical use. Despite the progress and promise, most current phototherapy agents have serious side effects as they can lead to damage to healthy tissue, even when the photosensitizers are fused to targeting molecules due to nonspecific light activation of the unbound photosensitizer. To overcome these limitations, we developed a phototherapy agent that combines a functional ligand and a near infrared phthalocyanine dye. Our target is type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R), considered an attractive therapeutic target for phototherapy given it is overexpressed by many types of cancers that are located at a surface or can be reached by an endoscope. We show that our CB2R-targeted phototherapy agent, IR700DX-mbc94, is specific for CB2R and effective only when bound to the target receptor. Overall, this opens up the opportunity for development of an alternative treatment option for CB2R-positive cancers.	0
Abstract2class: The fumitremorgin gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus: identification of a gene encoding brevianamide F synthetase Abstract: A gene encoding a putative dimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) was identified within a gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus, a species reported to produce fumitremorgins and other prenylated alkaloids. The gene was deleted and overexpressed in the genome reference strain Af293, and was also expressed in the naïve host Aspergillus nidulans, which lacks the equivalent gene cluster. While neither fumitremorgins nor the dipeptide brevianamide F (cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro), an early intermediate, were detected in wild-type and deletion strains of A. fumigatus, brevianamide F accumulated in fungal cultures following increased expression of the NRPS gene in both A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. We conclude that the gene Afu8g00170, named ftmA, encodes the NRPS brevianamide synthetase. Brevianamide F is the precursor of a variety of fungal prenylated alkaloids with biological activity, including fumitremorgins A, B and C and tryprostatin B.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of salivaricin CRL 1328, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 isolated from the human vagina Abstract: Salivaricin CRL 1328 is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328, a strain isolated from healthy human vagina, with potential applications for preventing urogenital infections. The objective of this study was to characterize the locus responsible for salivaricin CRL 1328 production and its mechanism of action against Enterococcus faecalis MP97 as the sensitive strain. Oligonucleotides were designed based on sequences of antimicrobial peptides previously described in the literature. The salivaricin CRL 1328 cluster was identified, sequenced and analyzed. This cluster was similar to the previously described ABP118 which codified for a two-peptide bacteriocin. The putative mature peptides of salivaricin CRL 1328, Salalpha and Salbeta were chemically synthesized. These peptides did not show bacteriocin activity when assayed individually. Both peptides exhibited optimal antimicrobial activity at an equimolar ratio. Spectroscopic fluorescence assays were carried out using the synthetic peptides to study the effect of salivaricin on proton motive force. This bacteriocin was shown to dissipate membrane potential and the transmembrane proton gradient, both components of proton motive force. E. faecalis MP97 cells treated with salivaricin CRL 1328 peptides were observed in transmission electron microscopy which revealed ultrastructural modifications of the cell wall.	1
Abstract2class: Putative identification of the usnic acid biosynthetic gene cluster by de novo whole-genome sequencing of a lichen-forming fungus Abstract: To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the polyketide usnic acid we carried out the de novo genome sequencing of the fungal partner of Cladonia uncialis. This was followed by comprehensive in silico annotation of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. The biosynthesis of usnic acid requires a non-reducing PKS possessing a carbon methylation (CMeT) domain, a terminal Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain, and an accompanying oxidative enzyme that dimerizes methylphloracetophenone to usnic acid. Of the 32 candidate PKS genes identified in the mycobiont genome, only one was identified as consistent with these biosynthetic requirements. This gene cluster contains two genes encoding a non-reducing PKS and a cytochrome p450, which have been respectively named methylphloracetophenone synthase (MPAS) and methylphloracetophenone oxidase (MPAO). Both mpas and mpao were demonstrated to be transcriptionally active by reverse transcriptase-PCR of the mRNA in a lichen sample that was observed by HPLC to produce usnic acid. Phylogenetic analysis of the bioinformatically identified ketosynthase (KS) and CLC domains of MPAS demonstrated that mpas grouped within a unique clade and that mpas could be used as a phylogenetic probe to identify other MPAS genes.	1
Abstract2class: Specific 5-hydroxylation of piperlongumine by Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159 Abstract: A new hydroxylated derivative was efficiently prepared by transforming the natural anti-cancer product, piperlongumine, with Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159. Its structure was determined to be 5-hydroxylpiperlongumine on the basis of the spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration at C-5 was established as R by Mosher's method.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of oxygenation steps during oviedomycin biosynthesis and generation of derivatives with increased antitumor activity Abstract: Eight different angucyclinones have been produced in Streptomyces albus by combining three oxygenase genes together with the polyketide synthase and cyclases genes from the oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891. Four of these compounds were fully characterized for the first time. Three of these angucyclinones-prejadomycin-2-carboxylate (2), 4a,12b-dehydro-UWM6 (5), and prejadomycin (3)-show a significant increase in their in vitro antitumor activity relative to oviedomycin (1). A hypothesis for the sequence of tailoring events catalyzed by these three oxygenases during oviedomycin biosynthesis is proposed. In this hypothesis OvmOII acts as a bifunctional oxygenase/dehydratase.	1
Abstract2class: Initial extracellular forms of Plasmodium falciparum: their ultrastructure and their definition with monoclonal antibodies Abstract: Merozoites of the erythrocytic stage of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, when placed under appropriate conditions in a culture medium with erythrocyte extract, differentiate into early trophic forms. These forms have much the same ultrastructure as rings of the same age that have developed intracellularly and have then been freed from their host cells by immune lysis. However, these forms differ in two respects: the extracellular forms have only their single plasma membrane, whereas the forms freed from host cells have, in addition, a surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane; the forms that develop extracellularly have fewer ribosomes. Five monoclonal antibodies against the ring stage have been prepared and characterized. Their pattern of immunofluorescence localization differs in merozoites as compared with rings, but their pattern is identical in rings developed extracellularly and those developed intracellularly. These results and the observations on fine structure demonstrate biochemical and morphological differentiation in the extracellular forms.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the bagremycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. Tü 4128 Abstract: Bagremycin A and bagremycin B isolated from Streptomyces sp. Tü 4128 have activities against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and also have a weak antitumor activity, which make them have great potential for development of novel antibiotics. Here, we report a draft genome 8,424,112 bp in length of S. sp. Tü 4128 by Illumina Hiseq2000, and identify the bagremycins biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by bioinformatics analysis. The putative bagremycins BGC includes 16 open reading frames (ORFs) with the functions of biosynthesis, resistance and regulation. Disruptions of relative genes and HPLC analysis of bagremycins production demonstrated that not all the genes within the BGC are responsible for the biosynthesis of bagremycins. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways of bagremycins are proposed for deeper inquiries into their intriguing biosynthetic mechanism.	1
Abstract2class: A gene determining a new member of the SARP family contributes to transcription of genes for the synthesis of the angucycline polyketide auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: Three regulators, Aur1P, Aur1R and a SARP-family Aur1PR3, have been previously found to control expression of the aur1 cluster for the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Here, we describe an additional regulatory gene, aur1PR4, encoding a homologue from the SARP-family regulators. Its role in auricin regulation was confirmed by its disruption that dramatically affected auricin production. However, transcription from the aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of 22 auricin biosynthetic genes, was not substantially affected in the Δaur1PR4 mutant. A new promoter, sa13p, directing transcription of four putative auricin tailoring genes, was found to be dependent on aur1PR4. Moreover, analysis of the sa13p promoter region revealed the presence of three heptameric repeat sequences corresponding to putative SARP-binding sites. Expression of aur1PR4 is directed by a single promoter, aur1PR4p, which is induced after entry into stationary phase. Transcription from aur1PR4p was absent in a S. aureofaciens Δaur1P mutant strain, and Aur1P was shown to bind specifically to the aur1PR4p promoter. These results indicate a complex network of regulation of the auricin gene cluster. Both Aur1P and Aur1PR3 are involved in regulation of the core aur1A-U biosynthetic genes, and Aur1PR4 in regulation of putative auricin tailoring genes.	1
Abstract2class: Ethambutol Partitioning in Tuberculous Pulmonary Lesions Explains Its Clinical Efficacy Abstract: Clinical trials and practice have shown that ethambutol is an important component of the first-line tuberculosis (TB) regime. This contrasts the drug's rather modest potency and lack of activity against nongrowing persister mycobacteria. The standard plasma-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of ethambutol suggests that the drug may be of limited clinical value. Here, we hypothesized that this apparent contradiction may be explained by favorable penetration of the drug into TB lesions. First, we utilized novel in vitro lesion pharmacokinetic assays and predicted good penetration of the drug into lesions. We then employed mass spectrometry imaging and laser capture microdissection coupled to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCM and LC/MS-MS, respectively) to show that ethambutol, indeed, accumulates in diseased tissues and penetrates the major human-like lesion types represented in the rabbit model of TB disease with a lesion-to-plasma exposure ratio ranging from 9 to 12. In addition, ethambutol exhibits slow but sustained passive diffusion into caseum to reach concentrations markedly higher than those measured in plasma at steady state. The results explain why ethambutol has retained its place in the first-line regimen, validate our in vitro lesion penetration assays, and demonstrate the critical importance of effective lesion penetration for anti-TB drugs. Our findings suggest that in vitro and in vivo lesion penetration evaluation should be included in TB drug discovery programs. Finally, this is the first time that LCM with LC-MS/MS has been used to quantify a small molecule at high spatial resolution in infected tissues, a method that can easily be extended to other infectious diseases.	0
Abstract2class: Coordinated Biosynthesis of the Purine Nucleoside Antibiotics Aristeromycin and Coformycin in Actinomycetes Abstract: Purine nucleoside antibiotic pairs, concomitantly produced by a single strain, are an important group of microbial natural products. Here, we report a target-directed genome mining approach to elucidate the biosynthesis of the purine nucleoside antibiotic pair aristeromycin (ARM) and coformycin (COF) in Micromonospora haikouensis DSM 45626 (a new producer for ARM and COF) and Streptomyces citricolor NBRC 13005 (a new COF producer). We also provide biochemical data that MacI and MacT function as unusual phosphorylases, catalyzing an irreversible reaction for the tailoring assembly of neplanocin A (NEP-A) and ARM. Moreover, we demonstrate that MacQ is shown to be an adenosine-specific deaminase, likely relieving the potential "excess adenosine" for producing cells. Finally, we report that MacR, an annotated IMP dehydrogenase, is actually an NADPH-dependent GMP reductase, which potentially plays a salvage role for the efficient supply of the precursor pool. Hence, these findings illustrate a fine-tuned pathway for the biosynthesis of ARM and also open the way for the rational search for purine antibiotic pairs.IMPORTANCE ARM and COF are well known for their prominent biological activities and unusual chemical structures; however, the logic of their biosynthesis has long been poorly understood. Actually, the new insights into the ARM and COF pathway will not only enrich the biochemical repertoire for interesting enzymatic reactions but may also lay a solid foundation for the combinatorial biosynthesis of this group of antibiotics via a target-directed genome mining strategy.	1
Abstract2class: Comparative transcriptomics as a guide to natural product discovery and biosynthetic gene cluster functionality Abstract: Bacterial natural products remain an important source of new medicines. DNA sequencing has revealed that a majority of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) maintained in bacterial genomes have yet to be linked to the small molecules whose biosynthesis they encode. Efforts to discover the products of these orphan BGCs are driving the development of genome mining techniques based on the premise that many are transcriptionally silent during normal laboratory cultivation. Here, we employ comparative transcriptomics to assess BGC expression among four closely related strains of marine bacteria belonging to the genus Salinispora The results reveal that slightly more than half of the BGCs are expressed at levels that should facilitate product detection. By comparing the expression profiles of similar gene clusters in different strains, we identified regulatory genes whose inactivation appears linked to cluster silencing. The significance of these subtle differences between expressed and silent BGCs could not have been predicted a priori and was only revealed by comparative transcriptomics. Evidence for the conservation of silent clusters among a larger number of strains for which genome sequences are available suggests they may be under different regulatory control from the expressed forms or that silencing may represent an underappreciated mechanism of gene cluster evolution. Coupling gene expression and metabolomics data established a bioinformatic link between the salinipostins and their associated BGC, while genetic manipulation established the genetic basis for this series of compounds, which were previously unknown from Salinispora pacifica.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a 12-gene Fusaric Acid Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Fusarium Species Through Comparative and Functional Genomics Abstract: In fungi, genes involved in biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite (SM) are often located adjacent to one another in the genome and are coordinately regulated. These SM biosynthetic gene clusters typically encode enzymes, one or more transcription factors, and a transport protein. Fusaric acid is a polyketide-derived SM produced by multiple species of the fungal genus Fusarium. This SM is of concern because it is toxic to animals and, therefore, is considered a mycotoxin and may contribute to plant pathogenesis. Preliminary descriptions of the fusaric acid (FA) biosynthetic gene (FUB) cluster have been reported in two Fusarium species, the maize pathogen F. verticillioides and the rice pathogen F. fujikuroi. The cluster consisted of five genes and did not include a transcription factor or transporter gene. Here, analysis of the FUB region in F. verticillioides, F. fujikuroi, and F. oxysporum, a plant pathogen with multiple hosts, indicates the FUB cluster consists of at least 12 genes (FUB1 to FUB12). Deletion analysis confirmed that nine FUB genes, including two Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor genes, are required for production of wild-type levels of FA. Comparisons of FUB cluster homologs across multiple Fusarium isolates and species revealed insertion of non-FUB genes at one or two locations in some homologs. Although the ability to produce FA contributed to the phytotoxicity of F. oxysporum culture extracts, lack of production did not affect virulence of F. oxysporum on cactus or F. verticillioides on maize seedlings. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and biochemical processes required for FA production.	1
Abstract2class: Elucidation of pseurotin biosynthetic pathway points to trans-acting C-methyltransferase: generation of chemical diversity Abstract: Pseurotins comprise a family of structurally related Aspergillal natural products having interesting bioactivity. However, little is known about the biosynthetic steps involved in the formation of their complex chemical features. Systematic deletion of the pseurotin biosynthetic genes in A. fumigatus and in vivo and in vitro characterization of the tailoring enzymes to determine the biosynthetic intermediates, and the gene products responsible for the formation of each intermediate, are described. Thus, the main biosynthetic steps leading to the formation of pseurotin A from the predominant precursor, azaspirene, were elucidated. The study revealed the combinatorial nature of the biosynthesis of the pseurotin family of compounds and the intermediates. Most interestingly, we report the first identification of an epoxidase C-methyltransferase bifunctional fusion protein PsoF which appears to methylate the nascent polyketide backbone carbon atom in trans.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization and development of novel small-molecules inhibiting GSK3 and activating Wnt signaling Abstract: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is an essential component of the Wnt signaling pathway and plays important roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. As GSK3 is abnormally upregulated in several diseases including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, it has been regarded as a potential drug target. During zebrafish development, inhibition of GSK3 leads to ectopic activation of the Wnt pathway, resulting in a headless embryo. Using this phenotype as an assay we screened a chemical library of 4000 compounds and identified one novel compound, 3F8, which specifically inhibits eye and forebrain formation in zebrafish embryos, resembling a typical Wnt overexpression phenotype. Cell reporter assays, chemical informatics analysis and in vitro kinase experiments revealed that 3F8 is a selective GSK3 inhibitor, which is more potent than SB216763, a commonly used GSK3 inhibitor. Based on the structure of 3F8, a new generation of compounds inhibiting GSK3 was synthesized and validated by biological assays. Together, 3F8 and its derivatives could be useful as new reagents and potential therapeutic candidates for GSK3 related diseases.	0
Abstract2class: Proposal to create subspecies of Rickettsia conorii based on multi-locus sequence typing and an emended description of Rickettsia conorii Abstract: Background:                       Rickettsiae closely related to the Malish strain, the reference Rickettsia conorii strain, include Indian tick typhus rickettsia (ITTR), Israeli spotted fever rickettsia (ISFR), and Astrakhan fever rickettsia (AFR). Although closely related genotypically, they are distinct serotypically. Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we have recently found that distinct serotypes may not always represent distinct species within the Rickettsia genus. We investigated the possibility of classifying rickettsiae closely related to R. conorii as R. conorii subspecies as proposed by the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics. For this, we first estimated their genotypic variability by using MLST including the sequencing of 5 genes, of 31 rickettsial isolates closely related to R. conorii strain Malish, 1 ITTR isolate, 2 isolates and 3 tick amplicons of AFR, and 2 ISFR isolates. Then, we selected a representative of each MLST genotype and used multi-spacer typing (MST) and mouse serotyping to estimate their degree of taxonomic relatedness.                  Results:                       Among the 39 isolates or tick amplicons studied, four MLST genotypes were identified: i) the Malish type; ii) the ITTR type; iii) the AFR type; and iv) the ISFR type. Among these four MLST genotypes, the pairwise similarity in nucleotide sequence varied from 99.8 to 100%, 99.4 to 100%, 98.2 to 99.8%, 98.4 to 99.8%, and 99.2 to 99.9% for 16S rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB, and sca4 genes, respectively. Representatives of the 4 MLST types were also classified within four types using MST genotyping as well as mouse serotyping.                  Conclusion:                       Although homogeneous genotypically, strains within the R. conorii species show MST genotypic, serotypic, and epidemio-clinical dissimilarities. We, therefore, propose to modify the nomenclature of the R. conorii species through the creation of subspecies. We propose the names R. conorii subsp. conorii subsp. nov. (type strain = Malish, ATCC VR-613), R. conorii subspecies indica subsp. nov. (type strain = ATCC VR-597), R. conorii subspecies caspia subsp. nov. (type strain = A-167), and R. conorii subspecies israelensis subsp. nov. (type strain = ISTT CDC1). The description of R. conorii is emended to accomodate the four subspecies.	0
Abstract2class: The yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster of Yersinia enterocolitica: organization and siderophore-dependent regulation Abstract: The ability to synthesize and uptake the Yersinia siderophore yersiniabactin is a hallmark of the highly pathogenic, mouse-lethal species Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica 1B. We have identified four genes, irp1, irp3, irp4, and irp5, on a 13-kb chromosomal DNA fragment of Y. enterocolitica 08, WA-314. These genes constitute the yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster together with the previously defined irp2. The irp1 gene consists of 9,486 bp capable of encoding a 3,161-amino-acid high-molecular-weight protein 1 (HMWP1) polypeptide with a predicted mass of 384.6 kDa. The first 3,000 bp of irp1 show similarity to the corresponding regions of the polyketide synthase genes of Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces antibioticus. The remaining part of irp1 is most similar to irp2, encoding HMWP2, which might be the reason for immunological cross-reactivity of the two polypeptides. Irp4 was found to have 41.7% similarity to thioesterase-like protein of the anguibactin biosynthetic genes of Vibrio anguillarum. Irp5 shows 41% similarity to EntE, the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid-activating enzyme utilized in enterobactin synthesis of Escherichia coli. Irp4 and Irp5 are nearly identical to YbtT and YbtE, recently identified in Y. pestis. irp3 has no similarity to any known gene. Inactivation of either irp1 or irp2 abrogates yersiniabactin synthesis. Mutations in irp1 or fyuA (encoding yersiniabactin/pesticin receptor) result in downregulation of irp2 that can be upregulated by the addition of yersiniabactin. A FyuA-green fluorescent protein translational fusion was downregulated in an irp1 mutant. Upregulation was achieved by addition of yersiniabactin but not desferal, pesticin, or pyochelin, which indicates high specificity of the FyuA receptor and autoregulation of genes involved in synthesis and uptake of yersiniabactin.	1
Abstract2class: Directed evolution of potent neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 using CDR-swapping mutagenesis Abstract: There is widespread interest in facile methods for generating potent neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and other affinity proteins against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses to address current and future pandemics. While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties. We expect that our methods will improve in vitro nanobody discovery and accelerate the generation of potent neutralizing nanobodies against diverse coronaviruses.	0
Abstract2class: Cross-talk among gp130 cytokines in adipocytes Abstract: The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines is a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). These proteins are also known as gp130 cytokines because they all share gp130 as a common transducer protein within their functional receptor complexes. Several of these cytokines (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1) also utilize the LIF receptor (LIFR) as a component of their receptor complex. We have shown that all of these cytokines are capable of activating both the JAK/STAT and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By performing a variety of preincubation studies and examining the ability of these cytokines to activate STATs, ERKs, and induce transcription of SOCS-3 mRNA, we have also examined the ability of gp130 cytokines to modulate the action of their family members. Our results indicate that a subset of gp130 cytokines, in particular CT-1, LIF, and OSM, has the ability to impair subsequent signaling activity initiated by gp130 cytokines. However, IL-6 and CNTF do not exhibit this cross-talk ability. Moreover, our results indicate that the cross-talk among gp130 cytokines is mediated by the ability of these cytokines to induce ligand-dependent degradation of the LIFR, in a proteasome-independent manner, which coincides with decreased levels of LIFR at the plasma membrane. In summary, our results demonstrate that an inhibitory cross-talk among specific gp130 cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes occurs as a result of specific degradation of LIFR via a lysosome-mediated pathway.	0
Abstract2class: A set of ordered cosmids and a detailed genetic and physical map for the 8 Mb Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) chromosome Abstract: A Supercos-1 library carrying chromosomal DNA of a plasmid-free derivative of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was organized into an ordered encyclopaedia of overlapping clones by hybridization. The minimum set of overlapping clones representing the entire chromosome (with three short gaps) consists of 319 cosmids. The average insert size is 37.5 kb and the set of clones therefore divides the chromosome into 637 alternating unique and overlapping segments which have an average length of approx. 12.5 kb. More than 170 genes, gene clusters and other genetic markers were mapped to their specific segment by hybridization to the encyclopaedia. Genes could be cloned by direct transformation and complementation of S. coelicolor mutants with cosmids isolated from Escherichia coli, selecting for insertion into the chromosome by homologous recombination. As in other streptomycetes, the ends of the chromosome have long terminal inverted repeats.	1
Abstract2class: CloN2, a novel acyltransferase involved in the attachment of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar of clorobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin contains a 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit, attached via an ester bond to the 3-OH group of the deoxysugar moiety. To investigate candidate genes responsible for the formation of this ester bond, a gene inactivation experiment was carried out in the clorobiocin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976. An in-frame deletion was created in the coding sequence of the gene cloN2. The production of secondary metabolites in the wild-type and in the cloN2 mutant was analysed. The wild-type showed clorobiocin as the main product, whereas the cloN2 mutant accumulated a new aminocoumarin derivative, novclobiocin 104, lacking the pyrrole moiety at the 3-OH of the deoxysugar. In addition, free pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid accumulated in the culture extract of the cloN2 mutant. The structures of the metabolites were confirmed by NMR and LC-MS analysis. Clorobiocin production was successfully restored in the cloN2 mutant by introducing a replicative plasmid containing the cloN2 sequence. These results prove an involvement of cloN2 in the formation of the ester bond between the pyrrole moiety and the deoxysugar in clorobiocin biosynthesis. Furthermore, they indicate that the C-methylation at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety occurs after the attachment of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit to the deoxysugar moiety.	1
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the concise biosynthetic pathway of the communesin indole alkaloids Abstract: The communesins are a prominent class of indole alkaloids isolated from Penicillium species. Owing to their daunting structural framework and potential as pharmaceuticals, communesins have inspired numerous synthetic studies. However, the genetic and biochemical basis of communesin biosynthesis has remained unexplored. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of the communesin (cns) biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium expansum. We confirmed that communesin is biosynthesized by the coupling of tryptamine and aurantioclavine, two building blocks derived from L-tryptophan. The postmodification steps were mapped by targeted-gene-deletion experiments and the structural elucidation of intermediates and new analogues. Our studies set the stage for the biochemical characterization of communesin biosynthesis. This knowledge will aid our understanding of how nature generates remarkable structural complexity from simple precursors.	1
Abstract2class: Artificial reconstruction of two cryptic angucycline antibiotic biosynthetic pathways Abstract: Genome-sequencing projects have revealed that Streptomyces bacteria have the genetic potential to produce considerably larger numbers of natural products than can be observed under standard laboratory conditions. Cryptic angucycline-type aromatic polyketide gene clusters are particularly abundant. Sequencing of two such clusters from Streptomyces sp. PGA64 and H021 revealed the presence of several open reading frames that could be involved in processing the basic angucyclic carbon skeleton. The pga gene cluster contains one putative FAD-dependant monooxygenase (pgaE) and a putatively bifunctional monooxygenase/short chain alcohol reductase (pgaM), whereas the cab cluster contains two similar monooxygenases (cabE and cabM) and an independent reductase (cabV). In this study we have reconstructed the biosynthetic pathways for aglycone synthesis by cloning and sequentially expressing the angucycline tailoring genes with genes required for the synthesis of the unmodified angucycline metabolite-UWM6-in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The expression studies unequivocally showed that, after the production of UWM6, the pathways proceed through the action of the similar monooxygenases PgaE and CabE, followed by reactions catalysed by PgaM and CabMV. Analysis of the metabolites produced revealed that addition of pgaE and cabE genes directs both pathways to a known shunt product, rabelomycin, whereas expression of all genes from a given pathway results in the production of the novel angucycline metabolites gaudimycin A and B. However, one of the end products is most probably further modified by endogenous S. lividans TK24 enzymes. These experiments demonstrate that genes that are either inactive or cryptic in their native host can be used as biosynthetic tools to generate new compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Understanding the Effects of Coordination and Self-Assembly on an Emissive Phenothiazine Abstract: The local environment surrounding luminophores can significantly influence their photophysical properties. Herein, we report the self-assembly of a highly emissive platinum(II)-based metallacage. In order to accommodate the connectivity of the platinum(II) building block used in the self-assembly process, the luminophore-containing building block adopts a highly twisted geometry relative to its free form, leading to the emergence of an emissive transition with a radiative rate constant an order of magnitude higher than that of the free luminophore. This increased rate constant is the primary driver for the 10-fold increase in quantum yield from 4.2% to 40%. Model complexes with platinum or methyl groups bound to the nitrogen were synthesized. These complexes had lower quantum yields (10% and non-emissive, respectively) due mainly to decreases in radiative rate constants. Computational studies were conducted and indicated that the excited state of the ensembles, as well as the model complexes, is a result of charge transfer to the pyridyl groups, in contrast to the free luminophore, which involves the diphenyl sulfone moiety. The differences in quantum yields can be explained by a twist in the chromophore upon coordination of platinum or methylation on the pyridyl group, leading to intersystem crossing to a triplet state. This state then becomes more emissive with the addition of platinum, which increases the radiative rate constant via the heavy atom effect. The formation of a metallacage also decreases the non-radiative rate constant by inhibiting the intramolecular motions of the incorporated luminophore.	0
Abstract2class: Ligand recognition by ActR, a TetR-like regulator of actinorhodin export Abstract: TetR-like transcriptional repressors interact with small-molecule ligands to control many facets of prokaryotic biology, including clinical antibiotic resistance. ActR is a TetR-like protein encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antibiotic actinorhodin and controls the expression of two actinorhodin exporters. We showed previously that actinorhodin and its precursor 4-dihydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-10-oxo-3-H-naphtho-[2,3-c]-pyran-3-(S)-acetic acid can bind ActR and prevent its interaction with DNA. Here, we compare ActR's interaction with naturally occurring and synthetic molecules to show that pathway intermediates bind to ActR 5- to 10-fold more tightly than actinorhodin itself, consistent with our suggestion that they are the biologically relevant triggers for actinorhodin export. We also find that the ligand-binding cavity of this protein can accommodate a surprisingly large diversity of ligands, many of which can release ActR from DNA in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the actR locus could be activated by, and perhaps adapted to confer resistance to other antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: New anthracycline metabolites from mutant strains of Streptomyces galilaeus MA144-M1. I. Isolation and characterization of various blocked mutants Abstract: During genetic study on obtaining high-yield variants of aclacinomycin A-producer, a variety of blocked mutants were isolated from Streptomyces galilaeus MA144-M1 and were characterized. The isolated mutants included those which accumulated only specific components of parental glycosides, those which produced new aklavinone glycosides devoid of parental rhodosamine or both rhodinose and cinerulose, those which produced non-glycosidic aglycones, and antibiotic-negative mutants, some of which were able to glycosidate exogenous aklavinone. By biotransformation with the aglycone feeding culture, the precursor activity of new aglycones was also tested. From the results and in relation to the characterization of isolated mutants, the biosynthetic pathway of aclacinomycin A and related antibiotics is discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the first diphenyl ether gene cluster for pestheic acid biosynthesis in plant endophyte Pestalotiopsis fici Abstract: The diphenyl ether pestheic acid was isolated from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, which is proposed to be the biosynthetic precursor of the unique chloropupukeananes. The pestheic acid biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster was identified in the fungus through genome scanning. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene cluster encodes a nonreducing polyketide synthase, a number of modification enzymes, and three regulators. Gene disruption and intermediate analysis demonstrated that the biosynthesis proceeded through formation of the polyketide backbone, cyclization of a polyketo acid to a benzophenone, chlorination, and formation of the diphenyl ether skeleton through oxidation and hydrolyzation. A dihydrogeodin oxidase gene, ptaE, was essential for diphenyl ether formation, and ptaM encoded a flavin-dependent halogenase catalyzing chlorination in the biosynthesis. Identification of the pta cluster laid the foundation to decipher the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Expression of the platencin biosynthetic gene cluster in heterologous hosts yielding new platencin congeners Abstract: Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising drug leads for both antibacterial and antidiabetic therapies. We have previously cloned and sequenced the PTM-PTN dual biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and the PTN biosynthetic gene cluster from S. platensis MA7339, the latter of which is composed of 31 genes encoding PTN biosynthesis, regulation, and resistance. We have also demonstrated that PTM or PTN production can be significantly improved upon inactivation of the pathway-specific regulator ptmR1 or ptnR1 in S. platensis MA7327 or MA7339, respectively. We now report engineered production of PTN and congeners in a heterologous Streptomyces host. Expression constructs containing the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster were engineered from SuperCos 1 library clones and introduced into five model Streptomyces hosts, and PTN production was achieved in Streptomyces lividans K4-114. Inactivation of ptnR1 was crucial for expression of the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster, thereby PTN production, in S. lividans K4-114. Six PTN congeners, five of which were new, were also isolated from the recombinant strain S. lividans SB12606, revealing new insights into PTN biosynthesis. Production of PTN in a model Streptomyces host provides new opportunities to apply combinatorial biosynthetic strategies to the PTN biosynthetic machinery for structural diversity.	1
Abstract2class: Rapid access to conformational analogues of (+)-peloruside A Abstract: An efficient synthetic strategy for rapid access to analogues of peloruside A has been demonstrated. The synthetic route was highlighted by a simple esterification-based fragment coupling and a late stage ring-closing metathesis reaction. This convergent route has provided access to rationally designed analogues inspired by the solution conformational preferences of peloruside A.	0
Abstract2class: VirB1* promotes T-pilus formation in the vir-Type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Abstract: The vir-type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium is assembled from 12 proteins encoded by the virB operon and virD4. VirB1 is one of the least-studied proteins encoded by the virB operon. Its N terminus is a lytic transglycosylase. The C-terminal third of the protein, VirB1*, is cleaved from VirB1 and secreted to the outside of the bacterial cell, suggesting an additional function. We show that both nopaline and octopine strains produce abundant amounts of VirB1* and perform detailed studies on nopaline VirB1*. Both domains are required for wild-type virulence. We show here that the nopaline type VirB1* is essential for the formation of the T pilus, a subassembly of the vir-T4SS composed of processed and cyclized VirB2 (major subunit) and VirB5 (minor subunit). A nopaline virB1 deletion strain does not produce T pili. Complementation with full-length VirB1 or C-terminal VirB1*, but not the N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain, restores T pili containing VirB2 and VirB5. T-pilus preparations also contain extracellular VirB1*. Protein-protein interactions between VirB1* and VirB2 and VirB5 were detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We propose that VirB1 is a bifunctional protein required for virT4SS assembly. The N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain provides localized lysis of the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow insertion of the T4SS. The C-terminal VirB1* promotes T-pilus assembly through protein-protein interactions with T-pilus subunits.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn5-induced mutants of Pseudomonas perfectomarina defective in nitrous oxide respiration Abstract: Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of Pseudomonas perfectomarina with the plasmid pSUP2021 [(pBR325-Mob(RP4))::Tn5] and the chromosomally integrated RP4 plasmid in Escherichia coli as the donor, produced three distinct groups of mutants that were defective in nitrous oxide respiration. One group of mutants lacked the structural protein of N2O reductase, the second synthesized a copper-free apoprotein; and a third group expressed a low level of intact enzyme. The mutants provided evidence for N2O being the immediate precursor of dinitrogen in denitrification and documented the essentiality of the copper enzyme. Synthesis of N2O reductase depended strongly on the growth conditions, with N2O-grown cells expressing the lowest level of enzyme. Regulatory responses of mutants elicited by nitrate or oxygen were unaltered when compared with wild-type behavior.	0
Abstract2class: Unraveling the B. pseudomallei Heptokinase WcbL: From Structure to Drug Discovery Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria utilize heptoses as part of their repertoire of extracellular polysaccharide virulence determinants. Disruption of heptose biosynthesis offers an attractive target for novel antimicrobials. A critical step in the synthesis of heptoses is their 1-O phosphorylation, mediated by kinases such as HldE or WcbL. Here, we present the structure of WcbL from Burkholderia pseudomallei. We report that WcbL operates through a sequential ordered Bi-Bi mechanism, loading the heptose first and then ATP. We show that dimeric WcbL binds ATP anti-cooperatively in the absence of heptose, and cooperatively in its presence. Modeling of WcbL suggests that heptose binding causes an elegant switch in the hydrogen-bonding network, facilitating the binding of a second ATP molecule. Finally, we screened a library of drug-like fragments, identifying hits that potently inhibit WcbL. Our results provide a novel mechanism for control of substrate binding and emphasize WcbL as an attractive anti-microbial target for Gram-negative bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of the gene cluster involved in production and immunity of the peptide antibiotic AS-48 in Enterococcus faecalis Abstract: A region of 7.8 kb of the plasmid pMB2 from Enterococcus faecalis S-48 carrying the information necessary for production and immunity of the peptide antibiotic AS-48 has been cloned and sequenced. It contains the as-48A structural gene plus five open reading frames (as-48B, as-48C, as-48C1, as-48D and as-48D1). Besides As-48D, all the predicted gene products are basic hydrophobic proteins with potential membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). None of them shows any homology with protein sequences stored in databanks, except for As-48D, which shows similarity to the C-terminal domain of ABC transporters and contains a highly conserved ATP-binding site. The gene products of as-48B, as-48C, as-48C1 and as-48D are thought to be involved in AS-48 production and secretion. The only gene able to provide resistance to AS-48 by itself is as-48D1. Immunity also seems to be enhanced at least by the products of as-48B, as-48C1 and as-48D genes. Transcription analysis using probes derived from the different ORFs revealed two large (3.5 and 2.7kb) mRNAs, suggesting that the different genes are organized in two constitutive operons.	1
Abstract2class: Comparative characterization of the lactimidomycin and iso-migrastatin biosynthetic machineries revealing unusual features for acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases and providing an opportunity to engineer new analogues Abstract: Lactimidomycin (LTM, 1) and iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS, 2) belong to the glutarimide-containing polyketide family of natural products. We previously cloned and characterized the mgs biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993. The iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery featured an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK). We now report cloning and characterization of the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, which consists of nine genes that encode an AT-less type I PKS (LtmBCDEFGHL) and one tailoring enzyme (LtmK). Inactivation of ltmE or ltmH afforded the mutant strain SB15001 or SB15002, respectively, that abolished the production of 1, as well as the three cometabolites 8,9-dihydro-LTM (14), 8,9-dihydro-8S-hydroxy-LTM (15), and 8,9-dihydro-9R-hydroxy-LTM (13). Inactivation of ltmK yielded the mutant strain SB15003 that abolished the production of 1, 13, and 15 but led to the accumulation of 14. Complementation of the ΔltmK mutation in SB15003 by expressing ltmK in trans restored the production of 1, as well as that of 13 and 15. These results support the model for 1 biosynthesis, featuring an AT-less type I PKS that synthesizes 14 as the nascent polyketide intermediate and a cytochrome P450 desaturase that converts 14 to 1, with 13 and 15 as minor cometabolites. Comparative analysis of the LTM and iso-MGS AT-less type I PKSs revealed several unusual features that deviate from those of the collinear type I PKS model. Exploitation of the tailoring enzymes for 1 and 2 biosynthesis afforded two analogues, 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM (16) and 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM (17), that provided new insights into the structure-activity relationship of 1 and 2. While 12-membered macrolides, featuring a combination of a hydroxyl group at C-17 and a double bond at C-8 and C-9 as found in 1, exhibit the most potent activity, analogues with a single hydroxyl or methoxy group at C-8 or C-9 retain most of the activity whereas analogues with double substitutions at C-8 and C-9 lose significant activity.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of mokB involved in monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K (MK), which is widely used as an antihypercholesterolemia medicine, is produced as a fungal secondary metabolite through the polyketide pathway. The MK biosynthetic gene cluster proposed for Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 was also identified in M. pilosus NBRC4480. The mokB gene, located at the end of the putative gene cluster and possibly encoding polyketide synthase, was disrupted. The mokB disruptant did not produce MK, but accumulated an intermediate that was confirmed to be monacolin J, indicating that mokB encodes the polyketide synthase responsible for the biosynthesis of side-chain diketide moiety.	1
Abstract2class: NKT cell stimulation with α-galactosylceramide results in a block of Th17 differentiation after intranasal immunization in mice Abstract: In a previous study we demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) vaccination promotes a Th17 biased immune response. Here, we show that co-administration of a pegylated derivative of α-galactosylceramide (αGCPEG) with an antigen, even in the presence of Th17-polarizing compounds, results in a strong blocking of Th17 differentiation. Additional studies demonstrated that this phenomenon is specifically dependent on soluble factors, like IL-4 and IFNγ, which are produced by NKT cells. Even NK1.1 negative NKT cells, which by themselves produce IL-17A, are able to block Th17 differentiation. It follows that the use of αGCPEG as adjuvant would enable to tailor Th17 responses, according to the specific clinical needs. This knowledge expands our understanding of the role played by NKT cells in overall control of the cytokine microenvironment, as well as in the overall shaping of adaptive immune responses.	0
Abstract2class: Fattiviracin A1, a novel antiviral agent produced by Streptomyces microflavus strain No. 2445. II. Biological properties Abstract: Fattiviracin A1, showed potent antiviral activities against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza A virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It showed no cytotoxicity against Vero cells. Fattiviracin A1 exhibited no significant antibacterial or antifungal activities. Treatment of HSV-1 with fattiviracin A1 decreased its infectivity to Vero cells. The mechanism of its antiviral activity may be due to inactivation of the viral particles and inhibition of viral entry into host cells.	0
Abstract2class: Semisynthesis and Evaluation of Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Cassane-Type Diterpenoid Taepeenin F and of Some Synthetic Intermediates Abstract: A new strategy for the semisynthesis of the aromatic cassane-type diterpene taepeenin F (6) is reported. The introduction of the methyl group at C-14, characteristic of the target compound, was achieved via dienone 13, easily prepared from abietic acid (10), the major compound in renewable rosin. Biological assays of selected compounds are reported. The antiproliferative activity against HT29, B16-F10, and HepG2 tumor cell lines has been investigated. Salicylaldehyde 21 was the most active compound (IC50 = 7.72 μM). Products 16 and 21 displayed apoptotic effects in B16-F10 cells, with total apoptosis rates of 46 and 38.4%, respectively. This apoptotic process involves a significant arrest of the B16-F10 cell cycle, blocking the G0/G1 phase. Dienone 16 did not cause any loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while salicylaldehyde 21 caused a partial loss of the MMP. The anti-inflammatory activity of the selected compounds was investigated with the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. All compounds showed potent NO inhibition, with percentages between 80 and 99% at subcytotoxic concentrations. Dienone 16 inhibited LPS-induced differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells, by increasing the proportion of cells in the S phase. In addition, salicylaldehyde 21 had effects on the cell cycle, recovering the cells from the G0/G1 full arrest produced in response to LPS action.	0
Abstract2class: The Generation and Exploitation of Protein Mutability Landscapes for Enzyme Engineering Abstract: The increasing number of enzyme applications in chemical synthesis calls for new engineering methods to develop the biocatalysts of the future. An interesting concept in enzyme engineering is the generation of large-scale mutational data in order to chart protein mutability landscapes. These landscapes allow the important discrimination between beneficial mutations and those that are neutral or detrimental, thus providing detailed insight into sequence-function relationships. As such, mutability landscapes are a powerful tool with which to identify functional hotspots at any place in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme. These hotspots can be used as targets for combinatorial mutagenesis to yield superior enzymes with improved catalytic properties, stability, or even new enzymatic activities. The generation of mutability landscapes for multiple properties of one enzyme provides the exciting opportunity to select mutations that are beneficial either for one or for several of these properties. This review presents an overview of the recent advances in the construction of mutability landscapes and discusses their importance for enzyme engineering.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a set of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the aminonucleoside moiety of antibiotic A201A from Streptomyces capreolus Abstract: A novel cosmid (pABC6.5) whose DNA insert from Streptomyces capreolus, the A201A antibiotic producer, overlaps the inserts of the previously reported pCAR11 and pCAR13 cosmids, has been isolated. These two latter cosmids were known to contain the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A resistance determinants ard2 and ard1, respectively. Together, these three cosmids have permitted the identification of a DNA stretch of 19 kb between ard1 and ard2, which should comprise a large region of a putative A201A biosynthetic (ata) gene cluster. The sequence of the 7 kb upstream of ard1 towards ard2 reveals seven consecutive open reading frames: ataP3, ataP5, ataP4, ataP10, ataP7, ata12 and ataPKS1. Except for the last two, their deduced products present high similarities to an identical number of counterparts from the pur cluster of Streptomyces alboniger that were either known or proposed to be implicated in the biosynthesis of the N6,N6-dimethyl-3'-amino-3'-deoxyadenosine moiety of puromycin. Because A201A contains this chemical moiety, these ataP genes are most likely implicated in its biosynthesis. Accordingly, the ataP4, ataP5 and ataP10 genes complemented specific puromycin nonproducing Deltapur4, Deltapur5 and Deltapur10 mutants of S. alboniger, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that ata12 and ataPKS1 could be implicated in the biosynthesis of the d-rhamnose and alpha-p-coumaric acid moieties of A201A. Further sequencing of 2 kb of DNA downstream of ard1 has disclosed a region which might contain one end of the ata cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization and utilization of methyltransferase for apramycin production in Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius Abstract: A structurally unique aminoglycoside produced in Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius, Apramycin is used in veterinary medicine or the treatment of Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Pasteurella multocida infections. Although apramycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago, many biosynthetic steps of apramycin remain unknown. In this study, we identified a HemK family methyltransferase, AprI, to be the 7'-N-methyltransferase in apramycin biosynthetic pathway. Biochemical experiments showed that AprI converted demethyl-aprosamine to aprosamine. Through gene disruption of aprI, we identified a new aminoglycoside antibiotic demethyl-apramycin as the main product in aprI disruption strain. The demethyl-apramycin is an impurity in apramycin product. In addition to demethyl-apramycin, carbamyltobramycin is another major impurity. However, unlike demethyl-apramycin, tobramycin is biosynthesized by an independent biosynthetic pathway in S. tenebrarius. The titer and rate of apramycin were improved by overexpression of the aprI and disruption of the tobM2, which is a crucial gene for tobramycin biosynthesis. The titer of apramycin increased from 2227 ± 320 mg/L to 2331 ± 210 mg/L, while the titer of product impurity demethyl-apramycin decreased from 196 ± 36 mg/L to 51 ± 9 mg/L. Moreover, the carbamyltobramycin titer of the wild-type strain was 607 ± 111 mg/L and that of the engineering strain was null. The rate of apramycin increased from 68% to 87% and that of demethyl-apramycin decreased from 1.17% to 0.34%.	0
Abstract2class: Alloying at a Subnanoscale Maximizes the Synergistic Effect on the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Abstract: Bonding dissimilar elements to provide synergistic effects is an effective way to improve the performance of metal catalysts. However, as the properties become more dissimilar, achieving synergistic effects effectively becomes more difficult due to phase separation. Here we describe a comprehensive study on how subnanoscale alloying is always effective for inter-elemental synergy. Thirty-six combinations of both bimetallic subnanoparticles (SNPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) were studied systematically using atomic-resolution imaging and catalyst benchmarking based on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results revealed that SNPs always produce greater synergistic effects than NPs, the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr. The atomic-scale miscibility and the associated modulation of electronic states at the subnanoscale were much different from those at the nanoscale, which was observed by annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.	0
Abstract2class: Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface Abstract: Understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the putative bryostatin polyketide synthase gene cluster from "Candidatus Endobugula sertula", the uncultivated microbial symbiont of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina Abstract: The bryostatins are protein kinase C modulators with unique structural features and potential anticancer and neurological activities. These complex polyketides were isolated from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina, but recent studies indicate that they are produced by the uncultured symbiotic bacterium "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" ("E. sertula"). Here we present the putative biosynthetic genes: five modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, a discrete acyltransferase, a beta-ketosynthase, a hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA synthase (HMG-CS), and a methyltransferase. The cluster was sequenced in two closely related "E. sertula" strains from different host species. In one strain the gene cluster is contiguous, while in the other strain it is split into two loci, with one locus containing the PKS genes and the other containing the accessory genes. Here, we propose a hypothesis for the biosynthesis of the bryostatins. Thirteen PKS modules form the core macrolactone ring, and the pendent methyl ester groups are added by the HMG-CS gene cassette. The resulting hypothetical compound bryostatin 0 is the common basis for the 20 known bryostatins. As "E. sertula" is to date uncultured, heterologous expression of this biosynthetic gene cluster has the potential of producing the bioactive bryostatins in large enough quantities for development into a pharmaceutical.	1
Abstract2class: Interaction of kanamycin A and kanamycin B with phospholipids Abstract: It has been suggested that the aminoglycoside drugs are ototoxic because they contain amine groups that interact with membrane phospholipids. The interaction of kanamycin A and kanamycin B with vesicles containing various phospholipids was assessed from studies of vesicle aggregation and of the fluorescence of the probes 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) added to the system. Kanamycin B, with 5 amino groups, showed a stronger interaction with the acidic phospholipids than kanamycin A, with only 4 amino groups. The evidence indicated that the interaction was an ionic one involving the charged groups of both components with penetration of the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayers. Of all the phospholipids tested polyphosphoinositide showed the greatest ability to interact with the kanamycins, supporting the proposal that interaction with this phospholipid may be the basis of the ototoxicity of aminoglycosides.	0
Abstract2class: Mutational analysis reveals that all tailoring region genes are required for production of polyketide antibiotic mupirocin by pseudomonas fluorescens: pseudomonic acid B biosynthesis precedes pseudomonic acid A Abstract: The Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin biosynthetic cluster encodes six proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis and 26 single polypeptides proposed to perform largely tailoring functions. In-frame deletions in the tailoring open reading frames demonstrated that all are required for mupirocin production. A bidirectional promoter region was identified between mupF, which runs counter to other open reading frames and its immediate neighbor macpC, implying the 74-kb cluster consists of two transcriptional units. mupD/E and mupJ/K must be cotranscribed as pairs for normal function implying co-assembly during translation. MupJ and K belong to a widely distributed enzyme pair implicated, with MupH, in methyl addition. Deletion of mupF, a putative ketoreductase, produced a mupirocin analogue with a C-7 ketone. Deletion of mupC, a putative dienoyl CoA reductase, generated an analogue whose structure indicated that MupC is also implicated in control of the oxidation state around the tetrahydropyran ring of monic acid. Double mutants with DeltamupC and DeltamupO, DeltamupU, DeltamupV, or DeltamacpE produced pseudomonic acid B but not pseudomonic acid A, as do the mupO, U, V, and macpE mutants, indicating that MupC must work after MupO, U, and V.	1
Abstract2class: Copper-catalyzed oxidative homo- and cross-coupling of Grignard reagents using diaziridinone Abstract: Transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are among the most powerful synthetic transformations. This paper describes an efficient copper-catalyzed homo- and cross-coupling of Grignard reagents with di-tert-butyldiaziridinone as oxidant under mild conditions, giving the coupling products in good to excellent yields. The reaction process has a broad substrate scope and is also effective for the C(sp)-C(sp(3)) coupling.	0
Abstract2class: Total synthesis of (+)-SCH 351448 Abstract: A convergent synthesis of (+)-SCH 351448 (1), a monosodium salt of a C(2)-symmetric macrodiolide, is described. Our approach is based on a [4 + 2] annulation with a chiral allyl silane (anti-5c) to assemble the pyran subunits. Homodimerization was carried out in a stepwise fashion; initial esterification at C29' followed by macrocyclization at C29 afforded the desired macrodiolide.	0
Abstract2class: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acid D Abstract: A convergent total synthesis of the architecturally complex indole diterpenoid (-)-nodulisporic acid D has been achieved. Key synthetic transformations include vicinal difunctionalization of an advanced α,β-unsaturated aldehyde to form the E,F-trans-fused 5,6-ring system of the eastern hemisphere and a cascade cross-coupling/indolization protocol leading to the CDE multisubstituted indole core.	0
Abstract2class: Bacterial Analogs of Plant Tetrahydropyridine Alkaloids Mediate Microbial Interactions in a Rhizosphere Model System Abstract: Plants expend significant resources to select and maintain rhizosphere communities that benefit their growth and protect them from pathogens. A better understanding of assembly and function of rhizosphere microbial communities will provide new avenues for improving crop production. Secretion of antibiotics is one means by which bacteria interact with neighboring microbes and sometimes change community composition. In our analysis of a taxonomically diverse consortium from the soybean rhizosphere, we found that Pseudomonas koreensis selectively inhibits growth of Flavobacterium johnsoniae and other members of the Bacteroidetes grown in soybean root exudate. A genetic screen in P. koreensis identified a previously uncharacterized biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the inhibitory activity. Metabolites were isolated based on biological activity and were characterized using tandem mass spectrometry, multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, and Mosher ester analysis, leading to the discovery of a new family of bacterial tetrahydropyridine alkaloids, koreenceine A to D (metabolites 1 to 4). Three of these metabolites are analogs of the plant alkaloid γ-coniceine. Comparative analysis of the koreenceine cluster with the γ-coniceine pathway revealed distinct polyketide synthase routes to the defining tetrahydropyridine scaffold, suggesting convergent evolution. Koreenceine-type pathways are widely distributed among Pseudomonas species, and koreenceine C was detected in another Pseudomonas species from a distantly related cluster. This work suggests that Pseudomonas and plants convergently evolved the ability to produce similar alkaloid metabolites that can mediate interbacterial competition in the rhizosphere.IMPORTANCE The microbiomes of plants are critical to host physiology and development. Microbes are attracted to the rhizosphere due to massive secretion of plant photosynthates from roots. Microorganisms that successfully join the rhizosphere community from bulk soil have access to more abundant and diverse molecules, producing a highly competitive and selective environment. In the rhizosphere, as in other microbiomes, little is known about the genetic basis for individual species' behaviors within the community. In this study, we characterized competition between Pseudomonas koreensis and Flavobacterium johnsoniae, two common rhizosphere inhabitants. We identified a widespread gene cluster in several Pseudomonas spp. that is necessary for the production of a novel family of tetrahydropyridine alkaloids that are structural analogs of plant alkaloids. We expand the known repertoire of antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas in the rhizosphere and demonstrate the role of the metabolites in interactions with other rhizosphere bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic analyses of the putative O and K antigen gene clusters of pandemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus Abstract: Pandemic V. parahaemolyticus strains have rapidly changed their serotypes, but its determinants, especially K antigen, and the genes involved in serotype have been an open question. The purpose of this study was to gain insights into these points. Although V. parahaemolyticus is known to be lacking O-side chain on its lipopolysaccharide, and O antigens are thought to be represented by core OS, the genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 strain RIMD2210633 suggests that this bacterium potentially synthesizes O-side chain. To explore possible relatedness between this O-side chain biosynthesis gene cluster, which is similar in the serotypes of Vibrio cholerae, and of V. parahaemolyticus, we amplified both core OS and O-side chain gene clusters of the strains belonging to various serotypes of V. parahaemolyticus by long PCR and performed PCR RFLP analyses. The results of our RFLP analyses suggest that the core OS biosynthesis gene cluster is related to the O antigens of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus and that the putative O-side chain gene cluster is related to K antigens of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus. We then determined the sequence of these regions of a pandemic O4:K68 strain, and compared it with the corresponding sequence of RIMD2210633. In addition, PCR analysis showed the putative O4 and K68 antigen gene clusters are unique to the strains belonging to the O4 and K68 serotype respectively. The data implies that the pandemic O4:K68 V. parahaemolyticus strain emerged from the pandemic O3:K6 strain by replacement of the putative O and K antigen gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc rpsL and rpsG genes Abstract: The Leptospira biflexa rpsL and rpsG genes were sequenced. Although similar in many respects, proteins encoded by these L. biflexa genes had several unusual features when compared with homologous proteins of other organisms. Unlike the rpsL genes of other eubacteria, the L. biflexa rpsL gene is adjacent to a rpoC-like gene.	0
Abstract2class: The response regulator PmrA is a major regulator of the icm/dot type IV secretion system in Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii Abstract: Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii have been shown to utilize the icm/dot type IV secretion system for pathogenesis and recently a large number of icm/dot-translocated substrates were identified in L. pneumophila. Bioinformatic analysis has revealed that 13 of the genes encoding for L. pneumophila-translocated substrates and five of the C. burnetii icm/dot genes, contain a conserved regulatory element that resembles the target sequence of the PmrA response regulator. Experimental analysis which included the construction of a L. pneumophila pmrA deletion mutant, intracellular growth analysis, comparison of gene expression between L. pneumophila wild type and the pmrA mutant, construction of mutations in the PmrA conserved regulatory element, controlled expression studies as well as mobility shift assays, demonstrated the direct relation between the PmrA regulator and the expression of L. pneumophila icm/dot-translocated substrates and several C. burnetii icm/dot genes. Furthermore, genomic analysis identified 35 L. pneumophila and 68 C. burnetii unique genes that contain the PmrA regulatory element and few of these genes from L. pneumophila were found to be new icm/dot-translocated substrates. Our results establish the PmrA regulator as a fundamental regulator of the icm/dot type IV secretion system in these two bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Mitogenomics of recombinant mitochondrial genomes of Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels Abstract: Recombination in the control region (CR) of Mytilus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was originally reported based on the relatively short, sequenced fragments of mitochondrial genomes. Recombination outside the CR has been reported recently with the suggestion that such processes are common in Mytilus. We have fully sequenced a set of 11 different mitochondrial haplotypes representing the high diversity of paternally inherited mitochondrial genomes of Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels, including the haplotype close to the native Mytilus trossulus mitochondrial genome, which was thought to have been entirely eliminated from this population. Phylogenetic and comparative analysis showed that the recombination is limited to the vicinity of the CR in all sequenced genomes. Coding sequence comparison indicated that all paternally inherited genomes showed increased accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions, including the genomes which switched their transmission route very recently. The acquisition of certain CR sequences through recombination with highly divergent paternally inherited genomes seems to precede and favor the switch, but it is not a prerequisite for this process. Interspecies hybridization in the Baltic Sea during the recent 10,000 years created conditions for both structural and evolutionary mitochondrial instability which resulted in the observed variation and dynamics of mtDNA in Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels. In conclusion, the data shows that the effects of mitochondrial recombination are limited to the CR of few phylogenetic lineages.	0
Abstract2class: Modeling of the bacterial growth curve Abstract: Several sigmoidal functions (logistic, Gompertz, Richards, Schnute, and Stannard) were compared to describe a bacterial growth curve. They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the hrp clusters of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola that control the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in susceptible host rice Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the cause of bacterial leaf streak in rice, possesses clusters of hrp genes that determine its ability to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice. A 27-kb region of the genome of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (RS105) was identified and sequenced, revealing 10 hrp, 9 hrc (hrp conserved), and 8 hpa (hrp-associated) genes and 7 regulatory plant-inducible promoter boxes. While the region from hpa2 to hpaB and the hrpF operon resembled the corresponding genes of other xanthomonads, the hpaB-hrpF region incorporated an hrpE3 gene that was not present in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. We found that an hrpF mutant had lost the ability to elicit the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in adult rice plants but still caused water-soaking symptoms in rice seedlings and that Hpa1 is an HR elicitor in nonhost tobacco whose expression is controlled by an hrp regulator, HrpX. Using an Hrp phenotype complementation test, we identified a small hrp cluster containing the hrpG and hrpX regulatory genes, which is separated from the core hrp cluster. In addition, we identified a gene, prhA (plant-regulated hrp), that played a key role in the Hrp phenotype of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola but was neither in the core hrp cluster nor in the hrp regulatory cluster. A prhA mutant failed to reduce the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in rice but caused water-soaking symptoms in rice. This is the first report that X. oryzae pv. oryzicola possesses three separate DNA regions for HR induction in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice, which will provide a fundamental base to understand pathogenicity determinants of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola compared with those of X. oryzae pv. oryzae.	0
Abstract2class: A desaturase gene involved in the formation of 1,14-nonadecadiene in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 Abstract: The marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 synthesizes two alkenes, 1-nonadecene and 1,14-nonadecadiene. Whereas the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the terminal double bond in both alkenes has been characterized, the origin of the internal double bond in 1,14-nonadecadiene has not. In this study, we demonstrate that a gene encoding an uncharacterized desaturase is involved in the formation of the internal double bond of 1,14-nonadecadiene. Further, at low temperatures, the desaturase gene is essential for growth, and in wild-type cells the levels of 1,14-nonadecadiene increase relative to that of cells grown at 38°C. These data suggest that 1,14-nonadecadiene plays a role in responding to cold stress.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is a potent antitumor agent with a previously undescribed molecular architecture and mode of action. Cloning and characterization of the 85-kilobase C-1027 biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces globisporus revealed (i) an iterative type I polyketide synthase that is distinct from any bacterial polyketide synthases known to date, (ii) a general polyketide pathway for the biosynthesis of both the 9- and 10-membered enediyne antibiotics, and (iii) a convergent biosynthetic strategy for the C-1027 chromophore from four building blocks. Manipulation of genes governing C-1027 biosynthesis allowed us to produce an enediyne compound in a predicted manner.	1
Abstract2class: Determination of biomass by ultrasonic measurements Abstract: The quantitative determination of biomass in a suspension by means of ultrasound velocity is a simple and on-line-applicable method. Such an ultrasonic sensor offers the advantage of being long-term stable, reliable, and sterilizable. In this paper we present sound velocity measurements made with different microorganisms. The experimental results which we have obtained with an impulse-echo method will be compared with theoretical predictions and discussed with respect to previous findings (Y. Ishimori, I. Karube, and S. Suzuki, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42:632-637, 1981).	0
Abstract2class: Human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron synthesizes 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D- galacto-nononic acid (KDN) Abstract: The proper functioning of the human intestine is dependent on its bacterial symbionts, the most predominant of which belong to the Phylum Bacteroidetes. These bacteria are known to use variable displays of multiple capsular polysaccharides (CPs) to aid in their survival and foraging within the intestine. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent human gut symbiont and a remarkably versatile glycophile. The structure determination of the CPs, encoded by the eight CP loci, is the key to understanding the mechanism of this organism's adaptation on a molecular level. Herein, we report the bioinformatics-based discovery and chemical demonstration of a biosynthetic pathway that forms and cytidylates 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), most likely for inclusion in the CP encoded by B. thetaiotaomicron CP locus 7.	0
Abstract2class: Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076 harbours the largest actinomycete chromosome to date and the kistamicin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) have served as potent clinical drugs and as an inspiration to chemists in various disciplines. Among known GPAs, complestatin, chloropeptin, and kistamicin are unique in that they contain an unusual indole-phenol crosslink. The mechanism of formation of this linkage is unknown, and to date, the biosynthetic gene cluster of only one GPA with an indole-phenol crosslink, that of complestatin, has been identified. Here, we report the genome sequence of the kistamicin producer Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076. We find that this strain harbours the largest actinobacterial chromosome to date, consisting of a single linear chromosome of ∼13.1 Mbp. AntiSMASH analysis shows that ∼32 biosynthetic gene clusters and ∼10% of the genome are devoted to production of secondary metabolites, which include 1,6-dihydroxyphenazine and nomuricin, a new anthraquinone-type pentacyclic compound that we report herein. The kistamicin gene cluster (kis) was identified bioinformatically. A unique feature of kis is that it contains two cytochrome P450 enzymes, which likely catalyze three crosslinking reactions. These findings set the stage for examining the biosynthesis of kistamicin and its unusual indole-phenol crosslink in the future.	1
Abstract2class: Listeria monocytogenes Strains Underrepresented during Selective Enrichment with an ISO Method Might Dominate during Passage through Simulated Gastric Fluid and In Vitro Infection of Caco-2 Cells Abstract: Various Listeria monocytogenes strains may contaminate a single food product, potentially resulting in simultaneous exposure of consumers to multiple strains. However, due to bias in strain recovery, L. monocytogenes strains isolated from foods by selective enrichment (SE) might not always represent those that can better survive the immune system of a patient. We investigated the effect of cocultivation in tryptic soy broth with 0.6% yeast extract (TSB-Y) at 10°C for 8 days on (i) the detection of L. monocytogenes strains during SE with the ISO 11290-1:1996/Amd 1:2004 protocol and (ii) the in vitro virulence of strains toward the Caco-2 human colon epithelial cancer cell line following exposure to simulated gastric fluid (SGF; pH 2.0)-HCl (37°C). We determined whether the strains which were favored by SE would be effective competitors under the conditions of challenges related to gastrointestinal passage of the pathogen. Interstrain competition of L. monocytogenes in TSB-Y determined the relative population of each strain at the beginning of SE. This in turn impacted the outcome of SE (i.e., favoring survival of competitors with better fitness) and the levels exposed subsequently to SGF. However, strong growth competitors could be outcompeted after SGF exposure and infection of Caco-2 cells by strains outgrown in TSB-Y and underdetected (or even missed) during enrichment. Our data demonstrate a preferential selection of certain L. monocytogenes strains during enrichments, often not reflecting a selective advantage of strains during infection. These findings highlight a noteworthy scenario associated with the difficulty of matching the source of infection (food) with the L. monocytogenes isolate appearing to be the causative agent during listeriosis outbreak investigations.IMPORTANCE This report is relevant to understanding the processes involved in selection and prevalence of certain L. monocytogenes strains in different environments (i.e., foods or sites of humans exposed to the pathogen). It highlights the occurrence of multiple strains in the same food as an important aspect contributing to mismatches between clinical isolates and infection sources during listeriosis outbreak investigations.	0
Abstract2class: Development of a Multifunctional Benzophenone Linker for Peptide Stapling and Photoaffinity Labelling Abstract: Photoaffinity labelling is a useful method for studying how proteins interact with ligands and biomolecules, and can help identify and characterise new targets for the development of new therapeutics. We present the design and synthesis of a novel multifunctional benzophenone linker that serves as both a photo-crosslinking motif and a peptide stapling reagent. Using double-click stapling, we attached the benzophenone to the peptide via the staple linker, rather than by modifying the peptide sequence with a photo-crosslinking amino acid. When applied to a p53-derived peptide, the resulting photoreactive stapled peptide was able to preferentially crosslink with MDM2 in the presence of competing protein. This multifunctional linker also features an extra alkyne handle for downstream applications such as pull-down assays, and can be used to investigate the target selectivity of stapled peptides.	0
Abstract2class: Structure of the nucleotide radical formed during reaction of CDP/TTP with the E441Q-alpha2beta2 of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase Abstract: The Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleotides and requires a diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor for catalysis. RNR is composed of a 1:1 complex of two homodimeric subunits: alpha and beta. Incubation of the E441Q-alpha mutant RNR with substrate CDP and allosteric effector TTP results in loss of the tyrosyl radical and formation of two new radicals on the 200 ms to min time scale. The first radical was previously established by stopped flow UV/vis spectroscopy and pulsed high field EPR spectroscopy to be a disulfide radical anion. The second radical was proposed to be a 4'-radical of a 3'-keto-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate. To identify the structure of the nucleotide radical [1'-(2)H], [2'-(2)H], [4'-(2)H], [5'-(2)H], [U-(13)C, (15)N], [U-(15)N], and [5,6 -(2)H] CDP and [beta-(2)H] cysteine-alpha were synthesized and incubated with E441Q-alpha2beta2 and TTP. The nucleotide radical was examined by 9 GHz and 140 GHz pulsed EPR spectroscopy and 35 GHz ENDOR spectroscopy. Substitution of (2)H at C4' and C1' altered the observed hyperfine interactions of the nucleotide radical and established that the observed structure was not that predicted. DFT calculations (B3LYP/IGLO-III/B3LYP/TZVP) were carried out in an effort to recapitulate the spectroscopic observations and lead to a new structure consistent with all of the experimental data. The results indicate, unexpectedly, that the radical is a semidione nucleotide radical of cytidine 5'-diphosphate. The relationship of this radical to the disulfide radical anion is discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Terrein biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus and its impact on phytotoxicity Abstract: Terrein is a fungal metabolite with ecological, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and antioxidative activities. Although it is produced by Aspergillus terreus as one of its major secondary metabolites, not much is known about its biosynthetic pathway. Here, we describe an unexpected discovery of the terrein biosynthesis gene locus made while we were looking for a PKS gene involved in production of conidia coloration pigments common for Aspergilli. The gene, ATEG_00145, here named terA, is essential for terrein biosynthesis and heterologous production of TerA in Aspergillus niger revealed an unusual plasticity in the products formed, yielding a mixture of 4-hydroxy-6-methylpyranone, orsellinic acid, and 6,7-dihydroxymellein. Biochemical and molecular genetic analyses indicate a low extension cycle specificity of TerA. Furthermore, 6-hydroxymellein was identified as a key intermediate in terrein biosynthesis. We find that terrein production is highly induced on plant-derived media, that terrein has phytotoxic activity on plant growth, and induces lesions on fruit surfaces.	1
Abstract2class: Function of glycosyltransferase genes involved in urdamycin A biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Urdamycin A, the principle product of Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, is an angucycline-type antibiotic. The polyketide-derived aglycone moiety is glycosylated at two positions, but only limited information is available about glycosyltransferases involved in urdamycin biosynthesis.                  Results:                       To determine the function of three glycosyltransferase genes in the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, we have carried out gene inactivation and expression experiments. Inactivation of urdGT1a resulted in the predominant accumulation of urdamycin B. A mutant lacking urdGT1b and urdGT1c mainly produced compound 100-2. When urdGT1c was expressed in the urdGT1b/urdGT1c double mutant, urdamycin G and urdamycin A were detected. The mutant lacking all three genes mainly accumulated aquayamycin and urdamycinone B. Expression of urdGT1c in the triple mutant led to the formation of compound 100-1, whereas expression of urdGT1a resulted in the formation of compound 100-2. Co-expression of urdGT1b and urdGT1c resulted in the production of 12b-derhodinosyl-urdamycin A, and co-expression of urdGT1a, urdGT1b and urdGT1c resulted in the formation of urdamycin A.                  Conclusions:                       Analysis of glycosyltransferase genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster led to an unambiguous assignment of each glycosyltransferase to a certain biosynthetic saccharide attachment step.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular study on the carAB operon reveals that carB gene is required for swimming and biofilm formation in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri Abstract: Background:                       The carA and carB genes code the small and large subunits of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPS) that responsible for arginine and pyrimidine production. The purpose of this work was to study the gene organization and expression pattern of carAB operon, and the biological functions of carA and carB genes in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri.                  Methods:                       RT-PCR method was employed to identify the full length of carAB operon transcript in X. citri subsp. citri. The promoter of carAB operon was predicted and analyzed its activity by fusing a GUS reporter gene. The swimming motility was tested on 0.25% agar NY plates with 1% glucose. Biofilm was measured by cell adhesion to polyvinyl chloride 96-well plate.                  Results:                       The results indicated that carAB operon was composed of five gene members carA-orf-carB-greA-rpfE. A single promoter was predicted from the nucleotide sequence upstream of carAB operon, and its sensitivity to glutamic acid, uracil and arginine was confirmed by fusing a GUS reporter gene. Deletion mutagenesis of carB gene resulted in reduced abilities in swimming on soft solid media and in forming biofilm on polystyrene microtiter plates.                  Conclusions:                       From these results, we concluded that carAB operon was involved in multiple biological processes in X. citri subsp. citri.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic origin of the rare nitroaryl moiety of the polyketide antibiotic aureothin: involvement of an unprecedented N-oxygenase Abstract: The antibiotic aureothin is a rare natural nitroaromatic compound produced by Streptomyces thioluteus. By labeling experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that p-nitrobenzoate (PNBA) serves as a polyketide synthase starter unit. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that this unusual primer is synthesized from p-aminobenzoate (PABA) by means of AurF, a novel N-oxygenase.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of specific B cell linear epitopes of mycoplasma hyorhinis P37 protein using monoclonal antibodies against baculovirus-expressed P37 protein Abstract: Background:                       Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Mhr) is the etiologic agent of lameness and polyserositis in swine. P37 is a membrane protein of Mhr that may be an important immunogen and is a potential target for diagnostic development. However, there is little information concerning Mhr P37 protein epitopes. A precise analysis of the P37 protein epitopes should extend our understanding of the antigenic composition of the P37 protein and the humoral immune responses to Mhr infection. Investigating the epitopes of Mhr P37 will help to establish a detection method for Mhr in tissue and provide an effective tool for detecting Mhr infection.                  Results:                       Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) confirmed that the expressed P37 protein was recognized by Mhr-positive porcine and mouse sera. Furthermore, the P37 protein was purified using affinity chromatography and used to immunize mice for hybridoma cell fusion. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) found to be positive for Mhr were detected in infected lung tissue. A panel of truncated P37 proteins was used to identify the minimal B cell linear epitopes of the protein based on these mAbs. The core epitope was determined to be 206KIKKAWNDKDWNTFRNF222. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 17 critical amino acids that determine the epitope of the P37 protein of Mhr. This study identified mAbs that could provide useful tools for investigating the Mhr P37 antigenic core epitope (amino acids 206-222) and detecting Mhr-specific antigens in infected tissue.	0
Abstract2class: Two Fis regulators directly repress the expression of numerous effector-encoding genes in Legionella pneumophila Abstract: Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular human pathogen that utilizes the Icm/Dot type IVB secretion system to translocate a large repertoire of effectors into host cells. For most of these effectors, there is no information regarding their regulation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the three L. pneumophila Fis homologs in the regulation of effector-encoding genes. Deletion mutants constructed in the genes encoding the three Fis regulators revealed that Fis1 (lpg0542 gene) and Fis3 (lpg1743) but not Fis2 (lpg1370) are partially required for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in Acanthamoeba castellanii. To identify pathogenesis-related genes directly regulated by Fis, we established a novel in vivo system which resulted in the discovery of numerous effector-encoding genes directly regulated by Fis. Further examination of these genes revealed that Fis1 and Fis3 repress the level of expression of effector-encoding genes during exponential phase. Three groups of effector-encoding genes were identified: (i) effectors regulated mainly by Fis1, (ii) effectors regulated mainly by Fis3, and (iii) effectors regulated by both Fis1 and Fis3. Examination of the upstream regulatory region of all of these effector-encoding genes revealed multiple putative Fis regulatory elements, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that a few of these sites constitute part of a repressor binding element. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the direct relation between the Fis1 and Fis3 regulators and these regulatory elements. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that two of the three L. pneumophila Fis regulators directly repress the expression of Icm/Dot effector-encoding genes.	0
Abstract2class: Real-time imaging of surface chemical reactions by electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscopy Abstract: Traditional electrochemical measurements based on either current or potential responses only present the average contribution of an entire electrode's surface. Here, we present an electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscope (EPRM) in which a potential-dependent nonlinear photothermal signal is exploited to map an electrochemical process with sub-micron spatial resolution. By using EPRM, we are able to monitor the photothermal signal of a Pt electrode during the electrochemical reaction at an imaging speed of 0.3 s per frame. The potential-dependent photothermal signal, which is sensitive to the free electron density, clearly revealed the evolution of surface species on the Pt surface. Our results agreed well with the reported spectroelectrochemical techniques under similar conditions but with a much faster imaging speed. We further mapped the potential oscillation during the oxidation of formic acid on the Pt surface. The photothermal images from the Pt electrode well matched the potential change. This technique opens new prospects for real-time imaging of surface chemical reaction to reveal the heterogeneity of electrochemical reactivity, which enables broad applications to the study of catalysis, energy storage, and light harvest systems.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery and Characterization of Bicereucin, an Unusual d-Amino Acid-Containing Mixed Two-Component Lantibiotic Abstract: Lantibiotics are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) exhibiting antimicrobial activity. They are characterized by the presence of the thioether-containing bisamino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Here, we report a two-component lantibiotic from Bacillus cereus SJ1 with unusual structural features that we named bicereucin. Unlike all previous two-component lantibiotics, only one of the two peptides of bicereucin contains a lanthionine. The second peptide lacks any cysteines but contains several d-amino acids. These are installed by the dehydrogenase BsjJB, the activity of which was successfully reconstituted in vitro. The proteolytic removal of the leader peptide was also performed in vitro. Bicereucin displayed synergistic antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci as well as hemolytic activity. To illustrate the utility of the enzymes, an analog of the d-amino acid containing opioid dermorphin was successfully produced in E. coli by employing the dehydratase BsjM and the dehydrogenase NpnJA.	1
Abstract2class: Insect antimicrobial peptides and their applications Abstract: Insects are one of the major sources of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs). Since observation of antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of pupae from the giant silk moths Samia Cynthia and Hyalophora cecropia in 1974 and purification of first insect AMP (cecropin) from H. cecropia pupae in 1980, over 150 insect AMPs have been purified or identified. Most insect AMPs are small and cationic, and they show activities against bacteria and/or fungi, as well as some parasites and viruses. Insect AMPs can be classified into four families based on their structures or unique sequences: the α-helical peptides (cecropin and moricin), cysteine-rich peptides (insect defensin and drosomycin), proline-rich peptides (apidaecin, drosocin, and lebocin), and glycine-rich peptides/proteins (attacin and gloverin). Among insect AMPs, defensins, cecropins, proline-rich peptides, and attacins are common, while gloverins and moricins have been identified only in Lepidoptera. Most active AMPs are small peptides of 20-50 residues, which are generated from larger inactive precursor proteins or pro-proteins, but gloverins (~14 kDa) and attacins (~20 kDa) are large antimicrobial proteins. In this mini-review, we will discuss current knowledge and recent progress in several classes of insect AMPs, including insect defensins, cecropins, attacins, lebocins and other proline-rich peptides, gloverins, and moricins, with a focus on structural-functional relationships and their potential applications.	0
Abstract2class: Acyclic CB[n]-type molecular containers: effect of solubilizing group on their function as solubilizing excipients Abstract: We report the synthesis and X-ray crystal structures of three acyclic CB[n]-type molecular containers (2a, 2h, 2f) that differ in the charge on their solubilizing groups (SO3(−), OH, NH3(+)). The X-ray crystal structures of compounds 2h and 2f reveal a self-folding of the ArOCH2CH2X wall into the cavity driven by π–π interactions, H-bonds and ion–dipole interactions. The need to reverse this self-folding phenomenon upon guest binding decreases the affinity of 2h and 2f toward cationic guests in water relative to 2a as revealed by direct (1)H NMR and UV/Vis titrations as well as UV/Vis competition experiments. We determined the pKa of 6-aminocoumarin 7 (pKa = 3.6) on its own and in the presence anionic, neutral, and cationic hosts (2a: pKa = 4.9; 2h: pKa = 4.1; 2f, pKa = 3.4) which reflect in part the relevance of direct ion–ion interactions between the arms of the host and the guest toward the recognition properties of acyclic CB[n]-type containers. Finally, we showed that the weaker binding affinities measured for neutral and positively charged hosts 2h and 2f compared to anionic 2a results in a decreased ability to act as solubilizing agents for either cationic (tamoxifen), neutral (17α-ethynylestradiol), or anionic (indomethacin) drugs in water. The results establish that acyclic CB[n] compounds that bear anionic solubilizing groups are most suitable for development as general purpose solubilizing excipients for insoluble pharmaceutical agents.	0
Abstract2class: Co-linearity and divergence of the A subgenome of Brassica juncea compared with other Brassica species carrying different A subgenomes Abstract: Background:                       There are three basic Brassica genomes (A, B, and C) and three parallel sets of subgenomes distinguished in the diploid Brassica (i.e.: B. rapa, A(r)A(r); B. nigra, B(ni)B(ni); B. oleracea, C(o)C(o)) and the derived allotetraploid species (i.e.: B. juncea, A(j)A(j)B(j)B(j); B. napus, A(n)A(n)C(n)C(n); B. carinata, B(c)B(c)C(c)C(c)). To understand subgenome differentiation in B. juncea in comparison to other A genome-carrying Brassica species (B. rapa and B. napus), we constructed a dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea, and conducted population genetic analysis on diverse lines of the three A-genome carrying Brassica species using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach (DArT-seq).                  Results:                       A dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea was constructed using an F2 population derived from Sichuan Yellow/Purple Mustard. The map included 3329 DArT-seq markers on 18 linkage groups and covered 1579 cM with an average density of two markers per cM. Based on this map and the alignment of the marker sequences with the physical genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we observed strong co-linearity of the ancestral blocks among the different A subgenomes but also considerable block variation. Comparative analyses at the level of genome sequences of B. rapa and B. napus, and marker sequence anchored on the genetic map of B. juncea, revealed a total of 30 potential inversion events across large segments and 20 potential translocation events among the three A subgenomes. Population genetic analysis on 26 accessions of the three A genome-carrying Brassica species showed that the highest genetic distance were estimated when comparing A(j)-A(n) than between A(n)-A(r) and A(j)-A(r) subgenome pairs.                  Conclusions:                       The development of the dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea with informative DArT-seq marker sequences and availability of the reference sequences of the A(r), and A(n)C(n) genomes allowed us to compare the A subgenome structure of B. juncea (A(j)) . Our results suggest that strong co-linearity exists among the three A Brassica genomes (A(r), A(n) and A(j)) but with apparent subgenomic variation. Population genetic analysis on three A-genome carrying Brassica species support the idea that B. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different A genome progenitor of B. napus.	0
Abstract2class: Rh(I)-catalyzed Pauson-Khand-type cycloaddition reaction of ene-vinylidenecyclopropanes with carbon monoxide (CO) Abstract: An intramolecular Pauson-Khand type cycloaddition reaction of ene-vinylidenecyclopropanes with carbon monoxide has been established by using [Rh(COD)Cl](2) as the catalyst. The reaction was found to be highly efficient in solvents of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane to give excellent yields of 90-99%. The reaction provides easy access to a series of fused 6,5-ring structures containing spiro-cyclopropane units that are useful for drug design and development. A mechanism of this cycloaddition process has been proposed accounting for structures of resulting products that were unambiguously assigned by X-ray diffractional analysis.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular Cloning and Functional Analysis of Gene Clusters for the Biosynthesis of Indole-Diterpenes in Penicillium crustosum and P. janthinellum Abstract: The penitremane and janthitremane families of indole-diterpenes are abundant natural products synthesized by Penicillium crustosum and P. janthinellum. Using a combination of PCR, cosmid library screening, and Illumina sequencing we have identified gene clusters encoding enzymes for the synthesis of these compounds. Targeted deletion of penP in P. crustosum abolished the synthesis of penitrems A, B, D, E, and F, and led to accumulation of paspaline, a key intermediate for paxilline biosynthesis in P. paxilli. Similarly, deletion of janP and janD in P. janthinellum abolished the synthesis of prenyl-elaborated indole-diterpenes, and led to accumulation in the latter of 13-desoxypaxilline, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the structurally related aflatremanes synthesized by Aspergillus flavus. This study helps resolve the genetic basis for the complexity of indole-diterpene natural products found within the Penicillium and Aspergillus species. All indole-diterpene gene clusters identified to date have a core set of genes for the synthesis of paspaline and a suite of genes encoding multi-functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, FAD dependent monooxygenases, and prenyl transferases that catalyse various regio- and stereo- specific oxidations that give rise to the diversity of indole-diterpene products synthesized by this group of fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Evidence and characterization of a gene cluster required for the production of viscosin, a lipopeptide biosurfactant, by a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens Abstract: The genetic control of viscosin production was examined in a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfA7B) that causes broccoli head rot. Viscosin is a potent lipopeptide biosurfactant that enables the bacteria to come into intimate contact with the difficult-to-wet waxy heads of broccoli. Tn5 mutagenesis completely disrupted viscosin production as shown by HPLC analysis of the mutagenized cell lysates. The Vis- mutants retained their pectolytic capability and were able to decay potato slices. On broccoli, however, the Vis- mutants caused decay of wounded florets, but the decay failed to spread to adjacent nonwounded florets as had occurred with the wild-type PfA7B. Triparental matings of the Vis- mutants with their corresponding wild-type clones and the helper Escherichia coli HB101 carrying the mobilization plasmid pPK2013 resulted in three stable viscosin-producing transconjugants that caused typical decay of broccoli tissue. Linkage maps of clones and protein profiles showed that a 25-kb chromosomal DNA region of PfA7B affected the production of three high molecular mass proteins required for viscosin synthesis. These proteins, approximately 218, 215, and 137 kDa in size, likely compose a synthetase complex that assembles the nine amino acid peptide of viscosin and subsequently attaches this to the hydrophobic fatty acid component of the molecule. A probe made from this DNA region hybridized with DNA fragments of other phytopathogenic pseudomonads to varying degrees.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of staphyloferrin B biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Siderophores are iron-scavenging molecules produced by many microbes. In general, they are synthesized using either non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) pathways. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores, of which the structures of staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B are known. Recently, the NIS biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin A was characterized. Here we show that, in S. aureus, the previously identified sbn (siderophore biosynthesis) locus encodes enzymes required for the synthesis of staphyloferrin B, an alpha-hydroxycarboxylate siderophore comprised of l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid, 1,2-diaminoethane and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Staphyloferrin B NIS biosynthesis was recapitulated in vitro, using purified recombinant Sbn enzymes and the component substrates. In vitro synthesized staphyloferrin B readily promoted the growth of iron-starved S. aureus, via the ABC transporter SirABC. The SbnCEF synthetases and a decarboxylase, SbnH, were necessary and sufficient to produce staphyloferrin B in reactions containing component substrates l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Since 1,2-diaminoethane was not required, this component of the siderophore arises from the SbnH-dependent decarboxylation of a 2,3-diaminoproprionic acid-containing intermediate. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analyses of a series of enzyme reactions identified mass ions corresponding to biosynthetic intermediates, allowing for the first proposed biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin B.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the ergot alkaloids Abstract: The ergots are a structurally diverse group of alkaloids derived from tryptophan and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) . The potent bioactivity of ergot alkaloids have resulted in their use in many applications throughout human history. In this highlight, we recap some of the history of the ergot alkaloids, along with a brief description of the classifications of the different ergot structures and producing organisms. Finally we describe what the advancements that have been made in understanding the biosynthetic pathways, both at the genomic and the biochemical levels. We note that several excellent review on the ergot alkaloids, including one by Wallwey and Li in Nat. Prod. Rep., have been published recently. We provide a brief overview of the ergot alkaloids, and highlight the advances in biosynthetic pathway elucidation that have been made since 2011 in Section 4.	1
Abstract2class: Mechanistic studies of Ser/Thr dehydration catalyzed by a member of the LanL lanthionine synthetase family Abstract: Members of the LanL family of lanthionine synthetases consist of three catalytic domains, an N-terminal pSer/pThr lyase domain, a central Ser/Thr kinase domain, and a C-terminal lanthionine cyclase domain. The N-terminal lyase domain has sequence homology with members of the OspF family of effector proteins. In this study, the residues in the lyase domain of VenL that are conserved in the active site of OspF proteins were mutated to evaluate their importance for catalysis. In addition, residues that are fully conserved in the LanL family but not in the OspF family were mutated. Activity assays with these mutant proteins are consistent with a model in which Lys80 in VenL deprotonates the α-proton of pSer/pThr residues to initiate the elimination reaction. Lys51 is proposed to activate this proton by coordination to the carbonyl of the pSer/pThr, and His53 is believed to protonate the phosphate leaving group. These functions are very similar to the corresponding homologous residues in OspF proteins. On the other hand, recognition of the phosphate group of pSer/pThr appears to be achieved differently in VenL than in the OspF proteins. Arg156 and Lys103 are thought to interact with the phosphate group on the basis of a structural homology model.	1
Abstract2class: Purification and characterization of S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus Abstract: An S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase has been isolated and purified from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus ATCC 13257. Deamination represents the major metabolic route of S-adenosylhomocysteine in this organism. The protein was found to be monomeric with a molecular weight of 56,100 +/- 1,600. The activity was optimal at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C, and the deaminase was inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate but not by metal chelators. The Km for S-adenosylhomocysteine is 2.5 mM, and the Ki for inhibition by deoxycoformycin is 1.6 nM.	0
Abstract2class: Pyridone Luciferins and Mutant Luciferases for Bioluminescence Imaging Abstract: New applications for bioluminescence imaging require an expanded set of luciferase enzymes and luciferin substrates. Here, we report two novel luciferins for use in vitro and in cells. These molecules comprise regioisomeric pyridone cores that can be accessed from a common synthetic route. The analogues exhibited unique emission spectra with firefly luciferase, although photon intensities remained weak. Enhanced light outputs were achieved by using mutant luciferase enzymes. One of the luciferin-luciferase pairs produced light on par with native probes in live cells. The pyridone analogues and complementary luciferases add to a growing set of designer probes for bioluminescence imaging.	0
Abstract2class: Selecting the highest of three binomial probabilities Abstract: A sequential elimination procedure for selecting the highest probability in binomial trials, proposed by Levin and Robbins [Levin, B. & Robbins, H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4663-4666], is examined further in the special case of trials involving three probabilities. A conjectured inequality relating ratios of selection probabilities to odds ratios is shown to hold only under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. Weaker conjectured inequalities involving the probability of correct selection are shown to hold without restriction.	0
Abstract2class: Enantioselective CuH-Catalyzed Hydroacylation Employing Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids as Aldehyde Surrogates Abstract: The direct asymmetric copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed coupling of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids to aryl alkenes to access chiral α-aryl dialkyl ketones is reported. A variety of substrate substitution patterns, sensitive functional groups, and heterocycles are tolerated in this reaction, which significantly expands the range of accessible products compared with existing hydroacylation methodology. Although mechanistic studies are ongoing, we propose that CuH-catalyzed silylation of unsaturated acids occurs to access a uniquely effective acyl electrophilic coupling partner.	0
Abstract2class: Biochemical characterization of the SgcA1 alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase from the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthetic pathway and overexpression of sgcA1 in Streptomyces globisporus to improve C-1027 production Abstract: Sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 from Streptomyces globisporus has previously suggested that the sgcA1 gene encodes a alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (Glc-1-P-TT) catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the 4-deoxy-4-(dimethylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-d-ribopyranose moiety by activating alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) into deoxythymidine diphosphate-alpha-d-glucose (dTDP-Glc). Here we report the overexpression of sgcA1 in E. coli, purification of the overproduced SgcA1 to homogenetity, biochemical and kinetic characterization of the purified SgcA1 as a Glc-1-P-TT, and yield improvement for C-1027 production by overexpression of sgcA1 and its flanking gene in S. globisporus. These findings provide biochemical evidence supporting the genetics-based hypothesis for C-1027 biosynthesis, set the stage for further investigation of the deoxysugar biosynthetic pathway, and demonstrate the utility of sugar biosynthesis genes in natural product yield improvement via combinatorial biosynthesis methods. In contrast to the homotetrameric quaternary structure known for Glc-1-P-TT enzymes from primary metabolic pathways, Glc-1-P-TT enzymes such as SgcA1 from secondary metabolic pathways are monomeric in solution. Sequence differences between the two subclasses of Glc-1-P-TT enzymes were noted. The monomeric structural feature of the latter enzymes could be exploited in engineering Glc-1-P-TT enzymes with broad substrate specificity for structural diversity via the glycorandomization strategy.	1
Abstract2class: FKS mutations and elevated echinocandin MIC values among Candida glabrata isolates from U.S. population-based surveillance Abstract: Candida glabrata is the second leading cause of candidemia in the United States. Its high-level resistance to triazole antifungal drugs has led to the increased use of the echinocandin class of antifungal agents for primary therapy of these infections. We monitored C. glabrata bloodstream isolates from a population-based surveillance study for elevated echinocandin MIC values (MICs of ≥0.25 μg/ml). From the 490 C. glabrata isolates that were screened, we identified 16 isolates with an elevated MIC value (2.9% of isolates from Atlanta and 2.0% of isolates from Baltimore) for one or more of the echinocandin drugs caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin. All of the isolates with elevated MIC values had a mutation in the previously identified hot spot 1 of either the glucan synthase FKS1 (n = 2) or FKS2 (n = 14) gene. No mutations were detected in hot spot 2 of either FKS1 or FKS2. The predominant mutation was mutation of FKS2-encoded serine 663 to proline (S663P), found in 10 of the isolates with elevated echinocandin MICs. Two of the mutations, R631G for FKS1 and R665G for FKS2, have not been reported previously for C. glabrata. Multilocus sequence typing indicated that the predominance of the S663P mutation was not due to the clonal spread of a single sequence type. With a rising number of echinocandin therapy failures reported, it is important to continue to monitor rates of elevated echinocandin MIC values and the associated mutations.	0
Abstract2class: Research Progress of the Biosynthesis of Natural Bio-Antibacterial Agent Pulcherriminic Acid in Bacillus Abstract: Pulcherriminic acid is a cyclic dipeptide found mainly in Bacillus and yeast. Due to the ability of pulcherriminic acid to chelate Fe3+ to produce reddish brown pulcherrimin, microorganisms capable of synthesizing pulcherriminic acid compete with other microorganisms for environmental iron ions to achieve bacteriostatic effects. Therefore, studying the biosynthetic pathway and their enzymatic catalysis, gene regulation in the process of synthesis of pulcherriminic acid in Bacillus can facilitate the industrial production, and promote the wide application in food, agriculture and medicine industries. After initially discussing, this review summarizes current research on the synthesis of pulcherriminic acid by Bacillus, which includes the crystallization of key enzymes, molecular catalytic mechanisms, regulation of synthetic pathways, and methods to improve efficiency in synthesizing pulcherriminic acid and its precursors. Finally, possible applications of pulcherriminic acid in the fermented food, such as Chinese Baijiu, applying combinatorial biosynthesis will be summarized.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation, synthesis, and biological activity of aphrocallistin, an adenine-substituted bromotyramine metabolite from the Hexactinellida sponge Aphrocallistes beatrix Abstract: A new adenine-substituted bromotyrosine-derived metabolite designated as aphrocallistin (1) has been isolated from the deep-water Hexactinellida sponge Aphrocallistes beatrix. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data and confirmed through a convergent, modular total synthetic route that is amenable toward future analogue preparation. Aphrocallistin inhibits the growth of a panel of human tumor cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 7.5 to >100 microM and has been shown to induce G1 cell cycle arrest in the PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cell line. Aphrocallistin has been fully characterized in the NCI cancer cell line panel and has undergone in vitro ADME pharmacological profiling.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of Methanobactin from Methylosinus sp. LW4 Abstract: Methanobactins (Mbns) are a growing family of ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified natural products. Characteristic nitrogen-containing heterocycles and neighboring thioamides allow these compounds to bind copper with high affinity. Genome mining has enabled the identification of Mbn operons in bacterial genomes and the prediction of diverse Mbn structures from operon content and precursor peptide sequence. Here we report the characterization of Mbn from Methylosinus (Ms.) species (sp.) LW4. The peptide backbone is distinct from all previously characterized Mbns, and the post-translational modifications correspond precisely to those predicted on the basis of the Ms. sp. LW4 Mbn operon. Thus, prediction based on genome analysis combined with isolation and structural characterization represents a phylogenetic approach to finding diverse Mbns and elucidating their biosynthetic pathways.	1

Abstract2class: Selecting the highest of three binomial probabilities Abstract: A sequential elimination procedure for selecting the highest probability in binomial trials, proposed by Levin and Robbins [Levin, B. & Robbins, H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4663-4666], is examined further in the special case of trials involving three probabilities. A conjectured inequality relating ratios of selection probabilities to odds ratios is shown to hold only under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. Weaker conjectured inequalities involving the probability of correct selection are shown to hold without restriction.	0
Abstract2class: Gatekeeping versus promiscuity in the early stages of the andrimid biosynthetic assembly line Abstract: The antibiotic andrimid, a nanomolar inhibitor of bacterial acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, is generated on an unusual polyketide/nonribosomal peptide enzyme assembly line in that all thiolation (T) domains/small-molecule building stations are on separate proteins. In addition, a transglutaminase homologue is used to condense andrimid building blocks together on the andrimid assembly line. The first two modules of the andrimid assembly line yields an octatrienoyl-beta-Phe-thioester tethered to the AdmI T domain, with amide bond formation carried out by a free-standing transglutaminase homologue AdmF. Analysis of the aminomutase AdmH reveals its specific conversion from l-Phe to (S)-beta-Phe, which in turn is activated by AdmJ and ATP to form (S)-beta-Phe-aminoacyl-AMP. AdmJ then transfers the (S)-beta-Phe moiety to one of the free-standing T domains, AdmI, but not AdmA, which instead gets loaded with an octatrienoyl group by other enzymes. AdmF, the amide synthase, will accept a variety of acyl groups in place of the octatrienoyl donor if presented on either AdmA or AdmI. AdmF will also use either stereoisomer of phenylalanine or beta-Phe when presented on AdmA and AdmI, but not when placed on noncognate T domains. Further, we show the polyketide synthase proteins responsible for the polyunsaturated acyl cap can be bypassed in vitro with N-acetylcysteamine as a low-molecular-weight acyl donor to AdmF and also in vivo in an Escherichia coli strain bearing the andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster with a knockout in admA.	1
Abstract2class: The proteome and phosphoproteome of Neurospora crassa in response to cellulose, sucrose and carbon starvation Abstract: Improving cellulolytic enzyme production by plant biomass degrading fungi holds great potential in reducing costs associated with production of next-generation biofuels generated from lignocellulose. How fungi sense cellulosic materials and respond by secreting enzymes has mainly been examined by assessing function of transcriptional regulators and via transcriptional profiling. Here, we obtained global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of the plant biomass degrading filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa grown on different carbon sources, i.e. sucrose, no carbon, and cellulose, by performing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based LC-MS/MS analyses. A comparison between proteomes and transcriptomes under identical carbon conditions suggests that extensive post-transcriptional regulation occurs in N. crassa in response to exposure to cellulosic material. Several hundred amino acid residues with differential phosphorylation levels on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) or carbon-free medium vs sucrose medium were identified, including phosphorylation sites in a major transcriptional activator for cellulase genes, CLR1, as well as a cellobionic acid transporter, CBT1. Mutation of phosphorylation sites on CLR1 did not have a major effect on transactivation of cellulase production, while mutation of phosphorylation sites in CBT1 increased its transporting capacity. Our data provides rich information at both the protein and phosphorylation levels of the early cellular responses to carbon starvation and cellulosic induction and aids in a greater understanding of the underlying post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in filamentous fungi.	0
Abstract2class: Phage display to identify Nedd8-mimicking peptides as inhibitors of the Nedd8 transfer cascade Abstract: The Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) launches the transfer of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 through an enzymatic cascade to covalently modify a diverse array of proteins, thus regulating their biological functions in the cell. The C-terminal peptide of Nedd8 extends deeply into the active site of NAE and plays an important role in the specific recognition of Nedd8 by NAE. We used phage display to profile C-terminal mutant sequences of Nedd8 that could be recognized by NAE for the activation reaction. We found that NAE can accommodate diverse changes in the Nedd8 C-terminal sequence (⁷¹ LALRGG⁷⁶), including Arg and Ile replacing Leu71, Leu, Ser, and Gln replacing Ala72, and substitutions by bulky aromatic residues at positions 73 and 74. We also observed that short peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of the Nedd8 variants can be activated by NAE to form peptide~NAE thioester conjugates. Once NAE is covalently loaded with these Nedd8-mimicking peptides, it can no longer activate full-length Nedd8 for transfer to the neddylation targets, such as the cullin subunits of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). We have thus developed a new method to inhibit protein neddylation by Nedd8-mimicking peptides.	0
Abstract2class: Highly enantioselective synthesis of (R)-1,3-butanediol via deracemization of the corresponding racemate by a whole-cell stereoinverting cascade system Abstract: Background:                       Deracemization, the transformation of the racemate into a single stereoisomeric product in 100% theoretical yield, is an appealing but challenging option for the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure chiral compounds as important pharmaceutical intermediates. To enhance the synthesis of (R)-1,3-butanediol from the corresponding low-cost racemate with minimal substrate waste, we designed a stereoinverting cascade deracemization route and constructed the cascade reaction for the total conversion of racemic 1,3-butanediol into its (R)-enantiomer. This cascade reaction consisted of the absolutely enantioselective oxidation of (S)-1,3-butanediol by Candida parapsilosis QC-76 and the subsequent asymmetric reduction of the intermediate 4-hydroxy-2-butanone to (R)-1,3-butanediol by Pichia kudriavzevii QC-1.                  Results:                       The key reaction conditions including choice of cosubstrate, pH, temperature, and rotation speed were optimized systematically and determined as follows: adding acetone as the cosubstrate at pH 8.0, a temperature of 30 °C, and rotation speed of 250 rpm for the first oxidation process; in the next reduction process, the optimal conditions were: adding glucose as the cosubstrate at pH 8.0, a temperature of 35 °C, and rotation speed of 200 rpm. By investigating the feasibility of the step-by-step method with one-pot experiment as a natural extension for performing the oxidation-reduction cascade, the step-by-step approach exhibited high efficiency for this cascade process from racemate to (R)-1,3-butanediol. Under optimal conditions, 20 g/L of the racemate transformed into 16.67 g/L of (R)-1,3-butanediol with 99.5% enantiomeric excess by the oxidation-reduction cascade system in a 200-mL bioreactor.                  Conclusions:                       The step-by-step cascade reaction efficiently produced (R)-1,3-butanediol from the racemate by biosynthesis and shows promising application prospects.	0
Abstract2class: A novel DNA modification by sulphur Abstract: Streptomyces lividans has a novel DNA modification, which sensitises its DNA to degradation during electrophoresis (the Dnd phenotype). The entire gene cluster (dnd) involved in this modification was localized on an 8 kb DNA fragment and was expressed in a S. lividans deletion mutant (dnd) and in several heterologous hosts. Disruption of the dnd locus abolishes the Dnd phenotype, and gain of the dnd locus conferred the Dnd phenotype respectively. Extensive analysis of the dnd gene cluster revealed five open reading frames, whose hypothetic functions suggested an incorporation of sulphur or a sulphur-containing substance into S. lividans genome, yet in an unknown manner. The Dnd phenotype was also discovered to exist in DNA of widespread bacterial species of variable origin and diverse habitat. Similarly organized gene clusters were found in several bacterial genomes representing different genera and in eDNA of marine organisms, suggesting such modification as a widespread phenomenon. A coincidence between the Dnd phenotype and DNA modification by sulphur was demonstrated to occur in several representative bacterial genomes by the in vivo(35)S-labelling experiments.	0
Abstract2class: A yeast chemical genetic screen identifies inhibitors of human telomerase Abstract: Telomerase comprises a reverse transcriptase and an internal RNA template that maintains telomeres in many eukaryotes, and it is a well-validated cancer target. However, there is a dearth of small molecules with efficacy against human telomerase in vivo. We developed a surrogate yeast high-throughput assay to identify human telomerase inhibitors. The reversibility of growth arrest induced by active human telomerase was assessed against a library of 678 compounds preselected for bioactivity in S. cerevisiae. Four of eight compounds identified reproducibly restored growth to strains expressing active human telomerase, and three of these four compounds also specifically inhibited purified human telomerase in vitro. These compounds represent probes for human telomerase function, and potential entry points for development of lead compounds against telomerase-positive cancers.	0
Abstract2class: Leveraging kinase inhibitors to develop small molecule tools for imaging kinases by fluorescence microscopy Abstract: As the usage of fluorescence microscopy as a tool to study biological systems continues to grow, so does the need for additional tools that permit the selective detection of proteins of interest.

Abstract2class: Isolation, Biosynthesis and Chemical Modifications of Rubterolones A-F: Rare Tropolone Alkaloids from Actinomadura sp. 5-2 Abstract: The discovery of six new, highly substituted tropolone alkaloids, rubterolones A-F, from Actinomadura sp. 5-2, isolated from the gut of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes natalensis is reported. Rubterolones were identified by using fungus-bacteria challenge assays and a HRMS-based dereplication strategy, and characterised by NMR and HRMS analyses and by X-ray crystallography. Feeding experiments and subsequent chemical derivatisation led to a first library of rubterolone derivatives (A-L). Genome sequencing and comparative analyses revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway, which was supported by feeding experiments. This study highlights how gut microbes can present a prolific source of secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into Protein Stability in Cell Lysate by 19 F NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400 g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study, and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies neglect the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in the thermodynamic stability of BsCspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters are quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that targeted application of 19 F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool for protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.	0
Abstract2class: Specific small molecule inhibitors of Skp2-mediated p27 degradation Abstract: In the ubiquitin proteasome system, the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2 and its accessory protein, Cks1, promote proliferation largely by inducing the degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27. Overexpression of Skp2 in human cancers correlates with poor prognosis, and deregulation of SCF-Skp2-Cks1 promotes tumorigenesis in animal models. We identified small molecule inhibitors specific to SCF-Skp2 activity using in silico screens targeted to the binding interface for p27. These compounds selectively inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 degradation by reducing p27 binding through key compound-receptor contacts. In cancer cells, the compounds induced p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promoted cell-type-specific blocks in the G1 or G2/M phases. Designing SCF-Skp2-specific inhibitors may be a novel strategy to treat cancers dependent on the Skp2-p27 axis.	0
Abstract2class: Six new genes required for production of T-toxin, a polyketide determinant of high virulence of Cochliobolus heterostrophus to maize Abstract: Southern Corn Leaf Blight, one of the worst plant disease epidemics in modern history, was caused by Cochliobolus heterostrophus race T, which produces T-toxin, a determinant of high virulence to maize carrying Texas male sterile cytoplasm. The genetics of T-toxin production is complex and the evolutionary origin of associated genes is uncertain. It is known that ability to produce T-toxin requires three genes encoded at two unlinked loci, Tox1A and Tox1B, which map to the breakpoints of a reciprocal translocation. DNA associated with Tox1A and Tox1B sums to about 1.2 Mb of A+T rich, repeated DNA that is not found in less virulent race O or other Cochliobolus species. Here, we describe identification and targeted deletion of six additional genes, three mapping to Tox1A and three to Tox1B. Mutant screens indicate that all six genes are involved in T-toxin production and high virulence to maize. The nine known Tox1 genes encode two polyketide synthases (PKS), one decarboxylase, five dehydrogenases, and one unknown protein. Only two have a similar phylogenetic profile. To trace evolutionary history of one of the core PKS, DNA from more than 100 Dothideomycete species were screened for homologs. An ortholog (60% identity) was confirmed in Didymella zeae-maydis, which produces PM-toxin, a polyketide of similar structure and biological specificity as T-toxin. Only one additional Dothideomycete species, the dung ascomycete Delitschia winteri harbored a paralog. The unresolved evolutionary history and distinctive gene signature of the PKS (fast-evolving, discontinuous taxonomic distribution) leaves open the question of lateral or vertical transmission.	1
Abstract2class: M2@C79N (M = Y, Tb): isolation and characterization of stable endohedral metallofullerenes exhibiting M-M bonding interactions inside aza[80]fullerene cages Abstract: Y2@C79N and Tb2@C79N have been prepared by conducting the Kratschmer-Huffman electric-arc process under 20 Torr of N2 and 280 Torr of He with metal oxide-doped graphite rods. These new heterofullerenes were separated from the resulting mixture of empty cage fullerenes and endohedral fullerenes by chemical separation and a two-stage chromatographic process. Crystallographic data for Tb2@C79N x Ni(OEP) x 2 C6H6 demonstrate the presence of an 80-atom cage with idealized I(h) symmetry and two, widely separated Tb atoms inside with a Tb-Tb separation of 3.9020(10) A for the major terbium sites. The EPR spectrum of the odd-electron Y2@C79N indicates that the spin density largely resides on the two equivalent yttrium ions. Computational studies on Y2@C79N suggest that the nitrogen atom resides at a 665 ring junction in the equator on the fullerene cage and that the unpaired electron is localized in a bonding orbital between the two yttrium ions of this stable radical. Thus, the Tb-Tb bond length of the single-electron bond is an exceedingly long metal-metal bond.	0
Abstract2class: Genomic mining for Aspergillus natural products Abstract: The genus Aspergillus is renowned for its ability to produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although the propensity of biosynthetic genes to form contiguous clusters greatly facilitates assignment of putative secondary metabolite genes in the completed Aspergillus genomes, such analysis cannot predict gene expression and, ultimately, product formation. To circumvent this deficiency, we have examined Aspergillus nidulans microarrays for expressed secondary metabolite gene clusters by using the transcriptional regulator LaeA. Deletion or overexpression of laeA clearly identified numerous secondary metabolite clusters. A gene deletion in one of the clusters eliminated the production of the antitumor compound terrequinone A, a metabolite not described, from A. nidulans. In this paper, we highlight that LaeA-based genome mining helps decipher the secondary metabolome of Aspergilli and provides an unparalleled view to assess secondary metabolism gene regulation.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene cluster of polyether antibiotic lasalocid from Streptomyces lasaliensis Abstract: Elucidation of enzymatic polyether formation is a long-standing controversial issue in organic chemistry. To address this intriguing issue, identifying the actual substrate for epoxidation and sequential cyclization is essential. We selected the representative polyether ionophore, lasalocid, which has been proposed to undergo no modification at the late stage of biosynthesis. Cloning and a sequence analysis revealed seven polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, epoxidase and epoxide hydrolase genes for sequential ether formation, and several putative genes for supplying ethylmalonyl-CoA. Based on bioinformatic data, we propose the lasalocid biosynthetic pathway which involves characteristic aromatic ring formation and sequential cyclic ether formation. The finding of a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the seventh PKS indicates that intriguing oxidative cascade cyclization would occur after cleavage of the polyketide intermediate from PKS. Based on this observation, we have recently reported the enzymatic transformation of a bisepoxide intermediate to lasalocid with the recombinant epoxide hydrolase, Lsd19.	1
Abstract2class: Function-related replacement of bacterial siderophore pathways Abstract: Bacterial genomes are rife with orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) associated with secondary metabolism of unrealized natural product molecules. Often up to a tenth of the genome is predicted to code for the biosynthesis of diverse metabolites with mostly unknown structures and functions. This phenomenal diversity of BGCs coupled with their high rates of horizontal transfer raise questions about whether they are really active and beneficial, whether they are neutral and confer no advantage, or whether they are carried in genomes because they are parasitic or addictive. We previously reported that Salinispora bacteria broadly use the desferrioxamine family of siderophores for iron acquisition. Herein we describe a new and unrelated group of peptidic siderophores called salinichelins from a restricted number of Salinispora strains in which the desferrioxamine biosynthesis genes have been lost. We have reconstructed the evolutionary history of these two different siderophore families and show that the acquisition and retention of the new salinichelin siderophores co-occurs with the loss of the more ancient desferrioxamine pathway. This identical event occurred at least three times independently during the evolution of the genus. We surmise that certain BGCs may be extraneous because of their functional redundancy and demonstrate that the relative evolutionary pace of natural pathway replacement shows high selective pressure against retention of functionally superfluous gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: Evaluation of metabolism of azo dyes and their effects on Staphylococcus aureus metabolome Abstract: Dyes containing one or more azo linkages are widely applied in cosmetics, tattooing, food and drinks, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, plastics, leather, as well as paper industries. Previously we reported that bacteria living on human skin have the ability to reduce some azo dyes to aromatic amines, which raises potential safety concerns regarding human dermal exposure to azo dyes such as those in tattoo ink and cosmetic colorant formulations. To comprehensively investigate azo dye-induced toxicity by skin bacteria activation, it is very critical to understand the mechanism of metabolism of the azo dyes at the systems biology level. In this study, an LC/MS-based metabolomics approach was employed to globally investigate metabolism of azo dyes by Staphylococcus aureus as well as their effects on the metabolome of the bacterium. Growth of S. aureus in the presence of Sudan III or Orange II was not affected during the incubation period. Metabolomics results showed that Sudan III was metabolized to 4-(phenyldiazenyl) aniline (48%), 1-[(4-aminophenyl) diazenyl]-2-naphthol (4%) and eicosenoic acid Sudan III (0.9%). These findings indicated that the azo bond close to naphthalene group of Sudan III was preferentially cleaved compared with the other azo bond. The metabolite from Orange II was identified as 4-aminobenzene sulfonic acid (35%). A much higher amount of Orange II (~90×) was detected in the cell pellets from the active viable cells compared with those from boiled cells incubated with the same concentration of Orange II. This finding suggests that Orange II was primarily transported into the S. aureus cells for metabolism, instead of the theory that the azo dye metabolism occurs extracellularly. In addition, the metabolomics results showed that Sudan III affected energy pathways of the S. aureus cells, while Orange II had less noticeable effects on the cells. In summary, this study provided novel information regarding azo dye metabolism by the skin bacterium, the effects of azo dyes on the bacterial cells and the important role on the toxicity and/or inactivation of these compounds due to microbial metabolism.	0
Abstract2class: Real-time imaging of Rab5 activity using a prequenched biosensor Abstract: A key regulator of receptor-mediated endocytosis, Rab5, plays a pivotal role in cargo receptor internalization, endosomal maturation, and transduction and degradation of internalized signaling molecules and recycling cargo receptor. Stressful conditions within cells lead to increased Rab5 activation, and increasing evidence correlates Rab5 activity abnormalities with certain diseases. Current antibody-based imaging methods cannot distinguish active Rab5 from total Rab5 population and provide dynamic information on magnitude and duration of Rab5 activation in cellular events and pathogenesis. We report here novel molecular imaging probes that specifically target GTP-bound Rab5 associated with the early endosome membrane in live cells and fixed mouse brain tissues. Our Rab5 activity fluorescent biosensor (RAFB) contains the Rab5 binding domain of the Rab5 effector Rabaptin 5, a fluorophore (a quantum dot or fluorescent dye) and a cell-penetrating peptide for live-cell delivery. The quantum dot conjugated RAFB was able to image the elevated Rab5 activity in both the cortex and hippocampi tissues of a Ts65Dn mouse. A prequenched RAFB based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can image cytosolic active Rab5 in single live cells. This novel method should enable imaging of the biological process in which Rab5 activity is regulated in various cellular systems.	0
Abstract2class: Bacillus anthracis requires siderophore biosynthesis for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence Abstract: Systemic anthrax infections can be characterized as proceeding in stages, beginning with an early intracellular establishment stage within phagocytes that is followed by extracelluar stages involving massive bacteraemia, sepsis and death. Because most bacteria require iron, and the host limits iron availability through homeostatic mechanisms, we hypothesized that B. anthracis requires a high-affinity mechanism of iron acquisition during its growth stages. Two putative types of siderophore synthesis operons, named Bacillus anthracis catechol, bac (anthrabactin), and anthrax siderophore biosynthesis, asb (anthrachelin), were identified. Directed gene deletions in both anthrabactin and anthrachelin pathways were generated in a B. anthracis (Sterne) 34F2 background resulting in mutations in asbA and bacCEBF. A decrease in siderophore production was observed during iron-depleted growth in both the DeltaasbA and DeltabacCEBF strains, but only the DeltaasbA strain was attenuated for growth under these conditions. In addition, the DeltaasbA strain was severely attenuated both for growth in macrophages (MPhi) and for virulence in mice. In contrast, the DeltabacCEBF strain did not differ phenotypically from the parental strain. These findings support a requirement for anthrachelin but not anthrabactin in iron assimilation during the intracellular stage of anthrax.	1
Abstract2class: Non-Deprotonative Primary and Secondary Amination of (Hetero)Arylmetals Abstract: Herein we disclose a novel method for the facile transfer of primary (-NH2) and secondary amino groups (-NHR) to heteroaryl- as well as arylcuprates at low temperature without the need for precious metal catalysts, ligands, excess reagents, protecting and/or directing groups. This one-pot transformation allows unprecedented functional group tolerance and it is well-suited for the amination of electron-rich, electron-deficient as well as structurally complex (hetero)arylmetals. In some of the cases, only catalytic amounts of a copper(I) salt is required.	0
Abstract2class: Chaetoglobosins and azaphilones from Chaetomium globosum associated with Apostichopus japonicus Abstract: Increasing attention has recently been focused on complex symbiotic associations, for instance coral and its symbionts. Sea cucumber, harboring diverse fungi, has also attracted more and more attention for their functional diversity. Here, secondary metabolites produced by Chaetomium globosum associated with sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, were investigated using gene mining with third-generation sequencing technology (PacBio SMRT). Nine compounds, including one new compound cytoglobosin X (1), were isolated from cultures of Chaetomium globosum. Compound 1 was identified based on NMR data, HRESIMS, and ECD, and the absolute configurations were identified as 3S, 4R, 7S, 8R, 9R, 16S, 19S, 20S, and 23S. In an antimicrobial assay, compound 4 showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with MICs of 47.3 and 94.6 μM, respectively. Our results suggest that the microbiomes associated with sea cucumber could be an important resource for biodiversity and structural novelty, and the bioactive compounds may protect the host from pathogen microbial.	1

Abstract2class: Oxidation-induced conformational changes in calcineurin determined by covalent labeling and tandem mass spectrometry Abstract: The Ca(2+)/calmodulin activated phosphatase, calcineurin, is inactivated by H2O2 or superoxide-induced oxidation, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the potential for global and/or local conformation changes occurring within calcineurin as a function of oxidative modification, that may play a role in the inactivation process, has not been examined. Here, the susceptibility of calcineurin methionine residues toward H2O2-induced oxidation were determined using a multienzyme digestion strategy coupled with capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Then, regions within the protein complex that underwent significant conformational perturbation upon oxidative modification were identified by monitoring changes in the modification rates of accessible lysine residues between native and oxidized forms of calcineurin, using an amine-specific covalent labeling reagent, S,S'-dimethylthiobutanoylhydroxysuccinimide ester (DMBNHS), and tandem mass spectrometry. Importantly, methionine residues found to be highly susceptible toward oxidation, and the lysine residues exhibiting large increases in accessibility upon oxidation, were all located in calcineurin functional domains involved in Ca(2+)/CaM binding regulated calcineurin stimulation. These findings therefore provide initial support for the novel mechanistic hypothesis that oxidation-induced global and/or local conformational changes within calcineurin contribute to inactivation via (i) impairing the interaction between calcineurin A and calcineurin B, (ii) altering the low-affinity Ca(2+) binding site in calcineurin B, (iii) inhibiting calmodulin binding to calcineurin A, and/or (iv) by altering the affinity between the calcineurin A autoinhibitory domain and the catalytic center.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of polyketide synthase genes for jadomycin B biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 Abstract: Hybridizing fragments in the genomic DNA of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230, which produces the jadomycin group of angucycline antibiotics, were detected by probing with actI DNA from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The hybridizing regions were isolated from a 16.5 kb insert of S. venezuelae DNA recovered from a genomic library cloned in a lambda replacement vector. Subcloning and sequencing of a 4.8 kb segment of the insert, containing regions hybridizing to actIII as well as actI, identified five open reading frames (ORFs). The deduced polypeptide products of the ORFs closely resemble in sequence the components of streptomycete type-II polyketide synthases (PKSs): the ORF1 product corresponds to the ketoacyl synthase, and the ORF2 product to a polypeptide closely related to the ketoacyl synthase and involved in determining chain length; the ORF3 product matches the acyl carrier protein; ORF4 encodes a bifunctional cyclase/dehydrase; and ORF5 encodes a ketoreductase. Integration into the chromosomal DNA of a plasmid containing a segment of the ORF2-ORF4 region severely depressed jadomycin B biosynthesis; since the integrant showed no change in growth or spore pigmentation, the cloned PKS genes are presumed to encode enzymes in the pathway for jadomycin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Australia antigen as a marker of propagation of the serum hepatitis virus in liver cultures Abstract: ATTEMPTS to isolate the human hepatitis viruses in tissue culture have resulted in a collection of “hepatitis-candidate” viruses, none of which has since been shown to be the causal agent of human hepatitis1.

Abstract2class: Functional expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene (thpD) from Streptomyces chrysomallus in Halomonas elongata Abstract: The formation of hydroxyectoine in the industrial ectoine producer Halomonas elongata was improved by the heterologous expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene, thpD, from Streptomyces chrysomallus. The efficient conversion of ectoine to hydroxyectoine was achieved by the concerted regulation of thpD by the H. elongata ectA promoter.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic origin of the antibiotic cyclocarbamate brabantamide A (SB-253514) in plant-associated Pseudomonas Abstract: Within the framework of our genome-based program to discover new antibiotic lipopeptides from Pseudomonads, brabantamides A-C were isolated from plant-associated Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52. Brabantamides A-C displayed moderate to high in vitro activities against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Their shared structure is unique in that they contain a 5,5-bicyclic carbamate scaffold. Here, the biosynthesis of brabantamide A (SB-253514) was studied by a combination of bioinformatics, feeding experiments with isotopically labelled precursors and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes encoded in the biosynthetic pathway. The studies resulted in the deduction of all biosynthetic building blocks of brabantamide A and revealed an unusual feature of this metabolite: its biosynthesis occurs via an initially formed linear di-lipopeptide that is subsequently rearranged by a novel FAD-dependent Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase.	1
Abstract2class: Habituation based synaptic plasticity and organismic learning in a quantum perovskite Abstract: A central characteristic of living beings is the ability to learn from and respond to their environment leading to habit formation and decision making. This behavior, known as habituation, is universal among all forms of life with a central nervous system, and is also observed in single-cell organisms that do not possess a brain. Here, we report the discovery of habituation-based plasticity utilizing a perovskite quantum system by dynamical modulation of electron localization. Microscopic mechanisms and pathways that enable this organismic collective charge-lattice interaction are elucidated by first-principles theory, synchrotron investigations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ environmental breathing studies. We implement a learning algorithm inspired by the conductance relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally incorporates habituation, and demonstrate learning to forget: a key feature of animal and human brains. Incorporating this elementary skill in learning boosts the capability of neural computing in a sequential, dynamic environment.Habituation is a learning mechanism that enables control over forgetting and learning. Zuo, Panda et al., demonstrate adaptive synaptic plasticity in SmNiO3 perovskites to address catastrophic forgetting in a dynamic learning environment via hydrogen-induced electron localization.	0
Abstract2class: Production of High Amounts of Hepatotoxin Nodularin and New Protease Inhibitors Pseudospumigins by the Brazilian Benthic Nostoc sp. CENA543 Abstract: Nostoc is a cyanobacterial genus, common in soils and a prolific producer of natural products. This research project aimed to explore and characterize Brazilian cyanobacteria for new bioactive compounds. Here we report the production of hepatotoxins and new protease inhibitors from benthic Nostoc sp. CENA543 isolated from a small, shallow, saline-alkaline lake in the Nhecolândia, Pantanal wetland area in Brazil. Nostoc sp. CENA543 produces exceptionally high amounts of nodularin-R. This is the first free-living Nostoc that produces nodularin at comparable levels as the toxic, bloom-forming, Nodularia spumigena. We also characterized pseudospumigins A-F, which are a novel family of linear tetrapeptides. Pseudospumigins are structurally related to linear tetrapeptide spumigins and aeruginosins both present in N. spumigena but differ in respect to their diagnostic amino acid, which is Ile/Leu/Val in pseudospumigins, Pro/mPro in spumigins, and Choi in aeruginosins. The pseudospumigin gene cluster is more similar to the spumigin biosynthetic gene cluster than the aeruginosin gene cluster. Pseudospumigin A inhibited trypsin (IC50 4.5 μM after 1 h) in a similar manner as spumigin E from N. spumigena but was almost two orders of magnitude less potent. This study identifies another location and environment where the hepatotoxic nodularin has the potential to cause the death of eukaryotic organisms.	1
Abstract2class: Fluorescence imaging of single-copy DNA sequences within the human genome using PNA-directed padlock probe assembly Abstract: We present an approach for fluorescent in situ detection of short, single-copy sequences within genomic DNA in human cells. The single-copy sensitivity and single-base specificity of our method is achieved due to the combination of three components. First, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe locally opens a chosen target site, which allows a padlock DNA probe to access the site and become ligated. Second, rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates thousands of single-stranded copies of the target sequence. Finally, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to visualize the amplified DNA. We validate this technique by successfully detecting six single-copy target sites on human mitochondrial and autosomal DNA. We also demonstrate the high selectivity of this method by detecting X- and Y-specific sequences on human sex chromosomes and by simultaneously detecting three sequence-specific target sites. Finally, we discriminate two target sites that differ by 2 nt. The PNA-RCA-FISH approach is a distinctive in situ hybridization method capable of multitarget visualization within human chromosomes and nuclei that does not require DNA denaturation and is extremely sequence specific.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation, characterization, and quantitative analysis of Microviridin J, a new Microcystis metabolite toxic to Daphnia Abstract: This paper describes the purification and characterization of microviridin J. a newly discovered metabolite of Microcystis that causes a lethal molting disruption in Daphnia spp., upon ingestion of living cyanobacterial cells. Microviridin J consists of an acetylated chain of 13 amino acids arranged in three rings and two side chains. Unlike other known isoforms of microviridin, microviridin J contains arginine that imparts a unique solution conformation characterized by proximal hydrophobic interactions between Arg and other regions of the molecule. This eventually results in the formation and stabilization of an additional ring system. Microviridin J potently inhibits porcine trypsin, bovine chymotrypsin, and daphnid trypsin-like proteases. The activity against trypsin is most likely due to Arg and its distinctive conformational interactions. Overall, the data presented for microviridin J emphasize once again the ability of cyanobacteria to produce numerous and potent environmental toxins.	1
Abstract2class: Revised Structure of Anthelvencin A and Characterization of the Anthelvencin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Anthelvencins A and B are pyrrolamide metabolites produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 14583 and 14585. Isolated in 1965, they were reported to exhibit anthelmintic and moderate antibacterial activities. In this study, we revise the structure of anthelvencin A and identify a third anthelvencin metabolite, bearing two N-methylated pyrrole groups, which we named anthelvencin C. We sequenced the genome of S. venezuelae ATCC 14583 and identified a gene cluster predicted to direct the biosynthesis of anthelvencins. Functional analysis of this gene cluster confirmed its involvement in anthelvencin biosynthesis and allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for anthelvencins. In addition to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), the assembly of anthelvencins involves an enzyme from the ATP-grasp ligase family, Ant23. We propose that Ant23 uses a PCP-loaded 4-aminopyrrole-2-carboxylate as substrate. As observed for the biosynthesis of the other pyrrolamides congocidine (produced by Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 25877) and distamycin (produced by Streptomyces netropsis DSM 40846), the NRPS assembling anthelvencins is composed of stand-alone domains only. Such NRPSs, sometimes called type II NRPSs, are less studied than the classical multimodular NRPSs. Yet, they constitute an interesting model to study protein-protein interactions in NRPSs and are good candidates for combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.	1
Abstract2class: A Single Stereodynamic Center Modulates the Rate of Self-Assembly in a Biomolecular System Abstract: Chirality is a property of asymmetry important to both physical and abstract systems. Understanding how molecular systems respond to perturbations in their chiral building blocks can provide insight into diverse areas such as biomolecular self-assembly, protein folding, drug design, materials, and catalysis. Despite the fundamental importance of stereochemical preorganization in nature and designed materials, the ramifications of replacing chiral centers with stereodynamic atomic mimics in the context of biomolecular systems is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that replacement of a single amino acid stereocenter with a stereodynamic nitrogen atom has profound consequences on the self-assembly of a biomolecular system. Our results provide insight into how the fundamental biopolymers of life would behave if their chiral centers were not configurationally stable, highlighting the vital importance of stereochemistry as a pre-organizing element in biomolecular folding and assembly events.	0
Abstract2class: New Aspercryptins, Lipopeptide Natural Products, Revealed by HDAC Inhibition in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Unlocking the biochemical stores of fungi is key for developing future pharmaceuticals. Through reduced expression of a critical histone deacetylase in Aspergillus nidulans, increases of up to 100-fold were observed in the levels of 15 new aspercryptins, recently described lipopeptides with two noncanonical amino acids derived from octanoic and dodecanoic acids. In addition to two NMR-verified structures, MS/MS networking helped uncover an additional 13 aspercryptins. The aspercryptins break the conventional structural orientation of lipopeptides and appear "backward" when compared to known compounds of this class. We have also confirmed the 14-gene aspercryptin biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes two fatty acid synthases and several enzymes to convert saturated octanoic and dodecanoic acid to α-amino acids.	1
Abstract2class: PDZ-Reactive Peptide Activates Ephrin-B Reverse Signaling and Inhibits Neuronal Chemotaxis Abstract: Intracellular reactions on nonenzymatic proteins that activate cellular signals are rarely found. We report one example here that a designed peptide derivative undergoes a nucleophilic reaction specifically with a cytosolic PDZ protein inside cells. This reaction led to the activation of ephrin-B reverse signaling, which subsequently inhibited SDF-1 induced neuronal chemotaxis of human neuroblastoma cells and mouse cerebellar granule neurons. Our work provides direct evidence that PDZ-RGS3 bridges ephrin-B reverse signaling and SDF-1 induced G protein signaling for the first time.	0
Abstract2class: Class IV Lasso Peptides Synergistically Induce Proliferation of Cancer Cells and Sensitize Them to Doxorubicin Abstract: Heterologous expression of a biosynthesis gene cluster from Amycolatopsis sp. resulted in the discovery of two unique class IV lasso peptides, felipeptins A1 and A2. A mixture of felipeptins stimulated proliferation of cancer cells, while having no such effect on the normal cells. Detailed investigation revealed, that pre-treatment of cancer cells with a mixture of felipeptins resulted in downregulation of the tumor suppressor Rb, making the cancer cells to proliferate faster. Pre-treatment with felipeptins made cancer cells considerably more sensitive to the anticancer agent doxorubicin and re-sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to this drug. Structural characterization and binding experiments showed an interaction between felipeptins resulting in complex formation, which explains their synergistic effect. This discovery may open an alternative avenue in cancer treatment, helping to eliminate quiescent cells that often lead to cancer relapse.	1
Abstract2class: Irregular transcriptome reprogramming probably causes thec developmental failure of embryos produced by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer between the Przewalski's gazelle and the bovine Abstract: Background:                       Interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) has been regarded as a potential alternative for rescuing highly endangered species and can be used as a model for studying nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. However, iSCNT embryos often fail to produce viable offspring. The alterations in normal molecular mechanisms contributing to extremely poor development are for the most part unknown.                  Results:                       Przewalski's gazelle-bovine iSCNT embryos (PBNT) were produced by transferring Przewalski's gazelle fibroblast nuclei into enucleated bovine oocytes. The percentages of PBNT embryos that developed to morula/blastocyst stages were extremely low even with the use of various treatments that included different SCNT protocols and treatment of embryos with small molecules. Transcriptional microarray analyses of the cloned embryos showed that the upregulation of reprogramming-associated genes in bovine-bovine SCNT (BBNT) embryos was significantly higher than those observed in PBNT embryos (1527:643). In all, 139 transcripts related to various transcription regulation factors (TFs) were unsuccessfully activated in the iSCNT embryos. Maternal degradation profiles showed that 1515 genes were uniquely downregulated in the BBNT embryos, while 343 genes were downregulated in the PBNT embryos. Incompatibilities between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA revealed that the TOMM (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane)/TIMM (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane) complex-associated genes in BBNT embryos had the highest expression levels, while the PBNT embryos exhibited much lower expression rates.                  Conclusions:                       Improper degradation of maternal transcripts, incomplete activation of TFs and abnormal expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function in PBNT embryos likely contributed to incomplete reprogramming of the donor cell nuclei and therefore led to the developmental failure of these cloned embryos.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and biochemical characterization of a novel lantibiotic mutacin from Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Certain members of the indigenous biota of humans produce antimicrobial substances called bacteriocins, which inhibit other bacteria, including members of their own species. One of these substances, mutacin, is made by Streptococcus mutans, a member of the oral biota. Mutacin inhibits other mutans streptococci as well as many gram-positive exogenous pathogens. Here, we report for the first time the purification and partial biochemical characterization of a lanthionine-containing mutacin peptide from S. mutants T8. The biologically active peptide was isolated from the broth cultures by ultrafiltration and differential precipitation. The final mutacin preparation was homogeneous as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A molecular mass of the peptide was estimated by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy to be 3,244.64 +/- 1.15 Da. Its amino acid composition indicates the presence of lanthionine and likely beta-methyllanthionine in a total of about 25 amino acids. Because alpha,beta-unsaturated amino acids, the precursors of lanthionine residues, are often found in lantibiotics, we carried out the addition reaction of the mutacin with N-(methyl)mercaptoacetamide. The subsequent electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of two reaction products with M(r)s of 3,350.45 and 3,456.0. These are interpreted as the mutacin molecule with the addition of one and two molecules of reagent to the unsaturated amino acids, respectively. Sequencing of the peptide revealed an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Asn-Arg-Trp-Trp-Gln-Gly-Val-Val.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis, characterization, and studies on DNA binding of the complex Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H(2)O) Abstract: A new metal complex, Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H2O) (where Sal is salicylaldehyde and dien is diethylenetriamine), has been synthesized and characterized. The interactions between the Fe(III) complex and calf thymus DNA has been investigated using UV and fluorescence spectra, viscosity, thermal denaturation, and molecular modeling. The cleavage reaction on plasmid DNA has been monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. The experimental results show that the mode of binding of the complex to DNA is classical intercalation and the complex can cleave pBR322 DNA.	0
Abstract2class: Total Synthesis of Bioactive Marine Meroterpenoids: The Cases of Liphagal and Frondosin B Abstract: Liphagal and frondosin B are two marine-derived secondary metabolites sharing a very similar polyfused-benzofuran skeleton. The two tetracyclic meroterpenoids were isolated from marine sponges, both featuring a 6-5-7-6 fused ring system. A preliminary bioactive study shows that (+)-liphagal is a selective kinase (PI3K α) inhibitor, while (+)-frondosin B is shown to inhibit the binding of the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) to its receptor, CX-CLR1/2. The unique structures and interesting biological profiles of these two meroterpenoids have attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists. Herein we summarize the synthetic efforts with respect to (+)-liphagal and (+)-frondosin B during the past two decades.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of the capsule biosynthetic locus of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 and proposal of a nomenclature system Abstract: A 16-kbp DNA region that contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of the capsule of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 has been characterized. The gene cluster can be divided into three regions like those of the typical group II capsule biosynthetic clusters in gram-negative bacteria. Region 1 contains four genes (wzt, wzm, wzf, and wza) which code for an ATP-binding cassette transport apparatus for the secretion of the capsule materials across the membranes. The M. haemolytica A1 wzt and wzm genes were able to complement Escherichia coli kpsT and kpsM mutants, respectively. Further, the ATP binding activity of Wzt was demonstrated by its affinity for ATP-agarose, and the lipoprotein nature of Wza was supported by [(3)H]palmitate labeling. Region 2 contains six genes; four genes (orf1/2/3/4) code for unique functions for which no homologues have been identified to date. The remaining two genes (nmaA and nmaB) code for homologues of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase and UDP-N-acetylmannosamine dehydrogenase, respectively. These two proteins are highly homologous to the E. coli WecB and WecC proteins (formerly known as RffE and RffD), which are involved in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). Complementation of an E. coli rffE/D mutant with the M. haemolytica A1 nmaA/B genes resulted in the restoration of ECA biosynthesis. Region 3 contains two genes (wbrA and wbrB) which are suggested to be involved in the phospholipid modification of capsular materials.	1
Abstract2class: Efficient Room-Temperature Activation of Methane by TaN(+) under C-N Coupling Abstract: The thermal reaction of diatomic tantalum nitride cation [TaN](+) with methane has been explored using FT-ICR mass spectrometry complemented by high-level quantum chemical calculation; based on this combined experimental/computational approach, mechanistic aspects of this novel, highly efficient C-N coupling process have been uncovered. In distinct contrast to [TaN](+) , its lighter congeners [VN](+) and [NbN](+) are inert towards methane under ambient conditions, and the origins of the remarkably variable efficiencies of the three metal nitrides are uncovered by CCSD(T) calculations.	0
Abstract2class: Heparan Sulfate Microarray Reveals That Heparan Sulfate-Protein Binding Exhibits Different Ligand Requirements Abstract: Heparan sulfates (HS) are linear sulfated polysaccharides that modulate a wide range of physiological and disease-processes. Variations in HS epimerization and sulfation provide enormous structural diversity, which is believed to underpin protein binding and regulatory properties. The ligand requirements of HS-binding proteins have, however, been defined in only a few cases. We describe here a synthetic methodology that can rapidly provide a library of well-defined HS oligosaccharides. It is based on the use of modular disaccharides to assemble several selectively protected tetrasaccharides that were subjected to selective chemical modifications such as regioselective O- and N-sulfation and selective de-sulfation. A number of the resulting compounds were subjected to enzymatic modifications by 3-O-sulfotransferases-1 (3-OST1) to provide 3-O-sulfated derivatives. The various approaches for diversification allowed one tetrasaccharide to be converted into 12 differently sulfated derivatives. By employing tetrasaccharides with different backbone compositions, a library of 47 HS-oligosaccharides was prepared and the resulting compounds were used to construct a HS microarray. The ligand requirements of a number of HS-binding proteins including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and the chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL13, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were examined using the array. Although all proteins recognized multiple compounds, they exhibited clear differences in structure-binding characteristics. The HS microarray data guided the selection of compounds that could interfere in biological processes such as cell proliferation. Although the library does not cover the entire chemical space of HS-tetrasaccharides, the binding data support a notion that changes in cell surface HS composition can modulate protein function.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery and Characterization of New Hydroxamate Siderophores, Baumannoferrin A and B, produced by Acinetobacter baumannii Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii AYE does not produce acinetobactin but grows under iron limitation. Accordingly, analyses of AYE iron-restricted culture supernatants resulted in the isolation of two fractions, which contained only hydroxamates and showed siderophore activity. Structural analyses identified baumannoferrin A and baumannoferrin B, which differ only by a double bond. These siderophores are composed of citrate, 1,3-diaminopropane, 2,4-diaminobutyrate, decenoic acid, and α-ketoglutarate. Analysis of the AYE genome showed the presence of a 12-gene cluster coding for proteins similar to those involved in the production and utilization of the hydroxamate siderophores acinetoferrin and achromobactin. As A. baumannii AYE does not produce acinetobactin and harbors only one gene cluster encoding the production and utilization of a siderophore, this strain's growth under iron limitation depends on baumannoferrin, a novel hydroxamate that could play a role in its virulence.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of a welwitindolinone alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster in the stigonematalean Cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwitschii Abstract: The identification of a 36 kb welwitindolinone (wel) biosynthetic gene cluster in Hapalosiphon welwitschii UTEX B1830 is reported. Characterization of the enzymes responsible for assembling the early biosynthetic intermediates geranyl pyrophosphate and 3-((Z)-2′-isocyanoethenyl)indole as well as a dedicated N-methyltransferase in the maturation of N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate solidified the link between the wel pathway and welwitindolinone biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of the ambiguine and welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathways in two different organisms provided insights into the origins of diverse structures within hapalindole-type molecules.	1
Abstract2class: Two different lantibiotic-like peptides originate from the ericin gene cluster of Bacillus subtilis A1/3 Abstract: A lantibiotic gene cluster was identified in Bacillus subtilis A1/3 showing a high degree of homology to the subtilin gene cluster and occupying the same genetic locus as the spa genes in B. subtilis ATCC 6633. The gene cluster exhibits diversity with respect to duplication of two subtilin-like genes which are separated by a sequence similar to a portion of a lanC gene. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses of B. subtilis A1/3 culture extracts confirmed the presence of two lantibiotic-like peptides, ericin S (3,442 Da) and ericin A (2,986 Da). Disruption of the lanB-homologous gene eriB resulted in loss of production of both peptides, demonstrating that they are processed in an eriB-dependent manner. Although precursors of ericins S and A show only 75% of identity, the matured lantibiotic-like peptides reveal highly similar physical properties; separation was only achieved after multistep, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on Edman and peptidase degradation in combination with MALDI-TOF MS, for ericin S a subtilin-like, lanthionine-bridging pattern is supposed. For ericin A two C-terminal rings are different from the lanthionine pattern of subtilin. Due to only four amino acid exchanges, ericin S and subtilin revealed similar antibiotic activities as well as similar properties in response to heat and protease treatment. For ericin A only minor antibiotic activity was found.	1
Abstract2class: Pleiotropic effects of Pasteurella multocida toxin are mediated by Gq-dependent and -independent mechanisms. involvement of Gq but not G11 Abstract: Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a highly potent mitogen for a variety of cell types. PMT has been shown to induce various cellular signaling processes, and it has been suggested to function through the heterotrimeric G-proteins G(q)/G(11). To analyze the role of G(q)/G(11) in the action of PMT, we have studied the effect of the toxin in Galpha(q)/Galpha(11) double-deficient fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts lacking only Galpha(q) or Galpha(11). Interestingly, formation of inositol phosphates in response to PMT was exclusively dependent on Galpha(q) but not on the closely related Galpha(11). Although Galpha(q)/Galpha(11) double-deficient and Galpha(q)-deficient cells did not respond with any production of inositol phosphates to PMT, PMT was still able to induce various other cellular effects in these cells, including the activation of Rho, the Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, as well as the stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These data show that PMT leads to a variety of cellular effects that are mediated only in part by the heterotrimeric G-protein G(q).	0
Abstract2class: G-Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects Abstract: White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G-quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G→T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild-type sequence into a three-tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1 : 3 : 1 and a minor 1 : 2 : 2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1 : 3 : 1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.	0
Abstract2class: Coordinated cyclic-di-GMP repression of Salmonella motility through YcgR and cellulose Abstract: Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a secondary messenger that controls a variety of cellular processes, including the switch between a biofilm and a planktonic bacterial lifestyle. This nucleotide binds to cellular effectors in order to exert its regulatory functions. In Salmonella, two proteins, BcsA and YcgR, both of them containing a c-di-GMP binding PilZ domain, are the only known c-di-GMP receptors. BcsA, upon c-di-GMP binding, synthesizes cellulose, the main exopolysaccharide of the biofilm matrix. YcgR is dedicated to c-di-GMP-dependent inhibition of motility through its interaction with flagellar motor proteins. However, previous evidences indicate that in the absence of YcgR, there is still an additional element that mediates motility impairment under high c-di-GMP levels. Here we have uncovered that cellulose per se is the factor that further promotes inhibition of bacterial motility once high c-di-GMP contents drive the activation of a sessile lifestyle. Inactivation of different genes of the bcsABZC operon, mutation of the conserved residues in the RxxxR motif of the BcsA PilZ domain, or degradation of the cellulose produced by BcsA rescued the motility defect of ΔycgR strains in which high c-di-GMP levels were reached through the overexpression of diguanylate cyclases. High c-di-GMP levels provoked cellulose accumulation around cells that impeded flagellar rotation, probably by means of steric hindrance, without affecting flagellum gene expression, exportation, or assembly. Our results highlight the relevance of cellulose in Salmonella lifestyle switching as an architectural element that is both essential for biofilm development and required, in collaboration with YcgR, for complete motility inhibition.	0
Abstract2class: Targeted therapy in the treatment of solid tumors: practice contradicts theory Abstract: The basic principle of targeted therapy formulated about ten years ago consists in the design and application of drugs specifically directed against well-defined targets that are critical for tumor survival and not compromising for normal organs and tissues. The past decade has been marked by the appearance of an immense diversity of novel antitumor agents with claimed targeted action. Unfortunately, despite indisputable progress in clinical settings, some popular drugs against solid tumors (e.g. bevacizumab, trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib) nominally assigned to targeted-action drugs, cannot actually be classified with this group being nonconforming to a priori stated goals of targeted therapy. The state-of-the-art and current problems in targeted therapy of solid tumors are reviewed.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the viridicatumtoxin and griseofulvin gene clusters from Penicillium aethiopicum Abstract: Penicillium aethiopicum produces two structurally interesting and biologically active polyketides: the tetracycline-like viridicatumtoxin 1 and the classic antifungal agent griseofulvin 2. Here, we report the concurrent discovery of the two corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (vrt and gsf) by 454 shotgun sequencing. Gene deletions confirmed that two nonreducing PKSs (NRPKSs), vrtA and gsfA, are required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, respectively. Both PKSs share similar domain architectures and lack a C-terminal thioesterase domain. We identified gsfI as the chlorinase involved in the biosynthesis of 2, because deletion of gsfI resulted in the accumulation of decholorogriseofulvin 3. Comparative analysis with the P. chrysogenum genome revealed that both clusters are embedded within conserved syntenic regions of P. aethiopicum chromosomes. Discovery of the vrt and gsf clusters provided the basis for genetic and biochemical studies of the pathways.	1
Abstract2class: New insights into polyene macrolide biosynthesis in Couchioplanes caeruleus Abstract: Couchioplanes caeruleus DSM43634 synthesises 67-121C, an aromatic heptaene macrolide that contains a mannosyl-mycosaminyl disaccharide. An improved draft genome sequence was used to obtain the biosynthetic gene cluster for this antifungal. Bioinformatic analysis of the polyketide synthase indicated that extension modules 7 and 8 contain A-type ketoreductase and dehydratase domains. These modules are therefore predicted to form cis double bonds. The deduced stereostructure of the 67-121C macrolactone is identical to that experimentally determined for the partricin subgroup of aromatic heptaenes. Some of these polyenes are N-methylated on the aminoacetophenone moiety. The C. caeruleus AceS protein was shown to methylate 4-aminoacetophenone and esters of 4-aminobenzoate, but not 4-aminobenzoate. This suggests that the substrate specificity of AceS prevents it from interfering with folate biosynthesis. The methyltransferase should be valuable for chemoenzymatic alkylation of compounds that contain aminobenzoyl moieties.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of eryBI, eryBIII and eryBVII from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA that lies between the known genes ermE (encoding the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase) and eryBIII (encoding a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase), and that contains the gene eryBI (orf2), has now been sequenced. The inferred product of the eryBI gene shows striking sequence similarity to authentic beta-glucosidases. Specific mutants were created in eryBI, and the resulting strains were found to synthesise erythromycin A, showing that this gene, despite its position in the biosynthetic gene cluster, is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. A mutant in eryBIII and a double mutant in eryBI and eryBIII were obtained and the analysis of novel erythromycins produced by these strains confirmed the proposed function of EryBIII as a C-methyltransferase. Also, a chromosomal mutant was constructed for the previously sequenced ORF19 and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant and consistent with its proposed role as an epimerase in dTDP-mycarose biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Functional investigation of the chromosomal ccdAB and hipAB operon in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 Abstract: Toxin-antitoxin systems (TASs) have attracted much attention due to their important physiological functions. These small genetic factors have been widely studied mostly in commensal Escherichia coli strains, whereas the role of TASs in the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is still elusive. Here, the physiological role of chromosomally encoded type II TASs in EcN was examined. We showed that gene pair ECOLIN_00240-ECOLIN_00245 and ECOLIN_08365-ECOLIN_08370 were two functional TASs encoding CcdAB and HipAB, respectively. The homologs of CcdAB and HipAB were more conserved in E. coli species belonging to pathogenic groups, suggesting their important roles in EcN. CRISPRi-mediated repression of ccdAB and hipAB significantly reduced the biofilm formation of EcN in the stationary phase. Moreover, ccdAB and hipAB were shown to be responsible for the persister formation in EcN. Biofilm and persister formation of EcN controlled by the ccdAB and hipAB were associated with the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis, SOS response, and stringent response. Besides, CRISPRi was proposed to be an efficient tool in annotating multiple TASs simultaneously. Collectively, our results advance knowledge and understanding of the role of TASs in EcN, which will enhance the utility of EcN in probiotic therapy.Key points• Two TASs in EcN were identified as hipAB and ccdAB.• Knockdown of HipAB and CcdAB resulted in decreased biofilm formation of EcN.• Transcriptional silencing of hipAB and ccdAB affected the persister formation of EcN.• An attractive link between TASs and stress response was unraveled in EcN.• CRISPRi afforded a fast and in situ annotation of multiple TASs simultaneously.	0
Abstract2class: A designer bleomycin with significantly improved DNA cleavage activity Abstract: The bleomycins (BLMs) are used clinically in combination with a number of other agents for the treatment of several types of tumors, and the BLM, etoposide, and cisplatin treatment regimen cures 90-95% of metastatic testicular cancer patients. BLM-induced pneumonitis is the most feared, dose-limiting side effect of BLM in chemotherapy, which can progress into lung fibrosis and affect up to 46% of the total patient population. There have been continued efforts to develop new BLM analogues in the search for anticancer drugs with better clinical efficacy and lower lung toxicity. We have previously cloned and characterized the biosynthetic gene clusters for BLMs from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003, tallysomycins from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158, and zorbamycin (ZBM) from Streptomyces flavoviridis SB9001. Comparative analysis of the three biosynthetic machineries provided the molecular basis for the formulation of hypotheses to engineer novel analogues. We now report engineered production of three new analogues, 6'-hydroxy-ZBM, BLM Z, and 6'-deoxy-BLM Z and the evaluation of their DNA cleavage activities as a measurement for their potential anticancer activity. Our findings unveiled: (i) the disaccharide moiety plays an important role in the DNA cleavage activity of BLMs and ZBMs, (ii) the ZBM disaccharide significantly enhances the potency of BLM, and (iii) 6'-deoxy-BLM Z represents the most potent BLM analogue known to date. The fact that 6'-deoxy-BLM Z can be produced in reasonable quantities by microbial fermentation should greatly facilitate follow-up mechanistic and preclinical studies to potentially advance this analogue into a clinical drug.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into the reaction mechanism of the prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase involved in anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a biosynthesis Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins. We recently reported the identification of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins as well as the in-vitro reconstitution of the first steps of this biosynthesis. We now report experimental evidence supporting the proposed reaction mechanism of AnaB, a flavoprotein homologous to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. AnaB catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of prolyl-AnaD, which is proline linked to the acyl carrier protein holo-AnaD, to dehydroprolyl-AnaD using oxygen as the second substrate. AnaB is thus an oxidase. By using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we have identified and characterized dehydroprolyl-AnaD, the AnaB product. We estimated an apparent catalytic constant of 1 min(-1) for AnaB catalysis. We synthesized several deuterium-labeled prolines and enzymatically transformed them into their corresponding prolyl-AnaD. These deuterium-labeled prolyl-AnaDs were oxidized in the presence of AnaB, and the deuterium labeling in the remaining substrate and in the product was determined by LC-MS/MS. The data supported a reaction mechanism starting with a rapid enolization followed by a slow oxidation to give the conjugated imine, which in turn was isomerized to pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD. We also showed that cis- and trans-4-fluoro-L-prolyl-AnaD and 3,4-dehydro-L-prolyl-AnaD were transformed into pyrrole-2-carboxyl-AnaD by AnaB. Thus, the 4-fluoro-analogues experienced a β-elimination supporting the AnaB-catalyzed aza-allylic isomerization. We identified by sequence alignment the AnaB active site base, Glu244. We produced, purified, and characterized the E244A AnaB mutant, which is inactive, supporting the catalytic role of E244 as a base.	1
Abstract2class: Enediyne polyketide synthases stereoselectively reduce the β-ketoacyl intermediates to β-D-hydroxyacyl intermediates in enediyne core biosynthesis Abstract: PKSE biosynthesizes an enediyne core precursor from decarboxylative condensation of eight malonyl-CoAs. The KR domain of PKSE is responsible for iterative β-ketoreduction in each round of polyketide chain elongation. KRs from selected PKSEs were investigated in vitro with β-ketoacyl-SNACs as substrate mimics. Each of the KRs reduced the β-ketoacyl-SNACs stereoselectively, all affording the corresponding β-D-hydroxyacyl-SNACs, and the catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(M)) of the KRs increased significantly as the chain length of the β-ketoacyl-SNAC substrate increases.	1
Abstract2class: Dedicated ent-kaurene and ent-atiserene synthases for platensimycin and platencin biosynthesis Abstract: Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising drug leads for both antibacterial and antidiabetic therapies. Comparative analysis of the PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries in Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and MA7339 revealed that the divergence of PTM and PTN biosynthesis is controlled by dedicated ent-kaurene and ent-atiserene synthases, the latter of which represents a new pathway for diterpenoid biosynthesis. The PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries provide a rare glimpse at how secondary metabolic pathway evolution increases natural product structural diversity and support the wisdom of applying combinatorial biosynthesis methods for the generation of novel PTM and/or PTN analogues, thereby facilitating drug development efforts based on these privileged natural product scaffolds.	1
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of TtnD and TtnF, unveiling new insights into tautomycetin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycetin (TTN), a highly potent and selective protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes, has recently been cloned and sequenced. To better understand the transformations responsible for converting the post-polyketide synthase product into the exciting anticancer and immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic candidate TTN, we produced and characterized new analogues resulting from inactivation of two genes, ttnD and ttnF, in S. griseochromogenes. Inactivation of ttnD and ttnF, which encode for putative decarboxylase and dehydratase enzymes, respectively, afforded mutant strains SB13013 and SB13014. The DeltattnD mutant SB13013 accumulated four new TTN analogues, TTN D-1, TTN D-2, TTN D-3, and TTN D-4, whereas the DeltattnF mutant accumulated only one new TTN analogue, TTN F-1. The accumulation of these new TTN analogues defines the function of TtnD and TtnF and the timing of their chemistries in relation to installation of the C5 ketone moiety within TTN. Notably, all new analogues possess a structurally distinguishing carboxylic acid moiety, revealing that TtnD apparently cannot catalyze decarboxylation in the absence of TtnF. Additionally, cytotoxicity and PP inhibition assays reveal the importance of the functional groups installed by TtnDF and, consistent with earlier proposals, the C2''-C5 fragment of TTN to be a critical structural determinant behind the important and unique PP-1 selectivity displayed by TTN.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and analysis of the core biosynthetic machinery of tubulysin, a potent cytotoxin with potential anticancer activity Abstract: Myxobacteria are well known for their biosynthetic potential, especially for the production of cytotoxic compounds with potential anticancer activities. The tubulysins are currently in preclinical development. They are produced in very low quantities, and genetic manipulation of producing strains has never been accomplished. We report the development of a mariner-based transposon mutagenesis system for Angiococcus disciformis An d48. Extracts from a library of 1200 mutants were analyzed for the presence of tubulysin by a microscopic cell nucleus fragmentation bioassay. The transposition sites of four tubulysin-negative mutants were identified by vector recovery, which led to the identification and the sequencing of the corresponding core biosynthetic gene locus. Sequence analysis of more than 80,000 bp reveals an unusual multimodular hybrid polyketide synthase/peptide synthetase assembly line with a variety of unprecedented features.	1
Abstract2class: Cinchonium Betaines as Efficient Catalysts for Asymmetric Proton Transfer Catalysis: The Development of a Practical Enantioselective Isomerization of Trifluoromethyl Imines Abstract: We have developed a new class of cinchonium betaine catalysts bearing both a base moiety and an aromatic moiety as an N-substituent of the quinuclidine motif. These cinchonium betaines were found to promote proton transfer catalysis with 1000-5000 turnovers per 24 h, thereby enabling us to realize highly efficient enantioselective isomerization of trifluoromethyl imines to provide a practical access to optically active trifluoromethylated amines.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery and Heterologous Biosynthesis of the Burnettramic Acids: Rare PKS-NRPS-Derived Bolaamphiphilic Pyrrolizidinediones from an Australian Fungus, Aspergillus burnettii Abstract: The burnettramic acids are a new class of antibiotics from an Australian fungus Aspergillus burnettii. The rare bolaamphiphilic scaffold consists of β-d-mannose linked to a pyrrolizidinedione unit via a 26-carbon chain. The most abundant metabolite displayed potent in vitro antifungal activity. Comparative genomics identified the hybrid PKS-NRPS bua gene cluster, which was verified by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Aspergillus nidulans.	1
Abstract2class: PtmC Catalyzes the Final Step of Thioplatensimycin, Thioplatencin, and Thioplatensilin Biosynthesis and Expands the Scope of Arylamine N-Acetyltransferases Abstract: The members of the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) family of enzymes are important for their many roles in xenobiotic detoxification in bacteria and humans. However, very little is known about their roles outside of detoxification or their specificities for acyl donors larger than acetyl-CoA. Herein, we report the detailed study of PtmC, an unusual NAT homologue encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster for thioplatensimycin, thioplatencin, and a newly reported scaffold, thioplatensilin, thioacid-containing diterpenoids and highly potent inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases. As the final enzyme of the pathway, PtmC is responsible for the selection of a thioacid arylamine over its cognate carboxylic acid and coupling to at least three large, 17-carbon ketolide-CoA substrates. Therefore, this study uses a combined approach of enzymology and molecular modeling to reveal how PtmC has evolved from the canonical NAT scaffold into a key part of a natural combinatorial biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, genome mining has revealed the presence of other related NATs located within natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, findings from this study are expected to expand our knowledge of how enzymes evolve for expanded substrate diversity and enable additional predictions about the activities of NATs involved in natural product biosynthesis and xenobiotic detoxification.	0
Abstract2class: Gravity field of the Orientale basin from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Mission Abstract: The Orientale basin is the youngest and best-preserved major impact structure on the Moon. We used the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft to investigate the gravitational field of Orientale at 3- to 5-kilometer (km) horizontal resolution. A volume of at least (3.4 ± 0.2) × 106 km3 of crustal material was removed and redistributed during basin formation. There is no preserved evidence of the transient crater that would reveal the basin's maximum volume, but its diameter may now be inferred to be between 320 and 460 km. The gravity field resolves distinctive structures of Orientale's three rings and suggests the presence of faults associated with the outer two that penetrate to the mantle. The crustal structure of Orientale provides constraints on the formation of multiring basins.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation, structure elucidation, and iron-binding properties of lystabactins, siderophores isolated from a marine Pseudoalteromonas sp Abstract: The marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. S2B, isolated from the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was found to produce lystabactins A, B, and C (1-3), three new siderophores. The structures were elucidated through mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and NMR. The lystabactins are composed of serine (Ser), asparagine (Asn), two formylated/hydroxylated ornithines (FOHOrn), dihydroxy benzoic acid (Dhb), and a very unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid, 4,8-diamino-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (LySta). The iron-binding properties of the compounds were investigated through a spectrophotometric competition.	0
Abstract2class: Caboxamycin biosynthesis pathway and identification of novel benzoxazoles produced by cross-talk in Streptomyces sp. NTK 937 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. NTK937, producer of benzoxazole antibiotic caboxamycin, produces in addition a methyl ester derivative, O-methylcaboxamycin. Caboxamycin cluster, comprising one regulatory and nine structural genes, has been delimited, and each gene has been individually inactivated to demonstrate its role in the biosynthetic process. The O-methyltransferase potentially responsible for O-methylcaboxamycin synthesis would reside outside this cluster. Five of the genes, cbxR, cbxA, cbxB, cbxD and cbxE, encoding a SARP transcriptional regulator, salicylate synthase, 3-oxoacyl-ACP-synthase, ACP and amidohydrolase, respectively, have been found to be essential for caboxamycin biosynthesis. The remaining five structural genes were found to have paralogues distributed throughout the genome, capable of partaking in the process when their cluster homologue is inactivated. Two of such paralogues, cbxC' and cbxI', coding an AMP-dependent synthetase-ligase and an anthranilate synthase, respectively, have been identified. However, the other three genes might simultaneously have more than one paralogue, given that cbxF (DAHP synthase), cbxG (2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase) and cbxH (isochorismatase) have three, three and five putative paralogue genes, respectively, of similar function within the genome. As a result of genetic manipulation, a novel benzoxazole (3'-hydroxycaboxamycin) has been identified in the salicylate synthase-deficient mutant strain ΔcbxA. 3'-hydroxycaboxamycin derives from the cross-talk between the caboxamycin and enterobactin pathways.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of the biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum. The sequence of a 10-kb region containing the capsule biosynthetic locus of Av. paragallinarum was determined. Two reference strains, i.e., 221 (serovar A) and H18 (serovar C), together with four Taiwanese field strains (all serovar C) were sequenced. The results showed that there are two genotypes (I and II) of the capsule biosynthetic locus in Av. paragallinarum, and the capsule genotype is independent of the serovar. The capsule biosynthetic loci of genotypes I and II consisted of six and five genes, respectively. The genotype I genes encoded proteins that are most similar to proteins from Pasteurella multocida capsule types A and F while the genotype II genes encoded proteins most similar to proteins from P. multocida capsule type D and Escherichia coli K5. The results suggested that genotype I strains contain hyaluronan or chondroitin in the capsule wall while genotype II contain heparosan. Enzymatic digestion of the capsule materials extracted from Av. paragallinarum showed that genotype I strains contained chondroitin while genotype II strains contained heparosan in the capsule. This is the first report on the existence of different genotypes of capsule biosynthesis genes in Av. paragallinarum and the presence of chondroitin and heparosan as chemical components of the capsule of Av. paragallinarum.	1
Abstract2class: High-Throughput, Label-Free Isolation of Cancer Stem Cells on the Basis of Cell Adhesion Capacity Abstract: Herein we report a microfluidics method that enriches cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells on the basis of cell adhesion properties. In our on-chip enrichment system, cancer cells were driven by hydrodynamic forces to flow through microchannels coated with basement membrane extract. Highly adhesive cells were captured by the functionalized microchannels, and less adhesive cells were collected from the outlets. Two heterogeneous breast cancer cell lines (SUM-149 and SUM-159) were successfully separated into enriched subpopulations according to their adhesive capacity, and the enrichment of the cancer stem cells was confirmed by flow cytometry biomarker analysis and tumor-formation assays. Our findings show that the less adhesive phenotype is associated with a higher percentage of CSCs, higher cancer-cell motility, and higher resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.	0
Abstract2class: Acyl-chain elongation drives ketosynthase substrate selectivity in trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases Abstract: Type I modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are responsible for the biosynthesis of many biologically active agents, possess a ketosynthase (KS) domain within each module to catalyze chain elongation. Acylation of the KS active site Cys residue is followed by transfer to malonyl-ACP to yield an extended β-ketoacyl chain (ACP = acyl carrier protein). To date, the precise contribution of KS selectivity in controlling product fidelity has been unclear. Six KS domains from trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) PKSs were subjected to a mass spectrometry based elongation assay, and higher substrate selectivity was identified for the elongating step than in preceding acylation. A close correspondence between the observed KS selectivity and that predicted by phylogenetic analysis was seen. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of KS selectivity in this important group of PKSs, can serve as guidance for engineering, and show that targeted mutagenesis can be used to expand the repertoire of acceptable substrates.	1
Abstract2class: The gene PatG involved in the biosynthesis pathway of patulin, a food-borne mycotoxin, encodes a 6-methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase Abstract: Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by fungal genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium and Byssochlamys. It induces neurological, gastrointestinal and immunological effects, which is why patulin belongs to a short list of mycotoxins whose level in food is regulated in many countries around the world. Recently, a cluster gathering 15 genes involved in the biosynthesis of patulin has been identified in Aspergillus clavatus, but so far, only 4 genes encoding 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase, m-cresol hydroxylase, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol hydroxylase and isoepoxydon dehydrogenase have been characterized. Previous studies have shown the involvement of a decarboxylase in the transformation of 6-methylsalicylic acid, the first stable patulin precursor, into m-cresol. In this study a putative decarboxylase gene, PatG, was identified in the genome sequence of A. clavatus. This gene is located near two P450 cytochrome genes PatH and PatI responsible respectively for the hydroxylation of m-cresol and m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. This decarboxylase encoded by PatG (ACLA_093620) consists of 325 amino acids. The search for putative conserved domain revealed that the gene product belongs to the AminoCarboxyMuconate Semialdehyde Decarboxylase (ACMSD) related protein family. This family includes decarboxylases such as the γ-resorcylate decarboxylase or o-pyrocatechuate decarboxylase. The substrates of these enzymes display strong structural similarities with 6-methylsalicylic acid. PatG was strongly expressed during patulin production whereas it was very weakly expressed in non-patulin permissive conditions. The coding sequence was used to enable heterologous expression of functional enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of decarboxylase was confirmed by Western blot. The bioconversion assays showed that PATG catalyzed the decarboxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid into m-cresol. These results confirm for the first time that 6-methylsalicylic acid is the substrate for PATG, the 6-methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase. With this study, the four genes involved in the four first steps of patulin biosynthesis pathway (acetate→gentisyl alcohol) are now identified.	1
Abstract2class: Lactobacillus plantarum ccl gene is non-essential, arginine-repressed and codes for a conserved protein in Firmicutes Abstract: Among proteins specifically found in most gram-positive bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, conserved proteins of the family pfam06177-DUF988-COG4708 are of unknown function. The citrulline cluster-linked (ccl) gene of Lactobacillus plantarum codes one such protein and is adjacent to the citrulline biosynthesis operon argCJBDF, a situation also found in Lactococcus lactis. This gene is well conserved among L. plantarum species, and 1 isolate out of 24 harbored two ccl copies. Northern hybridization with a ccl probe revealed two arginine-repressed transcripts with sizes corresponding to the predicted argCJBDF-ccl operon and the ccl gene alone. Transcription start sites of both transcripts were characterized. Four different 5' ends were mapped at the argF-ccl intergenic region, resulting from either regulated transcription initiation or maturation of the transcripts. Transcriptional ccl-gusA gene fusion confirmed the promoter activity of the argF-ccl intergenic region. Thus, the ccl gene is arginine-repressed and transcribed both monocistronically and polycistronically in the argCJBDF-ccl operon. The ccl gene is not essential in L. plantarum, because a ccl gene deletion was obtained in strain CCM 1904. Although no functions were found in the tested laboratory conditions, the Ccl-like proteins may play a role in environmental conditions of life.	1
Abstract2class: Covalent CouN7 enzyme intermediate for acyl group shuttling in aminocoumarin biosynthesis Abstract: The last stages of assembly of the aminocoumarin antibiotics, clorobiocin and coumermycin A(1), which target the GyrB subunits of bacterial DNA gyrase, involve enzymatic transfer of the pyrrolyl-2-carbonyl acyl group from a carrier protein (CloN1/CouN1) to the 3'-OH of the noviosyl moiety of the antibiotic scaffold. The enzyme, CouN7, will catalyze both the forward and back reaction on both arms of the coumermycin scaffold. This occurs via an O-acyl-Ser(101)-CouN7 intermediate, as shown by transient labeling of the enzyme with [(14)C]acetyl-S-CouN1 as donor and by inactivating mutation of the active site, Ser(101), to Ala. The intermediacy of the pyrrolyl-2-carbonyl-O-CouN7 allows net pyrrole transfer between distinct aminocoumarin scaffolds, for example, between the descarbamoylnovobiocin scaffold and coumermycin A(1) and vice versa. CouN7 also allows shuttling of surrogate acyl groups between noviosyl-aminocoumarin scaffolds to generate new antibiotic variants.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular analysis of a beta-lactam resistance gene encoded within the cephamycin gene cluster of Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A Streptomyces clavuligerus gene (designated pcbR) which is located immediately downstream from the gene encoding isopenicillin N synthase in the cephamycin gene cluster was characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis and database searching of PcbR identified a significant similarity between PcbR and proteins belonging to the family of high-molecular-weight group B penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Eight of nine boxes (motifs) conserved within this family of proteins are present in the PcbR protein sequence in the same order and with approximately the same spacing between them. When a mutant disrupted in pcbR was constructed by gene replacement, the resulting pcbR mutant exhibited a significant decrease in its resistance to benzylpenicillin and cephalosporins, indicating that pcbR is involved in beta-lactam resistance in this organism. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of S. clavuligerus cell membranes using PcbR-specific antibodies suggested that PcbR is a membrane protein. PcbR was also present in cell membranes when expressed in Escherichia coli and was able to bind radioactive penicillin in a PBP assay, suggesting that PcbR is a PBP. When genomic DNAs from several actinomycetes were probed with pcbR, hybridization was observed to some but not all beta-lactam-producing actinomycetes.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of Shiga toxin type 2 variants in Escherichia coli isolates from animals, food, and humans Abstract: There is considerable heterogeneity among the Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) toxins elaborated by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). One such Stx2 variant, the Stx2d mucus-activatable toxin (Stx2dact), is rendered more toxic by the action of elastase present in intestinal mucus, which cleaves the last two amino acids of the A2 portion of the toxin A subunit. We screened 153 STEC isolates from food, animals, and humans for the gene encoding Stx2dact by using a novel one-step PCR procedure. This method targeted the region of stx(2dact) that encodes the elastase recognition site. The presence of stx(2dact) was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the complete toxin genes. Seven STEC isolates from cows (four isolates), meat (two isolates), and a human (one isolate) that carried the putative stx(2dact) gene were identified; all were eae negative, and none was the O157:H7 serotype. Three of the isolates (CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584) also carried stx(1), two (P1332 and P1334) carried stx(1) and stx(2c), and one (CL-15) carried stx(2c). One isolate, P1130, harbored only stx(2dact). The Vero cell cytotoxicities of supernatants from P1130 and stx(1) deletion mutants of CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584 were increased 13- to 30-fold after treatment with porcine elastase. Thus, Stx2dact-producing strains, as detected by our one-step PCR method, can be isolated not only from humans, as previously documented, but also from food and animals. The latter finding has important public health implications based on a recent report from Europe of a link between disease severity and infection with STEC isolates that produce Stx2dact.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of Pyrroles through the CuH-Catalyzed Coupling of Enynes and Nitriles Abstract: Herein, we describe an efficient method to prepare polysubstituted pyrroles via a copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed enyne-nitrile coupling reaction. This protocol accommodates both aromatic and aliphatic substituents and a broad range of functional groups, providing a variety of N-H pyrroles in good yields and with high regioselectivity. We propose that the Cu-based catalyst promotes both the initial reductive coupling and subsequent cyclization steps. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.	0
Abstract2class: Initiation of the flexirubin biosynthesis in Chitinophaga pinensis Abstract: Bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum are known producers of the chemotaxonomic relevant flexirubins. These orange pigments comprise a non-isoprenoid aryl-polyene carboxylic acid esterified with a dialkylresorcinol. Herein, we report a gene cluster from Chitinophaga pinensis encoding the biosynthesis of the polyene moiety and the biochemical characterization of a tyrosine ammonia-lyase and a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase responsible for the initiation of the polyene biosynthesis. Additionally, the flexirubin of C. pinensis was characterized by a combination of feeding experiments, high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.	1
Abstract2class: Histone H2A.Z subunit exchange controls consolidation of recent and remote memory Abstract: Memory formation is a multi-stage process that initially requires cellular consolidation in the hippocampus, after which memories are downloaded to the cortex for maintenance, in a process termed systems consolidation. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate both types of consolidation, but histone variant exchange, in which canonical histones are replaced with their variant counterparts, is an entire branch of epigenetics that has received limited attention in the brain and has never, to our knowledge, been studied in relation to cognitive function. Here we show that histone H2A.Z, a variant of histone H2A, is actively exchanged in response to fear conditioning in the hippocampus and the cortex, where it mediates gene expression and restrains the formation of recent and remote memory. Our data provide evidence for H2A.Z involvement in cognitive function and specifically implicate H2A.Z as a negative regulator of hippocampal consolidation and systems consolidation, probably through downstream effects on gene expression. Moreover, alterations in H2A.Z binding at later stages of systems consolidation suggest that this histone has the capacity to mediate stable molecular modifications required for memory retention. Overall, our data introduce histone variant exchange as a novel mechanism contributing to the molecular basis of cognitive function and implicate H2A.Z as a potential therapeutic target for memory disorders.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a silent azaphilone gene cluster from Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 reveals a hydroxylation-mediated pyran-ring formation Abstract: Azaphilones are a class of fungal metabolites characterized by a highly oxygenated pyrano-quinone bicyclic core and exhibiting a broad range of bioactivities. Although widespread among various fungi, their biosynthesis has not been thoroughly elucidated. By activation of a silent (aza) gene cluster in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015, we discovered six azaphilone compounds, azanigerones A-F (1, 3-7). Transcriptional analysis and deletion of a key polyketide synthase (PKS) gene further confirmed the involvement of the aza gene cluster. The biosynthetic pathway was shown to involve the convergent actions of a highly reducing PKS and a non-reducing PKS. Most significantly, in vitro reaction of a key flavin-dependent monooxygenase encoded in the cluster with an early benzaldehyde intermediate revealed its roles in hydroxylation and pyran-ring formation to afford the characteristic bicylic core shared by azaphilones.	0
Abstract2class: Novel parameter describing restriction endonucleases: Secondary-Cognate-Specificity and chemical stimulation of TsoI leading to substrate specificity change Abstract: Over 470 prototype Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) are currently known. Most recognise specific DNA sequences 4-8 bp long, with very few exceptions cleaving DNA more frequently. TsoI is a thermostable Type IIC enzyme that recognises the DNA sequence TARCCA (R = A or G) and cleaves downstream at N11/N9. The enzyme exhibits extensive top-strand nicking of the supercoiled single-site DNA substrate. The second DNA strand of such substrate is specifically cleaved only in the presence of duplex oligonucleotides containing a cognate site. We have previously shown that some Type IIC/IIG/IIS enzymes from the Thermus-family exhibit 'affinity star' activity, which can be induced by the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) cofactor analogue-sinefungin (SIN). Here, we define a novel type of inherently built-in 'star' activity, exemplified by TsoI. The TsoI 'star' activity cannot be described under the definition of the classic 'star' activity as it is independent of the reaction conditions used and cannot be separated from the cognate specificity. Therefore, we define this phenomenon as Secondary-Cognate-Specificity (SCS). The TsoI SCS comprises several degenerated variants of the cognate site. Although the efficiency of TsoI SCS cleavage is lower in comparison to the cognate TsoI recognition sequence, it can be stimulated by S-adenosyl-L-cysteine (SAC). We present a new route for the chemical synthesis of SAC. The TsoI/SAC REase may serve as a novel tool for DNA manipulation.	0
Abstract2class: The dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose reductase encoding fcd gene is part of the surface layer glycoprotein glycosylation gene cluster of Geobacillus tepidamans GS5-97T Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Geobacillus tepidamans GS5-97(T) consists of disaccharide repeating units composed of L-rhamnose and D-fucose, the latter being a rare constituent of prokaryotic glycoconjugates. Although biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated L-rhamnose is well established, D-fucose biosynthesis is less investigated. The conversion of alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate into thymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose by the sequential action of RmlA (glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase) and RmlB (dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase) is shared between the dTDP-D-fucose and the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway. This key intermediate is processed by the dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose reductase Fcd to form dTDP-alpha-D-fucose. We identified the fcd gene in G. tepidamans GS5-97(T) by chromosome walking and performed functional characterization of the recombinant 308-amino acid enzyme. The in vitro activity of the enzymatic cascade (RmlB and Fcd) was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography and the reaction product was confirmed by (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This is the first characterization of the dTDP-alpha-D-fucopyranose biosynthesis pathway in a Gram-positive organism. fcd was identified as 1 of 20 open reading frames contained in a 17471-bp S-layer glycosylation (slg) gene cluster on the chromosome of G. tepidamans GS5-97(T). The sgtA structural gene is located immediately upstream of the slg gene cluster with an intergenic region of 247 nucleotides. By comparison of the SgtA amino acid sequence with the known glycosylation pattern of the S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a, two out of the proposed three glycosylation sites on SgtA could be identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be at positions Ser-792 and Thr-583.	1
Abstract2class: Hancockiamides: phenylpropanoid piperazines from Aspergillus hancockii are biosynthesised by a versatile dual single-module NRPS pathway Abstract: The hancockiamides are an unusual new family of N-cinnamoylated piperazines from the Australian soil fungus Aspergillus hancockii. Genomic analyses of A. hancockii identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (hkm) of 12 genes, including two single-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Heterologous expression of the hkm cluster in A. nidulans confirmed its role in the biosynthesis of the hancockiamides. We further demonstrated that a novel cytochrome P450, Hkm5, catalyses the methylenedioxy bridge formation, and that the PAL gene hkm12 is dispensable, but contributes to increased production of the cinnamoylated hancockiamides. In vitro enzymatic assays and substrate feeding studies demonstrated that NRPS Hkm11 activates and transfers trans-cinnamate to the piperazine scaffold and has flexibility to accept bioisosteric thienyl and furyl analogues. This is the first reported cinnamate-activating fungal NRPS. Expression of a truncated cluster lacking the acetyltransferase gene led to seven additional congeners, including an unexpected family of 2,5-dibenzylpiperazines. These pleiotropic effects highlight the plasticity of the pathway and the power of this approach for accessing novel natural product scaffolds.	1
Abstract2class: Gene cluster responsible for validamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008 Abstract: A gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of validamycin, an aminocyclitol antibiotic widely used as a control agent for sheath blight disease of rice plants, was identified from Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008 using heterologous probe acbC, a gene involved in the cyclization of D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone of the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster originated from Actinoplanes sp. strain SE50/110. Deletion of a 30-kb DNA fragment from this cluster in the chromosome resulted in loss of validamycin production, confirming a direct involvement of the gene cluster in the biosynthesis of this important plant protectant. A sequenced 6-kb fragment contained valA (an acbC homologue encoding a putative cyclase) as well as two additional complete open reading frames (valB and valC, encoding a putative adenyltransferase and a kinase, respectively), which are organized as an operon. The function of ValA was genetically demonstrated to be essential for validamycin production and biochemically shown to be responsible specifically for the cyclization of D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone in vitro using the ValA protein heterologously overexpressed in E. coli. The information obtained should pave the way for further detailed analysis of the complete biosynthetic pathway, which would lead to a complete understanding of validamycin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Plant, animal, and fungal micronutrient queuosine is salvaged by members of the DUF2419 protein family Abstract: Queuosine (Q) is a modification found at the wobble position of tRNAs with GUN anticodons. Although Q is present in most eukaryotes and bacteria, only bacteria can synthesize Q de novo. Eukaryotes acquire queuine (q), the free base of Q, from diet and/or microflora, making q an important but under-recognized micronutrient for plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic type tRNA-guanine transglycosylases (eTGTs) are composed of a catalytic subunit (QTRT1) and a homologous accessory subunit (QTRTD1) forming a complex that catalyzes q insertion into target tRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of eTGT subunits revealed a patchy distribution pattern in which gene losses occurred independently in different clades. Searches for genes co-distributing with eTGT family members identified DUF2419 as a potential Q salvage protein family. This prediction was experimentally validated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by confirming that Q was present by analyzing tRNA(Asp) with anticodon GUC purified from wild-type cells and by showing that Q was absent from strains carrying deletions in the QTRT1 or DUF2419 encoding genes. DUF2419 proteins occur in most Eukarya with a few possible cases of horizontal gene transfer to bacteria. The universality of the DUF2419 function was confirmed by complementing the S. pombe mutant with the Zea mays (maize), human, and Sphaerobacter thermophilus homologues. The enzymatic function of this family is yet to be determined, but structural similarity with DNA glycosidases suggests a ribonucleoside hydrolase activity.	0
Abstract2class: Sulfonium Acids Loaded onto an Unusual Thiotemplate Assembly Line Construct the Cyclopropanol Warhead of a Burkholderia Virulence Factor Abstract: Pathogenic bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause severe infectious diseases such as glanders and melioidosis. Malleicyprols were identified as important bacterial virulence factors, yet the biosynthetic origin of their cyclopropanol warhead has remained enigmatic. By a combination of mutational analysis and metabolomics we found that sulfonium acids, dimethylsulfoniumpropionate (DMSP) and gonyol, known as osmolytes and as crucial components in the global organosulfur cycle, are key intermediates en route to the cyclopropanol unit. Functional genetics and in vitro analyses uncover a specialized pathway to DMSP involving a rare prokaryotic SET-domain methyltransferase for a cryptic methylation, and show that DMSP is loaded onto the NRPS-PKS hybrid assembly line by an adenylation domain dedicated to zwitterionic starter units. Then, the megasynthase transforms DMSP into gonyol, as demonstrated by heterologous pathway reconstitution in E. coli.	1
Abstract2class: A two-step sulfation in antibiotic biosynthesis requires a type III polyketide synthase Abstract: Caprazamycins (CPZs) belong to a group of liponucleoside antibiotics inhibiting the bacterial MraY translocase, an essential enzyme involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We have recently identified analogs that are decorated with a sulfate group at the 2″-hydroxy of the aminoribosyl moiety, and we now report an unprecedented two-step sulfation mechanism during the biosynthesis of CPZs. A type III polyketide synthase (PKS) known as Cpz6 is used in the biosynthesis of a group of new triketide pyrones that are subsequently sulfated by an unusual 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-dependent sulfotransferase (Cpz8) to yield phenolic sulfate esters, which serve as sulfate donors for a PAPS-independent arylsulfate sulfotransferase (Cpz4) to generate sulfated CPZs. This finding is to our knowledge the first demonstration of genuine sulfate donors for an arylsulfate sulfotransferase and the first report of a type III PKS to generate a chemical reagent in bacterial sulfate metabolism.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning of the pactamycin biosynthetic gene cluster and characterization of a crucial glycosyltransferase prior to a unique cyclopentane ring formation Abstract: The biosynthetic gene (pct) cluster for an antitumor antibiotic pactamycin was identified by use of a gene for putative radical S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase as a probe. The pct gene cluster is localized to a 34 kb contiguous DNA from Streptomyces pactum NBRC 13433 and contains 24 open reading frames. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for pactamycin comprising of a unique cyclopentane ring, 3-aminoacetophenone, and 6-methylsalicylate was proposed. The pctL gene encoding a glycosyltransferase was speculated to be involved in an N-glycoside formation between 3-aminoacetophenone and UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine prior to a unique cyclopentane ring formation. The pctL gene was then heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and the enzymatic activity of the recombinant PctL protein was investigated. Consequently, the PctL protein was found to catalyze the expected reaction forming beta-N-glycoside. The enzymatic activity of the PctL protein clearly confirmed that the present identified gene cluster is for the biosynthesis of pactamycin. Also, a glycosylation prior to cyclopentane ring formation was proposed to be a general strategy in the biosynthesis of the structurally related cyclopentane containing compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Distinct mechanisms for spiro-carbon formation reveal biosynthetic pathway crosstalk Abstract: Spirotryprostatins, an indole alkaloid class of nonribosomal peptides isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus, are known for their antimitotic activity in tumor cells. Because spirotryprostatins and many other chemically complex spiro-carbon-bearing natural products exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding the mechanism of spiro-carbon biosynthesis is of great interest. Here we report a detailed study of spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatins from tryprostatins derived from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, using reactants and products prepared with engineered yeast and fungal strains. Unexpectedly, FqzB, an FAD-dependent monooxygenase from the unrelated fumiquinazoline biosynthetic pathway, catalyzed spiro-carbon formation in spirotryprostatin A via an epoxidation route. Furthermore, FtmG, a cytochrome P450 from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, was determined to catalyze the spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatin B. Our results highlight the versatile role of oxygenating enzymes in the biosynthesis of structurally complex natural products and indicate that cross-talk of different biosynthetic pathways allows product diversification in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Stable high level expression of the violacein indolocarbazole anti-tumour gene cluster and the Streptomyces lividans amyA gene in E. coli K12 Abstract: Previous studies showed that when pPSX-vioABCDE was used to transform E. coli K12 DH5alpha the strain retained the plasmid even after 100 generations of unselected growth but produced a low level of the anti-tumour antibiotic violacein. Markedly higher levels of violacein synthesis were obtained from E. coli K12 DH5alpha pUC18-vioABCDE and Sphingomonas sp. JMP4092 pPSX-vioABCDE. Unfortunately, both strains were extremely unstable regardless of presence or absence of antibiotic selection to retain the plasmid. The current study was undertaken to determine if strains of E. coli K12 could be isolated which stably over produce violacein. When a range of E. coli K12 strains were transformed with pPSX-vioABCDE, most produced small amounts of violacein. However, a small number of related strains of E. coli K12 JM101, JM105 and JM109 not only over-produced violacein, but also maintained the high stability. In addition, E. coli K12 JM109 strongly expressed an alpha amylase gene (amyA) from Streptomyces lividans indicating that the S. lividans amyA promoter is highly active in E. coli K12 JM109. In another set of experiments, a violacein overproduction mutation (opv-1) of the plasmid pPSX-vioABCDE was isolated which enabled E. coli K12 DH5alpha to overproduce violacein while retaining high stability. The plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1 possesses a single base pair deletion in the promoter region of the violacein operon. By combining the over producing strain E. coli K12 JM109 and the over producing plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1, a stable hyper producing strain (E. coli K12 JM109 pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1) was constructed. Finally, two additional stable vectors, pPSX10 and pPSX20, were constructed to facilitate subcloning and functional analysis studies.	1
Abstract2class: Regulation of pectate lyase synthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Erwinia carotovora Abstract: Inducible synthesis of extracellular pectate lyase occurs in Erwinia carotovora, a bacterial soft-rot pathogen of plants, and, to a lesser extent, in a nonpathogenic isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens. A combination of pectin and a heat-labile factor in fresh potato tissue or acetone powders of the tissue provided the best carbon source for induction. Yields of inducible pectate lyase were much greater than those usually reported. The pathogen, but not the saprophyte, produced a small amount of constitutive enzyme when grown on glucose. The relatively low level or absence of constitutive synthesis in these bacteria did not result from catabolite repression. Attempts were made to relieve any existing catabolite repression by restricting growth through slow feeding of glucose or by growing the organisms on glycerol. These conditions did not significantly alter the differential rate of lyase synthesis compared with changes observed in the presence of inducers. Previous growth history did not affect induction in the pathogen. However, P. fluorescens previously cultured on glucose required 10 to 20 generations of growth on inducing medium before appreciable lyase synthesis occurred. Differences between the pathogen and nonpathogen suggest that regulation of pectate lyase synthesis is related to pathogenicity of soft-rot bacteria.	0

Abstract2class: Unprecedented Cyclization Catalyzed by a Cytochrome P450 in Benzastatin Biosynthesis Abstract: Benzastatins have unique structures probably derived from geranylated p-aminobenzoic acids. The indoline and tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds are presumably formed by cyclization of the geranyl moiety, but the cyclization mechanism was unknown. We studied the benzastatin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. RI18; functions of the six enzymes encoded by it were analyzed by gene disruption in a heterologous host and in vitro enzyme assays. We propose the biosynthetic pathway for benzastatins in which a cytochrome P450 (BezE) is responsible for the cyclization of geranylated p-acetoxyaminobenzoic acids; BezE catalyzes elimination of acetic acid to form an iron nitrenoid, nitrene transfer to form an aziridine ring, and nucleophilic addition of hydroxide ion to C-10 and chloride ion to C-9 to generate the indoline and tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds, respectively. Discovery of this enzyme, which should be termed cytochrome P450 nitrene transferase, provides an important insight into the functional diversity of cytochrome P450.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of novel methylsalicylic acid synthase gene involved in the biosynthesis of isoasperlactone and asperlactone in Aspergillus westerdijkiae Abstract: Aspergillus westerdijkiae is the main producer of several biologically active polyketide metabolites including isoasperlactone and asperlactone. A 5298bp polyketide synthase gene "aomsas" has been cloned in Aspergillus westerdijkiae by using gene walking approach and RACE-PCR. The predicted amino acid sequence of aomsas shows an identity of 40-56% with different methylsalicylic acid synthase genes found in Byssochlamys nivea, P. patulum, A. terreus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes. Based on the reverse transcription PCR and kinetic secondary metabolites production studies, aomsas expression was found to be associated with the biosynthesis of isoasperlactone and asperlactone. Moreover an aomsas knockout mutant "aoDeltamsas" of A. westerdijkiae, not only lost the capacity to produce isoasperlactone and asperlactone, but also 6-methylsalicylic acid. The genetically complemented mutant ao+msas restored the biosynthesis of all the missing metabolites. Chemical complementation through the addition of 6-methylsalicylic acid, aspyrone and diepoxide to growing culture of aoDeltamsas mutant revealed that these compounds play intermediate roles in the biosynthesis of asperlactone and isoasperlactone.	1
Abstract2class: The surface protein Shr of Streptococcus pyogenes binds heme and transfers it to the streptococcal heme-binding protein Shp Abstract: Background:                       The heme acquisition machinery in Streptococcus pyogenes is believed to consist of the surface proteins, Shr and Shp, and heme-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter HtsABC. Shp has been shown to rapidly transfer its heme to the lipoprotein component, HtsA, of HtsABC. The function of Shr and the heme source of Shp have not been established.                  Results:                       The objective of this study was to determine whether Shr binds heme and is a heme source of Shp. To achieve the objective, recombinant Shr protein was prepared. The purified Shr displays a spectrum typical of hemoproteins, indicating that Shr binds heme and acquires heme from Escherichia coli hemoproteins in vivo. Spectral analysis of Shr and Shp isolated from a mixture of Shr and heme-free Shp (apoShp) indicates that Shr and apoShp lost and gained heme, respectively; whereas Shr did not efficiently lose its heme in incubation with apoHtsA under the identical conditions. These results suggest that Shr directly transfers its heme to Shp. In addition, the rates of heme transfer from human hemoglobin to apoShp are close to those of simple ferric heme dissociation from hemoglobin, suggesting that methemoglobin does not directly transfer its heme to apoShp.                  Conclusion:                       We have demonstrated that recombinant Shr can acquire heme from E. coli hemoproteins in vivo and appears to directly transfer its heme to Shp and that Shp appears not to directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin. These results suggest the possibility that Shr is a source of heme for Shp and that the Shr-to-Shp heme transfer is a step of the heme acquisition process in S. pyogenes. Further characterization of the Shr/Shp/HtsA system would advance our understanding of the mechanism of heme acquisition in S. pyogenes.	0
Abstract2class: The genome analysis of Candidatus Burkholderia crenata reveals that secondary metabolism may be a key function of the Ardisia crenata leaf nodule symbiosis Abstract: A majority of Ardisia species harbour Burkholderia sp. bacteria within specialized leaf nodules. The bacteria are transmitted hereditarily and have not yet been cultured outside of their host. Because the plants cannot develop beyond the seedling stage without their symbionts, the symbiosis is considered obligatory. We sequenced for the first time the genome of Candidatus Burkholderia crenata (Ca. B. crenata), the leaf nodule symbiont of Ardisia crenata. The genome of Ca. B. crenata is the smallest Burkholderia genome to date. It contains a large amount of insertion sequences and pseudogenes and displays features consistent with reductive genome evolution. The genome does not encode functions commonly associated with plant symbioses such as nitrogen fixation and plant hormone metabolism. However, we identified unique genes with a predicted role in secondary metabolism in the genome of Ca. B. crenata. Specifically, we provide evidence that the bacterial symbionts are responsible for the synthesis of compound FR900359, a cyclic depsipeptide with biomedical properties previously isolated from leaves of A. crenata.	1
Abstract2class: Insects represent a link between food animal farms and the urban environment for antibiotic resistance traits Abstract: Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections result in higher patient mortality rates, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Extensive use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the animal industry represents great pressure for evolution and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on farms. Despite growing evidence showing that antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in food animals correlate with resistance in human pathogens, the proof for direct transmission of antibiotic resistance is difficult to provide. In this review, we make a case that insects commonly associated with food animals likely represent a direct and important link between animal farms and urban communities for antibiotic resistance traits. Houseflies and cockroaches have been shown to carry multidrug-resistant clonal lineages of bacteria identical to those found in animal manure. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated proliferation of bacteria and horizontal transfer of resistance genes in the insect digestive tract as well as transmission of resistant bacteria by insects to new substrates. We propose that insect management should be an integral part of pre- and postharvest food safety strategies to minimize spread of zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistance traits from animal farms. Furthermore, the insect link between the agricultural and urban environment presents an additional argument for adopting prudent use of antibiotics in the food animal industry.	0
Abstract2class: Expanding the binding envelope of CYP51 inhibitors targeting Trypanosoma cruzi with 4-aminopyridyl-based sulfonamide derivatives Abstract: Chagas disease is a chronic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, manifested in progressive cardiomyopathy and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therapeutic options to prevent or treat Chagas disease are limited. CYP51, the enzyme key to the biosynthesis of eukaryotic membrane sterols, is a validated drug target in both fungi and T. cruzi. Sulfonamide derivatives of 4-aminopyridyl-based inhibitors of T. cruzi CYP51 (TcCYP51), including the sub-nanomolar compound 3, have molecular structures distinct from other validated CYP51 inhibitors. They augment the biologically relevant chemical space of molecules targeting TcCYP51. In a 2.08 Å X-ray structure, TcCYP51 is in a conformation that has been influenced by compound 3 and is distinct from the previously characterized ground-state conformation of CYP51 drug-target complexes. That the binding site was modulated in response to an incoming inhibitor for the first time characterizes TcCYP51 as a flexible target rather than a rigid template.	0
Abstract2class: A Defined and Flexible Pocket Explains Aryl Substrate Promiscuity of the Cahuitamycin Starter Unit-Activating Enzyme CahJ Abstract: Cahuitamycins are biofilm inhibitors assembled by a convergent nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway. Previous genetic analysis indicated that a discrete enzyme, CahJ, serves as a gatekeeper for cahuitamycin structural diversification. Here, the CahJ protein was probed structurally and functionally to guide the formation of new analogues by mutasynthetic studies. This analysis enabled the in vivo production of a new cahuitamycin congener through targeted precursor incorporation.	0
Abstract2class: Dorsomorphin inhibits BMP signals required for embryogenesis and iron metabolism Abstract: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals coordinate developmental patterning and have essential physiological roles in mature organisms. Here we describe the first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling in iron-hepcidin homeostasis.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of para- Cyclophane-Containing Hirsutellone Family of Fungal Natural Products Abstract: Hirsutellones are fungal natural products containing a macrocyclic para-cyclophane connected to a decahydrofluorene ring system. We have elucidated the biosynthetic pathway for pyrrocidine B (3) and GKK1032 A2 (4). Two small hypothetical proteins, an oxidoreductase and a lipocalin-like protein, function cooperatively in the oxidative cyclization of the cyclophane, while an additional hypothetical protein in the pyrrocidine pathway catalyzes the exo-specific cycloaddition to form the cis-fused decahydrofluorene.	1
Abstract2class: 5S clavam biosynthetic genes are located in both the clavam and paralog gene clusters in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: The Streptomyces clavuligerus clavam gene cluster was examined to identify genes specifically involved in 5S clavam biosynthesis. A reduction/loss of 5S clavam production was seen in cvm2 and cvm5 gene mutants, and a clavam metabolite not previously observed, 2-carboxymethylideneclavam, accumulated in the cvm5 mutant. Disruption of additional genes from the region of the clavam cluster did not have any effect on 5S clavam production. Examination of the paralog gene cluster region for 5S clavam biosynthetic genes led to the identification of cvm6P and cvm7P, which encode a putative aminotransferase and a transcriptional regulator, respectively. Mutants defective in cvm6P and cvm7P were completely blocked in 5S clavam but not clavulanic acid production. The loss of 5S clavam production in cvm7P mutants suggests that this gene encodes a transcriptional regulator specific for 5S clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Expanding the repertoire of glycosynthases Abstract: As reported in this issue, Moracci and coworkers have now expanded the glycosynthase concept to two retaining alpha-L-fucosidases. The newly generated alpha-fucosynthases can use beta-L-fucosyl azide as donors for transglycosylation, enabling the synthesis of fucose-containing oligosaccharides.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Complex Indole Alkaloids: Elucidation of the Concise Pathway of Okaramines Abstract: The okaramines are a class of complex indole alkaloids isolated from Penicillium and Aspergillus species. Their potent insecticidal activity arises from selectively activating glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) in invertebrates, not affecting human ligand-gated anion channels. Okaramines B (1) and D (2) contain a polycyclic skeleton, including an azocine ring and an unprecedented 2-dimethyl-3-methyl-azetidine ring. Owing to their complex scaffold, okaramines have inspired many total synthesis efforts, but the enzymology of the okaramine biosynthetic pathway remains unexplored. Here, we identified and characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster (oka) of 1 and 2, then elucidated the pathway with target gene inactivation, heterologous reconstitution, and biochemical characterization. Notably, we characterized an α-ketoglutarate-dependent non-heme FeII dioxygenase that forged the azetidine ring on the okaramine skeleton.	1
Abstract2class: Post-polyketide synthase steps in iso-migrastatin biosynthesis, featuring tailoring enzymes with broad substrate specificity Abstract: The iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS) biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 consists of 11 genes, featuring an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK. Systematic inactivation of mgsIJK in S. platensis enabled us to (i) identify two nascent products of the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS, establishing an unprecedented novel feature for AT-less type I PKSs, and (ii) account for the formation of all known post-PKS biosynthetic intermediates generated by the three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK, which possessed significant substrate promiscuities.	1
Abstract2class: Real-time analysis of very late antigen-4 affinity modulation by shear Abstract: Shear promotes endothelial recruitment of leukocytes, cell activation, and transmigration. Mechanical stress on cells caused by shear can induce a rapid integrin conformational change and activation, followed by an increase in binding to the extracellular matrix. The molecular mechanism of increased avidity is unknown. We have shown previously that the affinity of the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), measured with an LDV-containing small molecule, varies with cellular avidity, measured from cell disaggregation rates. In this study, we measured in real time affinity changes of VLA-4 in response to shear. The resulting affinity was comparable with the state mediated by receptor signaling and corresponded in time with intracellular Ca(2+) responses. Ca(2+) ionophores and N,N'-[1,2-ethanediyl-bis(oxy-2,1-phenylene)]bis[N-[2-[(acetyloxy)methoxy]-2-oxoethyl]]-, bis[(acetyloxy)methyl]ester demonstrate that the affinity regulation of VLA-4 in the presence of shear was related to Ca(2+) signaling. Pertussis toxin treatment implicates G(i) in an unknown pathway that connects shear, Ca(2+) elevation, VLA-4 affinity, and cell avidity.	0
Abstract2class: Complexity generation in fungal polyketide biosynthesis: a spirocycle-forming P450 in the concise pathway to the antifungal drug griseofulvin Abstract: Griseofulvin (1) is a spirocyclic fungal natural product used in treatment of fungal dermatophytes. Formation of the spirocycle, or the grisan scaffold, from a benzophenone precursor is critical for the activity of 1. In this study, we have systematically characterized each of the biosynthetic enzymes related to the biogenesis of 1, including the characterization of a new polyketide synthase GsfA that synthesizes the benzophenone precursor and a cytochrome P450 GsfF that performs oxidative coupling between the orcinol and the phloroglucinol rings to yield the grisan structure. Notably, the finding of GsfF is in sharp contrast to the copper-dependent dihydrogeodin oxidase that performs a similar reaction in the geodin biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic knowledge enabled the in vitro total biosynthesis of 1 from malonyl-CoA using all purified enzyme components. This work therefore completely maps out the previously unresolved enzymology of the biosynthesis of a therapeutically relevant natural product.	1
Abstract2class: Development and application of a rapid all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system for iterative genome editing in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Background:                       Bacillus subtilis, an important industrial microorganism, is commonly used in the production of industrial enzymes. Genome modification is often necessary to improve the production performance of cell. The dual-plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system suitable for iterative genome editing has been applied in Bacillus subtilis. However, it is limited by the selection of knockout genes, long editing cycle and instability.                  Results:                       To address these problems, we constructed an all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system, which was suitable for iterative genome editing of B. subtilis. The PEG4000-assisted monomer plasmid ligation (PAMPL) method greatly improved the transformation efficiency of B. subtilis SCK6. Self-targeting sgRNArep transcription was tightly controlled by rigorous promoter PacoR, which could induce the elimination of plasmids after genome editing and prepare for next round of genome editing. Our system achieved 100% efficiency for single gene deletions and point mutations, 96% efficiency for gene insertions, and at least 90% efficiency for plasmid curing. As a proof of concept, two extracellular protease genes epr and bpr were continuously knocked out using this system, and it only took 2.5 days to complete one round of genome editing. The engineering strain was used to express Douchi fibrinolytic enzyme DFE27, and its extracellular enzyme activity reached 159.5 FU/mL.                  Conclusions:                       We developed and applied a rapid all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system for iterative genome editing in B. subtilis, which required only one plasmid transformation and curing, and accelerated the cycle of genome editing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rapidest iterative genome editing system for B. subtilis. We hope that the system can be used to reconstruct the B. subtilis cell factory for the production of various biological molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Chemical Protein Ubiquitylation with Preservation of the Native Cysteine Residues Abstract: We report a cysteine-based ligation strategy for generating a monoubiquitylated protein while preserving the native cysteine residues on the acceptor protein. In monoubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) this method circumvents the need to mutate the native cysteine residues on PCNA. The chemically ubiquitylated PCNA contains a noncleavable linkage of the same length as the native isopeptide linkage. It also retains the normal function of the native Ub-PCNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of replication factor C (RFC) and lesion bypass synthesis by Polη. This method may be adapted for chemical ubiquitylation of other proteins and for site-specific modification of a target protein at a specific site through sulfhydryl chemistry.	0
Abstract2class: Antitumor effect of kazusamycin B on experimental tumors Abstract: Kazusamycin B, a novel antibiotic (MW 542) isolated from fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp. No. 81-484 showed a broad antitumor spectrum both in vitro and in vivo. IC50 against the growth of tumor cells was around 1 ng/ml at 72 hours-exposure in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of the antibiotic was effective in inhibiting the growth of murine tumors, S180, P388, EL-4, and B16. It was also active against doxorubicin-resistant P388, hepatic metastases of L5178Y-ML, pulmonary metastases of 3LL, and human mammary cancer MX-1 xenografted to nude mice. However, the activity of kazusamycin B toward L1210 or human lung cancer LX-1 was weaker. According to the results of comparative studies on the effect of kazusamycins B and A, an analog of B, there seemed to be no significant difference in their effectiveness. The effective dose range and toxicity were markedly dependent on tumor lines tested and the regimen used. Maximum tolerated dose in mice with subcutaneous tumors was much higher than that in mice bearing ascitic leukemia as P388. Although intermittent administration could greatly reduce the cumulative toxicity of the drug, therapeutic effect was similar with both successive and intermittent administration schedules.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering bacterial transcription regulation to create a synthetic in vitro two-hybrid system for protein interaction assays Abstract: Transcriptional activation of σ(54)-RNA polymerase holoenzyme (σ(54)-RNAP) in bacteria is dependent on a cis-acting DNA element (bacterial enhancer), which recruits the bacterial enhancer-binding protein to contact the holoenzyme via DNA looping. Using a constructive synthetic biology approach, we recapitulated such process of transcriptional activation by recruitment in a reconstituted cell-free system, assembled entirely from a defined number of purified components. We further engineered the bacterial enhancer-binding protein PspF to create an in vitro two-hybrid system (IVT2H), capable of carrying out gene regulation in response to expressed protein interactions. Compared with genetic systems and other in vitro methods, IVT2H not only allows detection of different types of protein interactions in just a few hours without involving cells but also provides a general correlation of the relative binding strength of the protein interaction with the IVT2H signal. Due to its reconstituted nature, IVT2H provides a biochemical assay platform with a clean and defined background. We demonstrated the proof-of-concept of using IVT2H as an alternative assay for high throughput screening of small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interaction.	0
Abstract2class: Urdamycins, new angucycline antibiotics from Streptomyces fradiae. IV. Biosynthetic studies of urdamycins A-D Abstract: The biogenetic origin of the angucycline antibiotics urdamycins A-D was studied by feeding experiments with isotope labeled precursors and by NMR analysis. Feeding experiments with [1-13C]acetate and [1,2-13C2]acetate show that the chromophores of urdamycins A and B and the angucycline 4-ring skeleton of the urdamycins C and D chromophores are formed from a single decapolyketide chain. The chromophores of the urdamycins C and D contain additional structural elements which derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. The latter was shown by feeding deuterium-labeled tyrosine and 13C-labeled tryptophan derivatives. Feeding of [1-13C]glucose and of [U-13C3]glycerol proved that the C-glycosidic moiety and the three sugars (2 x L-rhodinose, 1 x D-olivose each) of the urdamycins arise from glucose. Experiments with 14C-labeled urdamycin A, obtained by biosynthesis from [14C]acetate, showed this compound to be a late precursor of the urdamycins C and D.	1
Abstract2class: Comparative Analysis of Extremely Thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor Species Reveals Common and Unique Cellular Strategies for Plant Biomass Utilization Abstract: Microbiological, genomic and transcriptomic analyses were used to examine three species from the bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor with respect to their capacity to convert the carbohydrate content of lignocellulosic biomass at 70°C to simple sugars, acetate, lactate, CO2, and H2. Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. saccharolyticus solubilized 38%, 36%, and 29% (by weight) of unpretreated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (5 g/liter), respectively, which was about half of the amount of crystalline cellulose (Avicel; 5 g/liter) that was solubilized under the same conditions. The lower yields with C. saccharolyticus, not appreciably greater than the thermal control for switchgrass, were unexpected, given that its genome encodes the same glycoside hydrolase 9 (GH9)-GH48 multidomain cellulase (CelA) found in the other two species. However, the genome of C. saccharolyticus lacks two other cellulases with GH48 domains, which could be responsible for its lower levels of solubilization. Transcriptomes for growth of each species comparing cellulose to switchgrass showed that many carbohydrate ABC transporters and multidomain extracellular glycoside hydrolases were differentially regulated, reflecting the heterogeneity of lignocellulose. However, significant differences in transcription levels for conserved genes among the three species were noted, indicating unexpectedly diverse regulatory strategies for deconstruction for these closely related bacteria. Genes encoding the Che-type chemotaxis system and flagellum biosynthesis were upregulated in C. kronotskyensis and C. bescii during growth on cellulose, implicating motility in substrate utilization. The results here show that capacity for plant biomass deconstruction varies across Caldicellulosiruptor species and depends in a complex way on GH genome inventory, substrate composition, and gene regulation.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic characterization and biochemical features of the third natural nisin variant, nisin Q, produced by Lactococcus lactis 61-14 Abstract: Aims:                       To characterize the genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q.                  Methods and results:                       The nisin Q gene cluster was sequenced, and 11 putative orfs having 82% homology with the nisin A biosynthesis gene cluster were identified. Nisin Q production was confirmed from the nisQ-introduced nisin Z producer. In the reporter assay, nisin Q exhibited an induction level that was threefold lower than that of nisin A. Nisin Q demonstrated an antimicrobial spectrum similar to those of the other nisins. Under oxidizing conditions, nisin Q retained a higher level of activity than nisin A. This higher oxidative tolerance could be attributed to the presence of only one methionine residue in nisin Q, in contrast to other nisins that contain two.                  Conclusions:                       The 11 orfs of the nisin producers were identical with regard to their functions. The antimicrobial spectra of the three natural nisins were similar. Nisin Q demonstrated higher oxidative tolerance than nisin A.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q are similar to those of other variants. Moreover, owing to its higher oxidative tolerance, nisin Q is a potential alternative for nisin A.	1
Abstract2class: The stress response protein Gls24 is induced by copper and interacts with the CopZ copper chaperone of Enterococcus hirae Abstract: Intracellular copper routing in Enterococcus hirae is accomplished by the CopZ copper chaperone. Under copper stress, CopZ donates Cu(+) to the CopY repressor, thereby releasing its bound zinc and abolishing repressor-DNA interaction. This in turn induces the expression of the cop operon, which encodes CopY and CopZ, in addition to two copper ATPases, CopA and CopB. To gain further insight into the function of CopZ, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins interacting with the copper chaperone. This led to the identification of Gls24, a member of a family of stress response proteins. Gls24 is part of an operon containing eight genes. The operon was induced by a range of stress conditions, but most notably by copper. Gls24 was overexpressed and purified, and was shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis to also interact with CopZ in vitro. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that Gls24 is partially unstructured. The current findings establish a novel link between Gls24 and copper homeostasis.	0
Abstract2class: Rational design of modular polyketide synthases: morphing the aureothin pathway into a luteoreticulin assembly line Abstract: The unusual nitro-substituted polyketides aureothin, neoaureothin (spectinabilin), and luteoreticulin, which are produced by diverse Streptomyces species, point to a joint evolution. Through rational genetic recombination and domain exchanges we have successfully reprogrammed the modular (type I) aur polyketide synthase (PKS) into a synthase that generates luteoreticulin. This is the first rational transformation of a modular PKS to produce a complex polyketide that was initially isolated from a different bacterium. A unique aspect of this synthetic biology approach is that we exclusively used genes from a single biosynthesis gene cluster to design the artificial pathway, an avenue that likely emulates natural evolutionary processes. Furthermore, an unexpected, context-dependent switch in the regiospecificity of a pyrone methyl transferase was observed. We also describe an unprecedented scenario where an AT domain iteratively loads an extender unit onto the cognate ACP and the downstream ACP. This aberrant function is a novel case of non-colinear behavior of PKS domains.	1
Abstract2class: A blaVEB-1 variant, blaVEB-6, associated with repeated elements in a complex genetic structure Abstract: bla(VEB-6) was found on the Proteus mirabilis chromosome in a context similar to those of bla(VEB-1a) and bla(VEB-1b), in a truncated gene cassette flanked by 135-bp elements and duplications of the 3'-conserved segment of class 1 integrons. A linked aacA4-aadB-dfrA1-orfC cassette array includes components of Tn1331, illustrating the complex mosaicism of multiresistance regions.	0
Abstract2class: Expression and purification of the 5'-nucleotidase YitU from Bacillus species: its enzymatic properties and possible applications in biotechnology Abstract: 5'-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides plus phosphate. In the present study, to search for new genes encoding 5'-nucleotidases specific for purine nucleotides in industrially important Bacillus species, "shotgun" cloning and the direct selection of recombinant clones grown in purine nucleosides at inhibitory concentrations were performed in the Escherichia coli GS72 strain, which is sensitive to these compounds. As a result, orthologous yitU genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, whose products belong to the ubiquitous haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF), were selected and found to have a high sequence similarity of 87%. B. subtilis YitU was produced in E. coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein, purified and biochemically characterized as a soluble 5'-nucleotidase with broad substrate specificity with respect to various deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside monophosphates: dAMP, GMP, dGMP, CMP, AMP, XMP, IMP and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (AICAR-P). However, the preferred substrate for recombinant YitU was shown to be flavin mononucleotide (FMN). B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens yitU overexpression increased riboflavin (RF) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) accumulation and can be applied to breed highly performing RF- and AICAR-producing strains.	0
Abstract2class: The biosynthetic gene cluster of zorbamycin, a member of the bleomycin family of antitumor antibiotics, from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC 21892 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotic zorbamycin (ZBM) was cloned by screening a cosmid library of Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC 21892. Sequence analysis revealed 40 ORFs belonging to the ZBM biosynthetic gene cluster. However, only 23 and 22 ORFs showed striking similarities to the biosynthetic gene clusters for the bleomycins (BLMs) and tallysomycins (TLMs), respectively; the remaining ORFs do not show significant homology to ORFs from the related BLM and TLM clusters. The ZBM gene cluster consists of 16 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding eight complete NRPS modules, three incomplete didomain NRPS modules, and eight freestanding single NRPS domains or associated enzymes, a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one PKS module, six sugar biosynthesis genes, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis and resistance proteins. A genetic system using Escherichia coli-Streptomyces flavoviridis intergeneric conjugation was developed to enable ZBM gene cluster boundary determinations and biosynthetic pathway manipulations.	1
Abstract2class: Enzymatic Reconstitution and Biosynthetic Investigation of the Lasso Peptide Fusilassin Abstract: Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural product which possess a unique lariat knot conformation. The low entropy "threaded" conformation endows lasso peptides with considerable resistance to heat and proteolytic degradation, which are attractive properties for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. Despite their discovery nearly 30 years ago, the molecular mechanism underlying lasso peptide biosynthesis remains poorly characterized due to the low stability of the purified biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we report the biosynthetic reconstitution of a lasso peptide derived from Thermobifida fusca, termed fusilassin. Beyond robust catalytic activity, the fusilassin enzymes demonstrate extraordinary substrate tolerance during heterologous expression in E. coli and upon purification in cell-free biosynthetic reconstitution reactions. We provide evidence that the fusilassin biosynthetic enzymes are not capable of forming branched-cyclic products but can produce entirely unrelated lasso peptides. Finally, we leveraged our bioinformatic survey of all lasso peptides identified in GenBank to perform coevolutionary analysis of two requisite biosynthetic proteins. This effort correctly identified residues governing an important protein-protein interaction, illustrating how genomic insight can accelerate the characterization of natural product biosynthetic pathways. The fusilassin enzymes described within represent a model system for both designing future lasso peptides of biomedical importance and also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern lasso peptide biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: RNA-guided nucleotide modification of ribosomal and non-ribosomal RNAs in Archaea Abstract: Archaea use ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machines similar to those found in the eukaryotic nucleolus to methylate ribose residues in nascent ribosomal RNA. The archaeal complex required for this 2'-O-ribose-methylation consists of the C/D box sRNA guide and three proteins, the core RNA-binding aL7a protein, the aNop56 protein and the methyltransferase aFib protein. These RNP machines were reconstituted in vitro from purified recombinant components, and shown to have methylation activity when provided with a simple target oligonucleotide, complementary to the sRNA guide sequence. To obtain a better understanding of the versatility and specificity of this reaction, the activity of reconstituted particles on more complex target substrates, including 5S RNA, tRNA(Gln) and 'double target' oligonucleotides that exhibit either direct or reverse complementarity to both the D' and D box guides, has been examined. The natural 5S and tRNA(Gln) substrates were efficiently methylated in vitro, as long as the complementarity between guide and target was about 10 base pairs in length, and lacked mismatches. Maximal activity of double guide sRNAs required that both methylation sites be present in cis on the target RNA.	0
Abstract2class: A novel lantibiotic acting on bacterial cell wall synthesis produced by the uncommon actinomycete Planomonospora sp Abstract: Important classes of antibiotics acting on bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, such as beta-lactams and glycopeptides, are used extensively in therapy and are now faced with a challenge because of the progressive spread of resistant pathogens. A discovery program was devised to target novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors capable of overcoming these resistance mechanisms. The microbial products were first screened according to their differential activity against Staphylococcus aureus and its L-form. Then, activities insensitive to the addition of a beta-lactamase cocktail or d-alanyl-d-alanine affinity resin were selected. Thirty-five lantibiotics were identified from a library of broth extracts produced by 40,000 uncommon actinomycetes. Five of them showed structural characteristics that did not match with any known microbial metabolite. In this study, we report on the production, structure determination, and biological activity of one of these novel lantibiotics, namely, planosporicin, which is produced by the uncommon actinomycete Planomonospora sp. Planosporicin is a 2194 Da polypeptide originating from 24 proteinogenic amino acids. It contains lanthionine and methyllanthionine amino acids generating five intramolecular thioether bridges. Planosporicin selectively blocks peptidoglycan biosynthesis and causes accumulation of UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors in growing bacterial cells. On the basis of its mode of action and globular structure, planosporicin can be assigned to the mersacidin (20 amino acids, 1825 Da) and the actagardine (19 amino acids, 1890 Da) subgroup of type B lantibiotics. Considering its spectrum of activity against Gram-positive pathogens of medical importance, including multi-resistant clinical isolates, and its efficacy in vivo, planosporicin represents a potentially new antibiotic to treat emerging pathogens.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of fusarubins accounts for pigmentation of Fusarium fujikuroi perithecia Abstract: Fusarium fujikuroi produces a variety of secondary metabolites, of which polyketides form the most diverse group. Among these are the highly pigmented naphthoquinones, which have been shown to possess different functional properties for the fungus. A group of naphthoquinones, polyketides related to fusarubin, were identified in Fusarium spp. more than 60 years ago, but neither the genes responsible for their formation nor their biological function has been discovered to date. In addition, although it is known that the sexual fruiting bodies in which the progeny of the fungus develops are darkly colored by a polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived pigment, the structure of this pigment has never been elucidated. Here we present data that link the fusarubin-type polyketides to a defined gene cluster, which we designate fsr, and demonstrate that the fusarubins are the pigments responsible for the coloration of the perithecia. We studied their regulation and the function of the single genes within the cluster by a combination of gene replacements and overexpression of the PKS-encoding gene, and we present a model for the biosynthetic pathway of the fusarubins based on these data.	1
Abstract2class: Structure elucidation and biosynthesis of fuscachelins, peptide siderophores from the moderate thermophile Thermobifida fusca Abstract: Bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales have proven to be an important source of biologically active and often therapeutically useful natural products. The characterization of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters is an emerging and valuable approach to the discovery of novel small molecules. Analysis of the recently sequenced genome of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermobifida fusca revealed an orphan nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster coding for an unknown siderophore natural product. T. fusca is a model organism for the study of thermostable cellulases and is a major degrader of plant cell walls. Here, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of the fuscachelins, siderophore natural products produced by T. fusca. In addition, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of the termination module of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Biochemical analysis of adenylation domain specificity supports the assignment of this gene cluster as the producer of the fuscachelin siderophores. The proposed nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathway exhibits several atypical features, including a macrocyclizing thioesterase that produces a 10-membered cyclic depsipeptide and a nonlinear assembly line, resulting in the unique heterodimeric architecture of the siderophore natural product.	1
Abstract2class: SseA acts as the chaperone for the SseB component of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 translocon Abstract: The Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) shown to be critical for adaptation to the intracellular environment within both phagocytic and epithelial cell types. Within SPI2, the Effector region encodes several exported proteins that comprise the SPI2 translocon (SseB, C, D). SseA is the first protein encoded within the Effector region but remains an unclassified factor that is essential for SPI2 function. In the present study, we determined that SseA shares several features with TTSS chaperones: it is small (12.5 kDa), located directly upstream of a TTSS export target (SseB), and contains an amphipathic, C-terminal alpha-helix. Construction and analysis of a DeltasseA mutant demonstrated that the total amount of SseB is significantly reduced and SPI2 export of SseB to the bacterial surface is prevented. SseB accumulation and export were restored when SseA was provided in trans. Loss of SseA does not cause a generalized defect in SPI2 secretory function as export of SseC, encoded downstream of SseB, still occurs in the DeltasseA strain. Quantitative PCR indicates that the loss of SseB in DeltasseA does not occur at the transcriptional level. Co-purification studies demonstrate that SseA directly binds to SseB. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SseA functions as a TTSS chaperone for the SPI2 translocon component, SseB.	0
Abstract2class: Genome-wide analysis of Candida albicans gene expression patterns during infection of the mammalian kidney Abstract: Global analysis of the molecular responses of microbial pathogens to their mammalian hosts represents a major challenge. To date few microarray studies have been performed on Candida albicans cells derived from infected tissues. In this study we examined the C. albicans SC5314 transcriptome from renal infections in the rabbit. Genes involved in adhesion, stress adaptation and the assimilation of alternative carbon sources were up-regulated in these cells compared with control cells grown in RPMI 1640, whereas genes involved in morphogenesis, fermentation and translation were down-regulated. When we compared the congenic virulent C. albicans strains NGY152 and SC5314, there was minimal overlap between their transcriptomes during kidney infections. This suggests that much of the gene regulation observed during infections is not essential for virulence. Indeed, we observed a poor correlation between the transcriptome and phenome for those genes that were regulated during kidney infection and that have been virulence tested.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, biochemical characterization of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase (GerKI) from Streptomyces sp. KCTC 0041BP Abstract: dTDP-6-deoxy-d-allose, an unusual deoxysugar, has been identified as an intermediate in the mycinose biosynthetic pathway of several macrolide antibiotics. In order to characterize the biosynthesis of this deoxysugar, we have cloned and heterologously overexpressed gerK1 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. This gene encodes for a protein with the putative function of a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase, which appears to be involved in the dihydrochalcomycin (GERI-155) biosynthesis evidenced by Streptomyces sp KCTC 0041BP. Our results revealed that GerK1 exhibited a specific reductive effect on the 4-keto carbon of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-allose, with the hydroxyl group in an axial configuration at the C3 position only. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose to dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, according to the results of an in vitro coupled enzyme assay, in the presence of GerF (dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose 3-epimerase). The product was isolated, and its stereochemistry was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.	1
Abstract2class: The lipopeptide antibiotic A54145 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Ca(2+)-dependent cyclic lipodepsipeptides are an emerging class of antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. These compounds are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complexes encoded by large gene clusters. The gene cluster encoding biosynthetic pathway enzymes for the Streptomyces fradiae A54145 NRP was cloned from a cosmid library and characterized. Four NRPS-encoding genes, responsible for subunits of the synthetase, as well as genes for accessory functions such as acylation, methylation and hydroxylation, were identified by sequence analysis in a 127 kb region of DNA that appears to be located subterminally in the bacterial chromosome. Deduced epimerase domain-encoding sequences within the NRPS genes indicated a D: -stereochemistry for Glu, Lys and Asn residues, as observed for positionally analogous residues in two related compounds, daptomycin, and the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) produced by Streptomyces roseosporus and Streptomyces coelicolor, respectively. A comparison of the structure and the biosynthetic gene cluster of A54145 with those of the related peptides showed many similarities. This information may contribute to the design of experiments to address both fundamental and applied questions in lipopeptide biosynthesis, engineering and drug development.	1
Abstract2class: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, produced by Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. I. Taxonomy, production, isolation, physico-chemical properties and biological activities Abstract: Benastatins have been isolated as part of a program designed to find microorganism-produced inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase from Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. They were purified by chromatography of reversed-phase silica gel, silica gel and Capcell Pak C18 (HPLC) followed by solvent extraction and then isolated as yellow powders. Benastatins A and B have the molecular formulae, C30H28O7 and C30H30O7, respectively. They were competitive with 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene as the substrate, and the inhibition constants (Ki) of benastatins A and B were 5.0 x 10(-6) and 3.7 x 10(-6), respectively.	1
Abstract2class: Association of a Mr 50,000 cap-binding protein with the cytoskeleton in baby hamster kidney cells Abstract: A monoclonal antibody directed against eukaryotic mRNA 5'-cap-binding protein (anti-CBP antibody) was used to localize cap-binding protein (CBP) in BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. It was found that the antibody reacts with a fibrous network extending through the cytoplasm in a radial arrangement. The network behaves like intermediate filaments in colchicine-treated cells, suggesting a direct or indirect linkage of CBP with intermediate filaments. The association of CBP with a cytoskeletal element was further confirmed by isolation of proteins from Triton X-100-extracted cells and identification of CBP in the cytoskeletal fraction with anti-CBP antibody. The major polypeptide reacting with anti-CBP antibody is a Mr 50,000 component. Tryptic peptide mapping showed that this polypeptide is related to a Mr 24,000 polypeptide identified as CBP in earlier experiments [Sonenberg, N., Morgan, M. A., Testa, D., Colonna, R. J. & Shatkin, A. J. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 4843-4847].	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the lacticin 481 operon: the Lactococcus lactis genes lctF, lctE, and lctG encode a putative ABC transporter involved in bacteriocin immunity Abstract: The lantibiotic lacticin 481 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis strains. The genetic determinants of lacticin 481 production are organized as an operon encoded by a 70-kb plasmid. We previously reported the first three genes of this operon, lctA, lctM, and lctT, which are involved in the bacteriocin biosynthesis and export (A. Rincé, A. Dufour, S. Le Pogam, D. Thuault, C. M. Bourgeois, and J.-P. Le Pennec, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:1652-1657, 1994). The operon contains three additional open reading frames: lctF, lctE, and lctG. The hydrophobicity profiles and sequence similarities strongly suggest that the three gene products associate to form an ABC transporter. When the three genes were coexpressed into a lacticin 481-sensitive L. lactis strain, the strain became resistant to the bacteriocin. This protection could not be obtained when any of the three genes was deleted, confirming that lctF, lctE, and lctG are all necessary to provide immunity to lacticin 481. The quantification of the levels of immunity showed that lctF, lctE, and lctG could account for at least 6% and up to 100% of the immunity of the wild-type lacticin 481 producer strain, depending on the gene expression regulation. The lacticin 481 biosynthesis and immunity systems are discussed and compared to other lantibiotic systems.	1
Abstract2class: Selective removal of aberrant extender units by a type II thioesterase for efficient FR-008/candicidin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. strain FR-008 Abstract: Gene fscTE, encoding a putative type II thioesterase (TEII), was associated with the FR-008/candicidin gene cluster. Deletion of fscTE reduced approximately 90% of the FR-008/candicidin production, while the production level was well restored when fscTE was added back to the mutant in trans. FscTE was unable to compensate for the release of the maturely elongated polyketide as site-directed inactivation of the type I thioesterase (TEI) totally abolished FR-008/candicidin production. Direct biochemical analysis of FscTE in parallel with its homologue TylO from the tylosin biosynthetic pathway demonstrated their remarkable preferences for acyl-thioesters (i.e., propionyl-S-N-acetylcysteamine [SNAC] over methylmalonyl-SNAC and acetyl-SNAC over malonyl-SNAC) and thus concluded that TEII could maintain effective polyketide biosynthesis by selectively removing the nonelongatable residues bound to acyl carrier proteins. Overexpression of FscTE under the strong constitutive ermE*p promoter in the wild-type strain did not suppress FR-008/candicidin formation, which confirmed its substrate specificity in vivo. Furthermore, successful complementation of the fscTE mutant was obtained with fscTE and tylO, whereas no complementation was detected with nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) TEII tycF and srfAD, reflecting substrate specificities of TEIIs distinctive from those of either polyketide synthases or NRPSs.	0
Abstract2class: Systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro synergy of polymyxins and carbapenems Abstract: Our objective was to examine the evidence of in vitro synergy of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. All studies examining in vitro interactions of antibiotic combinations consisting of any carbapenem with colistin or polymyxin B against any GNB were used. A broad search was conducted with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. Synergy rates, defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index of ≤0.5 or a >2-log reduction in CFU, were pooled separately for time-kill, checkerboard, and Etest methods in a mixed-effect meta-analysis of rates. We examined whether the synergy rate depended on the testing method, type of antibiotic, bacteria, and resistance to carbapenems. Pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown. Thirty-nine published studies and 15 conference proceeding were included, reporting on 246 different tests on 1,054 bacterial isolates. In time-kill studies, combination therapy showed synergy rates of 77% (95% CI, 64 to 87%) for Acinetobacter baumannii, 44% (95% CI, 30 to 59%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 50% (95% CI, 30 to 69%) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with low antagonism rates for all. Doripenem showed high synergy rates for all three bacteria. For A. baumannii, meropenem was more synergistic than imipenem, whereas for P. aeruginosa the opposite was true. Checkerboard and Etest studies generally reported lower synergy rates than time-kill studies. The use of combination therapy led to less resistance development in vitro. The combination of a carbapenem with a polymyxin against GNB, especially A. baumannii, is supported in vitro by high synergy rates, with low antagonism and less resistance development. These findings should be examined in clinical studies.	0
Abstract2class: The Pax-5 gene is alternatively spliced during B-cell development Abstract: The transcription factor Pax-5 is expressed during the early stages of B-cell differentiation and influences the expression of several B-cell-specific genes. In addition to the existing isoform (Pax-5, which we have named Pax-5a), we have isolated three new isoforms, Pax-5b, Pax-5d, and Pax-5e, from murine spleen and B-lymphoid cell lines using library screenings and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Isoforms Pax-5b and Pax-5e have spliced out their second exon, resulting in proteins with only a partial DNA-binding domain. Isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e have deleted the 3'-region, which encodes the transactivating domain, and replaced it with a novel sequence. The existence of alternative Pax-5 transcripts was confirmed using RNase protection assays. Furthermore, Pax-5a and Pax-5b proteins were detected using Western blot analysis. Pax-5a was detectable in pro-, pre-, and mature B-cell lines, but not in two plasmacytomas; Pax-5b was shown to be present at low levels in mature B-cell lines and, unexpectedly, in one plasma cell line, but not in pro-B-cell or T-cell lines. Mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated Pax-5a and Pax-5d, but not Pax-5b or Pax-5e, could interact with a B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site on the blk promoter. Using this assay, we also showed that Pax-5d was present in nuclear extracts of some (but not all) B-lymphoid lines and interacts with the B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site. The pattern of differential expression of alternatively spliced Pax-5 isoforms suggests that they may be important regulators of transcription during B-cell maturation.	0
Abstract2class: Purine metabolite inosine is an adrenergic neurotrophic substance for cultured chicken sympathetic neurons Abstract: Purines are ubiquitous endogenous cellular metabolites that have been postulated as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the nervous system. Recently, we showed that a low-molecular-mass component present in liver-conditioned medium selectively enhances the adrenergic properties of dissociated chicken sympathetic neurons in culture. We report here that this substance is inosine, a purine metabolite. Indeed, analysis of the low-molecular-mass fraction of liver-conditioned medium by HPLC shows that the neurotrophic activity coelutes with and has the same absorption spectrum as inosine. Inosine increases incorporation of [3H]leucine into neuronal protein and stimulates catecholamine, but not acetylcholine, production by the sympathetic neurons in a dose-dependent fashion (half-maximal stimulation at 10(-6) M). This effect can be blocked by 5 x 10(-6) M dipyridamole, an inhibitor of nucleoside transport. Inosine therefore appears to be capable of modulating adrenergic phenotypic expression in cultured sympathetic neurons by acting via an as-yet-unknown intracellular pathway.	0
Abstract2class: Prevalence and abundance of uncultivated Megasphaera-like bacteria in the human vaginal environment Abstract: Cultivation-independent analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in vaginal samples revealed two previously unrecognized, uncultivated Megasphaera-like phylotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and environmental distribution suggest that these Megasphaera types may be unique to the vaginal environment.

Abstract2class: Rufomycins or Ilamycins: Naming Clarifications and Definitive Structural Assignments Abstract: Rufomycin and ilamycin are synonymous for the same class of cyclopeptides, currently encompassing 33 structurally characterized isolates and 9 semisynthetic derivatives. Elucidation of new structures prioritized the consolidation of the names and established the structures of four diastereoisomeric rufomycins with a 2-piperidinone, named rufomycins 4-7, including full 1H/13C NMR assignments. The characteristic HSQC cross-peak for the CH-5, the hemiaminal carbon in amino acid #5, allows assignment of the stereocenters C-4 and C-5 within this ring. Semisynthetic derivatives (rufomycinSS 1, 2, and 3) were prepared from a rufomycins 4 and 6 mixture to validate the structural assignments. Based on the X-ray crystal structures of rufomycins 2 and 4, considering the NMR differences of rufomycins 7 vs 4-6 compared to rufomycinSS 1 vs 2 and 3, and taking into account that two major conformers, A and B, occur in both rufomycinSS 2 and 3, structural modeling was pursued. Collectively, this paper discusses the NMR spectroscopic differences of the stereoisomers and their possible 3D conformers and correlates these with the anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity. In addition, a look at the history prioritizes names and numbering schemes for this group of antibiotics and leads to consolidated nomenclature for all currently known members, natural and semisynthetic derivatives, and serves to accommodate future discoveries.	0
Abstract2class: tRNA-Dependent Aminoacylation of an Amino Sugar Intermediate in the Biosynthesis of a Streptothricin-Related Antibiotic Abstract: The antibiotic streptothricin (ST) possesses an amino sugar bound to an l-β-lysine (β-Lys) residue via a peptide bond. The peptide bond formation has been shown to be catalyzed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) during ST biosynthesis. The focus of this study is the closely related ST analogue BD-12, which carries a glycine-derived side chain rather than a β-Lys residue. Here, in Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC13826, we describe our biosynthetic studies of BD-12, which revealed that the peptide bond between the amino sugar and the glycine residue is catalyzed by a Fem-like enzyme (Orf11) in a tRNA-dependent manner rather than by an NRPS. Although there have been several reports of peptide bond-forming tRNA-dependent enzymes, to our knowledge, Orf11 is the first enzyme that can accept an amino sugar as a substrate. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the structural diversity of the side chains of ST-type compounds in nature is generated in an unusual manner via two distinct peptide bond-forming mechanisms. Moreover, the identification and functional analysis of Orf11 resulted in not only the production of new ST-related compounds, but also the provision of new insights into the structure-activity relationship of the ST-related antibiotics.                  Importance:                       The antibiotic streptothricin (ST) possesses an amino sugar bound to an l-β-lysine (β-Lys) side chain via a peptide bond formed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). BD-12, an analogue of ST, carries a glycine-derived side chain rather than β-Lys, and here, we describe the BD-12-biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC13826, which contains the orf11 gene encoding a novel tRNA-dependent peptide bond-forming enzyme. The unique Fem-like enzyme (Orf11) accepts the amino sugar as a substrate and mediates the peptide formation between the amino sugar intermediate and glycine. Our studies demonstrate that the structural diversity of the side chains of ST-related compounds in nature is generated via two distinct peptide bond-forming mechanisms.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of diterpene aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha Abstract: The fungal diterpene, aphidicolin, is a well-known specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. Terpenoids are an important class of natural products. However, identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster in terpenoids is relatively rare compared with another important class of natural products, polyketides. To explore a reliable identification method for the biosynthetic gene cluster in fungal diterpenoids, cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster of aphidicolin was employed. The application of a simple PCR method for genome walking based on the sequence of cDNA encoding aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase (ACS) allowed us to analyze a 15.6-kb region of the Phoma betae genomic DNA. Six ORFs, PbGGS, ACS, PbP450-1, PbP450-2, PbTP, and PbTF were found in this region, and respectively expected to encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, diterpene synthase, two cytochrome P-450s, the transporter and transcription factor. Their amino acid sequences and introns were deduced by a corresponding cDNA analysis. This study shows that simple PCR-based genome walking without constructing a genomic DNA library is useful for identification of a small gene cluster. We propose a general strategy for the cloning the biosynthetic genes of fungal diterpenoids by using fungal GGS.	1
Abstract2class: Regulation of the expression level of transcription factor XylS reveals new functional insight into its induction mechanism at the Pm promoter Abstract: Background:                       XylS is the positive regulator of the inducible Pm promoter, originating from Pseudomonas putida, where the system controls a biochemical pathway involved in degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which also act as inducers. The XylS/Pm positive regulator/promoter system is used for recombinant gene expression and the output from Pm is known to be sensitive to the intracellular XylS concentration.                  Results:                       By constructing a synthetic operon consisting of xylS and luc, the gene encoding luciferase, relative XylS expression levels could be monitored indirectly at physiological concentrations. Expression of XylS from inducible promoters allowed control over a more than 800-fold range, however, the corresponding output from Pm covered only an about five-fold range. The maximum output from Pm could not be increased by introducing more copies of the promoter in the cells. Interestingly, a previously reported XylS variant (StEP-13), known to strongly stimulate expression from Pm, caused the same maximum activity from Pm as wild-type XylS at high XylS expression levels. Under uninduced conditions expression from Pm also increased as a function of XylS expression levels, and at very high concentrations the maximum activity from Pm was the same as in the presence of inducer.                  Conclusion:                       According to our proposed model, which is in agreement with current knowledge, the regulator, XylS, can exist in three states: monomers, dimers, and aggregates. Only the dimers are active and able to induce expression from Pm. Their maximum intracellular concentration and the corresponding output from Pm are limited by the concentration-dependent conversion into inactive aggregates. Maximization of the induction ratio at Pm can be obtained by expression of XylS at the level where aggregation occurs, which might be exploited for recombinant gene expression. The results described here also indicate that there might exist variants of XylS which can exist at higher active dimer concentrations and thus lead to increased expression levels from Pm.	0
Abstract2class: Genome sequences of two novel phages infecting marine roseobacters Abstract: Two bacteriophages, DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1, which infect marine roseobacters Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 and Sulfitobacter sp. EE-36, respectively, were isolated from Baltimore Inner Harbor water. These two roseophages resemble bacteriophage N4, a large, short-tailed phage infecting Escherichia coli K12, in terms of their morphology and genomic structure. The full genome sequences of DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1 reveal that their genome sizes are 74.6 and 73.3 kb, respectively, and they both contain a highly conserved N4-like DNA replication and transcription system. Both roseophages contain a large virion-encapsidated RNA polymerase gene (> 10 kb), which was first discovered in N4. DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1 also possess several genes (i.e. ribonucleotide reductase and thioredoxin) that are most similar to the genes in roseobacters. Overall, the two roseophages are highly closely related, and share 80-94% nucleotide sequence identity over 85% of their ORFs. This is the first report of N4-like phages infecting marine bacteria and the second report of N4-like phage since the discovery of phage N4 40 years ago. The finding of these two N4-like roseophages will allow us to further explore the specific phage-host interaction and evolution for this unique group of bacteriophages.	0
Abstract2class: Effective one-pot multienzyme (OPME) synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides and other sialosides containing 4-O-acetyl sialic acid Abstract: A facile one-pot two-enzyme chemoenzymatic approach has been established for the gram (Neu4,5Ac2α3Lac, 1.33 g) and preparative scale (Neu4,5Ac2α3LNnT) synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides. Other O-acetyl-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac2)- or 4-O-acetyl-5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu4Ac5Gc) -containing α2-3-sialosides have also been synthesized in the preparative scale. Used as an effective probe, Neu4,5Ac2α3GalβpNP was found to be a suitable substrate by human influenza A viruses but not bacterial sialidases.	0
Abstract2class: Skeletal muscle expression of the adhesion-GPCR CD97: CD97 deletion induces an abnormal structure of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum but does not impair skeletal muscle function Abstract: CD97 is a widely expressed adhesion class G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR). Here, we investigated the presence of CD97 in normal and malignant human skeletal muscle as well as the ultrastructural and functional consequences of CD97 deficiency in mice. In normal human skeletal muscle, CD97 was expressed at the peripheral sarcolemma of all myofibers, as revealed by immunostaining of tissue sections and surface labeling of single myocytes using flow cytometry. In muscle cross-sections, an intracellular polygonal, honeycomb-like CD97-staining pattern, typical for molecules located in the T-tubule or sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR), was additionally found. CD97 co-localized with SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a constituent of the longitudinal SR, but not with the receptors for dihydropyridine (DHPR) or ryanodine (RYR), located in the T-tubule and terminal SR, respectively. Intracellular expression of CD97 was higher in slow-twitch compared to most fast-twitch myofibers. In rhabdomyosarcomas, CD97 was strongly upregulated and in part more N-glycosylated compared to normal skeletal muscle. All tumors were strongly CD97-positive, independent of the underlying histological subtype, suggesting high sensitivity of CD97 for this tumor. Ultrastructural analysis of murine skeletal myofibers confirmed the location of CD97 in the SR. CD97 knock-out mice had a dilated SR, resulting in a partial increase in triad diameter yet not affecting the T-tubule, sarcomeric, and mitochondrial structure. Despite these obvious ultrastructural changes, intracellular Ca2+ release from single myofibers, force generation and fatigability of isolated soleus muscles, and wheel-running capacity of mice were not affected by the lack of CD97. We conclude that CD97 is located in the SR and at the peripheral sarcolemma of human and murine skeletal muscle, where its absence affects the structure of the SR without impairing skeletal muscle function.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of genes necessary for jinggangmycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 Abstract: A series of large chromosomal deletions in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 were aligned on the physical map of the wild-type strain and the mutants were assessed for their ability to produce the aminocyclitol antibiotic 5102-I (jinggangmycin). Twenty-eight mutants were blocked for jinggangmycin production and all of them were found to lack a 300 kb AseI-F fragment of the wild-type chromosome. An ordered cosmid library of the 300 kb AseI-F fragment was made and one of the cosmids conferred jinggangmycin productivity to Streptomyces lividans ZX1. Three of the overlapping cosmids (18G7, 5H3 and 9A2) also hybridized to the valA gene of the validamycin pathway from S. hygroscopicus 5008 as a probe. This gene resembles acbC from Actinoplanes sp. 50/110, which encodes a C7-cyclitol synthase that catalyses the transformation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate into 2-5-epi-valiolone for acarbose biosynthesis. The valA/acbC-homolog (orf1) of S. hygroscopicus 10-22 was shown to be essential for jinggangmycin biosynthesis as an engineered mutant with a specific in-frame deletion removing a 609 bp sequence internal to orf1 completely abolished jinggangmycin production and the corresponding knock-out mutant (JXH4) could be complemented for jinggangmycin production by the introduction of an orf1-containing construct. Concurrently, the identities of the genes common to S. hygroscopicus strains 10-22 and 5008 prompted a comparison of the chemical structures of jinggangmycin and validamycin, which led to a clear demonstration that they are identical.	1
Abstract2class: Glycan microarray analysis of Candida glabrata adhesin ligand specificity Abstract: The Candida glabrata genome encodes at least 23 members of the EPA (epithelial adhesin) family responsible for mediating adherence to host cells. To better understand the mechanism by which the Epa proteins contribute to pathogenesis, we have used glycan microarray analysis to characterize their carbohydrate-binding specificities. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains surface-expressing the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of the Epa proteins, we found that the three Epa family members functionally identified as adhesins in Candida glabrata (Epa1, Epa6 and Epa7) bind to ligands containing a terminal galactose residue. However, the specificity of the three proteins for glycans within this class varies, with Epa6 having a broader specificity range than Epa1 or Epa7. This result is intriguing given the close homology between Epa6 and Epa7, which are 92% identical at the amino acid level. We have mapped a five-amino-acid region within the N-terminal ligand-binding domain that accounts for the difference in specificity of Epa6 and Epa7 and show that these residues contribute to adherence to both epithelial and endothelial cell lines in vitro.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of C-Glycosylpyranonaphthoquinones in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 by a Combined NMR-Based Metabolomics and Bioinformatics Workflow Abstract: Mining of microbial genomes has revealed that actinomycetes harbor far more biosynthetic potential for bioactive natural products than anticipated. Activation of (cryptic) biosynthetic gene clusters and identification of the corresponding metabolites has become a focal point for drug discovery. Here, we applied NMR-based metabolomics combined with bioinformatics to identify novel C-glycosylpyranonaphthoquinones in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 and to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway. Following activation of the cryptic qin gene cluster for a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) by constitutive expression of its pathway-specific activator, bioinformatics coupled to NMR profiling facilitated the chromatographic isolation and structural elucidation of qinimycins A-C (1-3). The intriguing structural features of the qinimycins, including 8-C-glycosylation, 5,14-epoxidation, and 13-hydroxylation, distinguished these molecules from the model pyranonaphthoquinones actinorhodin, medermycin, and granaticin. Another novelty lies in the unusual fusion of a deoxyaminosugar to the pyranonaphthoquinone backbone during biosynthesis of the antibiotics BE-54238 A and B (4, 5). Qinimycins showed weak antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Our work shows the utility of combining bioinformatics, targeted activation of cryptic gene clusters, and NMR-based metabolic profiling as an effective pipeline for the discovery of microbial natural products with distinctive skeletons.	0
Abstract2class: Regulating the Rate of Molecular Self-Assembly for Targeting Cancer Cells Abstract: Besides tight and specific ligand-receptor interactions, the rate regulation of the formation of molecular assemblies is one of fundamental features of cells. But the latter receives little exploration for developing anticancer therapeutics. Here we show that a simple molecular design of the substrates of phosphatases-tailoring the number of phosphates on peptidic substrates-is able to regulate the rate of molecular self-assembly of the enzyme reaction product. Such a rate regulation allows selective inhibition of osteosarcoma cells over hepatocytes, which promises to target cancer cells in a specific organ. Moreover, our result reveals that the direct measurement of the rate of the self-assembly in a cell-based assay provides precise assessment of the cell targeting capability of self-assembly. This work, as the first report establishing rate regulation of a multiple-step process to inhibit cells selectively, illustrates a fundamentally new approach for controlling the fate of cells.	0
Abstract2class: A Natural Variation of Fumonisin Gene Cluster Associated with Fumonisin Production Difference in Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Fusarium fujikuroi, a member of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex, stands out as a rice bakanae disease pathogen with a high production of gibberellic acid. Not all, but some F. fujikuroi strains are known to produce a carcinogenic mycotoxin fumonisin. Fumonisin biosynthesis is dependent on the FUM cluster composed of 16 FUM genes. The FUM cluster was detected not only from a fumonisin producing strain, but also from a fumonisin nonproducing strain that does not produce a detectable level of fumonisin. Genetic mapping indicated the causative mutation(s) of fumonisin nonproduction is present in the FUM cluster of the fumonisin nonproducing strain. Comparative analyses of FUM genes between the fumonisin producing and the nonproducing strains and gene complementation indicated that causative mutation of fumonisin nonproduction is not a single occurrence and the mutations are distributed in FUM21 and FUM7. Our research revealed a natural variation in the FUM cluster involving fumonisin production difference in F. fujikuroi.	1
Abstract2class: A suite of asymmetric citrate siderophores isolated from a marine Shewanella species Abstract: Woodybactins A-D are a suite of new fatty acyl siderophores produced by the luminous marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi MS32. While this bacterium has a set of genes homologous to the biosynthetic gene cluster for aerobactin, aerobactin is not produced. The arrangement of these genes within the genome differs in S. woodyi MS32 when compared to E. coli and other species producing siderophores similar to aerobactin, and one synthetase gene which would append a second acyl-hydroxylysine to the terminal carboxylate of citrate is not functional. Within the suite of woodybactins A-D, which differ by the fatty acid appendage, one contains an unusual C9 (9:0) fatty acid and one contains a unique branched C9 iso (9:0 iso) fatty acid, as well as a C8 (8:0) and C10 (10:0) fatty acid.	1
Abstract2class: Colibactin assembly line enzymes use S-adenosylmethionine to build a cyclopropane ring Abstract: Despite containing an α-amino acid, the versatile cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is not a known building block for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we report an unusual NRPS module from colibactin biosynthesis that uses SAM for amide bond formation and subsequent cyclopropanation. Our findings showcase a new use for SAM and reveal a novel biosynthetic route to a functional group that likely mediates colibactin's genotoxicity.	0
Abstract2class: A small-molecule probe of the histone methyltransferase G9a induces cellular senescence in pancreatic adenocarcinoma Abstract: Post-translational modifications of histones alter chromatin structure and play key roles in gene expression and specification of cell states. Small molecules that target chromatin-modifying enzymes selectively are useful as probes and have promise as therapeutics, although very few are currently available. G9a (also named euchromatin histone methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2)) catalyzes methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification linked to aberrant silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, among others. Here, we report the discovery of a novel histone methyltransferase inhibitor, BRD4770. This compound reduced cellular levels of di- and trimethylated H3K9 without inducing apoptosis, induced senescence, and inhibited both anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. ATM-pathway activation, caused by either genetic or small-molecule inhibition of G9a, may mediate BRD4770-induced cell senescence. BRD4770 may be a useful tool to study G9a and its role in senescence and cancer cell biology.	0
Abstract2class: Dissecting the PhoP regulatory network of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica Abstract: Genetic and genomic approaches have been successfully used to assign genes to distinct regulatory networks. However, the present challenge of distinguishing differentially regulated genes within a network is particularly hard because members of a given network tend to have similar regulatory features. We have addressed this challenge by developing a method, termed Gene Promoter Scan, that discriminates coregulated promoters by simultaneously considering both multiple cis promoter features and gene expression. Here, we apply this method to probe the regulatory networks governed by the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system in the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our analysis uncovered members of the PhoP regulon and interactions with other regulatory systems that were not discovered in previous approaches. The predictions made by Gene Promoter Scan were experimentally validated to establish that the PhoP protein uses multiple mechanisms to control gene transcription, regulates acid resistance determinants, and is a central element in a highly connected network.	0
Abstract2class: A fungal biofilm reactor based on metal structured packing improves the quality of a Gla::GFP fusion protein produced by Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Fungal biofilm is known to promote the excretion of secondary metabolites in accordance with solid-state-related physiological mechanisms. This work is based on the comparative analysis of classical submerged fermentation with a fungal biofilm reactor for the production of a Gla::green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein by Aspergillus oryzae. The biofilm reactor comprises a metal structured packing allowing the attachment of the fungal biomass. Since the production of the target protein is under the control of the promoter glaB, specifically induced in solid-state fermentation, the biofilm mode of culture is expected to enhance the global productivity. Although production of the target protein was enhanced by using the biofilm mode of culture, we also found that fusion protein production is also significant when the submerged mode of culture is used. This result is related to high shear stress leading to biomass autolysis and leakage of intracellular fusion protein into the extracellular medium. Moreover, 2-D gel electrophoresis highlights the preservation of fusion protein integrity produced in biofilm conditions. Two fungal biofilm reactor designs were then investigated further, i.e. with full immersion of the packing or with medium recirculation on the packing, and the scale-up potentialities were evaluated. In this context, it has been shown that full immersion of the metal packing in the liquid medium during cultivation allows for a uniform colonization of the packing by the fungal biomass and leads to a better quality of the fusion protein.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the antitumor chromomycin A3 in Streptomyces griseus: analysis of the gene cluster and rational design of novel chromomycin analogs Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aureolic acid type antitumor drug chromomycin A3 from S. griseus subsp. griseus has been identified and characterized. It spans 43 kb and contains 36 genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis and modification, deoxysugar biosynthesis and sugar transfer, pathway regulation and resistance. The organization of the cluster clearly differs from that of the closely related mithramycin. Involvement of the cluster in chromomycin A3 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the cmmWI gene encoding a polyketide reductase involved in side chain reduction. Three novel chromomycin derivatives were obtained, named chromomycin SK, chromomycin SA, and chromomycin SDK, which show antitumor activity and differ with respect to their 3-side chains. A pathway for the biosynthesis of chromomycin A3 and its deoxysugars is proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Improved bioconversion of 15-fluoro-6-deoxyerythronolide B to 15-fluoro-erythromycin A by overexpression of the eryK Gene in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The bioconversion of a 6-deoxyerythronolide B analogue to the corresponding erythromycin A analogue (R-EryA) by a Saccharopolyspora erythraea mutant lacking the ketosynthase in the first polyketide synthase module was significantly improved by changing fluxes at a key branch point affecting the erythromycin congener distribution. This was achieved by integrating an additional copy of the eryK gene into the chromosome under control of the eryAIp promoter. Real-time PCR analysis of RNA confirmed higher expression of eryK in the resulting strain, S. erythraea K301-105B, compared to its parent. In shake flasks, K301-105B produced less of the shunt product 15-fluoro-erythromycin B (15F-EryB), suggesting a shift in congener distribution toward the desired product, 15-fluoro-erythromycin A (15F-EryA). In bioreactor studies, K301-105B produced 1.3 g/L of 15F-EryA with 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor, compared with 0.9 g/L 15F-EryA with 50-55% molar yield on fed precursor by the parent strain. At higher precursor feed rates, K301-105B produced 3.5 g/L of 15F-EryA while maintaining 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor.	1
Abstract2class: A Dinuclear Mechanism Implicated in Controlled Carbene Polymerization Abstract: Carbene polymerization provides polyolefins that cannot be readily prepared from olefin monomers; however, controlled and living carbene polymerization has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a new class of initiators, (π-allyl)palladium carboxylate dimers, which polymerize ethyl diazoacetate, a carbene precursor in a controlled and quasi-living manner, with nearly quantitative yields, degrees of polymerization >100, molecular weight dispersities 1.2-1.4, and well-defined, diversifiable chain ends. This method also provides block copolycarbenes that undergo microphase segregation. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analysis supports a new dinuclear mechanism for this process.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of the Tailoring Steps in Julichrome Biosynthesis by Marine Gastropod Mollusk-Associated Streptomyces sampsonii SCSIO 054 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster governing the production of antibacterial julichromes was identified from marine gastropod mollusk-associated Streptomyces sampsonii SCSIO 054. Post-PKS assembly/tailoring enzymes JuiL, JuiM, JuiI, and JuiN represent key assembly enzymes. JuiL serves as a ketoreductase. JuiM is an acetyltransferase. JuiI carries out an intriguing biaryl coupling of two julichrome Q6 units (immediate JuiL, JuiM product) to afford julichrome Q6-6. JuiN carries out tailoring steps on julichrome Q6-6, transforming Q6-6 into Q3-3.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycetin, a linear polyketide T cell-specific immunomodulator from Streptomyces sp. CK4412 Abstract: The bacterial genus Streptomyces has long been appreciated for its ability to produce various kinds of medically important secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, anti-tumour agents, immunosuppressants and enzyme inhibitors. Tautomycetin (TMC), which is produced by Streptomyces sp. CK4412, is a novel activated T cell-specific immunosuppressive compound with an ester bond linkage between a terminal cyclic anhydride moiety and a linear polyketide chain bearing an unusual terminal alkene. Using a Streptomyces polyketide methylmalonyl-CoA acyltransferase gene as a probe, three overlapping cosmids were isolated from the genomic library of TMC-producing Streptomyces sp. CK4412. Sequence information of an approximately 70 kb contiguous DNA region revealed two multi-modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), and 12 additional gene products presumably involved in TMC biosynthesis. The deduced roles for most of the TMC PKS catalytic domains were consistent with the expected functions necessary for TMC chain elongation and processing. In addition, disruption of a putative TMC acyl-CoA transferase gene, located upstream of the PKS gene locus, completely abolished TMC biosynthesis. Taken together, these data provide strong supporting evidence that the cloned gene cluster identified in this study is responsible for TMC biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. CK4412, and set the stage for detailed genetic and biochemical studies of the biosynthesis of this important metabolite.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and functional analysis of the aspergillic acid gene cluster in Aspergillus flavus Abstract: Aspergillus flavus can colonize important food staples and produce aflatoxins, a group of toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites. Previous in silico analysis of the A. flavus genome revealed 56 gene clusters predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. A. flavus secondary metabolites produced during infection of maize seed are of particular interest, especially with respect to their roles in the biology of the fungus. A predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene, designated asaC (AFLA_023020), present in the uncharacterized A. flavus secondary metabolite gene cluster 11 was previously shown to be expressed during the earliest stages of maize kernel infection. Cluster 11 is composed of six additional genes encoding a number of putative decorating enzymes as well as a transporter and transcription factor. We generated knock-out mutants of the seven predicted cluster 11 genes. LC-MS analysis of extracts from knockout mutants of these genes showed that they were responsible for the synthesis of the previously characterized antimicrobial mycotoxin aspergillic acid. Extracts of the asaC mutant showed no production of aspergillic acid or its precursors. Knockout of the cluster 11 P450 oxidoreductase afforded a pyrazinone metabolite, the aspergillic acid precursor deoxyaspergillic acid. The formation of hydroxyaspergillic acid was abolished in a desaturase/hydroxylase mutant. The hydroxamic acid functional group in aspergillic acid allows the molecule to bind to iron resulting in the production of a red pigment in A. flavus identified previously as ferriaspergillin. A reduction of aflatoxin B1 and cyclopiazonic acid that correlated with reduced fungal growth was observed in maize kernel infection assays when aspergillic acid biosynthesis in A. flavus is halted.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the beta-amino acid moiety of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 featuring beta-amino acyl-S-carrier protein intermediates Abstract: The enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 chromoprotein is produced by Streptomyces globisporus. The biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety (boxed) of the C-1027 chromophore (1) from l-tyrosine (3) and its incorporation into 1 are catalyzed by six enzymes: SgcC, SgcC1, SgcC2, SgcC3, SgcC4, ShcC5. In vivo and in vitro characterization of these enzymes delineated this pathway, unveiling a novel strategy for beta-amino acid modification featuring beta-amino acyl-S-carrier protein intermediates. These findings shed new light into beta-amino acid biosynthesis and present a new opportunity to engineer the C-1027 biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues as exemplified by 20-deschloro-C-1027 (4), 20-deschro-22-deshydroxy-C-1027 (5), and 22-deshydroxy-C-1027 (6).	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic pathway for high structural diversity of a common dilactone core in antimycin production Abstract: We herein report comparative analysis of two versions of the biosynthetic gene clusters of antimycins, a natural product family possessing up to 44 distinct entities. The biosynthetic pathway of antimycins is amenable to the high structural variation of the substrates, supported by successes in heterologous expression of the ant cluster and in fluorine incorporation. The latter facilitated the investigation of the structure-activity relationship into the usually invariable 3-formamidosalicylic acid moiety of the molecules.	1
Abstract2class: Study of matrix additives for sensitive analysis of lipid A by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry Abstract: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been widely used for structural characterization of bacterial endotoxins (lipid A). However, the mass spectrometric behavior of the lipid A molecule is highly dependent on the matrix. Furthermore, this dependence is strongly linked to phosphorylation patterns. Using lipid A from Escherichia coli O116 as a model system, we have investigated the effects of different matrices and comatrix compounds on the analysis of lipid A. In this paper, we report a highly sensitive matrix system for lipid A analysis, which consists of 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole matrix and EDTA ammonium salt comatrix. This matrix system enhances the sensitivity of the analysis of diphosphorylated lipid A species by more than 100-fold and in addition provides tolerance to high concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and tolerance to sodium chloride and calcium chloride at 10 muM, 100 muM, and 10 muM concentrations. The method was further evaluated for analysis of lipid A species with different phosphorylation patterns and from different bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica serovar Riogrande, and Francisella novicida.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular Recognition in C-Type Lectins: The Cases of DC-SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L-Sectin Abstract: Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross-talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll-like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C-type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.	0
Abstract2class: Homologous Expression and Characterization of Gassericin T and Gassericin S, a Novel Class IIb Bacteriocin Produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA327 Abstract: Lactobacillus gasseri LA327, isolated from the large intestine tissue in humans, is a bacteriocinogenic strain with two kinds of class IIb bacteriocin structural genes, i.e., those for gassericin T (GT) and acidocin LF221A (Acd LF221A). In this study, DNA sequencing of the genes for GT and Acd LF221A from L. gasseri LA327 revealed that the amino acid sequences for GT corresponded with those for GT genes, except for GatK (histidine kinase). However, Acd LF221A genes had analogues which differed in at least one amino acid residue, to encode a class IIb bacteriocin designated gassericin S (GS). The LA327 strain retained antimicrobial activity after the deletion of the GT structural genes (gatAX); however, both GS and GT activities were lost by deletion of the putative ABC transporter gene (gatT). This indicates that the LA327 strain produces GS and GT and that GS secretion is performed via GT genes with the inclusion of gatT Homologous expression using deletion mutants of GS and GT, each containing a single peptide, elucidated that GS (GasAX) and GT (GatAX) showed synergistic activity as class IIb bacteriocins and that no synergistic activity was observed between GS and GT peptides. The molecular mass of GS was estimated to be theoretical ca. 5,400 Da by in situ activity assay after SDS-PAGE, clarifying that GS was actually expressed as an active class IIb bacteriocin. Furthermore, the stability of expressed GS to pH, heat, and protease was determined.IMPORTANCE Bacteriocins are regarded as potential alternatives for antibiotics in the absence of highly resistant bacteria. In particular, two-peptide (class IIb) bacteriocins exhibit the maximum activity through the synergy of two components, and their antimicrobial spectra are known to be relatively wide. However, there are few reports of synergistic activity of class IIb bacteriocins determined by isolation and purification of individual peptides. Our results clarified the interaction of each class IIb component peptide for GT and GS via the construction of homologous mutants, which were not dependent on the purification. These data may contribute to understanding the mechanisms of action by which class IIb bacteriocins exhibit wide antibacterial spectra.	1
Abstract2class: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolide concanamycin A in Streptomyces neyagawaensis ATCC 27449 Abstract: The macrolide antibiotic concanamycin A has been identified as an exceptionally potent inhibitor of the vacuolar (V-type) ATPase. Such compounds have been mooted as the basis of a potential drug treatment for osteoporosis, since the V-ATPase is involved in the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption that underlies this common condition. To enable combinatorial engineering of altered concanamycins, the biosynthetic gene cluster governing the biosynthesis of concanamycin A has been cloned from Streptomyces neyagawaensis and shown to span a region of over 100 kbp of contiguous DNA. An efficient transformation system has been developed for S. neyagawaensis and used to demonstrate the role of the cloned locus in the formation of concanamycin A. Sequence analysis of the 28 ORFs in the region has revealed key features of the biosynthetic pathway, in particular the biosynthetic origin of portions of the backbone, which arise from the unusual polyketide building blocks ethylmalonyl-CoA and methoxymalonyl-ACP, and the origin of the pendant deoxysugar moiety 4'-O-carbamoyl-2'-deoxyrhamnose, as well as the presence of a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by six giant ORFs. Examination of the methoxymalonyl-specific acyltransferase (AT) domains has led to recognition of an amino acid sequence motif which can be used to distinguish methylmalonyl-CoA- from methoxymalonyl-ACP-specific AT domains in natural PKSs.	1
Abstract2class: Palladium-Catalyzed Fluorosulfonylvinylation of Organic Iodides Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed fluorosulfonylvinylation reaction of organic iodides is described. Catalytic Pd(OAc)2 with a stoichiometric amount of silver(I) trifluoroacetate enables the coupling process between either an (hetero)aryl or alkenyl iodide with ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF). The method is demonstrated in the successful syntheses of eighty-eight otherwise difficult to access compounds, in up to 99 % yields, including the unprecedented 2-heteroarylethenesulfonyl fluorides and 1,3-dienylsulfonyl fluorides.	0
Abstract2class: Pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin and interaction with cisapride and sucralfate Abstract: In an open, randomized, triple crossover study, the effects of cisapride and sucralfate on the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin were assessed. Fifteen healthy volunteers received 400 mg of sparfloxacin as a single oral dose on day 0. In a random order, concomitant doses of 10 mg of cisapride three times daily from day -2 to day 2 and 1 g of sucralfate four times daily from day -2 to day 0 were administered. Sparfloxacin concentrations were measured by bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters for sparfloxacin alone were as follows (mean +/- standard deviation): maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), 1.27 +/- 0.39 microg/ml; time to C(max) (T(max)), 4.1 +/- 1.9 h; area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 35.0 +/- 9.7 microg x h/ml; mean residence time, 28.5 +/- 5.7 h; half-life (t1/2), 20 +/- 4 h; urinary recovery (UR x f), 11.0% +/- 2.7%; and metabolite-sparfloxacin ratio in urine, 2.6. For the cisapride group there was a significant decrease in the sparfloxacin T(max) (1.9 +/- 2.1 h) and a significant increase in C(max) (1.74 +/- 0.73 microg/ml). The QTc interval for patients receiving sparfloxacin and cisapride was prolonged by 7.7% compared to the QTc interval during medication-free periods. Significant differences in the values for the group receiving sucralfate compared to the values for the group receiving sparfloxacin alone were found: C(max), 0.77 +/- 0.31 microg/ml; AUC, 18.6 +/- 5.8 microg x h/ml; t1/2, 26 +/- 10 h; and UR x f, 5.8 +/- 1.8%. Concomitant adminstration of cisapride accelerates the absorption and increases the peak concentration of sparfloxacin without having a significant effect on the extent of bioavailability. Coadministration of sucralfate leads to a 44% decrease in the bioavailability of sparfloxacin.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and role in virulence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depudecin from Alternaria brassicicola Abstract: Depudecin, an eleven-carbon linear polyketide made by the pathogenic fungus Alternaria brassicicola, is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). A chemically unrelated HDAC inhibitor, HC toxin, was earlier shown to be a major virulence factor in the interaction between Cochliobolus carbonum and its host, maize. In order to test whether depudecin is also a virulence factor for A. brassicicola, we identified the genes for depudecin biosynthesis and created depudecin-minus mutants. The depudecin gene cluster contains six genes (DEP1 to DEP6), which are predicted to encode a polyketide synthase (AbPKS9 or DEP5), a transcription factor (DEP6), two monooxygenases (DEP2 and DEP4), a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (DEP3), and one protein of unknown function (DEP1). The involvement in depudecin production of DEP2, DEP4, DEP5, and DEP6 was demonstrated by targeted gene disruption. DEP6 is required for expression of DEP1 through DEP5 but not the immediate flanking genes, thus defining a coregulated depudecin biosynthetic cluster. The genes flanking the depudecin gene cluster but not the cluster itself are conserved in the same order in the related fungi Stagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Depudecin-minus mutants have a small (10%) but statistically significant reduction in virulence on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) but not on Arabidopsis. The role of depudecin in virulence is, therefore, less dramatic than that of HC toxin.	1
