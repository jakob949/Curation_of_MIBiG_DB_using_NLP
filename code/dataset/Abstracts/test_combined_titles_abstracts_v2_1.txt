Abstract2class: Characterization of the Suillus grevillei quinone synthetase GreA supports a nonribosomal code for aromatic α-keto acids Abstract: The gene greA was cloned from the genome of the basidiomycete Suillus grevillei. It encodes a monomodular natural product biosynthesis protein composed of three domains for adenylation, thiolation, and thioesterase and, hence, is reminiscent of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). GreA was biochemically characterized in vitro. It was identified as atromentin synthetase and therefore represents one of only a limited number of biochemically characterized NRPS-like enzymes which accept an aromatic α-keto acid. Specificity-conferring amino acid residues--collectively referred to as the nonribosomal code--were predicted for the primary sequence of the GreA adenylation domain and were an unprecedented combination for aromatic α-keto acids. Plausible support for this new code came from in silico simulation of the adenylation domain structure. According to the model, the predicted residues line the active site and, therefore, very likely contribute to substrate specificity.	1
Abstract2class: Transcriptional organization of a cloned chemotaxis locus of Bacillus subtilis Abstract: A cloned chemotaxis operon has been characterized. Thirteen representative che mutations from different complementation groups were localized on the physical map by recombination experiments. The use of integration plasmids established that at least 10 of these complementation groups within this locus are cotranscribed. An additional three complementation groups may form part of the same transcript. The direction of transcription and the time of expression were determined from chromosomal che-lacZ gene fusions. The promoter was cloned and localized to a 3-kilobase fragment. Expression of beta-galactosidase from this promoter was observed primarily during the logarithmic phase of growth. Three-factor PBS1 cotransduction experiments were performed to order the che locus with respect to adjacent markers. The cheF141 mutation is 70 to 80% linked to pyrD1. This linkage is different from that reported previously (G. W. Ordal, D. O. Nettleton, and J. A. Hoch, J. Bacteriol. 154:1088-1097, 1983). The cheM127 mutation is 57% linked by transformation to spcB3. The gene order determined from all crosses is pyrD-cheF-cheM-spcB.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the grincamycin gene cluster unveils divergent roles for GcnQ in different hosts, tailoring the L-rhodinose moiety Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for grincamycin (GCN, 1) biosynthesis in Streptomyces lusitanus SCSIO LR32 was identified; heterologous expression of the GCN cluster in S. coelicolor M512 yielded P-1894B (1b) as a predominant product. The ΔgcnQ mutant accumulates intermediate 1a and two shunt products 2a and 3a bearing L-rhodinose for L-cinerulose A substitutions. In vitro data demonstrated that GcnQ is capable of iteratively tailoring the two L-rhodinose moieties into L-aculose moieties, supporting divergent roles of GcnQ in different hosts.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the azinomycin B biosynthetic gene cluster revealing a different iterative type I polyketide synthase for naphthoate biosynthesis Abstract: Azinomycin B is a complex natural product containing densely assembled functionalities with potent antitumor activity. Cloning and sequence analysis of the azi gene cluster revealed an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene, five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) genes and numerous genes encoding the biosynthesis of unusual building blocks and tailoring steps for azinomycin B production. Characterization of AziB as a 5-methyl-naphthoic acid (NPA) synthase showed a distinct selective reduction pattern in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis governed by bacterial iterative type I PKSs. Heterologous expression established the PKS-post modification route from 5-methyl-NPA to reach the first building block 3-methoxy-5-methyl-NPA. This proposed azinomycin B biosynthetic pathway sets the stage to investigate the enzymatic mechanisms for building structurally unique and pharmaceutically important groups, including the unprecedented azabicyclic ring system and highly active epoxide moiety.	1
Abstract2class: Phenylnannolones A-C: biosynthesis of new secondary metabolites from the myxobacterium Nannocystis exedens Abstract: Myxobacteria are gliding bacteria that belong to the delta-Proteobacteria and are known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. Among myxobacteria, Nannocystis spp. are most closely related to marine myxobacteria and their secondary metabolism has hardly been investigated. Phenylnannolones A (1), B (2) and C (3) were obtained from a culture of Nannocystis exedens that was isolated from the intertidal region of Crete. Compound 1 had inhibitory activity toward the ABCB1 gene product P-glycoprotein and reversed daunorubicin resistance in cultured cancer cells. Phenylnannolone A has an unusual structural architecture; it is composed of an ethyl-substituted polyene chain linked to a pyrone moiety on one side and to a phenyl ring on the other. The investigation of the biosynthesis with labelled precursors revealed acetate, butyrate and phenylalanine as building blocks for 1. The labelling pattern suggested novel biochemical reactions for the biosynthesis of the starter unit.	1
Abstract2class: SimC7 Is a Novel NAD(P)H-Dependent Ketoreductase Essential for the Antibiotic Activity of the DNA Gyrase Inhibitor Simocyclinone Abstract: Simocyclinone D8 (SD8) is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040. The simocyclinone (sim) biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway has been proposed. The tetraene linker in SD8 was suggested to be the product of a modular type I polyketide synthase working in trans with two monofunctional enzymes. One of these monofunctional enzymes, SimC7, was proposed to supply a dehydratase activity missing from two modules of the polyketide synthase. In this study, we report the function of SimC7. We isolated the entire ~72-kb sim cluster on a single phage artificial chromosome clone and produced simocyclinone heterologously in a Streptomyces coelicolor strain engineered for improved antibiotic production. Deletion of simC7 resulted in the production of a novel simocyclinone, 7-oxo-SD8, which unexpectedly carried a normal tetraene linker but was altered in the angucyclinone moiety. We demonstrate that SimC7 is an NAD(P)H-dependent ketoreductase that catalyzes the conversion of 7-oxo-SD8 into SD8. 7-oxo-SD8 was essentially inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor, and the reduction of the keto group by SimC7 was shown to be crucial for high-affinity binding to the enzyme. Thus, SimC7 is an angucyclinone ketoreductase that is essential for the biological activity of simocyclinone.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of alpha-L-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates (tNTPs) Abstract: [structure: see text] The alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates of T, G, and D (tTTP, tGTP, and tDTP) were synthesized from the described 2'-O-DMT-protected derivatives using the Eckstein method, while the corresponding C derivative (tCTP) was prepared from the 2'-O-acetyl derivative. The prepared alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, despite being one carbon shorter than the native 2'-deoxyfuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, are effective substrates for selected DNA polymerases.	0
Abstract2class: FILAMENT FORMATION BY ESCHERICHIA COLI AT INCREASED HYDROSTATIC PRESSURES Abstract: ZoBell, Claude E. (University of California, La Jolla), and Andre B. Cobet. Filament formation by Escherichia coli at increased hydrostatic pressures. J. Bacteriol. 87:710-719. 1964.-The reproduction as well as the growth of Escherichia coli is retarded by hydrostatic pressures ranging from 200 to 500 atm. Reproduction was indicated by an increase in the number of cells determined by plating on EMB Agar as well as by direct microscopic counts. Growth, which is not necessarily synonymous with reproduction, was indicated by increase in dry weight and protein content of the bacterial biomass. At increased pressures, cells of three different strains of E. coli tended to form long filaments. Whereas most normal cells of E. coli that developed at 1 atm were only about 2 mu long, the mean length of those that developed at 475 atm was 2.93 mu for strain R(4), 3.99 mu for strain S, and 5.82 mu for strain B cells. Nearly 90% of the bacterial biomass produced at 475 atm by strain B was found in filaments exceeding 5 mu in length; 74.7 and 16.4% of the biomass produced at 475 atm by strains S and R(4), respectively, occurred in such filaments. Strain R(4) formed fewer and shorter (5 to 35 mu) filaments than did the other two strains, whose filaments ranged in length from 5 to >100 mu. The bacterial biomass produced at all pressures had approximately the same content of protein and nucleic acids. But at increased pressures appreciably more ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proportionately less deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was found per unit of biomass. Whereas the RNA content per cell increased with cell length, the amount of DNA was nearly the same in long filaments formed at increased pressure as in cells of normal length formed at 1 atm. The inverse relationship between the concentration of DNA and cell length in all three strains of E. coli suggests that the failure of DNA to replicate at increased pressure may be responsible for a repression of cell division and consequent filament formation.	0
Abstract2class: Transfer of neurotoxigenicity from Clostridium butyricum to a nontoxigenic Clostridium botulinum type E-like strain Abstract: Two Clostridium butyricum strains from infant botulism cases produce a toxic molecule very similar to C. botulinum type E neurotoxin. Chromosomal, plasmid, and bacteriophage DNAs of toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of C. butyricum and C. botulinum type E were probed with (i) a synthesized 30-mer oligonucleotide encoding part of the L chain of type E botulinum toxin and (ii) the DNA of phages lysogenizing these cultures. The toxin gene probe hybridized to the chromosomal DNA of toxigenic strains but not to their plasmid DNA. All toxigenic and most nontoxigenic strains tested were lysogenized by a prophage on the chromosome. Prophages of toxigenic strains, irrespective of species, had related or identical DNAs which differed from the DNAs of prophages in nontoxigenic strains. The prophage of toxigenic strains was adjacent or close to the toxin gene on the chromosome. Phage DNAs purified from toxigenic strains did not hybridize with the toxin gene probe but could act as the template of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the toxin gene. The toxin gene was not transferred between C. botulinum and C. butyricum (either direction) when different pairs of a possible gene donor and a recipient strain were grown as mixed cultures. Nontoxigenic C. butyricum or C. botulinum type E-like strains did not become toxigenic when grown in broth containing the phage induced from a toxigenic strain of the other species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Abstract2class: Biochemical and genetic characterization of fungal proline hydroxylase in echinocandin biosynthesis Abstract: An intriguing structural feature of echinocandins is the incorporation of hydroxylated amino acids. Elucidation of the machinery and the mechanism responsible for this modification is critical to generate new echinocandin derivatives with enhanced antifungal activity. In our present study, we biochemically characterized the α-ketoglutarate/Fe2+-dependent proline hydroxylase (HtyE) from two Aspergillus species, Aspergillus pachycristatus and Aspergillus aculeatus, in the respective echinocandin B and aculeacin A biosynthetic gene clusters. Our results showed that both Ap- and Aa-HtyE converted L-proline to trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline, but at different ratios. Both enzymes also effectively hydroxylated C-3 of 4R-methyl-proline, L-pipecolic acid, and D-proline. Our homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified Leu182 of Ap-HtyE as a key residue in determining the regioselectivity of Ap-HtyE. Notably, we found that the efficiency in C-3 hydroxylation of 4R-methyl-proline has no direct correlation with the ratio of trans-4-hydroxylproline to trans-3-hydroxylproline catalyzed by HtyE. Deletion of Ap-htyE abolished A. pachycristatus anti-Candida activity and the production of echinocandin B, demonstrating that HtyE is the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation of L-proline and 4R-methyl-proline in vivo and is essential for the anti-Candida activity of echinocandin B. Our present study thus sheds light on the biochemical basis for the selective hydroxylation of L-proline and 4R-methyl-proline and reveals a new type of biocatalyst with potential for the custom production of hydroxylated proline and pipecolic acid derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Fusarin C biosynthesis in Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum Abstract: Fragments of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) of the fusarin C producing filamentous fungi Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum by using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to select for fungal PKS C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domains. The PCR products, which were highly homologous to fragments of known fungal PKS CMeT domains, were used to probe cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries of F. moniliforme and F. venenatum. A 4.0 kb cDNA clone from F. venenatum was isolated and used to prepare a hygromycin-resistance knockout cassette, which was used to produce a fusarin-deficient strain of F. venenatum (kb = 1000 bp). Similarly, a 26 kb genomic fragment, isolated on two overlapping clones from F. moniliforme, encoded a complete iterative Type I PKS fused to an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthase module. Once again, targeted gene disruption produced a fusarin-deficient strain, thereby proving that this synthase is responsible for the first steps of fusarin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Lipid and fatty acid composition of diatoms revisited: rapid wound-activated change of food quality parameters influences herbivorous copepod reproductive success Abstract: Lipid and fatty acid composition are considered to be key parameters that determine the nutritive quality of phytoplankton diets for zooplanktonic herbivores. The fitness, reproduction and physiology of the grazers are influenced by these factors. The trophic transfer of lipids and fatty acids from algal cells has been typically studied by using simple extraction and quantification approaches, which, as we argue here, do not reflect the actual situation in the plankton. We show that cell disruption, as it occurs during a predator's grazing on diatoms can drastically change the lipid and fatty acid content of the food. In some algae, a rapid depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is observed within the first minutes after cell disruption. This fatty acid depletion is directly linked to the production of PUFA-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUA); these are molecules that are thought to be involved in the chemical defence of the algae. PUA-releasing diatoms are even capable of transforming lipids from other sources if these are available in the vicinity of the wounded cells. Fluorescent staining reveals that the enzymes involved in lipid transformation are active in the foregut of copepods, and therefore link the depletion processes directly to food uptake. Incubation experiments with the calanoid copepod Temora longicornis showed that PUFA depletion in PUA-producing diatoms is correlated to reduced hatching success, and can be compensated for by externally added single fatty acids.	0
Abstract2class: Nickel-Catalyzed Chemo- and Enantioselective Coupling between Cyclobutanones and Allenes: Rapid Synthesis of [3.2.2] Bicycles Abstract: Herein an intramolecular nickel-catalyzed (4+2) coupling between cyclobutanones and allenes, by C-C cleavage, is reported. The reaction provides a distinct approach for accessing [3.2.2] bicyclic scaffolds which are challenging to prepare through conventional approaches. The reaction is efficient, chemoselective, and pH/redox neutral. Room temperature conditions and low catalyst loadings can be adopted. Excellent enantioselectivity is also achieved.	0
Abstract2class: General and Robust Chemoenzymatic Method for Glycan-Mediated Site-Specific Labeling and Conjugation of Antibodies: Facile Synthesis of Homogeneous Antibody-Drug Conjugates Abstract: Site-specific labeling and conjugation of antibodies are highly desirable for fundamental research and for developing more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic methods. We report here a general and robust chemoenzymatic method that permits a one-pot site-specific functionalization of antibodies. A series of selectively modified disaccharide oxazoline derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as donor substrates of different endoglycosidases for antibody Fc glycan remodeling. We found that among several endoglycosidases tested, wild-type endoglycosidase from Streptococcus pyogenes of serotype M49 (Endo-S2) exhibited remarkable activity in transferring the functionalized disaccharides carrying site-selectively modified azide, biotin, or fluorescent tags to antibodies without hydrolyzing the resulting transglycosylation products. This discovery, together with the excellent Fc deglycosylation activity of Endo-S2 on recombinant antibodies, allowed direct labeling and functionalization of antibodies in a one-pot manner without the need of intermediate and enzyme separation. The site-specific introduction of varied numbers of azide groups enabled a highly efficient synthesis of homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with a precise control of the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) ranging from 2 to 12 via a copper-free strain-promoted click reaction. Cell viability assays showed that ADCs with higher DARs were more potent in killing antigen-overexpressed cells than the ADCs with lower DARs. This new method is expected to find applications not only for antibody-drug conjugation but also for cell labeling, imaging, and diagnosis.	0
Abstract2class: Novel ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials discovered by chemical substitution-oriented design Abstract: Exploring novel functional materials via chemical substitution-oriented design is an emerging strategy. The method can be expanded to the discovery of high performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) solid state materials by a careful tuning of the substituted atoms. This minireview presents a brief introduction to chemical substitution-oriented design including single-site substitution, dual-site substitution, and multisite substitution. Several state-of-the-art UV NLO materials such as K3VO(O2)2CO3-type, KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)-type, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)-type, and KTiOPO4 (KTP)-type phases successfully discovered by the chemical substitution method are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Antiplasmodial activity and mechanism of action of RSM-932A, a promising synergistic inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum choline kinase Abstract: We have investigated the mechanism of action of inhibition of the choline kinase of P. falciparum (p.f.-ChoK) by two inhibitors of the human ChoKα, MN58b and RSM-932A, which have previously been shown to be potent antitumoral agents. The efficacy of these inhibitors against p.f.-ChoK is investigated using enzymatic and in vitro assays. While MN58b may enter the choline/phosphocholine binding site, RSM-932A appears to have an altogether novel mechanism of inhibition and is synergistic with respect to both choline and ATP. A model of inhibition for RSM-932A in which this inhibitor traps p.f.-ChoK in a phosphorylated intermediate state blocking phosphate transfer to choline is presented. Importantly, MN58b and RSM-932A have in vitro inhibitory activity in the low nanomolar range and are equally effective against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains. RSM-932A and MN58b significantly reduced parasitemia and induced the accumulation of trophozoites and schizonts, blocking intraerythrocytic development and interfering with parasite egress or invasion, suggesting a delay of the parasite maturation stage. The present data provide two new potent structures for the development of antimalarial compounds and validate p.f.-ChoK as an accessible drug target against the parasite.	0
Abstract2class: Strain Prioritization and Genome Mining for Enediyne Natural Products Abstract: The enediyne family of natural products has had a profound impact on modern chemistry, biology, and medicine, and yet only 11 enediynes have been structurally characterized to date. Here we report a genome survey of 3,400 actinomycetes, identifying 81 strains that harbor genes encoding the enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes that could be grouped into 28 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Genome sequencing of 31 representative strains confirmed that each clade harbors a distinct enediyne biosynthetic gene cluster. A genome neighborhood network allows prediction of new structural features and biosynthetic insights that could be exploited for enediyne discovery. We confirmed one clade as new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, and discovered a new family of enediyne natural products, the tiancimycins (TNMs), that exhibit potent cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection.                  Importance:                       Recent advances in microbial genomics clearly revealed that the biosynthetic potential of soil actinomycetes to produce enediynes is underappreciated. A great challenge is to develop innovative methods to discover new enediynes and produce them in sufficient quantities for chemical, biological, and clinical investigations. This work demonstrated the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection. The new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, will impact the practical supply of this important drug lead. The TNMs, with their extremely potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cells and their rapid and complete cancer cell killing characteristics, in comparison with the payloads used in FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are poised to be exploited as payload candidates for the next generation of anticancer ADCs. Follow-up studies on the other identified hits promise the discovery of new enediynes, radically expanding the chemical space for the enediyne family.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the pacidamycin group of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics Abstract: Pacidamycins are a family of uridyl tetra/pentapeptide antibiotics that act on the translocase MraY to block bacterial cell wall assembly. To elucidate the biosynthetic logic of pacidamcyins, a putative gene cluster was identified by 454 shotgun genome sequencing of the producer Streptomyces coeruleorubidus NRRL 18370. The 31-kb gene cluster encodes 22 proteins (PacA-V), including highly dissociated nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules and a variety of tailoring enzymes. Gene deletions confirmed that two NRPSs, PacP and PacO, are required for the biosynthesis of pacidamycins. Heterologous expression and in vitro assays of PacL, PacO, and PacP established reversible formation of m-Tyr-AMP, l-Ala-AMP, and diaminopropionyl-AMP, respectively, consistent with the amino acids found in pacidamycin scaffolds. The unusual Ala(4)-Phe(5) dipeptidyl ureido linkage was formed during in vitro assays containing purified PacL, PacJ, PacN, and PacO. Both the genetic and enzymatic studies validate identification of the biosynthetic genes for this subclass of uridyl peptide antibiotics and provide the basis for future mechanistic study of their biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical synthesis and biological activity of analogues of the lantibiotic epilancin 15X Abstract: Lantibiotics are a large family of antibacterial peptide natural products containing multiple post-translational modifications, including the thioether structures lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Efforts to probe structure-activity relationships and engineer improved pharmacological properties have driven the development of new methods to produce non-natural analogues of these compounds. In this study, solid-supported chemical synthesis was used to produce analogues of the potent lantibiotic epilancin 15X, in order to assess the importance of several N-terminal post-translational modifications for biological activity. Surprisingly, substitution of these moieties, including the unusual N-terminal D-lactyl moiety, resulted in relatively small changes in the antimicrobial activity and pore-forming ability of the peptides.	1
Abstract2class: 5S clavam biosynthesis is controlled by an atypical two-component regulatory system in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Streptomyces clavuligerus produces a collection of five clavam metabolites, including the clinically important β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, as well as four structurally related metabolites called 5S clavams. The paralogue gene cluster of S. clavuligerus is one of three clusters of genes for the production of these clavam metabolites. A region downstream of the cluster was analyzed, and snk, res1, and res2, encoding elements of an atypical two-component regulatory system, were located. Mutation of any one of the three genes had no effect on clavulanic acid production, but snk and res2 mutants produced no 5S clavams, whereas res1 mutants overproduced 5S clavams. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses showed that transcription of cvm7p (which encodes a transcriptional activator of 5S clavam biosynthesis) and 5S clavam biosynthetic genes was eliminated in snk and in res2 mutants but that snk and res2 transcription was unaffected in a cvm7p mutant. Both snk and res2 mutants could be complemented by introduction of cvm7p under the control of an independently regulated promoter. In vitro assays showed that Snk can autophosphorylate and transfer its phosphate group to both Res1 and Res2, and Snk-H365, Res1-D52, and Res2-D52 were identified as the phosphorylation sites for the system. Dephosphorylation assays indicated that Res1 stimulates dephosphorylation of Res2∼P. These results suggest a regulatory cascade in which Snk and Res2 form a two-component system controlling cvm7p transcription, with Res1 serving as a checkpoint to modulate phosphorylation levels. Cvm7P then activates transcription of 5S clavam biosynthetic genes.	1
Abstract2class: Novel key metabolites reveal further branching of the roquefortine/meleagrin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Metabolic profiling and structural elucidation of novel secondary metabolites obtained from derived deletion strains of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum were used to reassign various previously ascribed synthetase genes of the roquefortine/meleagrin pathway to their corresponding products. Next to the structural characterization of roquefortine F and neoxaline, which are for the first time reported for P. chrysogenum, we identified the novel metabolite roquefortine L, including its degradation products, harboring remarkable chemical structures. Their biosynthesis is discussed, questioning the exclusive role of glandicoline A as key intermediate in the pathway. The results reveal that further enzymes of this pathway are rather unspecific and catalyze more than one reaction, leading to excessive branching in the pathway with meleagrin and neoxaline as end products of two branches.	1
Abstract2class: Expression, purification and preliminary diffraction studies of CmlS Abstract: CmlS, a flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) present in the chloramphenicol-biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces venezuelae, directs the dichlorination of an acetyl group. The reaction mechanism of CmlS is of considerable interest as it will help to explain how the FDH family can halogenate a wide range of substrates through a common mechanism. The protein has been recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method was used to produce crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction. Data were collected to 2.0 A resolution. The crystal belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 208.1, b = 57.7, c = 59.9 A, beta = 97.5 degrees .	1
Abstract2class: Colonization and internalization of Salmonella enterica in tomato plants Abstract: The consumption of fresh tomatoes has been linked to numerous food-borne outbreaks involving various serovars of Salmonella enterica. Recent advances in our understanding of plant-microbe interactions have shown that human enteric pathogenic bacteria, including S. enterica, are adapted to survive in the plant environment. In this study, tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom) grown in sandy loam soil from Virginia's eastern shore (VES) were inoculated with S. enterica serovars to evaluate plausible internalization routes and to determine if there is any niche fitness for certain serovars. Both infested soil and contaminated blossoms can lead to low internal levels of fruit contamination with Salmonella. Salmonella serovars demonstrated a great ability to survive in environments under tomato cultivation, not only in soil but also on different parts of the tomato plant. Of the five serovars investigated, Salmonella enterica serovars Newport and Javiana were dominant in sandy loam soil, while Salmonella enterica serovars Montevideo and Newport were more prevalent on leaves and blossoms. It was also observed that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium had a poor rate of survival in all the plant parts examined here, suggesting that postharvest contamination routes are more likely in S. Typhimurium contamination of tomato fruit. Conversely, S. Newport was the most prevalent serovar recovered in both the tomato rhizosphere and phyllosphere. Plants that were recently transplanted (within 3 days) had an increase in observable internalized bacteria, suggesting that plants were more susceptible to internalization right after transplant. These findings suggest that the particular Salmonella serovar and the growth stage of the plant were important factors for internalization through the root system.	0
Abstract2class: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. II. Kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus growing in a defined medium was determined. Under these conditions, M. xanthus contains one chromosome which is replicated during 80% of the cell cycle. Stable RNA synthesis was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radioactive uridine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of stable RNA synthesis as a function of cell size was determined. Unstable RNA synthesis during the division cycle was determined by correlating the data for stable RNA synthesis with the relative amounts of stable and unstable RNA labeled during the short pulse. The data reported here demonstrate that: (i) cells synthesize both stable and unstable RNA throughout the division cycle; (ii) the rate of stable RNA synthesis increases in two discrete steps, corresponding to average ages of 0.15 and 0.75 generations; (iii) the rate of unstable RNA synthesis exhibits an initial rise, followed by a relatively constant rate of synthesis, and finally, a burst of unstable RNA synthesis prior to septum formation. The half-life of unstable RNA of M. xanthus, generation time of 390 min at 30 C, was 4 min. Comparison of the rates of stable and unstable RNA synthesis indicates noncoordinate RNA synthesis within the normal division cycle.	0
Abstract2class: Prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 are essential for activation by DOCK7 Abstract: The unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family comprising 11 DOCK180 related proteins is classified into four subfamilies, A through D, based on their relative GEF activity toward the closely related Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. DOCK proteins participate in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and are key regulators of cell motility, phagocytosis, and adhesion. Here we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of DOCK7, DHR2 (for DOCK homology region 2), is a potent GEF for prenylated Cdc42 and Rac1 in a model liposome system, demonstrating that the prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 or Rac1 are necessary for their activation by DOCK7. Additionally, we identify DOCK7 residues that confer GTPase GEF specificity. Finally, using our liposome reconstitution assay, we show that a more narrowly defined GEF domain of DHR2 (designated DHR2s) harbors an N-terminal site distinct from the GEF active site that binds preferentially to the active, GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 and thereby recruits free DHR2s from solution to the membrane surface. This recruitment results in a progressive increase in the effective concentration of DHR2s at the membrane surface that in turn provides for an accelerated rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42. The positive cooperativity observed in our reconstituted system suggests that the action of DOCK7 in vivo may involve the coordinated integration of Cdc42/Rac signaling in the context of the membrane recruitment of a DOCK7 GEF complex.	0
Abstract2class: Helix-Dependent Spin Filtering through the DNA Duplex Abstract: Recent work suggests that electrons can travel through DNA and other chiral molecules in a spin-selective manner, but little is known about the origin of this spin selectivity. Here we describe experiments on magnetized DNA-modified electrodes to explore spin-selective electron transport through hydrated duplex DNA. Our results show that the two spins migrate through duplex DNA with a different yield and that spin selectivity requires charge transport through the DNA duplex. Significantly, shifting the same duplex DNA between right-handed B- and left-handed Z-forms leads to a diode-like switch in spin selectivity; which spin moves more efficiently through the duplex depends upon the DNA helicity. With DNA, the supramolecular organization of chiral moieties, rather than the chirality of the individual monomers, determines the selectivity in spin, and thus a conformational change can switch the spin selectivity.	0
Abstract2class: Redox-Active Reagents for Photocatalytic Generation of the OCF3 Radical and (Hetero)Aryl C-H Trifluoromethoxylation Abstract: The trifluoromethoxy (OCF3 ) radical is of great importance in organic chemistry. Yet, the catalytic and selective generation of this radical at room temperature and pressure remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, the design and development of a redox-active cationic reagent (1) that enables the formation of the OCF3 radical in a controllable, selective, and catalytic fashion under visible-light photocatalytic conditions is reported. More importantly, the reagent allows catalytic, intermolecular C-H trifluoromethoxylation of a broad array of (hetero)arenes and biorelevant compounds. Experimental and computational studies suggest single electron transfer (SET) from excited photoredox catalysts to 1 resulting in exclusive liberation of the OCF3 radical. Addition of this radical to (hetero)arenes gives trifluoromethoxylated cyclohexadienyl radicals that are oxidized and deprotonated to afford the products of trifluoromethoxylation.	0
Abstract2class: New insights into the echinocandins and other fungal non-ribosomal peptides and peptaibiotics Abstract: Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a primary modality for fungal peptidic natural product assembly and are responsible for some of the best known, most useful, and most destructive fungal metabolites. Through genome sequencing and computer-assisted recognition of modular motifs of catalytic domains, one can now confidently identify most NRPS biosynthetic genes of a fungal strain. The biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for two of the most important classes of NRP fungal derived drugs, cyclosporine and the echinocandins, have been recently characterized by genomic sequencing and annotation. Complete biosynthetic gene clusters for the pneumocandins and echinocandins have been mapped at the genetic level and functionally characterized to some extent. Genomic sequencing of representative strains of most of the variants in the echinocandin family, including the wild-type of the three fungal strains employed for industrial-scale production of caspofungin, micafungin and anidulofungin, has enabled characterization of the basic architecture of the echinocandin NRPS pathways. A comparative analysis of how pathway genes cause variations in lipoinitiation, biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acids, amino acid substitutions, and hydroxylations and sulfonations of the core peptide and contribute to the molecular diversity of the family is presented. We also review new information on the natural functions of NRPs, the differences between fungal and bacterial NRPSs, and functional characterization of selected NRPS gene clusters. Continuing discovery of the new fungal nonribosomal peptides has contributed new structural diversity and potential insights into their biological functions among other natural peptides and peptaibiotics. We therefore provide an update on new peptides, depsipeptides and peptaibols discovered in the Fungi since 2009.	1
Abstract2class: Genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans bacteriophage M102 Abstract: Bacteriophage M102 is a lytic phage specific for serotype c strains of Streptococcus mutans, a causative agent of dental caries. In this study, the complete genome sequence of M102 was determined. The genome is 31,147 bp in size and contains 41 ORFs. Most of the ORFs encoding putative phage structural proteins show similarity to those from bacteriophages from Streptococcus thermophilus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the M102 genome contains an unusual lysis cassette, which encodes a holin and two lytic enzymes.	0
Abstract2class: In vitro and in vivo production of new aminocoumarins by a combined biochemical, genetic, and synthetic approach Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin, novobiocin, and coumermycin A(1) are inhibitors of bacterial gyrase. Their chemical structures contain amide bonds, formed between an aminocoumarin ring and an aromatic acyl component, which is 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate in the case of novobiocin and clorobiocin. These amide bonds are formed under catalysis of the gene products of cloL, novL, and couL, respectively. We first examined the substrate specificity of the purified amide synthetases CloL, NovL, and CouL for the various analogs of the prenylated benzoate moiety. We then generated new aminocoumarin antibiotics by feeding synthetic analogs of the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate moiety to a mutant strain defective in the biosynthesis of the prenylated benzoate moiety. This resulted in the formation of 32 new aminocoumarin compounds. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using FAB-MS and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy.	1
Abstract2class: Efficient transposition of Tn4556 by alterations in inverted repeats using a delivery vector carrying a counter-selectable marker for Streptomyces Abstract: A 6625-base pair transposon, Tn4556, was initially isolated from a Streptomyces strain and a sequence analysis was performed; however, its annotation data remain incomplete. At least three positions were identified as frameshift and base-exchange errors by resequencing. The revised sequence revealed that Tn4556 contains four open reading frames that encode transposase, methyltransferase, isoprenyl diphosphate transferase, and resolvase, respectively. Thirty-eight-base pair inverted repeat (IR) sequences at both ends contained a 1-bp mismatch flanked by a target duplication site, and transposition efficiency was improved by the replacement of imperfectly matched IR-L to perfectly matched IR-L. The detection of Tn4556 transposition was markedly facilitated using a delivery vector carrying a strictly counter-selectable marker for Streptomyces strains.	0
Abstract2class: Strict control of auricin production in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 involves a feedback mechanism Abstract: The polyketide gene cluster aur1 is responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Auricin production is regulated in a complex manner involving several regulators, including a key pathway-specific positive regulator Aur1P that belongs to the family of 'atypical' response regulators. Production of auricin is induced after entry into stationary phase. However, auricin was produced in only a short time interval of several hours. We found that the decrease of auricin production was due to a strict regulation of auricin biosynthetic genes at the transcriptional level by a feedback mechanism; auricin and/or its intermediate(s) inhibited binding of Aur1P to its cognate biosynthetic promoter aur1Ap and consequently stopped its activation. In addition, we also determined that synthesised auricin is unstable during growth of S. aureofaciens CCM3239 in the production medium even though purified auricin is stable for days in various organic solvents. The critical parameter affecting its stability was pH. Auricin is stable at acid pH and unstable at neutral and alkaline pH. The drop in auricin concentration was due to an increase of pH shortly after induction of auricin production during cultivation of S. aureofaciens CCM3239.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16-membered macrolide antibiotic FD-891: involvement of a dual functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing epoxidation and hydroxylation Abstract: FD-891 is a 16-membered cytotoxic antibiotic macrolide that is especially active against human leukemia such as HL-60 and Jurkat cells. We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Enterotoxic Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Natural Product Tilivalline Abstract: The nonribosomal enterotoxin tilivalline was the first naturally occurring pyrrolobenzodiazepine to be linked to disease in the human intestine. Since the producing organism Klebsiella oxytoca is part of the intestinal microbiota and the pyrrolobenzodiazepine causes the pathogenesis of colitis it is important to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of tilivalline activity. Here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and show that this nonribosomal peptide assembly pathway initially generates tilimycin, a simple pyrrolobenzodiazepine with cytotoxic properties. Tilivalline results from the non-enzymatic spontaneous reaction of tilimycin with biogenetically generated indole. Through a chemical total synthesis of tilimycin we could corroborate the predictions made about the biosynthesis. Production of two cytotoxic pyrrolobenzodiazepines with distinct functionalities by human gut resident Klebsiella oxytoca has important implications for intestinal disease.	1
Abstract2class: The NDP-sugar co-substrate concentration and the enzyme expression level influence the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases: cloning and characterization of deoxysugar biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces fradiae is the principal producer of urdamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a polyketide-derived aglycone, which is glycosylated with four sugar components, 2x D-olivose (first and last sugar of a C-glycosidically bound trisaccharide chain at the 9-position), and 2x L-rhodinose (in the middle of the trisaccharide chain and at the 12b-position). Limited information is available about both the biosynthesis of D-olivose and L-rhodinose and the influence of the concentration of both sugars on urdamycin biosynthesis.                  Results:                       To further investigate urdamycin biosynthesis, a 5.4 kb section of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced. Five new open reading frames (ORFs) (urdZ3, urdQ, urdR, urdS, urdT) could be identified each one showing significant homology to deoxysugar biosynthetic genes. We inactivated four of these newly allocated ORFs (urdZ3, urdQ, urdR, urdS) as well as urdZ1, a previously found putative deoxysugar biosynthetic gene. Inactivation of urdZ3, urdQ and urdZ1 prevented the mutant strains from producing L-rhodinose resulting in the accumulation of mainly urdamycinone B. Inactivation of urdR led to the formation of the novel urdamycin M, which carries a C-glycosidically attached D-rhodinose at the 9-position. The novel urdamycins N and O were detected after overexpression of urdGT1c in two different chromosomal urdGT1c deletion mutants. The mutants lacking urdS and urdQ accumulated various known diketopiperazines.                  Conclusions:                       Analysis of deoxysugar biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed a widely common biosynthetic pathway leading to D-olivose and L-rhodinose. Several enzymes responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. The pathway had to be modified compared to earlier suggestions. Two glycosyltransferases normally involved in the C-glycosyltransfer of D-olivose at the 9-position (UrdGT2) and in conversion of 100-2 to urdamycin G (UrdGT1c) show relaxed substrate specificity for their activated deoxysugar co-substrate and their alcohol substrate, respectively. They can transfer activated D-rhodinose (instead of D-olivose) to the 9-position, and attach L-rhodinose to the 4A-position normally occupied by a D-olivose unit, respectively.	1
Abstract2class: Function of lanGT3, a glycosyltransferase gene involved in landomycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The glycosyltransferase gene lanGT3, involved in the biosynthesis of the angucyclic antibiotic landomycin A, has been characterised by targeted gene deletion. A lanGT3 mutant was shown to produce landomycin E, which consists of a trisaccharide side chain attached to the polyketide moiety. Expression of lanGT3 in the mutant restored landomycin A production. Our results indicate that LanGT3 is responsible for the transfer of the fourth sugar during landomycin A biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Mining the cinnabaramide biosynthetic pathway to generate novel proteasome inhibitors Abstract: The cinnabaramides and salinosporamides are mixed PKS/NRPS natural products isolated from a terrestrial streptomycete and a marine actinomycete, respectively. They interfere with the proteasome and thus potentially inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The compounds exhibit a γ-lactam-β-lactone bicyclic ring structure attached to a cyclohexenyl unit and a PKS side chain. As a first step towards improving anticancer activity and permitting genetic approaches to novel analogues, we have cloned and characterized the cinnabaramide biosynthetic genes from Streptomyces sp. JS360. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes functionalities for the assembly of the hexyl side chain precursor. The corresponding enzymes exhibit relaxed substrate specificities towards a number of synthesized precursors, enabling production of novel chlorinated cinnabaramides. These were isolated and analyzed for activity, revealing that derivatives bearing a chlorine atom in the PKS side chain show higher inhibitory potentials towards the proteasome's proteolytic subunits (especially the trypsin and chymotrypsin units) and higher cytotoxicities towards human tumor cell lines than the parent cinnabaramide A. Although their activities towards the proteasome were weaker than that of salinosporamide A, the cinnabaramides were found to inhibit the growth of various fungi with greater potency.	1
Abstract2class: High-throughput bead-based identification of structure-switching aptamer beacons Abstract: We describe a new platform to identify structure-switching DNA beacon aptamers, which detect small molecules in a specific manner. By clonally amplifying a DNA library designed to fluoresce in response to binding events onto microbeads, aptamer beacons can be selected by stringent fluorescence-assisted sorting. We validated this method by isolating known and novel anti-steroid aptamers from two separate DNA libraries that were structurally enriched with three-way junctions. Importantly, aptamers were retrieved in only a few (three) rounds of selection by this approach and did not require further optimization, significantly streamlining the process of beacon development.	0
Abstract2class: The ppuI-rsaL-ppuR quorum-sensing system regulates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 by controlling biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides putisolvins I and II Abstract: Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 produces two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess surface tension-reducing abilities and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down existing biofilms of several Pseudomonas spp., including P. aeruginosa. Putisolvins are secreted in the culture medium during growth at late exponential phase, indicating that production is possibly regulated by quorum sensing. In the present study, we identified a quorum-sensing system in PCL1445 that is composed of ppuI, rsaL, and ppuR and shows very high similarity with gene clusters of P. putida strains IsoF and WCS358. Strains with mutations in ppuI and ppuR showed a severe reduction of putisolvin production. Expression analysis of the putisolvin biosynthetic gene in a ppuI background showed decreased expression, which could be complemented by the addition of synthetic 3-oxo-C(10)-N-acyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(10)-AHL) or 3-oxo-C(12)-AHL to the medium. An rsaL mutant overproduces AHLs, and production of putisolvins is induced early during growth. Analysis of biofilm formation on polyvinylchloride showed that ppuI and ppuR mutants produce a denser biofilm than PCL1445, which correlates with decreased production of putisolvins, whereas an rsaL mutant shows a delay in biofilm production, which correlates with early production of putisolvins. The results demonstrate that quorum-sensing signals induce the production of cyclic lipopeptides putisolvin I and II and consequently control biofilm formation by Pseudomonas putida.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and transcriptional organization of a gene cluster involved in biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin, a siderophore produced by Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606T Abstract: In order to assimilate iron, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606(T) produces a siderophore named acinetobactin (Ab) that is composed of equimolar quantities of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), L-threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine. Application of the Fur titration assay system to A. baumannii genomic libraries, followed by further cloning of the regions surrounding the candidate genes, led to the identification of the Ab cluster, which harbours the genetic determinants necessary for the biosynthesis and transport of the siderophore. However, an entA homologue essential for DHBA biosynthesis was not found in this cluster. Functions of potential biosynthetic genes inferred by homology studies suggested that the precursors, DHBA, l-threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine, are linked in steps resembling those of bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthesis to form Ab. Genes responsible for the two-step biosynthesis of N-hydroxyhistamine from histidine were also identified in this cluster. Their genetic organization suggests that five genes involved in the transport system of ferric Ab into the cell cytosol form an operon. Construction of disruptants of some selected genes followed by phenotypic analysis supported their predicted biological functions. Interestingly, three additional genes probably involved in the intracellular release of iron from ferric Ab and the secretion of nascent Ab are contained in this cluster. Primer extension and RT-PCR analyses suggested that the Ab cluster, which includes 18 genes, is organized in seven transcriptional units originating from respective Fur-regulated promoter-operator regions.	1
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of sorangipyranone - a new γ-dihydropyrone from the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 Abstract: Sorangipyranone was isolated as a novel natural product featuring a unique 2,3-dihydro-γ-4H-pyrone scaffold from cultures of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020. We report here the full structure elucidation of sorangipyranone by spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry together with the analysis of the biosynthetic pathway. Determination of the absolute configuration was performed by time-dependent density functional theory-electronic circular dichroism calculations and determination of the applicability of the Snatzke's helicity rule, to correlate the high-wavelength n→π* electronic circular dichroism (ECD) transition and the absolute configuration of the 2,3-dihydro-4H-γ-pyrone, was done by the analysis of low-energy conformers and the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Sorangipyranone outlines a new class of a γ-dihydropyrone-containing natural product comprised of malonyl-CoA-derived building blocks and features a unique polyketide scaffold. In silico analysis of the genome sequence of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 complemented with feeding experiments employing stable isotope-labeled precursors allowed the identification and annotation of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. A model for the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the γ-dihydropyrone scaffold is presented in this study.	1
Abstract2class: Co-occurrence of enzyme domains guides the discovery of an oxazolone synthetase Abstract: Multidomain enzymes orchestrate two or more catalytic activities to carry out metabolic transformations with increased control and speed. Here, we report the design and development of a genome-mining approach for targeted discovery of biochemical transformations through the analysis of co-occurring enzyme domains (CO-ED) in a single protein. CO-ED was designed to identify unannotated multifunctional enzymes for functional characterization and discovery based on the premise that linked enzyme domains have evolved to function collaboratively. Guided by CO-ED, we targeted an unannotated predicted ThiF-nitroreductase di-domain enzyme found in more than 50 proteobacteria. Through heterologous expression and biochemical reconstitution, we discovered a series of natural products containing the rare oxazolone heterocycle and characterized their biosynthesis. Notably, we identified the di-domain enzyme as an oxazolone synthetase, validating CO-ED-guided genome mining as a methodology with potential broad utility for both the discovery of unusual enzymatic transformations and the functional annotation of multidomain enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Effect of Temperature-Shift and Temperature-Constant Cultivation on the Monacolin K Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Expression in Monascus sp Abstract: In this study, the effects of temperature-shift (from 30 to 25 °C) and temperature-constant (at 30 °C) cultivation on the mass of Monascus fuliginosus CG-6 mycelia and concentration of the produced monacolin K (MK) were monitored. The expression levels of the MK biosynthetic genes of M. fuliginosus CG-6 at constant and variable culture temperatures were analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The total protein was collected and determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results showed that the maximum mycelial mass in temperature-shift cultivation was only 0.477 g of dry cell mass per dish, which was lower than that in temperature-constant cultivation (0.581 g of dry cell mass per dish); however, the maximum concentration of MK in temperature-shift cultivation (34.5 µg/mL) was 16 times higher than that in temperature-constant cultivation at 30 °C (2.11 µg/mL). Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of the MK biosynthetic gene cluster at culture temperature of 25 °C was higher than that at 30 °C, which was similar to the trend of the MK concentration, except for individual MK B and MK C genes. Analysis of differential protein expression revealed that 2016 proteins were detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The expression level of efflux pump protein coded by the MK I gene exhibited the same upregulated trend as the expression of MK I in temperature-shift cultivation. Temperature-shift cultivation enhanced the expression of proteins in the secondary metabolite production pathway, but suppressed the expression of proteins involved in the mycelial growth.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Alternative Producers of the Enediyne Antitumor Antibiotic C-1027 with High Titers Abstract: The potent cytotoxicity and unique mode of action make the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 an exquisite drug candidate for anticancer chemotherapy. However, clinical development of C-1027 has been hampered by its low titer from the original producer Streptomyces globisporus C-1027. Here we report three new C-1027 alternative producers, Streptomyces sp. CB00657, CB02329, and CB03608, from The Scripps Research Institute actinomycetes strain collection. Together with the previously disclosed Streptomyces sp. CB02366 strain, four C-1027 alternative producers with C-1027 titers of up to 11-fold higher than the original producer have been discovered. The five C-1027 producers, isolated from distant geographic locations, are distinct Streptomyces strains based on morphology and taxonomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis of the five C-1027 producers reveal that their C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are all located on giant plasmids of varying sizes. The high nucleotide sequence similarity among the five C-1027 BGCs implies that they most likely have evolved from a common ancestor.	0
Abstract2class: Synthetic biotechnology to study and engineer ribosomal bottromycin biosynthesis Abstract: Bottromycins represent a promising class of antibiotics binding to the therapeutically unexploited A-site of the bacterial ribosome. By inhibiting translation they are active against clinically important pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Structurally, bottromycins are heavily modified peptides exhibiting various unusual biosynthetic features. To set the stage for compound modification and yield optimization, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster, used synthetic biotechnology approaches to establish and improve heterologous production, and generated analogs by pathway genetic engineering. We unambiguously identified three radical SAM methyltransferase-encoding genes required for various methylations at unactivated carbons yielding tert-butyl valine, methyl-proline, and β-methyl-phenylalanine residues, plus a gene involved in aspartate methyl-ester formation. Evidence for the formation of the exo-thiazole unit and for a macrocyclodehydration mechanism leading to amidine ring formation is provided.	1
Abstract2class: Shared biosynthesis of the saliniketals and rifamycins in Salinispora arenicola is controlled by the sare1259-encoded cytochrome P450 Abstract: Saliniketals A and B are unusual polyketides from the marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola that inhibit ornithine decarboxylase induction. The structural similarities between the saliniketals and the ansa chain of the potent rifamycin antibiotics, which co-occur in the fermentation broth, suggest a common origin between the two compound classes. Using PCR-directed mutagenesis, chemical complementation studies, and stable isotope feeding experiments, we showed that the saliniketals are byproducts of the rifamycin biosynthetic pathway diverging at the stage of 34a-deoxyrifamycin W. Our results suggest that a single enzyme, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded by sare1259, catalyzes multiple oxidative rearrangement reactions on 34a-deoxyrifamyin W to yield both the saliniketal and rifamycin structural classes.	1
Abstract2class: 4-Aminophthalimide Amino Acids as Small and Environment-Sensitive Fluorescent Probes for Transmembrane Peptides Abstract: Fluorescence probing of transmembrane (TM) peptides is needed to complement state-of-the art methods-mainly oriented circular dichroism and solid-state NMR spectroscopy-and to allow imaging in living cells. Three new amino acids incorporating the solvatofluorescent 4-aminophthalimide in their side chains were synthesized in order to examine the local polarity in the α-helical TM fragment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor. It was possible to distinguish their locations, either in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer or at the membrane surface, by fluorescence readout, including blue shift and increased quantum yield. An important feature is the small size of the 4-aminophthalimide chromophore. It makes one of the new amino acids approximately isosteric to tryptophan, typically used as a very small fluorescent amino acid in peptides and proteins. In contrast to the only weakly fluorescent indole system in tryptophan, the 4-aminophthalimide moiety produces a significantly more informative fluorescence readout and is selectively excited outside the biopolymer absorption range.	0
Abstract2class: Tricarbocyclic core formation of tyrosine-decahydrofluorenes implies a three-enzyme cascade with XenF-mediated sigmatropic rearrangement as a prerequisite Abstract: Tyrosine-decahydrofluorene derivatives feature a fused [6.5.6] tricarbocyclic core and a 13-membered para-cyclophane ether. Herein, we identified new xenoacremones A, B, and C (1-3) from the fungal strain Xenoacremonium sinensis ML-31 and elucidated their biosynthetic pathway using gene deletion in the native strain and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. The hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) XenE together with enoyl reductase XenG were confirmed to be responsible for the formation of the tyrosine-nonaketide skeleton. This skeleton was subsequently dehydrated by XenA to afford a pyrrolidinone moiety. XenF catalyzed a novel sigmatropic rearrangement to yield a key cyclohexane intermediate as a prerequisite for the formation of the multi-ring system. Subsequent oxidation catalyzed by XenD supplied the substrate for XenC to link the para-cyclophane ether, which underwent subsequent spontaneous Diels-Alder reaction to give the end products. Thus, the results indicated that three novel enzymes XenF, XenD, and XenC coordinate to assemble the [6.5.6] tricarbocyclic ring and para-cyclophane ether during biosynthesis of complex tyrosine-decahydrofluorene derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Recurrent circuits within medial entorhinal cortex superficial layers support grid cell firing Abstract: Specialized cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), such as speed cells, head direction (HD) cells, and grid cells, are thought to support spatial navigation. To determine whether these computations are dependent on local circuits, we record neuronal activity in mEC layers II and III and optogenetically perturb locally projecting layer II pyramidal cells. We find that sharply tuned HD cells are only weakly responsive while speed, broadly tuned HD cells, and grid cells show pronounced transient excitatory and inhibitory responses. During the brief period of feedback inhibition, there is a reduction in specifically grid accuracy, which is corrected as firing rates return to baseline. These results suggest that sharp HD cells are embedded in a separate mEC sub-network from broad HD cells, speed cells, and grid cells. Furthermore, grid tuning is not only dependent on local processing but also rapidly updated by HD, speed, or other afferent inputs to mEC.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic Encoding of a Bioconjugation Handle for [2+2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions Abstract: Protein bioconjugates have many critical applications, especially in the development of therapeutics. Consequently, the design of novel methodologies to prepare protein bioconjugates is of great importance. Herein we present the development and optimization of a novel strategy to prepare bioconjugates through a genetically encoded [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. To do this, a novel unnatural amino acid (UAA) containing a dipropargyl amine functionality was synthesized and incorporated site specifically. This UAA-containing protein was reacted with an alkyne-containing fluorophore to afford a covalently linked, well-defined protein bioconjugate. This reaction is convenient with an optimized reaction time of just two hours at room temperature and yields a stable, polysubstituted benzene ring. Overall, this work contributes a new bioconjugation strategy to the growing toolbox of reactions to develop protein bioconjugates, which have a myriad of applications.	0
Abstract2class: Live-cell fluorescence imaging reveals dynamic production and loss of bacterial flagella Abstract: Bacterial flagella are nanomachines that drive bacteria motility and taxis in response to environmental changes. Whether flagella are permanent cell structures and, if not, the circumstances and timing of their production and loss during the bacterial life cycle remain poorly understood. Here we used the single polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus as our model and implementing in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB) in a population varies substantially across different growth phases. In the early-exponential phase, the PFB increases rapidly through the widespread production of flagella. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaks at around 76% and the partitioning of flagella between the daughter cells are 1:1 and strictly at the old poles. After entering the stationary phase, the PFB starts to decline, mainly because daughter cells stop making new flagella after cell division. Interestingly, we observed that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, though cell division has long been suspended. Further experimental investigations confirmed that flagella were ejected in V. alginolyticus, starting from breakage in the rod. Our results highlight the dynamic production and loss of flagella during the bacterial life cycle. IMPORTANCE: Flagella motility is critical for many bacterial species. The bacterial flagellum is made up of about 20 different types of proteins in its final structure and can be self-assembled. The current understanding of the lifetime and durability of bacterial flagella is very limited. In the present study, we monitored Vibrio alginolyticus flagellar assembly and loss by in vivo fluorescence labeling, and found that the percentage of flagellated bacteria varies substantially across different growth phases. The production of flagella was synchronized with cell growth but stopped when cells entered the stationary phase. Surprisingly, we observed that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, as well as in the low glucose buffering medium. We then confirmed the ejection of flagella in V. alginolyticus started with breakage of the rod. Our results highlight the dynamic production and loss of flagella during the bacterial life cycle.	0
Abstract2class: Holomycin, an Antibiotic Secondary Metabolite, Is Required for Biofilm Formation by the Native Producer Photobacterium galatheae S2753 Abstract: While the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms are widely studied, it remains less well understood how antibiotics affect the physiology of the native producing organisms. Here, using a marine bacterium, Photobacterium galatheae S2753, that produces the antibiotic holomycin, we generated a holomycin-deficient strain by in-frame deletion of hlmE, the core gene responsible for holomycin production. Mass spectrometry analysis of cell extracts confirmed that the ΔhlmE strain did not produce holomycin and that the mutant was devoid of antibacterial activity. Biofilm formation of the ΔhlmE strain was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type S2753 and was restored in an hlmE complementary mutant. Consistent with this, exogenous holomycin, but not its dimethylated and less antibacterial derivative, S,S'-dimethyl holomycin, restored the biofilm formation of the ΔhlmE strain. Furthermore, zinc starvation was found to be essential for both holomycin production and biofilm formation of S2753, although the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Collectively, these data suggest that holomycin promotes biofilm formation of S2753 via its ene-disulfide group. Lastly, the addition of holomycin at subinhibitory concentrations also enhanced the biofilms of four other Vibrionaceae strains. P. galatheae likely gains an ecological advantage from producing holomycin as both an antibiotic and a biofilm stimulator, which facilitates nutrition acquisition and protects P. galatheae from environmental stresses. Studying the function of antibiotic compounds in the native producer will shed light on their roles in nature and could point to novel bioprospecting strategies.IMPORTANCE Despite the societal impact of antibiotics, their ecological functions remain elusive and have mostly been studied by exposing nonproducing bacteria to subinhibitory concentrations. Here, we studied the effects of the antibiotic holomycin on its native producer, Photobacterium galatheae S2753, a Vibrionaceae bacterium. Holomycin provides a distinct advantage to S2753 both as an antibiotic and by enhancing biofilm formation in the producer. Vibrionaceae species successfully thrive in global marine ecosystems, where they play critical ecological roles as free-living, symbiotic, or pathogenic bacteria. Genome mining has demonstrated that many have the potential to produce several bioactive compounds, including P. galatheae To unravel the contribution of the microbial metabolites to the development of marine microbial ecosystems, better insight into the function of these compounds in the producing organisms is needed. Our finding provides a model to pursue this and highlights the ecological importance of antibiotics to the fitness of the producing organisms.	1
Abstract2class: Piperazine ring formation by a single-module NRPS and cleavage by an α-KG-dependent nonheme iron dioxygenase in brasiliamide biosynthesis Abstract: Brasiliamides are a class of piperazine-containing alkaloids produced by Penicillium brasilianum with a range of pharmaceutical activities. The mechanism of brasiliamide biosynthesis, including piperazine ring formation and multiple tailoring modifications, still remains unclear. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of brasiliamides, brs, was identified from the marine-derived fungal strain Penicillium brasilianum WZXY-M122-9. Deletion of a histone deacetylase-encoding gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system led to the production of a new compound, namely brasiliamide I (1). The brs-encoded single-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) BrsA is involved in the formation of the piperazine skeleton of brasiliamides. Full-length BrsA protein (113.6 kDa) was purified, and reconstitution of enzymatic activity in vitro confirmed that BrsA stereoselectively accepts L-phenylalanine as the substrate. Multiple deletion of tailoring genes and analysis of purified proteins in vitro enabled us to propose a brasiliamide biosynthetic pathway. In the tailoring steps, an α-ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent nonheme iron dioxygenase, BrsJ, was identified to catalyze piperazine ring cleavage during biosynthesis of brasiliamide A (2). KEY POINTS: The gene cluster encoding brasiliamide biosynthesis, brs, is identified. Deletion of a histone deacetylase-encoding gene produces brasiliamide I. BrsA catalyzes brasiliamide piperazine skeleton formation. BrsJ catalyzes piperazine ring cleavage to produce brasiliamide A. Graphical abstract.	1
Abstract2class: (4+1) vs (4+2): Catalytic Intramolecular Coupling between Cyclobutanones and Trisubstituted Allenes via C-C Activation Abstract: Herein we describe a rhodium-catalyzed (4+1) cyclization between cyclobutanones and allenes, which provides a distinct [4.2.1]-bicyclic skeleton containing two quaternary carbon centers. The reaction involves C-C activation of cyclobutanones and employs allenes as a one-carbon unit. A variety of functional groups can be tolerated, and a diverse range of polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed. Excellent enantioselectivity can be obtained, which is enabled by a TADDOL-derived phosphoramidite ligand. The bridged bicyclic products can be further functionalized or derivatized though simple transformations.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster enable yield improvement by overexpressing a transcriptional activator Abstract: Spiruchostatins A and B are members of the FK228-family of natural products with potent histone deacetylase inhibitory activities and antineoplastic activities. However, their production in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 is low. To improve the yield, the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster (spi) was first identified by rapid genome sequencing and characterized by genetic mutations. This spi gene cluster encodes a hybrid biosynthetic pathway similar to that encoded by the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster (dep) in Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968. Each gene cluster contains a pathway regulatory gene (spiR vs. depR), but these two genes encode transcriptional activators of different classes. Overexpression of native spiR or heterologous depR in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 resulted in 268 or 1,285 % increase of the combined titer of spiruchostatins A and B, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicates that overexpression of heterologous depR upregulates the expression of native spiR.	1
Abstract2class: Dynamics of ligand binding from 13C NMR relaxation dispersion at natural abundance Abstract: We show that Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) 13Calpha NMR relaxation dispersion measurements are a viable means for profiling mus-ms ligand dynamics involved in receptor binding. Critically, the dispersion is at natural 13C abundance; this matches typical pharmaceutical research settings in which ligand isotope-labeling is often impractical. The dispersion reveals ligand 13Calpha nuclei that experience mus-ms modulation of their chemical shifts due to binding. 13Calpha shifts are dominated by local torsion angles , psi, chi1; hence, these experiments identify flexible torsion angles that may assist complex formation. Since the experiments detect the ligand, they are viable even in the absence of a receptor structure. The mus-ms dynamic information gained helps establish flexibility-activity relationships. We apply these experiments to study the binding of a phospho-peptide substrate ligand to the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1.	0
Abstract2class: Characterisation of the biosynthetic pathway to agnestins A and B reveals the reductive route to chrysophanol in fungi Abstract: Two new dihydroxy-xanthone metabolites, agnestins A and B, were isolated from Paecilomyces variotii along with a number of related benzophenones and xanthones including monodictyphenone. The structures were elucidated by NMR analyses and X-ray crystallography. The agnestin (agn) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and targeted gene disruptions of the PKS, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, and other oxido-reductase genes revealed new details of fungal xanthone biosynthesis. In particular, identification of a reductase responsible for in vivo anthraquinone to anthrol conversion confirms a previously postulated essential step in aromatic deoxygenation of anthraquinones, e.g. emodin to chrysophanol.	1
Abstract2class: In Vivo Profiling of a Natural Alkaloid, Anatabine, in Rodents: Pharmacokinetics and Anti-Inflammatory Efficacy Abstract: Natural alkaloids, a large class of plant-derived substances, have attracted considerable interest because of their pharmacological activities. In this study, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory profile of anatabine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, were characterized in rodents. Anatabine was found to be bioavailable and brain-penetrant following systemic administration. Following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg), anatabine caused a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats; in mice, it inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and simultaneously elevated the levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine in a dose-dependent manner 2 h after lipopolysaccharide challenge. Furthermore, anatabine (∼10 and ∼20 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks; inhalation exposure) had effects in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, reducing neurological deficits and bodyweight loss. Comparative studies of the pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory activity of anatabine demonstrated its bioequivalence in rats following i.p. administration and inhalation exposure. This study not only provides the first detailed profile of anatabine pharmacokinetics in rodents but also comprehensively characterizes the anti-inflammatory activities of anatabine in acute and chronic inflammatory models. These findings provide a basis for further characterizing and optimizing the anti-inflammatory properties of anatabine.	0
Abstract2class: Glycerol kinase, the pacemaker for the dissimilation of glycerol in Escherichia coli Abstract: The activity of glycerol kinase is rate-limiting in the metabolism of glycerol by cells of Escherichia coli. A mutant strain producing a glycerol kinase resistant to inhibition by fructose-1,6-diphosphate grows faster than its wild-type parent on glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy. The amount of intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate was determined for wild-type cells growing exponentially on glycerol. The water content of such cells was also determined, allowing calculation of the intracellular concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. This value, 1.7 mm, is adequate to exert substantial inhibition on the wild-type glycerol kinase. The desensitization of glycerol kinase to feedback inhibition also enhances the power of glycerol to exert catabolite repression, both on the enzymes of the glycerol system itself and on those of the lactose system. However, desensitization of glycerol kinase alone does not eliminate the phenomenon of diauxic growth in a glucose-glycerol medium. Biphasic growth in such a medium is abolished if the altered enzyme is produced constitutively. The constitutive production of the mutant kinase at high levels, however, renders the cells vulnerable to glycerol. Thus, when the cells have been grown on a carbon source with a low power for catabolite repression, e.g., succinate, sudden exposure to glycerol leads to overconsumption of the nutrient and cell death.	0
Abstract2class: Bicyclic core estrogens as full antagonists: synthesis, biological evaluation and structure-activity relationships of estrogen receptor ligands based on bridged oxabicyclic core arylsulfonamides Abstract: Compounds that block estrogen action through the estrogen receptor (ER) or downregulate ER levels are useful for the treatment of breast cancer and endocrine disorders. In our search for structurally novel estrogens having three-dimensional core scaffolds, we found some compounds with a 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core that bound well to the ERs. The best of these compounds, a phenyl sulfonate ester (termed OBHS for oxabicycloheptene sulfonate), was a partial antagonist on both ERα and ERβ. Although OBHS bears no structural resemblance to other estrogen antagonists, it appears to achieve its partial antagonist character by stabilizing a novel conformation of the ER that involves a significant distortion of helix-11. To enhance the antagonist properties of these oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core ligands, we expanded the functional diversity of OBHS by replacing the sulfonate with secondary or tertiary sulfonamides (-SO(2)NR-), isoelectronic and potentially isostructural molecular replacements. An array of 16 OBHS sulfonamide analogues were prepared through a Diels-Alder reaction of a 3,4-diarylfuran using various N-aryl vinyl sulfonamide dienophiles. While the more polar secondary sulphonamides were weak ligands, certain of the tertiary sulfonamides had very good ER binding affinity. In HepG2 cell reporter gene assays, the sulphonamides had moderate potency, but they showed lower intrinsic transcriptional activity on ERα than the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) hydroxytamoxifen or OBHS, and they were inverse agonists on ERβ. Thus, the behaviour of these OBH-sulfonamides more closely mirrors the activity of full antagonists like the drug fulvestrant (ICI 182 780), and their greater antagonist biocharacter appears to arise from an accentuated distortion of helix-11.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular cloning, sequence analysis and functional characterization of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of K-252a and its analogs Abstract: Among the indolocarbazole alkaloids of antitumor antibiotics, K-252a represents a structurally unique indolocarbazole glycoside and exhibits potent neuroprotective and broad anticancer activities. K-252a consists of K-252c and the unusual dihydrostreptose moiety, linked together with oxidative and glycosidic C-N bonds. Herein, we reported a complete sequence of an approximately 45 kb genomic fragment harboring the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole alkaloids in Nocardiopsis sp. K-252 (NRRL15532). The sequence of 35 open reading frames discovered several new, critical genes, hence shedding new light on biosynthesis, resistance and regulation of K-252a and its analogs. To functionally characterize the gene cluster in vitro and in enzyme level, a multigene expression cassette containing the K-252c biosynthetic genes was constructed and successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli to yield soluble proteins for cell-free tandem enzymatic assays. Consequently, the heterologous expression with soluble NokA and NokB led to in vitro production of chromopyrrolic acid (CPA), thereby providing functional evidence for K-252c biosynthesis. Moreover, a facile production of CPA in culture broth was successfully accomplished by using an in vivo biotransformation of L-tryptophan with E. coli harboring the gene cassette. Importantly, by sequence analysis and the functional characterization here and in the companion paper, biosynthetic pathways leading to formation of K-252a and its analogs were hence proposed. Together, the results provide critical information and materials useful for combinatorial biosynthesis of K-252a and its analogs for therapeutic applications.	1
Abstract2class: AoiQ Catalyzes Geminal Dichlorination of 1,3-Diketone Natural Products Abstract: Enzymes that can perform halogenation of aliphatic carbons are of significant interest to the synthetic and biocatalysis communities. Here we describe the characterization of AoiQ, a single-component flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes gem-dichlorination of 1,3-diketone substrates in the biosynthesis of dichlorodiaporthin. AoiQ represents the first biochemically reconstituted FDH that can halogenate an enolizable sp3-hybridized carbon atom.	1
Abstract2class: Coumarin formation in novobiocin biosynthesis: beta-hydroxylation of the aminoacyl enzyme tyrosyl-S-NovH by a cytochrome P450 NovI Abstract: Background:                       Coumarin group antibiotics, such as novobiocin, coumermycin A1 and clorobiocin, are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. These antibiotics have been isolated from various Streptomyces species and all possess a 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin moiety as their structural core. Prior labeling experiments on novobiocin established that the coumarin moiety was derived from L-tyrosine, probably via a beta-hydroxy-tyrosine (beta-OH-Tyr) intermediate. Recently the novobiocin gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides was cloned and sequenced and allows analysis of the biosynthesis of the coumarin at the biochemical level using overexpressed and purified proteins.                  Results:                       Two open reading frames (ORFs), NovH and NovI, from the novobiocin producer S. spheroides have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized for tyrosine activation and oxygenation which are the initial steps in coumarin formation. The 65 kDa NovH has two predicted domains, an adenylation (A) and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), reminiscent of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Purified NovH catalyzes L-tyrosyl-AMP formation by its A domain, can be posttranslationally phosphopantetheinylated on the PCP domain, and accumulates the covalent L-tyrosyl-S-enzyme intermediate on the holo PCP domain. The second enzyme in the pathway, NovI, is a 45 kDa heme protein that functions as a cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase with specificity for the tyrosyl-S-NovH acyl enzyme. The product beta-OH-tyrosyl-S-NovH was detected by alkaline release and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radioactive [3H]beta-OH-Tyr and by mass spectrometry. Also detected was 4-OH-benzaldehyde, a retro aldol breakdown product of beta-OH-Tyr. The amino acid released was (3R,2S)-3-OH-Tyr by comparison with authentic standards.                  Conclusions:                       This work establishes that NovH and NovI are responsible for the formation of a beta-OH-Tyr intermediate that is covalently tethered to NovH in novobiocin biosynthesis. Comparable A-PCP/P450 pairs for amino acid beta-hydroxylation are found in various biosynthetic gene clusters, such as ORF19/ORF20 in the chloroeremomycin cluster for tyrosine, CumC/CumD in the coumermycin A1 cluster for tyrosine, and NikP1/NikQ in the nikkomycin cluster for histidine. This phenomenon of covalent docking of the amino acid in a kinetically stable thioester linkage prior to chemical modification by downstream tailoring enzymes, could represent a common strategy for controlling the partitioning of the amino acid for incorporation into secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Mechanistic analysis of a type II polyketide synthase. Role of conserved residues in the beta-ketoacyl synthase-chain length factor heterodimer Abstract: Type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of multienzyme systems that catalyze the biosynthesis of polyfunctional aromatic natural products such as actinorhodin, frenolicin, tetracenomycin, and doxorubicin. A central component in each of these systems is the beta-ketoacyl synthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) heterodimer. In the presence of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and a malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyl transferase (MAT), this enzyme synthesizes a polyketide chain of defined length from malonyl-CoA. We have investigated the role of the actinorhodin KS-CLF in priming, elongation, and termination of its octaketide product by subjecting the wild-type enzyme and selected mutants to assays that probe key steps in the overall catalytic cycle. Under conditions reflecting steady-state turnover of the PKS, a unique acyl-ACP intermediate is detected that carries a long, possibly full-length, acyl chain. This species cannot be synthesized by the C169S, H309A, K341A, and H346A mutants of the KS, all of which are blocked in early steps in the PKS catalytic cycle. These four residues are universally conserved in all known KSs. Malonyl-ACP alone is sufficient for kinetically and stoichiometrically efficient synthesis of polyketides by the wild-type KS-CLF, but not by heterodimers that carry the mutations listed above. Among these mutants, C169S is an efficient decarboxylase of malonyl-ACP, but the H309A, K341A, and H346A mutants are unable to catalyze decarboxylation. Transfer of label from [(14)C]malonyl-ACP to the nucleophile at position 169 in the KS can be detected for the wild-type enzyme and for the C169S and K341A mutants, but not for the H309A mutant and only very weakly for the H346A mutant. A model is proposed for decarboxylative priming and extension of a polyketide chain by the KS, where C169 and H346 form a catalytic dyad for acyl chain attachment, H309 positions the malonyl-ACP in the active site and supports carbanion formation by interacting with the thioester carbonyl, and K341 enhances the rate of malonyl-ACP decarboxylation via electrostatic interaction. Our data also suggest that the ACP and the KS dissociate after each C-C bond forming event, and that the newly extended acyl chain is transferred back from the ACP pantetheine to the KS cysteine before dissociation can occur. Chain termination is most likely the rate-limiting step in polyketide biosynthesis. Within the act CLF, neither the universally conserved S145 residue nor Q171, which aligns with the active site cysteine of the ketosynthase, is essential for PKS activity. The results described here provide a basis for a better understanding of the catalytic cycle of type II PKSs and fatty acid synthases.	1
Abstract2class: High-titer heterologous production in E. coli of lyngbyatoxin, a protein kinase C activator from an uncultured marine cyanobacterium Abstract: Many chemically complex cyanobacterial polyketides and nonribosomal peptides are of great pharmaceutical interest, but the levels required for exploitation are difficult to achieve from native sources. Here we develop a framework for the expression of these multifunctional cyanobacterial assembly lines in Escherichia coli using the lyngbyatoxin biosynthetic pathway, derived from a marine microbial assemblage dominated by the cyanobacterium Moorea producens. Heterologous expression of this pathway afforded high titers of both lyngbyatoxin A (25.6 mg L(-1)) and its precursor indolactam-V (150 mg L(-1)). Production, isolation, and identification of all expected chemical intermediates of lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis in E. coli also confirmed the previously proposed biosynthetic route, setting a solid chemical foundation for future pathway engineering. The successful production of the nonribosomal peptide lyngbyatoxin A in E. coli also opens the possibility for future heterologous expression, characterization, and exploitation of other cyanobacterial natural product pathways.	1
Abstract2class: TNF-induced structural joint damage is mediated by IL-1 Abstract: Blocking TNF effectively inhibits inflammation and structural damage in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, so far it is unclear whether the effect of TNF is a direct one or indirect on up-regulation of other mediators. IL-1 may be one of these candidates because it has a central role in animal models of arthritis, and inhibition of IL-1 is used as a therapy of human RA. We removed the effects of IL-1 from a TNF-mediated inflammatory joint disease by crossing IL-1alpha and beta-deficient mice (IL-1-/-) with arthritic human TNF-transgenic (hTNFtg) mice. Development of synovial inflammation was almost unaffected on IL-1 deficiency, but bone erosion and osteoclast formation were significantly reduced in IL-1-/-hTNFtg mice, compared with hTNFtg mice based on an intrinsic differentiation defect of IL-1-deficient monocytes. Most dramatically, however, cartilage damage was absent in IL-1-/-hTNFtg mice. Chimera studies revealed that protection of cartilage is based on the loss of IL-1 on hematopoietic, but not mesenchymal, cells, leading to decreased expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-3. These data show that TNF-mediated cartilage damage is completely and TNF-mediated bone damage is partially dependent on IL-1, suggesting that IL-1 is a crucial mediator for inflammatory cartilage and bone degradation.	0
Abstract2class: Comparative genomics of citric-acid-producing Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 versus enzyme-producing CBS 513.88 Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger exhibits great diversity in its phenotype. It is found globally, both as marine and terrestrial strains, produces both organic acids and hydrolytic enzymes in high amounts, and some isolates exhibit pathogenicity. Although the genome of an industrial enzyme-producing A. niger strain (CBS 513.88) has already been sequenced, the versatility and diversity of this species compel additional exploration. We therefore undertook whole-genome sequencing of the acidogenic A. niger wild-type strain (ATCC 1015) and produced a genome sequence of very high quality. Only 15 gaps are present in the sequence, and half the telomeric regions have been elucidated. Moreover, sequence information from ATCC 1015 was used to improve the genome sequence of CBS 513.88. Chromosome-level comparisons uncovered several genome rearrangements, deletions, a clear case of strain-specific horizontal gene transfer, and identification of 0.8 Mb of novel sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms per kilobase (SNPs/kb) between the two strains were found to be exceptionally high (average: 7.8, maximum: 160 SNPs/kb). High variation within the species was confirmed with exo-metabolite profiling and phylogenetics. Detailed lists of alleles were generated, and genotypic differences were observed to accumulate in metabolic pathways essential to acid production and protein synthesis. A transcriptome analysis supported up-regulation of genes associated with biosynthesis of amino acids that are abundant in glucoamylase A, tRNA-synthases, and protein transporters in the protein producing CBS 513.88 strain. Our results and data sets from this integrative systems biology analysis resulted in a snapshot of fungal evolution and will support further optimization of cell factories based on filamentous fungi.	1
Abstract2class: The type II O-antigenic polysaccharide moiety of Burkholderia pseudomallei lipopolysaccharide is required for serum resistance and virulence Abstract: Melioidosis, an infection caused by the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in south-east Asia and northern Australia. Acute septicaemic melioidosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in north-east Thailand. B. pseudomallei is highly resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum (NHS), and we have found that B. pseudomallei 1026b multiplies in 10-30% NHS. We developed a simple screen for the identification of serum-sensitive mutants based on this novel phenotype. Approximately 1200 Tn5-OT182 mutants were screened, and three serum-sensitive mutants were identified. The type II O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) moiety of lipopolysaccharide was not present in the serum-sensitive mutants. A representative serum-sensitive mutant, SRM117, was killed by the alternative pathway of complement and was less virulent than 1026b in three animal models of melioidosis. The Tn5-OT182 integrations in the serum-sensitive mutants were physically linked on the B. pseudomallei chromosome, and further genetic analysis of this locus revealed a cluster of 15 genes required for type II O-PS production. The proteins encoded by these genes were similar to proteins involved in bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. The results presented here demonstrate that type II O-PS is essential for B. pseudomallei serum resistance and virulence.	1
Abstract2class: A PCR method to identify ochratoxin A-producing Aspergillus westerdijkiae strains on dried and aged foods Abstract: Ochratoxins are a group of mycotoxins that frequently occur as contaminants in agricultural commodities and foods, including dry-cured meats and cheeses. The fungus Aspergillus westerdijkiae is frequently isolated from aged foods and can produce ochratoxin A (OTA). However, individual strains of the fungus can have one of two OTA production phenotypes (chemotypes): OTA production and OTA nonproduction. Monitoring and early detection of OTA-producing fungi in food are the most effective strategies to manage OTA contamination. Therefore, we examined genome sequence data from five A. westerdijkiae strains isolated from the surface of cheese from southern Italy to identify genetic markers indicative of the twoOTA chemotypes. This analysis revealed a naturally occurring deletion of the OTA regulatory gene, otaR, in an OTA-nonproducing isolate.We used this information to design a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that could identify A. westerdijkiae and distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes. In this method, the PCR primers were complementary to conserved sequences flanking otaR and yielded different-sized amplicons from strains with the different chemotypes. The primers did not yield ota-region-specific amplicons from other OTA-producing species. Because the method is specific to A. westerdijkiae and can distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes, it has potential to significantly improve OTA monitoring programs.	1
Abstract2class: Rapid screening for freshwater bacterial groups by using reverse line blot hybridization Abstract: The identification of phylogenetic clusters of bacteria that are common in freshwater has provided a basis for probe design to target important freshwater groups. We present a set of 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based oligonucleotide probes specific for 15 of these freshwater clusters. The probes were applied in reverse line blot hybridization, a simple method that enables the rapid screening of PCR products from many samples against an array of probes. The optimized assay was made stringent to discriminate at approximately the single-mismatch level. This made 10 of the probes highly specific, with at least two mismatches to the closest noncluster member in the global database. Screening of PCR products from bacterioplankton of 81 diverse lakes from Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway showed that the respective probes were reactive against 5 to 100% of the lake samples. Positive reactivity of six highly specific probes showed that bacteria from actinobacterial clusters ACK-M1 and Sta2-30 and from verrucomicrobial cluster CLO-14 occurred in at least 90% of the investigated lakes. Furthermore, bacteria from alpha-proteobacterial cluster LD12 (closely related to the marine SAR11 cluster), beta-proteobacterial cluster LD28 and cyanobacterial cluster Synechococcus 6b occurred in more than 70% of the lakes. Reverse line blot hybridization is a new tool in microbial ecology that will facilitate research on distribution and habitat specificity of target species at relatively low costs.	0
Abstract2class: A fluorogenic histone deacetylase assay well suited for high-throughput activity screening Abstract: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important enzymes for the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Recent findings suggest that HDACs could be key targets for chemotherapeutic intervention in malignant diseases. A convenient and sensitive fluorogenic assay for HDAC activity would therefore expedite studies of HDAC in transcriptional regulation and in vitro screening for drug discovery. In this study, novel fluorogenic substrates of HDACs were synthesized with an epsilon-acetylated lysyl moiety and an adjacent MCA moiety at the C terminus of the peptide chain. Upon deacetylation of the acetylated lysyl moiety, molecules became substrates for trypsin, which released highly fluorescent AMC molecules in a subsequent step of the assay. The fluorescence increased in direct proportion to the amount of deacetylated substrate molecules, i.e., HDAC activity. The nonisotopic, homogeneous assay is well suited for high-throughput HDAC inhibitor screening.	0
Abstract2class: Mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibition and mycobacterial survival are uncoupled in murine macrophages Abstract: Background:                       Autophagy is a cellular response to intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria and is induced by the direct inhibitors of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a major negative regulator of autophagy. Autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition (mTOR dependent autophagy), through chemical means or starvation, leads to mycobacterial killing in infected cells. However, previous work by our group has shown that mycobacterial infection of macrophages naturally induces both autophagy and mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity (mTOR independent autophagy). In the current work, we further explore the relationship between mTOR activity and mycobacterial killing in macrophages.                  Results:                       While low concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin, Torin 1, and Torin 2, can effectively reduce or block mTOR activity in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or mycobacteria, higher concentrations (10 uM) are required to observe Mycobacterium smegmatis killing. The growth of M. smegmatis was also inhibited by high concentrations of Rapamycin in LC3B and ATG5 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that non-autophagic mechanisms might contribute to killing at high doses. Since mycobacterial killing could be observed only at fairly high concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, exceeding doses necessary to inhibit mTOR, we hypothesized that high doses of Rapamycin, the most commonly utilized mTOR inhibitor for inducing autophagic killing, may exert a direct bactericidal effect on the mycobacteria. Although a short-term treatment of mycobacteria with Rapamycin did not substantially affect mycobacterial growth, a long-term exposure to Rapamycin could impact mycobacterial growth in vitro in select species.                  Conclusions:                       This data, coupled with previous work from our laboratory, further indicates that autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition is an artificial means to increase mycobacterial killing and masks more relevant endogenous autophagic biochemistry that needs to be understood.	0
Abstract2class: Development of Autologous C5 Vaccine Nanoparticles to Reduce Intravascular Hemolysis in Vivo Abstract: The complement system is emerging as a new target for treating many diseases. For example, Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against complement component 5 (C5), has been approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in which patient erythrocytes are lysed by complement. In this study, we developed vaccines to elicit autologous anti-C5 antibody production in mice for complement inhibition. Immunization of mice with a conservative C5 xenoprotein raised high titers of IgG's against the xenogenous C5, but these antibodies did not reduce C5 activity in the blood. In contrast, an autologous mouse C5 vaccine containing multiple predicted epitopes together with a tolerance-breaking peptide was found to induce anti-C5 autoantibody production in vivo, resulting in decreased hemolytic activity in the blood. We further validated a peptide epitope within this C5 vaccine and created recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying this epitope fused with the tolerance breaking peptide. Immunizing mice with these novel nanoparticles elicited strong humoral responses against recombinant mouse C5, reduced hemolytic activity, and protected the mice from complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in a model of PNH. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that autologous C5-based vaccines could be an effective alternative or supplement for treating complement-mediated diseases such as PNH.	0
Abstract2class: Exploitation of sulfonylurea resistance marker and non-homologous end joining mutants for functional analysis in Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: The lack of techniques for rapid assembly of gene deletion vectors, paucity of selectable marker genes available for genetic manipulation and low frequency of homologous recombination are major constraints in construction of gene deletion mutants in Zymoseptoria tritici. To address these issues, we have constructed ternary vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of Z. tritici, which enable the single step assembly of multiple fragments via yeast recombinational cloning. The sulfonylurea resistance gene, which is a mutated allele of the Magnaporthe oryzae ILV2 gene, was established as a new dominant selectable marker for Z. tritici. To increase the frequency of homologous recombination, we have constructed Z. tritici strains deficient in the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA double stranded break repair by inactivating the KU70 and KU80 genes. Targeted gene deletion frequency increased to more than 85% in both Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains, compared to ⩽10% seen in the wild type parental strain IPO323. The in vitro growth and in planta pathogenicity of the Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains were comparable to strain IPO323. Together these molecular tools add significantly to the platform available for genomic analysis through targeted gene deletion or promoter replacements and will facilitate large-scale functional characterization projects in Z. tritici.	0
Abstract2class: Pseudilins: halogenated, allosteric inhibitors of the non-mevalonate pathway enzyme IspD Abstract: The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been identified as attractive targets with novel modes of action for the development of herbicides for crop protection and agents against infectious diseases. This pathway is present in many pathogenic organisms and plants, but absent in mammals. By using high-throughput screening, we identified highly halogenated marine natural products, the pseudilins, to be inhibitors of the third enzyme, IspD, in the pathway. Their activity against the IspD enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Plasmodium vivax was determined in photometric and NMR-based assays. Cocrystal structures revealed that pseudilins bind to an allosteric pocket by using both divalent metal ion coordination and halogen bonding. The allosteric mode of action for preventing cosubstrate (CTP) binding at the active site was elucidated. Pseudilins show herbicidal activity in plant assays and antiplasmodial activity in cell-based assays.	1
Abstract2class: Application of a simulation model to the prognosis of material loss in wood processing Abstract: The article discusses the influence of a sample size on the credibility of a simulation model created for the estimation of material loss in the production of a middle layer of a wooden floorboard. The study was conducted in a production company operating in the wood processing industry. Geometric characteristics of input material were captured and used to derive statistical distributions, which were then included in the simulation model. The conducted experiments indicated that the quality of the simulation model was significantly affected by the quality and quantity of the sample, on the basis of which the stochastic model is estimated. It was shown that small sample for wood processing data was insufficient to capture process variability. On the other hand, excessive sample size (80 or more observations) for the material with high natural geometric variability, involves taking into account outliers, which may lower the overall prognostic quality of the simulation model. Based on the conducted simulation experiments, the recommended sample size which allows development of a reliable model for estimation of material loss in the analyzed manufacturing process, ranges from 40 to 60 measurements.	0
Abstract2class: Effect of ammonium as nitrogen source on production of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase by Cephalosporium acremonium C-10 Abstract: Cephalosporin production by Cephalosporium acremonium strain C-10 was suppressed when the organic nitrogen source (1.2% L-asparagine) was replaced by 1.2% (NH4)2SO4. A higher level of (NH4)2SO4 (3.5%) led to even greater suppression. Ammonium repression was exerted on formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) synthetase, together with that of expandase; a lesser effect by ammonium was observed on cyclase production. Inhibition of ACV synthetase activity byammonium was also observed (ca. 50% inhibition at 250 mM NH4+).	0
Abstract2class: A new cascade halosulfonylation of 1,7-enynes toward 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones via sulfonyl radical-triggered addition/6-exo-dig cyclization Abstract: A new cascade three-component halosulfonylation of 1,7-enynes for efficient synthesis of densely functionalized 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones has been established from readily accessible arylsulfonyl hydrazides and NIS (or NBS). The reaction pathway involves in situ-generated sulfonyl radical-triggered α,β-conjugated addition/6-exo-dig cyclization/radical coupling sequence, resulting in continuous multiple bond-forming events including C-S, C-C and C-I (or C-Br) bonds to rapidly build up molecular complexity.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic and Biochemical Characterization of a Gene Operon for trans-Aconitic Acid, a Novel Nematicide from Bacillus thuringiensis Abstract: trans-Aconitic acid (TAA) is an isomer of cis-aconitic acid (CAA), an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that is synthesized by aconitase. Although TAA production has been detected in bacteria and plants for many years and is known to be a potent inhibitor of aconitase, its biosynthetic origins and the physiological relevance of its activity have remained unclear. We have serendipitously uncovered key information relevant to both of these questions. Specifically, in a search for novel nematicidal factors from Bacillus thuringiensis, a significant nematode pathogen harboring many protein virulence factors, we discovered a high yielding component that showed activity against the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita and surprisingly identified it as TAA. Comparison with CAA, which displayed a much weaker nematicidal effect, suggested that TAA is specifically synthesized by B. thuringiensis as a virulence factor. Analysis of mutants deficient in plasmids that were anticipated to encode virulence factors allowed us to isolate a TAA biosynthesis-related (tbr) operon consisting of two genes, tbrA and tbrB We expressed the corresponding proteins, TbrA and TbrB, and characterized them as an aconitate isomerase and TAA transporter, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis of the TAA biosynthetic gene cluster revealed the association of the TAA genes with transposable elements relevant for horizontal gene transfer as well as a distribution across B. cereus bacteria and other B. thuringiensis strains, suggesting a general role for TAA in the interactions of B. cereus group bacteria with nematode hosts in the soil environment. This study reveals new bioactivity for TAA and the TAA biosynthetic pathway, improving our understanding of virulence factors employed by B. thuringiensis pathogenesis and providing potential implications for nematode management applications.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of 2'-Chloropentostatin and 2'-Amino-2'-Deoxyadenosine Highlights a Single Gene Cluster Responsible for Two Independent Pathways in Actinomadura sp. Strain ATCC 39365 Abstract: 2'-Chloropentostatin (2'-Cl PTN, 2'-chloro-2'-deoxycoformycin) and 2'-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine (2'-amino dA) are two adenosine-derived nucleoside antibiotics coproduced by Actinomadura sp. strain ATCC 39365. 2'-Cl PTN is a potent adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor featuring an intriguing 1,3-diazepine ring, as well as a chlorination at C-2' of ribose, and 2'-amino dA is an adenosine analog showing bioactivity against RNA-type virus infection. However, the biosynthetic logic of them has remained poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a single gene cluster (ada) essential for the biosynthesis of 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA. Further systematic genetic investigations suggest that 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA are biosynthesized by independent pathways. Moreover, we provide evidence that a predicted cation/H+ antiporter, AdaE, is involved in the chlorination step during 2'-Cl PTN biosynthesis. Notably, we demonstrate that 2'-amino dA biosynthesis is initiated by a Nudix hydrolase, AdaJ, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP. Finally, we reveal that the host ADA (designated ADA1), capable of converting adenosine/2'-amino dA to inosine/2'-amino dI, is not very sensitive to the powerful ADA inhibitor pentostatin. These findings provide a basis for the further rational pathway engineering of 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA production.IMPORTANCE 2'-Cl PTN/PTN and 2'-amino dA have captivated the great interests of scientists, owing to their unusual chemical structures and remarkable bioactivities. However, the precise logic for their biosynthesis has been elusive for decades. Actually, the identification and elucidation of their biosynthetic pathways not only enrich the biochemical repertoire of novel enzymatic reactions but may also lay solid foundations for the pathway engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis of this family of purine nucleoside antibiotics to generate novel hybrid analogs with improved features.	1
Abstract2class: Robust circadian clocks from coupled protein-modification and transcription-translation cycles Abstract: The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus uses both a protein phosphorylation cycle and a transcription-translation cycle to generate circadian rhythms that are highly robust against biochemical noise. We use stochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable rhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation cycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or dilution rates (and compensating synthesis rates), however, the phosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus cannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate, and consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a purely posttranslational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling time drops below the 24-h clock period. At higher growth rates, a transcription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust circadian rhythms. Interestingly, although a transcription-translation cycle is necessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a phosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a transcription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. In fact, the full oscillator built from these two tightly intertwined cycles far outperforms not just each of its two components individually, but also a hypothetical system in which the two parts are coupled as in textbook models of coupled phase oscillators. Our analysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust circadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Self-assembling small molecules form nanofibrils that bind procaspase-3 to promote activation Abstract: Modulating enzyme function with small-molecule activators, as opposed to inhibitors, offers new opportunities for drug discovery and allosteric regulation. We previously identified a compound, called 1541, from a high-throughput screen (HTS) that stimulates activation of a proenzyme, procaspase-3, to generate mature caspase-3. Here we further investigate the mechanism of activation and report the surprising finding that 1541 self-assembles into nanofibrils exceeding 1 μm in length. These particles are an unanticipated outcome from an HTS that have properties distinct from standard globular protein aggregators. Moreover, 1541 nanofibrils function as a unique biocatalytic material that activates procaspase-3 via induced proximity. These studies demonstrate a novel approach for proenzyme activation through binding to fibrils, which may mimic how procaspases are naturally processed on protein scaffolds.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of inthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealing new insights into carboxamide formation Abstract: Inthomycins are polyketide antibiotics which contain a terminal carboxamide group and a triene chain. Inthomycin B (1) and its two new analogues 2 and 3 were isolated from the crude extract of Streptomyces pactum L8. Identification of the gene cluster for inthomycin biosynthesis as well as the 15N-labeled glycine incorporation into inthomycins are described. Combined with the gene deletion of the rare P450 domain in the NRPS module, a formation mechanism of carboxamide moiety in inthomycins was proposed via an oxidative release of the assembly chain assisted by the P450 domain.	1
Abstract2class: The role of two SARP family transcriptional regulators in regulation of the auricin gene cluster in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: Two regulators, Aur1P and Aur1R, have been previously found to control expression of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 in a cascade mechanism. Here, we describe the characterization of two additional regulatory genes, aur1PR2 and aur1PR3, encoding homologues of the SARP family of transcriptional activators that were identified in the upstream part of the aur1 cluster. Expression of both genes is directed by a single promoter, aur1PR2p and aur1Pr3p, respectively, induced in late exponential phase. Disruption of aur1PR2 in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 had no effect on auricin production. However, the disruption of aur1PR3 dramatically reduced auricin compared with its parental wild-type strain. Transcription from the aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of the first biosynthetic gene in the auricin gene cluster, was similarly decreased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1PR3 mutant. Transcription from the aur1PR3p promoter increased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1R mutant strain, and the TetR family negative regulator Aur1R was shown to specifically bind the aur1PR3p promoter. These results indicate a complex regulation of the auricin cluster by the additional SARP family transcriptional activator Aur1PR3.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous Expression, Biosynthetic Studies, and Ecological Function of the Selective Gq-Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), isolated from the tropical plant Ardisia crenata, is a strong and selective inhibitor of Gq proteins, making it an indispensable pharmacological tool to study Gq-related processes, as well as a promising drug candidate. Gq inhibition is a novel mode of action for defense chemicals and crucial for the ecological function of FR, as shown by in vivo experiments in mice, its affinity to insect Gq proteins, and insect toxicity studies. The uncultured endosymbiont of A. crenata was sequenced, revealing the FR nonribosomal peptide synthetase (frs) gene cluster. We here provide a detailed model of FR biosynthesis, supported by in vitro enzymatic and bioinformatic studies, and the novel analogue AC-1, which demonstrates the flexibility of the FR starter condensation domains. Finally, expression of the frs genes in E. coli led to heterologous FR production in a cultivable, bacterial host for the first time.	1
Abstract2class: New Limonoids from Melia toosendan Abstract: The root bark of Melia toosendan afforded four new limonoids with a C-19/C-29 bridged acetal structure, together with two known limonoids, 12α-hydroxyamoorastatone and its 12-acetate. The new compounds were elucidated as 1-O-acetyltrichilin H and 29-O-substituted amoorastatone derivatives, named neoazedarachins A, B and D, by spectroscopic and chemical means. Their antifeedant activity was also studied.	0
Abstract2class: Serotype identification of group B streptococci by PCR and sequencing Abstract: Group B streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is the most common cause of neonatal and obstetric sepsis and is an increasingly important cause of septicemia in elderly individuals and immunocompromised patients. Ongoing surveillance to monitor GBS serotype distribution will be needed to guide the development and use of GBS conjugate vaccines. We designed sequencing primers based on the previously published sequences of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene clusters to further define partial cps gene clusters for eight of the nine GBS serotypes (serotypes Ia to VII). Subsequently, we designed and evaluated primers to identify serotypes Ia, Ib, III, IV, V, and VI directly by PCR and all eight serotypes (serotypes Ia to VII) by sequence heterogeneity. A total of 206 clinical GBS isolates were used to compare our molecular serotype (MS) identification method with conventional serotyping (CS). All clinical isolates were assigned an MS, whereas 188 of 206 (91.3%) were assigned a serotype by use of antisera. A small number of isolates (serosubtypes III-3 and III-4) showed different serotype specificities between PCR and sequencing, but the PCR results correlated with those obtained by CS. The overall agreement between the MS identification method and CS for isolates for which results of both tests were available was 100% (188 of 188 isolates). The MS identification method is a specific and practical alternative to conventional GBS serotyping and will facilitate epidemiological studies.	1
Abstract2class: Insights in the glycosylation steps during biosynthesis of the antitumor anthracycline cosmomycin: characterization of two glycosyltransferase genes Abstract: Glycosylation pattern in cosmomycins is a distinctive feature among anthracyclines. These antitumor compounds possess two trisaccharide chains attached at C-7 and C-10, each of them with structural variability, mainly at the distal deoxysugar moieties. We have characterized a 14-kb chromosomal region from Streptomyces olindensis containing 13 genes involved in cosmomycin biosynthesis. Two of the genes, cosG and cosK, coding for glycosyltransferase were inactivated with the generation of five new derivatives. Structural elucidation of these compounds showed altered glycosylation patterns indicating the capability of both glycosyltransferases of transferring deoxysugars to both sides of the aglycone and the flexibility of CosK with respect to the deoxysugar donor. A model is proposed for the glycosylation steps during cosmomycins biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Sex-specific gene expression during asexual development of Neurospora crassa Abstract: The impact of loci that determine sexual identity upon the asexual, dominant stage of fungal life history has been well studied. To investigate their impact, expression differences between strains of different mating type during asexual development were assayed, with RNA sampled from otherwise largely isogenic mat A and mat a strains of Neurospora crassa at early, middle, and late clonal stages of development. We observed significant differences in overall gene expression between mating types across clonal development, especially at late development stages. The expression levels of mating-type genes and pheromone genes were assayed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR, revealing expression of pheromone and receptor genes in strains of both mating types in all development stages, and revealing that mating type (mat) genes were increasingly expressed over the course of asexual development. Interestingly, among differentially expressed genes, the mat A genotype more frequently exhibited a higher expression level than mat a, and demonstrated greater transcriptional regulatory dynamism. Significant up-regulation of expression was observed for many late light-responsive genes at late asexual development stages. Further investigation of the impact of light and the roles of light response genes in asexual development of both mating types are warranted.	0
Abstract2class: Programmable Nanoassemblies from Non-Assembling Homopolymers Using Ad Hoc Electrostatic Interactions Abstract: Robust nanostructures were obtained from polymers that otherwise do not assemble by using a novel approach based on electrostatic self-assembly. The essence of this strategy involves the use of divalent counterions to temporarily perturb the packing features of the ionic groups in a homopolymer, which results in a vesicle-like structure that is captured in situ through a simple crosslinking reaction. The fidelity of the assembly has been tested for molecular transport across the nanomembrane, both for the molecules encapsulated in the lumen and for those trapped in the membrane itself. The membranes are addressable for robust multifunctionalization of their surfaces and for tunable transmembrane molecular transport.	0
Abstract2class: Landornamides: Antiviral Ornithine-Containing Ribosomal Peptides Discovered through Genome Mining Abstract: Proteusins are a family of bacterial ribosomal peptides that largely remain hypothetical genome-predicted metabolites. The only known members are the polytheonamide-type cytotoxins, which have complex structures due to numerous unusual posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Cyanobacteria contain large numbers of putative proteusin loci. To investigate their chemical and pharmacological potential beyond polytheonamide-type compounds, we characterized landornamide A, the product of the silent osp gene cluster from Kamptonema sp. PCC 6506. Pathway reconstruction in E. coli revealed a peptide combining lanthionines, d-residues, and, unusually, two ornithines introduced by the arginase-like enzyme OspR. Landornamide A inhibited lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mouse cells, thus making it one of the few known anti-arenaviral compounds. These data support proteusins as a rich resource of chemical scaffolds, new maturation enzymes, and bioactivities.	1
Abstract2class: Unique features of the ketosynthase domain in a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase hybrid enzyme, tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 Abstract: Many microbial secondary metabolites are produced by multienzyme complexes comprising nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). The ketosynthase (KS) domains of polyketide synthase normally catalyze the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of acyl and malonyl blocks to extend the polyketide chain. However, the terminal KS domain in tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 (TAS1) from the fungus Pyricularia oryzae conducts substrate cyclization. Here, we report on the unique features of the KS domain in TAS1. We observed that this domain is monomeric, not dimeric as is typical for KSs. Analysis of a 1.68-Å resolution crystal structure suggests that the substrate cyclization is triggered via proton abstraction from the active methylene moiety in the substrate by a catalytic His-322 residue. Additionally, we show that TAS1 KS promiscuously accepts aminoacyl substrates and that this promiscuity can be increased by a single amino acid substitution in the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into a KS domain that accepts the amino acid-containing substrate in an NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme and provide hints to the substrate cyclization mechanism performed by the KS domain in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid.	1
Abstract2class: Virgin Olive Oil Quality Is Affected by the Microbiota that Comprise the Biotic Fraction of the Oil Abstract: This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effects of oil-borne yeasts on the physicochemical, sensorial, and health-related characteristics of virgin olive oil (VOO) during storage. Bacteria, yeasts, and molds constitute the biotic fraction of freshly produced VOO. During storage, the bacteria and molds often die after a short period, while the yeasts survive and condition the quality of VOO. To date, approximately twenty-four yeast species have been isolated from different types of olive oil and its by-products, and seven of these species have been identified as new species. The activity of some yeasts of the biotic fraction of olive oil improves the sensorial characteristics of VOO. Some yeasts can also worsen the quality of the product by allowing the appearance of defects, oxidation of polar phenols, and triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Some yeast species of VOO show in vitro beneficial health effects, such as probiotic and antioxidant activities.	0
Abstract2class: Coral Carbonic Anhydrases: Regulation by Ocean Acidification Abstract: Global change is a major threat to the oceans, as it implies temperature increase and acidification. Ocean acidification (OA) involving decreasing pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry challenges the capacity of corals to form their skeletons. Despite the large number of studies that have investigated how rates of calcification respond to ocean acidification scenarios, comparatively few studies tackle how ocean acidification impacts the physiological mechanisms that drive calcification itself. The aim of our paper was to determine how the carbonic anhydrases, which play a major role in calcification, are potentially regulated by ocean acidification. For this we measured the effect of pH on enzyme activity of two carbonic anhydrase isoforms that have been previously characterized in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. In addition we looked at gene expression of these enzymes in vivo. For both isoforms, our results show (1) a change in gene expression under OA (2) an effect of OA and temperature on carbonic anhydrase activity. We suggest that temperature increase could counterbalance the effect of OA on enzyme activity. Finally we point out that caution must, thus, be taken when interpreting transcriptomic data on carbonic anhydrases in ocean acidification and temperature stress experiments, as the effect of these stressors on the physiological function of CA will depend both on gene expression and enzyme activity.	0
Abstract2class: The principal determinants for the structure of the substrate-binding pocket are located within a central core of a biphenyl dioxygenase alpha subunit Abstract: Protein engineering by segment exchange was used to distinguish between regions of major and minor influence on the structure of the substrate-binding pocket of a biphenyl dioxygenase (BDO). Eight chimaeric enzyme systems were generated that each consisted of a hybrid hydroxylase alpha subunit (BphA1) containing segments from Burkholderia sp. strain LB400 and Rhodococcus globerulus P6, and of a hydroxylase beta subunit (BphA2), a ferredoxin (BphA3) and a ferredoxin reductase (BphA4) from strain LB400. All hybrid bphA1 genes were expressed at high levels. Seven of the resulting fusion subunits functionally interacted with the other polypeptides of the dioxygenase system to yield catalytically active enzymes. Changes in the regiospecificity of substrate attack, monitored by the formation of seventeen different dioxygenation products obtained from seven chlorobiphenyls, were used to monitor effects of segment exchanges on the structure of the BDO substrate-binding site. Exchanges of neither the beta subunit nor the N- and C-terminal regions of the alpha subunit exerted significant influences. All BDO regions that showed major effects on the substrate-binding pocket were located between approximately positions 165 and 395 of the alpha subunit. Within this part of the enzyme, in addition to segments identified previously, a subregion which is involved in ligation of the mononuclear iron significantly influenced the regiospecificity of substrate dioxygenation. Moreover, the results indicate that the construction of appropriate hybrid genes may be used as a general strategy to overcome problems in obtaining heterologous BDO activities in Escherichia coli or other host organisms.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster affording diversified tiacumicin analogues and revealing a tailoring dihalogenase Abstract: The RNA polymerase inhibitor tiacumicin B is currently undergoing phase III clinical trial for treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea with great promise. To understand the biosynthetic logic and to lay a foundation for generating structural analogues via pathway engineering, the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and characterized from the producer Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085. Sequence analysis of a 110,633 bp DNA region revealed the presence of 50 open reading frames (orfs). Functional investigations of 11 orfs by in vivo inactivation experiments, preliminarily outlined the boundaries of the tia-gene cluster and suggested that 31 orfs were putatively involved in tiacumicin B biosynthesis. Functions of a halogenase (TiaM), two glycosyltransferases (TiaG1 and TiaG2), a sugar C-methyltransferase (TiaS2), an acyltransferase (TiaS6), and two cytochrome P450s (TiaP1 and TiaP2) were elucidated by isolation and structural characterization of the metabolites from the corresponding gene-inactivation mutants. Accumulation of 18 tiacumicin B analogues from 7 mutants not only provided experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also set an example of accessing microbial natural product diversity via genetic approach. More importantly, biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase TiaM reveals a sequentially acting dihalogenation step tailoring tiacumicin B biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: A non-canonical NRPS is involved in the synthesis of fungisporin and related hydrophobic cyclic tetrapeptides in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum harbors an astonishing variety of nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes, which encode proteins known to produce complex bioactive metabolites from simple building blocks. Here we report a novel non-canonical tetra-modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) with microheterogenicity of all involved adenylation domains towards their respective substrates. By deleting the putative gene in combination with comparative metabolite profiling various unique cyclic and derived linear tetrapeptides were identified which were associated with this NRPS, including fungisporin. In combination with substrate predictions for each module, we propose a mechanism for a 'trans-acting' adenylation domain.	1
Abstract2class: The structure and biosynthesis of heinamides A1-A3 and B1-B5, antifungal members of the laxaphycin lipopeptide family Abstract: Laxaphycins are a family of cyclic lipopeptides with synergistic antifungal and antiproliferative activities. They are produced by multiple cyanobacterial genera and comprise two sets of structurally unrelated 11- and 12-residue macrocyclic lipopeptides. Here, we report the discovery of new antifungal laxaphycins from Nostoc sp. UHCC 0702, which we name heinamides, through antimicrobial bioactivity screening. We characterized the chemical structures of eight heinamide structural variants A1-A3 and B1-B5. These variants contain the rare non-proteinogenic amino acids 3-hydroxy-4-methylproline, 4-hydroxyproline, 3-hydroxy-d-leucine, dehydrobutyrine, 5-hydroxyl β-amino octanoic acid, and O-carbamoyl-homoserine. We obtained an 8.6-Mb complete genome sequence from Nostoc sp. UHCC 0702 and identified the 93 kb heinamide biosynthetic gene cluster. The structurally distinct heinamides A1-A3 and B1-B5 variants are synthesized using an unusual branching biosynthetic pathway. The heinamide biosynthetic pathway also encodes several enzymes that supply non-proteinogenic amino acids to the heinamide synthetase. Through heterologous expression, we showed that (2S,4R)-4-hydroxy-l-proline is supplied through the action of a novel enzyme LxaN, which hydroxylates l-proline. 11- and 12-residue heinamides have the characteristic synergistic activity of laxaphycins against Aspergillus flavus FBCC 2467. Structural and genetic information of heinamides may prove useful in future discovery of natural products and drug development.	1
Abstract2class: Protein Patterns and Oscillations on Lipid Monolayers and in Microdroplets Abstract: The Min proteins from E.coli position the bacterial cell-division machinery through pole-to-pole oscillations. In vitro, Min protein self-organization can be reconstituted in the presence of a lipid membrane as a catalytic surface. However, Min dynamics have so far not been reconstituted in fully membrane-enclosed volumes. Microdroplets interfaced by lipid monolayers were employed as a simple 3D mimic of cellular compartments to reconstitute Min protein oscillations. We demonstrate that lipid monolayers are sufficient to fulfil the catalytic role of the membrane and thus represent a facile platform to investigate Min protein regulated dynamics of the cell-division protein FtsZ-mts. In particular, we show that droplet containers reveal distinct Min oscillation modes, and reveal a dependence of FtsZ-mts structures on compartment size. Finally, co-reconstitution of Min proteins and FtsZ-mts in droplets yields antagonistic localization, thus demonstrating that droplets indeed support the analysis of complex bacterial self-organization in confined volumes.	0
Abstract2class: CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for activation of silent Streptomyces biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Here we report an efficient CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in strategy to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in streptomycetes. We applied this one-step strategy to activate multiple BGCs of different classes in five Streptomyces species and triggered the production of unique metabolites, including a novel pentangular type II polyketide in Streptomyces viridochromogenes. This potentially scalable strategy complements existing activation approaches and facilitates discovery efforts to uncover new compounds with interesting bioactivities.	0
Abstract2class: A Terpene Synthase Is Involved in the Synthesis of the Volatile Organic Compound Sodorifen of Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 Abstract: Bacteria release a plethora of volatile organic compounds, including compounds with extraordinary structures. Sodorifen (IUPAC name: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethyl-3-methylenebicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene) is a recently identified and unusual volatile hydrocarbon that is emitted by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4R×13. Sodorifen comprises a bicyclic ring structure solely consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, where every carbon atom of the skeleton is substituted with either a methyl or a methylene group. This unusual feature of sodorifen made a prediction of its biosynthetic origin very difficult and so far its biosynthesis is unknown. To unravel the biosynthetic pathway we performed genome and transcriptome analyses to identify candidate genes. One knockout mutant (SOD_c20750) showed the desired negative sodorifen phenotype. Here it was shown for the first time that this gene is indispensable for the synthesis of sodorifen and strongly supports the hypothesis that sodorifen descends from the terpene metabolism. SOD_c20750 is the first bacterial terpene cyclase isolated from Serratia spp. and Enterobacteriales. Homology modeling revealed a 3D structure, which exhibits a functional role of amino acids for intermediate cation stabilization (W325) and putative proton acception (Y332). Moreover, the size and hydrophobicity of the active site strongly indicates that indeed the enzyme may catalyze the unusual compound sodorifen.	1
Abstract2class: γ-Tubulin complex in Trypanosoma brucei: molecular composition, subunit interdependence and requirement for axonemal central pair protein assembly Abstract: γ-Tubulin complex constitutes a key component of the microtubule-organizing center and nucleates microtubule assembly. This complex differs in complexity in different organisms: the budding yeast contains the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) composed of γ-tubulin, gamma-tubulin complex protein (GCP)2 and GCP3, whereas animals contain the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) composed of γTuSC and three additional proteins, GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6. In Trypanosoma brucei, the composition of the γ-tubulin complex remains elusive, and it is not known whether it also regulates assembly of the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Here we report that the γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei is composed of γ-tubulin and three GCP proteins, GCP2-GCP4, and is primarily localized in the basal body throughout the cell cycle. Depletion of GCP2 and GCP3, but not GCP4, disrupted the axonemal central pair microtubules, but not the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Furthermore, we showed that the γTuSC is required for assembly of two central pair proteins and that γTuSC subunits are mutually required for stability. Together, these results identified an unusual γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei, uncovered an essential role of γTuSC in central pair protein assembly, and demonstrated the interdependence of individual γTuSC components for maintaining a stable complex.	0
Abstract2class: Naphthyridinomycin biosynthesis revealing the use of leader peptide to guide nonribosomal peptide assembly Abstract: Analysis of naphthyridinomycin gene cluster revealed that this antibiotic is generated by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) machinery. However, four modules encoded by two genes do not correspond with the structural units in the final product. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the gene cluster suggested that the leader peptide mechanism for the NRPS assembly line was involved in biosynthesis of this tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of a novel analogue of FR901533 and the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089 Abstract: FR901533 (1, also known as WS79089B), WS79089A (2), and WS79089C (3) are polycyclic aromatic natural products with promising inhibitory activity to endothelin-converting enzymes. In this work, we isolated five tridecaketide products from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089, including 1-3, benaphthamycin (4) and a novel FR901533 analogue (5). The structure of 5 was characterized based on spectroscopic data. Compared with the major product 2, the new compound 5 has an additional hydroxyl group at C-12 and an extra methyl group at the 13-OH. The configuration of C-19 of these compounds was determined to be R using Mosher's method. A putative biosynthetic gene cluster for compounds 1-5 was discovered by analyzing the genome of S. roseum No. 79089. This 38.6-kb gene cluster contains 38 open reading frames, including a minimal polyketide synthase (wsaA-C), an aromatase (wsaD), three cyclases (wsaE, F, and W), and a series of tailoring enzymes such as monooxygenases (wsaO1-O7) and methyltransferases (wsaM1 and M2). Disruption of the ketosynthase gene (wsaA) in this gene cluster abolished the production of 1-5, confirming that this gene cluster is indeed responsible for the biosynthesis of 1-5. A type II polyketide biosynthetic pathway was proposed for this group of natural endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors. KEY POINTS: • Five aromatic tridecaketides were isolated from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089. • A novel FR901533 analogue, 12-hydroxy-13-O-methyl-WS79089A, was characterized. • The absolute configuration of C-19 of FR901533 and analogues was determined. • The biosynthetic gene cluster of FR901533 and analogues was discovered.	1
Abstract2class: Genomics-driven discovery of taiwachelin, a lipopeptide siderophore from Cupriavidus taiwanensis Abstract: A genome mining study led to the identification of a previously unrecognised siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424. Based upon predicted structural residues, a convenient strategy for an NMR-assisted isolation of the associated metabolite was designed. The structure of the purified siderophore, taiwachelin, was fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatisation.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and regulation of grisemycin, a new member of the linaridin family of ribosomally synthesized peptides produced by Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350 Abstract: Our recent identification and genetic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for production of the ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide cypemycin revealed a new class of peptide natural products, the linaridins. Here we describe the identification and characterization of grisemycin, a linaridin produced by a previously unidentified gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that grisemycin possesses at least three of the modifications found in cypemycin, as well as an analogous leader peptidase cleavage site. Expression of putative grisemycin biosynthetic genes in a Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) derivative, combined with deletion of the gene encoding the grisemycin precursor peptide, confirmed the identity of the grisemycin gene cluster. Both grisemycin and cypemycin depend on the transcriptional activator AdpA for wild-type levels of production.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the mokH gene encoding transcription factor for the upregulation of monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus. The monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster, mokA-mokI, has been characterized in Monascus pilosus. The mokH gene encoding Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear DNA binding protein is assumed to be an activator for monacolin K production. In this study, the mokH gene was cloned and driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter for overexpression in M. pilosus. The transformants containing an extra copy of the mokH gene were obtained and verified by PCR and Southern hybridization. The transcripts of mokH in the transformants were expressed significantly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The transformants were stably inherited through the next generation, as determined by observation of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The transformant T-mokH1 also showed a 1.7-fold higher production of monacolin K than the wild-type strain in a time course analysis. Analysis of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the monacolin K biosynthetic genes in the transformant were expressed to a greater extent than those in the wild-type strain. These results indicated that mokH upregulated the transcription of monacolin K biosynthetic genes and increased monacolin K production.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a gene required for the terminal step in erythromycin A biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) Abstract: We have identified a transcription unit in the ermE region of the chromosome of the erythromycin (Er)-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) that is briefly switched on at about the time that macrolide production commences. Disruption of the transcription unit, herein designated eryG, by insertion of an integrational plasmid vector, caused a block at the terminal step in the biosynthesis of erythromycin, the conversion of erythromycin C to A by O-methylation.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical Proteomics for Expanding the Druggability of Human Disease Abstract: Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small-molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.	0
Abstract2class: A methyltransferase initiates terpene cyclization in teleocidin B biosynthesis Abstract: Teleocidin B is an indole terpenoid isolated from Streptomyces. Due to its unique chemical structure and ability to activate protein kinase C, it has attracted interest in the areas of organic chemistry and cell biology. Here, we report the identification of genes encoding enzymes for teleocidin B biosynthesis, including nonribosomal peptide synthetase (tleA), P-450 monooxygenase (tleB), prenyltransferase (tleC), and methyltransferase (tleD). The tleD gene, which is located outside of the tleABC cluster on the chromosome, was identified by transcriptional analysis and heterologous expression. Remarkably, TleD not only installs a methyl group on the geranyl moiety of the precursor but also facilitates the nucleophilic attack from the electron-rich indole to the resultant cation, to form the indole-fused six-membered ring. This is the first demonstration of a cation, generated from methylation, triggering successive terpenoid ring closure.	1
Abstract2class: Structural basis for specific, high-affinity tetracycline binding by an in vitro evolved aptamer and artificial riboswitch Abstract: The tetracycline aptamer is an in vitro selected RNA that binds to the antibiotic with the highest known affinity of an artificial RNA for a small molecule (Kd approximately 0.8 nM). It is one of few aptamers known to be capable of modulating gene expression in vivo. The 2.2 A resolution cocrystal structure of the aptamer reveals a pseudoknot-like fold formed by tertiary interactions between an 11 nucleotide loop and the minor groove of an irregular helix. Tetracycline binds within this interface as a magnesium ion chelate. The structure, together with previous biochemical and biophysical data, indicates that the aptamer undergoes localized folding concomitant with tetracycline binding. The three-helix junction, h-shaped architecture of this artificial RNA is more complex than those of most aptamers and is reminiscent of the structures of some natural riboswitches.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of the safracin biosynthetic pathway from Pseudomonas fluorescens A2-2: designing new cytotoxic compounds Abstract: Safracin is an antibiotic with anti-tumour activity produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens A2-2. The entire safracin synthetic gene cluster spanning 17.5 kb has been identified, cloned and sequenced. The safracin cluster comprises 10 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins for three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), three safracin precursor biosynthetic enzymes, two safracin tailoring enzymes, a safracin resistance protein and a small hypothetical protein of unknown function. These genes are organized in two divergent operons of eight and two genes respectively. This pathway exhibits unusual features when compared with other NRPS systems. We have demonstrated by heterologous expression of the cluster that it is able to direct the synthesis of safracin in other strains. Cross-feeding experiments have confirmed that 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-O-methyltyrosine is the precursor of two amino acids of the molecule. Genetic analyses have allowed us to demonstrate that the bicistronic operon encodes the hydroxylation and N-methylation activities of the pathway. The cloning and expression of the safracin cluster has settled the basis for the in vivo and in vitro production of a wide variety of compounds, such as the promising ecteinascidins anti-cancer compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris: a cluster of 15 genes is involved in the biosynthesis of the LPS O-antigen and the LPS core Abstract: As a result of mutational and DNA sequence analysis, a wxc gene cluster involved in the synthesis of the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was identified in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. This gene cluster comprises 15 genes. It was located on a cloned 35-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA, close, but not directly adjacent, to previously characterized genes for LPS biosynthesis. The G + C content of all but one of the wxc genes was atypically low for X. campestris pv. campestris, while the G + C distribution was uniform throughout the cluster. An SDS-PAGE analysis of mutant strains defective in various wxc genes confirmed that genes from this cluster were involved in LPS biosynthesis. The mutant phenotypes allowed the differentiation of three regions within the wxc cluster. Genes from wxc region 1 are necessary for the biosynthesis of the water-soluble LPS O-antigen. Analysis of DNA and deduced amino acid sequences led to the identification of two glycosyltransferases, two components of an ABC transport system, and a possible kinase among the seven putative proteins encoded by genes constituting wxc region 1. The two genes in wxc region 2 were similar to gmd and rmd, which direct the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide GDP-D-rhamnose. Mutations affecting wxc region 2 demonstrated its involvement in the formation of the LPS core. Genes from wxc region 3 showed similarities to genes that code for enzymes that modify nucleotide sugars, and to components of sugar translocation systems that have so far been rarely described in bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Comparison of cysteine and tryptophan content of insoluble proteins derived from wild-type and mi-1 strains of Neurospora crassa Abstract: The possibility of an amino acid substitution (cysteine for tryptophan) in a membrane protein of the [mi-1] strain of Neurospora crassa has been investigated in detail by using a double radioactive labeling procedure. Auxotrophic strains of Neurospora having wild-type [+] or [mi-1] cytoplasm have been grown under conditions which result in the specific labeling of protein tryptophan with (3)H and protein cysteine with (35)S. Although the least soluble 1 to 20% of the [mi-1] mitochondrial membrane protein was usually found to have a higher Cys/Trp ratio (ratio of cysteine plus half-cystine to tryptophan) than the corresponding [+] fraction, it has been shown that these differences were due mainly to the presence of differential amounts of a very insoluble, cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) material. The same Cys-rich material was found in variable amounts in both [+] and [mi-1] cultures, but the concentration was usually higher in the [mi-1] cultures. The Cys-rich material is clearly distinct from "structural protein" on the basis of amino acid composition and appears to have no direct relationship to the [mi-1] phenotype. In the absence of the Cys-rich material, no difference between the Cys/Trp ratios of corresponding [+] and [mi-1] membrane proteins could be detected. We conclude, therefore, that the previously postulated amino acid substitution of cysteine for tryptophan in [mi-1] membrane protein is incorrect.	0
Abstract2class: Screening of putative oxygenase genes in the Fusarium graminearum genome sequence database for their role in trichothecene biosynthesis Abstract: In the biosynthesis of type B trichothecenes, four oxygenation steps remain to have genes functionally assigned to them. On the basis of the complete genome sequence of Fusarium graminearum, expression patterns of all oxygenase genes were investigated in Fusarium asiaticum (F. graminearum lineage 6). As a result, we identified five cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) genes that are specifically expressed under trichothecene-producing conditions and are unique to the toxin-producing strains. The entire coding regions of four of these genes were identified in F. asiaticum. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, none of the oxygenases were able to transform trichodiene-11-one to expected products. However, one of the oxygenases catalyzed the 2beta-hydroxylation rather than the expected 2alpha-hydroxylation. Targeted disruption of the five CYP genes did not alter the trichothecene profiles of F. asiaticum. The results are discussed in relation to the presence of as-yet-unidentified oxygenation genes that are necessary for the biosynthesis of trichothecenes.	1
Abstract2class: A point mutation in ftmD blocks the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus strain Af293 Abstract: Fumitremorgins (FTMs), tremorgenic mycotoxins produced by the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, are prenylated indole alkaloids that have been extensively studied in view of their diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Their biosynthetic gene (ftm) cluster was identified on the basis of the genome sequence of A. fumigatus. However, it has been reported that the ftm cluster in genome reference strain Af293 is inactive, which makes complete understanding of the FTM pathway difficult. Hence, we used an FTM-producing strain of A. fumigatus, BM939, to dissect the FTM pathway. Here, we delineate the genetic determinant for the observed defect in the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293. Metabolite profiling and sequence comparison of the two strains revealed a point mutation in ftmD as a possible cause of altered metabolite production in strain Af293. FTM production in Af293 was restored when a DNA fragment containing ftmD from BM939 was introduced. Biochemical analysis indicated that FtmD is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of 6-hydroxytryprostatin B into tryprostatin A. The mutated FtmD retained enzymatic activity but did not function under physiological conditions, resulting in blockage of the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293.	1
Abstract2class: Diversity of Polyketide Chains Achieved by Deleting the Tailoring Genes in the Biosynthesis of Ansatrienins Abstract: The ast gene cluster (GenBank accession numbers KF813023.1 and KP284551) was characterized to be responsible for the biosynthesis of ansatrienins in Streptomyces sp. XZQH13, which contains astC, astF1, and astF2 genes involved in the assembly of the N-cyclohexanoyl d-alanyl side chain and the hydroxylation of C-19, respectively. Further to investigating the biosynthetic mechanism of ansatrienins, herein we constructed the mutant strains XZQH13OEΔastF2 and XZQH13OEΔastCΔastF2. Three new ansatrienin analogues, namely, ansatrienols I-K (1-3), along with trienomycinol (4) and 3-O-demethyltrienomycinol (5), were isolated from the XZQH13OEΔastCΔastF2 strain, and trienomycin A (6) and trienomycin G (7) were isolated from the XZQH13OEΔastF2 strain. Their structures were determined by a combination of high-resolution MS (ESI) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Accordingly, a pathway for the biosynthesis of these new ansatrienins was proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic gene cluster of the glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin: characterization of two glycosyltransferases and the key acyltransferase Abstract: The gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of the clinically important glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin has been cloned from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Forty-nine putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified within an 89 kbp genetic locus and assigned roles in teicoplanin biosynthesis, export, resistance, and regulation. Two ORFs, designated orfs 1 and 10*, showed significant homology to known glycosyltransferases. When heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, these glycosyltransferases were shown to catalyze the transfer of UDP-(N-acetyl)-glucosamine onto, respectively, 3-chloro-beta-hydroxytyrosine-6 (3-Cl-6betaHty) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine-4 (4Hpg) of the teicoplanin heptapeptide aglycone. The product of another ORF, orf11*, was demonstrated in vitro to transfer n-acetyl-, n-butyryl-, and n-octanoyl-groups from acyl-CoA donors either to a free UDP-aminosugar or to an aminosugar moiety in the teicoplanin pseudoaglycone, thus identifying Orf11* as the key acyltransferase in teicoplanin maturation. These findings should accelerate the combinatorial engineering of new and improved glycopeptide drugs.	1
Abstract2class: [18F]- and [11C]-labeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues as PET tracers for apoptosis: synthesis, radiolabeling mechanism, and in vivo imaging study of apoptosis in Fas-treated mice using [11C]WC-98 Abstract: The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [18F] 2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [18F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [18F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [18F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18F-labeled isatinate 17. [18F] 17 can be converted to isatin [18F] 2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [11C] 4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [11C] 4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radio-synthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [11C] 4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.	0
Abstract2class: Genome-Based Identification of a Plant-Associated Marine Bacterium as a Rich Natural Product Source Abstract: The large number of sequenced bacterial genomes provides the opportunity to bioinformatically identify rich natural product sources among previously neglected microbial groups. Testing this discovery strategy, unusually high biosynthetic potential was suggested for the Oceanospirillales member Gynuella sunshinyii, a Gram-negative marine bacterium from the rhizosphere of the halophilic plant Carex scabrifolia. Its genome contains numerous unusual biosynthetic gene clusters for diverse types of metabolites. Genome-guided isolation yielded representatives of four different natural product classes, of which only alteramide A was known. Cytotoxic lacunalides were identified as products of a giant trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase gene cluster, one of six present in this strain. Cytological profiling against HeLa cells suggested that lacunalide A disrupts CDK signaling in the cell cycle. In addition, chemical studies on model compounds were conducted, suggesting the structurally unusual ergoynes as products of a conjugated diyne-thiourea cyclization reaction.	1
Abstract2class: Halogenase genes in nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of Microcystis (cyanobacteria): sporadic distribution and evolution Abstract: Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis are known to produce secondary metabolites of large structural diversity by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways. For a number of such compounds, halogenated congeners have been reported along with nonhalogenated ones. In the present study, chlorinated cyanopeptolin- and/or aeruginosin-type peptides were detected by mass spectrometry in 17 out of 28 axenic strains of Microcystis. In these strains, a halogenase gene was identified between 2 genes coding for NRPS modules in respective gene clusters, whereas it was consistently absent when the strains produced only nonchlorinated corresponding congeners. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for 12 complete halogenase genes and 14 intermodule regions of gene clusters lacking a halogenase gene or containing only fragments of it. When a halogenase gene was found absent, a specific, identical excision pattern was observed for both synthetase gene clusters in most strains. A phylogenetic analysis including other bacterial halogenases showed that the NRPS-related halogenases of Microcystis form a monophyletic group divided into 2 subgroups, corresponding to either the cyanopeptolin or the aeruginosin peptide synthetases. The distribution of these peptide synthetase gene clusters, among the tested Microcystis strains, was found in relative agreement with their phylogeny reconstructed from 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences, whereas the distribution of the associated halogenase genes appears to be sporadic. The presented data suggest that in cyanobacteria these prevalent halogenase genes originated from an ancient horizontal gene transfer followed by duplication in the cyanobacterial lineage. We propose an evolutionary scenario implying repeated gene losses to explain the distribution of halogenase genes in 2 NRPS gene clusters that subsequently defines the seemingly erratic production of halogenated and nonhalogenated aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins among Microcystis strains.	1
Abstract2class: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. 3. Kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus was determined. The distribution of cell size for both septated and nonseptated bacteria was obtained by direct measurement of the lengths of 8,000 cells. The Collins-Richmond equation was modified to consider bacterial growth in two phases: growth and division. From the derived equation, the growth rate of individual cells was computed as a function of size. Nondividing cells (growth phase) comprised 91% of the population and took up 87% of the time of the division cycle. The absolute and specific growth rates of nondividing cells were observed to increase continually throughout the growth phase; the growth rate of dividing cells could not be determined accurately by this technique because of changes in the geometry of cells between the time of septation and physical separation. The rate of protein synthesis during the division cycle was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radio-active valine or arginine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of protein synthesis as a function of cell size was obtained. Nondividing cells showed an increase in both the absolute and specific rates of protein synthesis throughout the growth phase; the specific rate of protein synthesis for dividing cells was low when compared to growthphase cells. Cell growth and protein synthesis are compared to the previously reported kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis during the division cycle.	0
Abstract2class: Host-mediated modification of Sau3AI restriction in Listeria monocytogenes: prevalence in epidemic-associated strains Abstract: Most major food-related outbreaks of listeriosis have been traced to a cluster of genetically related strains of serovar 4b (epidemic clone). In spite of numerous searches, distinct bacteriologic or virulence-related features unique to these strains have eluded identification, although a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) characteristic of the epidemic clone has previously been described (W. Zheng and S. Kathariou, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:4310-4314, 1995). We found that DNAs from 75 strains which were derived from three separate outbreaks and which had the epidemic clone-specific RFLP were also invariably resistant to digestion by Sau3AI and other restriction endonucleases sensitive to cytosine methylation at 5' GATC 3' sites. This modification of Sau3AI restriction was host mediated, as it did not persist when DNA was cloned and propagated in Escherichia coli, and was uncommon among other Listeria strains. Epidemic-associated strains with this modification were resistant to infection by phage propagated in a serotype 4b strain which was not known to be involved in an epidemic and which lacked the epidemic clone-specific RFLP. Screening for susceptibility to MboI digestion revealed that these epidemic strains lacked methylation of adenines at GATC sites. This type of modification was rare among Listeria strains and was found in only three (of eight screened) strains of serovar 1/2b, possibly representing one clonal lineage.	0
Abstract2class: A FRET-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Ratiometric Detection of Cysteine in Mitochondria Abstract: We report a near-infrared fluorescent probe A for the ratiometric detection of cysteine based on FRET from a coumarin donor to a near-infrared rhodamine acceptor. Upon addition of cysteine, the coumarin fluorescence increased dramatically up to 18-fold and the fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor decreased moderately by 45 % under excitation of the coumarin unit. Probe A has been used to detect cysteine concentration changes in live cells ratiometrically and to visualize fluctuations in cysteine concentrations induced by oxidation stress through treatment with hydrogen peroxide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, probe A was successfully applied for the in vivo imaging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to measure cysteine concentration changes.	0
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of Catenulispora acidiphila type strain (ID 139908) Abstract: Catenulispora acidiphila Busti et al. 2006 is the type species of the genus Catenulispora, and is of interest because of the rather isolated phylogenetic location it occupies within the scarcely explored suborder Catenulisporineae of the order Actinomycetales. C. acidiphilia is known for its acidophilic, aerobic lifestyle, but can also grow scantly under anaerobic conditions. Under regular conditions, C. acidiphilia grows in long filaments of relatively short aerial hyphae with marked septation. It is a free living, non motile, Gram-positive bacterium isolated from a forest soil sample taken from a wooded area in Gerenzano, Italy. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of the actinobacterial family Catenulisporaceae, and the 10,467,782 bp long single replicon genome with its 9056 protein-coding and 69 RNA genes is a part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of new class III lantibiotics--erythreapeptin, avermipeptin and griseopeptin from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, Streptomyces avermitilis and Streptomyces griseus demonstrates stepwise N-terminal leader processing Abstract: Lantibiotics are a large group of ribosomally synthesized peptides post-translationally modified to incorporate the amino acid lanthionine. They are classified, according to their biosynthetic pathway and bioactivity, into three major subtypes. Of Actinomycetes type III lantibiotics, only four peptides (SapB, SapT, LabA1, and LabA2) have been described and structurally characterized, although homologous gene clusters are abundant in other Actinomycetes. All these gene clusters share a similar architecture with a characteristic Ser/Ser/Cys motif in precursor peptides, which has previously been suggested to act as a precursor for lanthionine (SapB) and labionin (LabA2) rings. Mass spectrometry screening led to the discovery and characterization of three new representatives of type III lantibiotics: Avermipeptin (Avi), Erythreapeptin (Ery), and Griseopeptin (Gri) from Streptomyces avermitilis DSM 46492, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338, and Streptomyces griseus DSM 40236, respectively. Apart from the assignment of these peptides to their corresponding gene clusters, additional investigations on Avi, Ery and Gri peptides indicate stepwise leader processing by putative aminopeptidase-like protease(s), thus yielding mixtures of differently N-terminal-processed lantibiotic peptides. Similar peptide processing was observed for a heterologously expressed eryth biosynthetic gene cluster expressed in a Streptomyces host system. Remarkably, all isolates of the new type III lantibiotics contain both the amino acids lanthionine and labionin, thus implying dual-mode cyclase activity of the processing lyase-kinase-cyclase enzymes. These findings have implications for the structures and maturation of other type III lantibiotics from Actinomycetes.	1
Abstract2class: Acinetodin and Klebsidin, RNA Polymerase Targeting Lasso Peptides Produced by Human Isolates of Acinetobacter gyllenbergii and Klebsiella pneumoniae Abstract: We report the bioinformatic prediction and structural validation of two lasso peptides, acinetodin and klebsidin, encoded by the genomes of several human-associated strains of Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Computation of the three-dimensional structures of these peptides using NMR NOESY constraints verifies that they contain a lasso motif. Despite the lack of sequence similarity to each other or to microcin J25, a prototypical lasso peptide and transcription inhibitor from Escherichia coli, acinetodin and klebsidin also inhibit transcript elongation by the E. coli RNA polymerase by binding to a common site. Yet, unlike microcin J25, acinetodin and klebsidin are unable to permeate wild type E. coli cells and inhibit their growth. We show that the E. coli cells become sensitive to klebsidin when expressing the outer membrane receptor FhuA homologue from Klebsiella pneumoniae. It thus appears that specificity to a common target, the RNA polymerase secondary channel, can be attained by a surprisingly diverse set of primary sequences folded into a common threaded-lasso fold. In contrast, transport into cells containing sensitive targets appears to be much more specific and must be the major determinant of the narrow range of bioactivity of known lasso peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Conformational flexibility and strand arrangements of the membrane-associated HIV fusion peptide trimer probed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion peptide (HFP) is the N-terminal apolar region of the HIV gp41 fusion protein and interacts with target cell membranes and promotes membrane fusion. The free peptide catalyzes vesicle fusion at least to the lipid mixing stage and serves as a useful model fusion system. For gp41 constructs which lack the HFP, high-resolution structures show trimeric protein and suggest that at least three HFPs interact with the membrane with their C-termini in close proximity. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that HFPs which are cross-linked at their C-termini to form trimers (HFPtr) catalyze fusion at a rate which is 15-40 times greater than that of non-cross-linked HFP. In the present study, the structure of membrane-associated HFPtr was probed with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Chemical shift and intramolecular (13)CO-(15)N distance measurements show that the conformation of the Leu-7 to Phe-11 region of HFPtr has predominant helical conformation in membranes without cholesterol and beta strand conformation in membranes containing approximately 30 mol % cholesterol. Interstrand (13)CO-(13)CO and (13)CO-(15)N distance measurements were not consistent with an in-register parallel strand arrangement but were consistent with either (1) parallel arrangement with adjacent strands two residues out-of-register or (2) antiparallel arrangement with adjacent strand crossing between Phe-8 and Leu-9. Arrangement 1 could support the rapid fusion rate of HFPtr because of placement of the apolar N-terminal regions of all strands on the same side of the oligomer while arrangement 2 could support the assembly of multiple fusion protein trimers.	0
Abstract2class: Dss1 release activates DNA binding potential in Brh2 Abstract: Dss1 is an intrinsically unstructured polypeptide that partners with the much larger Brh2 protein, the BRCA2 ortholog in Ustilago maydis, to form a tight complex. Mutants lacking Dss1 have essentially the same phenotype as mutants defective in Brh2, implying that through physical interaction Dss1 serves as a positive activator of Brh2. Dss1 associates with Brh2 through an interaction surface in the carboxy-terminal region. Certain derivatives of Brh2 lacking this interaction surface remain highly competent in DNA repair as long as a DNA-binding domain is present. However, the Dss1-independent activity raises the question of what function might be met in the native protein by having Brh2 under Dss1 control. Using a set of Brh2 fusions and truncated derivatives, we show here that Dss1 is capable of exerting control when there is a cognate Dss1-interacting surface present. We find that association of Dss1 attenuates the DNA binding potential of Brh2 and that the amino-terminal domain of Brh2 helps evict Dss1 from its carboxy-terminal interaction surface. The findings presented here add to the notion that Dss1 serves in a regulatory capacity to dictate order in association of Brh2's amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains with DNA.	0
Abstract2class: Albusnodin: an acetylated lasso peptide from Streptomyces albus Abstract: We describe a lasso peptide, albusnodin, that is post-translationally modified with an acetyl group, the first example of a lasso peptide with this modification. Using heterologous expression, we further show that the acetyltransferase colocalized with the albusnodin gene cluster is required for the biosynthesis of this lasso peptide. This type of lasso peptide is widespread in Actinobacteria with 44 examples found in currently sequenced genomes.	1
Abstract2class: Collisional and Coulombic unfolding of gas-phase proteins: high correlation to their domain structures in solution Abstract: The three-dimensional structures adopted by proteins are predicated by their many biological functions. Mass spectrometry has played a rapidly expanding role in protein structure discovery, enabling the generation of models for both proteins and their higher-order assemblies. While important coursed-grained insights have been generated, relatively few examples exist where mass spectrometry has been successfully applied to the characterization of protein tertiary structure. Here, we demonstrate that gas-phase unfolding can be used to determine the number of autonomously folded domains within monomeric proteins. Our ion mobility-mass spectrometry data highlight a strong, positive correlation between the number of protein unfolding transitions observed in the gas phase and the number of known domains within a group of sixteen proteins ranging from 8-78 kDa. This correlation and its potential uses for structural biology is discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Expression of the htrB gene is essential for responsiveness of Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni to harsh environments Abstract: In Campylobacter jejuni, an htrB homologous gene is located in the lipo-oligosaccharide synthesis gene cluster. This study examined the effects of htrB expression on the responsiveness of Salmonella typhimurium and C. jejuni to harsh environments. Complementation experiments showed that the C. jejuni htrB gene could restore the normal morphology of the Salmonella htrB mutant, and its ability to grow without inhibition under heat, acid and osmotic stresses, but not bile stress. This indicated that the htrB genes in C. jejuni and S. typhimurium exhibit similar pleiotropic effects. Moreover, quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of the C. jejuni htrB gene was upregulated under acid, heat, oxidative and osmotic stresses, but did not change under bile stress. This indicated that the C. jejuni htrB gene plays a role in regulating cell responses to various environmental changes. Furthermore, deletion mutation of the htrB gene in C. jejuni was lethal, indicating that the htrB gene is essential for C. jejuni survival. Therefore, these results showed that expression of the htrB gene is essential for the response of S. typhimurium and C. jejuni to environmental stresses.	1
Abstract2class: Computational design and experimental characterization of peptides intended for pH-dependent membrane insertion and pore formation Abstract: There are many opportunities to use macromolecules, such as peptides and oligonucleotides, for intracellular applications. Despite this, general methods for delivering these molecules to the cytosol in a safe and efficient manner are not available. Efforts to develop a variety of intracellular drug delivery systems such as viral vectors, lipoplexes, nanoparticles, and amphiphilic peptides have been made, but various challenges such as delivery efficiency, toxicity, and controllability remain. A central challenge is the ability to selectively perturb, not destroy, the membrane to facilitate cargo introduction. Herein, we describe our efforts to design and characterize peptides that form pores inside membranes at acidic pH, so-called pH-switchable pore formation (PSPF) peptides, as a potential means for facilitating cargo translocation through membranes. Consistent with pore formation, these peptides exhibit low-pH-triggered selective release of ATP and miRNA, but not hemoglobin, from red blood cells. Consistent with these observations, biophysical studies (tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy) show that decreased pH destabilizes the PSPF peptides in aqueous systems while promoting their membrane insertion. Together, these results suggest that reduced pH drives insertion of PSPF peptides into membranes, leading to target-specific escape through a proposed pore formation mechanism.	0
Abstract2class: Selective Transformation of Nickel-Bound Formate to CO or C-C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali-Metal Ions Abstract: The complexes [LtBu Ni(OCO-κ2 O,C)]M3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBu NiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3 )2 ], feature a NiII -CO2 2- core surrounded by Lewis-acidic cations (M+ ) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3 SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni-OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+ , the {[K3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 }+ shell around the Ni-CO2 2- entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3 )2 ] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBu NiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBu NiI (μ-OOCH)NiI LtBu ]K and [LtBu Ni(C2 O4 )NiLtBu ]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2 C-CO2 -CO2 ]4- ) ligands.	0
Abstract2class: Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) attack causes a dramatic shift in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in wheat Abstract: Carbon and nitrogen (C/N) metabolism and allocation within the plant have important implications for plant-parasite interactions. Many plant parasites manipulate the host by inducing C/N changes that benefit their own survival and growth. Plant resistance can prevent this parasite manipulation. We used the wheat-Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) system to analyze C/N changes in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. The Hessian fly is an insect but shares many features with plant pathogens, being sessile during feeding stages and having avirulence (Avr) genes that match plant resistance genes in gene-for-gene relationships. Many wheat genes involved in C/N metabolism were differentially regulated in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. In plants during compatible interactions, the content of free carbon-containing compounds decreased 36%, whereas the content of free nitrogen-containing compounds increased 46%. This C/N shift was likely achieved through a coordinated regulation of genes in a number of central metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino-acid synthesis. Our data on plants during compatible interactions support recent findings that Hessian fly larvae create nutritive cells at feeding (attack) sites and manipulate host plants to enhance their own survival and growth. In plants during incompatible interactions, most of the metabolic genes examined were not affected or down-regulated.	0
Abstract2class: Phenolic lipids synthesized by type III polyketide synthase confer penicillin resistance on Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) found in plants, fungi, and bacteria synthesize a variety of aromatic polyketides. A Gram-positive, filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus contained an srs operon, in which srsA encoded a type III PKS, srsB encoded a methyltransferase, and srsC encoded a flavoprotein hydroxylase. Consistent with this annotation, overexpression of the srs genes in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, showed that SrsA was a type III PKS responsible for synthesis of phenolic lipids, alkylresorcinols, and alkylpyrones, SrsB was a methyltransferase acting on the phenolic lipids to yield alkylresorcinol methyl ethers, and SrsC was a hydroxylase acting on the alkylresorcinol methyl ethers. In vitro SrsA reaction showed that SrsA synthesized alkylresorcinols from acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths as a starter substrate, one molecule of methylmalonyl-CoA, and two molecules of malonyl-CoA. SrsA was thus unique in that it incorporated the extender substrates in a strictly controlled order of malonyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA to produce alkylresorcinols. An srsA mutant, which produced no phenolic lipids, was highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin G and cephalexin. Together with the fact that the alkylresorcinols were fractionated mainly in the cell wall fraction, this observation suggests that the phenolic lipids, perhaps associated with the cytoplasmic membrane because of their amphiphilic property, affect the characteristic and rigidity of the cytoplasmic membrane/peptidoglycan of a variety of bacteria. An srs-like operon is found widely among Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, indicating wide distribution of the phenolic lipids.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of monoclonal antibodies for rapid identification of Actinomyces naeslundii in clinical samples Abstract: The purpose of this study was to generate highly specific serological reagents for the quantitative identification of Actinomyces naeslundii in clinical samples, in particular dental plaque. Balb/c mice were immunized with pasteurized human A. naeslundii strains representing different genospecies and serotypes. Ten hybrid cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies reactive with A. naeslundii were isolated and characterized. Antibody specificity was determined by indirect immunofluo-rescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using strains from 59 species and by immunofluorescence analyses of supragingival plaque from 10 gingivitis patients. Nine monoclonal antibodies reacted selectively with A. naeslundii, whereas one additionally bound to Actinomyces israelii. They recognized at least nine different epitopes with characteristic expression patterns among the test strains. Six clusters of antigenically unique or closely related strains could be distinguished. Clusters 1, 4, and 5 represented by 12, 18, and 5 strains, respectively, comprised over 80% of the A. naeslundii strains tested. All reference strains for genospecies 1 grouped with cluster 1. Strains associated with genospecies 2 fell into clusters 4 and 5. Tests with mutant strains indicated that three monoclonal antibodies recognize type 2 and one type 1 fimbriae of genospecies 2. Only four isolates grouped with clusters 2 and 3 characterized by the expression of cluster-specific antigens. Interestingly, cluster 2 and 3 bacteria were markedly more abundant in vivo than indicated by their sparse representation in our strain collection. Overall, all but one of the new monoclonal antibodies should prove of value for the serological classification and rapid quantitative determination of A. naeslundii in clinical samples.	0
Abstract2class: New Tetramic Acids Comprising of Decalin and Pyridones From Chaetomium olivaceum SD-80A With Antimicrobial Activity Abstract: Cycloaddition reactions such as intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) are extremely important in constructing multicyclic scaffolds with diverse bioactivities. Using MycB as a biomarker, three new polyketides - Chaetolivacines A (1), B (3), and C (4) - with one known compound Myceliothermophin E (2) comprising of decalin and 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones were obtained from the culture of Chaetomium olivaceum SD-80A under the guidance of gene mining. The structures of these compounds were established using detailed 1D, 2D NMR, and high-resolution electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS) analysis. The relative and absolute configurations of the compounds 1, 3, and 4 were elucidated by NOESY and ECD. The biosynthesis pathways of these compounds were proposed, which involves in three key genes ChaA [polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (PKS-NRPS)], ChaB, and ChaC. Compounds 1-4 were tested for their antimicrobial activities, and compounds 2 and 3 showed moderate bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with MIC values of 15.8 and 27.1 μM. The results showed that configuration of C-21 in 3 and 4 is important for anti-SA and anti-MRSA activities. This study reveals the significant potential of the genus Chaetomium in producing new PKS-NRPS, therefore increasing the speed in the mining for new sources of antimicrobial agents.	1
Abstract2class: The SapB morphogen is a lantibiotic-like peptide derived from the product of the developmental gene ramS in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: SapB is a morphogenetic peptide that is important for aerial mycelium formation by the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Production of SapB commences during aerial mycelium formation and depends on most of the genes known to be required for the morphogenesis of aerial hyphae. Furthermore, the application of purified SapB to mutants blocked in morphogenesis restores their capacity to form aerial hyphae. Here, we present evidence that SapB is a lantibiotic-like peptide that is derived by posttranslational modification from the product of a gene (ramS) in the four-gene ram operon, which is under the control of the regulatory gene ramR. We show that the product of another gene in the operon (ramC) contains a region that is similar to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, suggesting that it might be involved in the posttranslational processing of RamS. We conclude that SapB is derived from RamS through proteolytic cleavage and the introduction of four dehydroalanine residues and two lanthionine bridges. We provide an example of a morphogenetic role for an antibiotic-like molecule.	1
Abstract2class: Degradation of mutant influenza virus hemagglutinins is influenced by cytoplasmic sequences independent of internalization signals Abstract: A mutant influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA+8, having a carboxyl-terminal extension of 8 amino acids that included 4 aromatic residues, was internalized within 2 min of arriving at the cell surface and was degraded quickly by a process that was inhibited by ammonium chloride. Through second-site mutagenesis, the internalization sequence of HA+8 was found to closely resemble the internalization signals of the transferrin receptor or large mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Comparison of the intracellular traffic of HA+8 and a series of other HA mutants that differed in their rates of internalization revealed a relation between the amount of the protein on the plasma membrane at steady state and the internalization rate that would be predicted if most of each protein recycled to the cell surface. However, there was no simple correlation between the internalization rate and the rate of degradation, indicating that transport to the compartment where degradation occurred was not simply a function of the concentration of the proteins in early endosomes. The internal populations of both HA+8, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 1.9 h, and HA-Y543, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 2.9 h, were found by cell fractionation and density-shift experiments to reside in early endosomes with little accumulation in lysosomes. A fluid-phase marker reached lysosomes 3-4-fold faster than these proteins were degraded. Degradation of these mutant HAs involved a rate-determining step in early endosomes that was sensitive to some feature of the protein that depended upon sequence differences in the cytoplasmic domain unrelated to the internalization signal.	0
Abstract2class: Mutations in the scaffoldin gene, cipA, of Clostridium thermocellum with impaired cellulosome formation and cellulose hydrolysis: insertions of a new transposable element, IS1447, and implications for cellulase synergism on crystalline cellulose Abstract: Mutants of Clostridium thermocellum that had lost the ability to adhere to microcrystalline cellulose were isolated. Six of them that showed diminished ability to depolymerize crystalline cellulose were selected. Size exclusion chromatography of the proteins from the culture supernatant revealed the loss of the supramolecular enzyme complex, the cellulosome. However, denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulted in extracellular protein patterns comparable to those of isolated cellulosomes, except for a missing CipA band. Sequencing of the six mutant cipA genes revealed a new insertion (IS) element, IS1447, belonging to the IS3 family. It was inserted into the cipA reading frame in four different locations: cohesin module 1, two different positions in the carbohydrate binding module, and cohesin module 3. The IS sequences were identical and consisted of a transposase gene and the inverted repeats IRR and IRS. The insertion resulted in an obviously nonspecific duplication of 3 base pairs within the target sequence. This lack of specificity allows transposition without the need of a defined target DNA sequence. Eighteen copies of IS1447 were identified in the genomic sequence of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405. At least one of them can be activated for transposition. Compared to the wild type, the mutant culture supernatant, with a completely defective CipA protein, showed equal specific hydrolytic activity against soluble beta-glucan but a 15-fold reduction in specific activity with crystalline cellulose. These results identify a genetic basis for the synergistic effect of complex formation on crystalline-cellulose degradation.	0
Abstract2class: Metaproteomics reveals potential mechanisms by which dietary resistant starch supplementation attenuates chronic kidney disease progression in rats Abstract: Background:                       Resistant starch is a prebiotic metabolized by the gut bacteria. It has been shown to attenuate chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in rats. Previous studies employed taxonomic analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling. Here we expand these studies by metaproteomics, gaining new insight into the host-microbiome interaction.                  Methods:                       Differences between cecum contents in CKD rats fed a diet containing resistant starch with those fed a diet containing digestible starch were examined by comparative metaproteomics analysis. Taxonomic information was obtained using unique protein sequences. Our methodology results in quantitative data covering both host and bacterial proteins.                  Results:                       5,834 proteins were quantified, with 947 proteins originating from the host organism. Taxonomic information derived from metaproteomics data surpassed previous 16S RNA analysis, and reached species resolutions for moderately abundant taxonomic groups. In particular, the Ruminococcaceae family becomes well resolved-with butyrate producers and amylolytic species such as R. bromii clearly visible and significantly higher while fibrolytic species such as R. flavefaciens are significantly lower with resistant starch feeding. The observed changes in protein patterns are consistent with fiber-associated improvement in CKD phenotype. Several known host CKD-associated proteins and biomarkers of impaired kidney function were significantly reduced with resistant starch supplementation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008845.                  Conclusions:                       Metaproteomics analysis of cecum contents of CKD rats with and without resistant starch supplementation reveals changes within gut microbiota at unprecedented resolution, providing both functional and taxonomic information. Proteins and organisms differentially abundant with RS supplementation point toward a shift from mucin degraders to butyrate producers.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyether antibiotic monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis and evidence for the role of monB and monC genes in oxidative cyclization Abstract: The analysis of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (97 kbp) for the polyether ionophore monensin from Streptomyces cinnamonensis has revealed a modular polyketide synthase composed of eight separate multienzyme subunits housing a total of 12 extension modules, and flanked by numerous other genes for which a plausible function in monensin biosynthesis can be ascribed. Deletion of essentially all these clustered genes specifically abolished monensin production, while overexpression in S. cinnamonensis of the putative pathway-specific regulatory gene monR led to a fivefold increase in monensin production. Experimental support is presented for a recently-proposed mechanism, for oxidative cyclization of a linear polyketide intermediate, involving four enzymes, the products of monBI, monBII, monCI and monCII. In frame deletion of either of the individual genes monCII (encoding a putative cyclase) or monBII (encoding a putative novel isomerase) specifically abolished monensin production. Also, heterologous expression of monCI, encoding a flavin-linked epoxidase, in S. coelicolor was shown to significantly increase the ability of S. coelicolor to epoxidize linalool, a model substrate for the presumed linear polyketide intermediate in monensin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Direct synthesis of fluorinated heteroarylether bioisosteres Abstract: This work delineates a method for the modular synthesis of reagents that are capable of direct incorporation of difluoroalkyl groups onto heterocycles. The scope and generality of this method is exemplified with the difluoroethyl group (along with the introduction of a new reagent for difluoroethylation, DFES-Na) and a proof of principle is shown for a general synthesis of fluorinated heteroarylether bioisosteres.	0
Abstract2class: Expression, purification, and characterization of AknX anthrone oxygenase, which is involved in aklavinone biosynthesis in Streptomyces galilaeus Abstract: In streptomycete anthracycline biosynthetic gene clusters, small open reading frames are located just upstream of minimal polyketide synthase genes. aknX is such a gene found in the aklavinone-aclacinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces galilaeus. In order to identify its function, the aknX gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The cell extract prepared from E. coli cells overexpressing AknX protein exhibited anthrone oxygenase activity, which converted emodinanthrone to anthraquinone emodin. This indicates that AknX and related gene products such as DnrG and SnoaB are involved in the formation of aklanonic acid from its anthrone precursor, as suggested by their homology with TcmH and ActVA6. The AknX protein fused with a His(6) tag was efficiently purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity and anion-exchange column chromatography. The native molecular mass of AknX was estimated to be 42 kDa by gel filtration. Thus, native AknX is considered to have a homotrimeric subunit structure. AknX, like TcmH and ActVA6, possesses no apparent prosthetic group for oxygen activation. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify the key amino acid residue(s) involved in the oxygenation reaction. Of seven AknX mutants expressed, the W67F mutant showed significantly reduced oxygenase activity, suggesting the important role of the W67 residue in the AknX reaction. A possible mechanism for the reaction via peroxy anion intermediate is proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and functional analysis of gene cluster involvement in biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic pelgipeptin produced by Paenibacillus elgii Abstract: Background:                       Pelgipeptin, a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent, is a non-ribosomally synthesised lipopeptide antibiotic. This compound consists of a β-hydroxy fatty acid and nine amino acids. To date, there is no information about its biosynthetic pathway.                  Results:                       A potential pelgipeptin synthetase gene cluster (plp) was identified from Paenibacillus elgii B69 through genome analysis. The gene cluster spans 40.8 kb with eight open reading frames. Among the genes in this cluster, three large genes, plpD, plpE, and plpF, were shown to encode non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), with one, seven, and one module(s), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of the substrate specificity of all nine adenylation domains indicated that the sequence of the NRPS modules is well collinear with the order of amino acids in pelgipeptin. Additional biochemical analysis of four recombinant adenylation domains (PlpD A1, PlpE A1, PlpE A3, and PlpF A1) provided further evidence that the plp gene cluster involved in pelgipeptin biosynthesis.                  Conclusions:                       In this study, a gene cluster (plp) responsible for the biosynthesis of pelgipeptin was identified from the genome sequence of Paenibacillus elgii B69. The identification of the plp gene cluster provides an opportunity to develop novel lipopeptide antibiotics by genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Semisynthesis and Kappa-Opioid Receptor Activity of Derivatives of Columbin, a Furanolactone Diterpene Abstract: Columbin (1) is a furanolactone diterpene isolated from the roots of Jateorhiza and Tinospora species. These species generally grow in Asia and Africa and have been used in folk medicine for their apparent analgesic and antipyretic activities. Columbin (1) is of particular interest due to its structural similarity to the known kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist salvinorin A. Given that the KOR is of interest in the study of many serious diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction, obtaining natural or semisynthetic molecules with KOR activity recently has gained much interest. For this reason, in the present study, derivatives of 1 were designed and synthesized using known structure-activity relationships of salvinorin A at KORs. The structures of the columbin analogues prepared were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, and their KOR activity was investigated in vitro by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Slight improvements in KOR activity were observed in columbin derivatives over their parent compound. However, despite the structural similarities to salvinorin A, neither columbin (1) nor its derivatives were potent KOR ligands. This work represents not only the first evaluation of columbin (1) at the KOR but also one of the first works to explore synthetic strategies that are tolerated on the columbin core.	0
Abstract2class: Mutasynthesis of fluorinated pactamycin analogues and their antimalarial activity Abstract: A mutasynthetic strategy has been used to generate fluorinated TM-025 and TM-026, two biosynthetically engineered pactamycin analogues produced by Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456. The fluorinated compounds maintain excellent activity and selectivity toward chloroquine-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of malarial parasites as the parent compounds. The results also provide insights into the biosynthesis of 3-aminobenzoic acid in S. pactum.	1
Abstract2class: Complexes of serine acetyltransferase and isozymes of cysteine synthase in spinach leaves Abstract: Polyclonal antibodies against cysteine synthase (CSase; EC 4.2.99.8) isozymes 1, 2, and 3 were used for the detection of complexes of these isozymes with serine acetyltransferase (SATase; EC 2.3.1.30). SATase was partially purified and found to complex with these isozymes by western blotting and immunotitration. When the complexes were treated with a high concentration of O-acetyl-L-serine, they did not dissociate. However, some complexes with CSase 1 or 3 dissociated when left for 24 h at 4 degrees C. Results of western blotting on SDS-PAGE showed that CSase 2 complexed with SATase. CSases 1, 2, and 3 all could complex with SATase, but the tightness of the bond differed.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous Production of a Novel Cyclic Peptide Compound, KK-1, in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: A novel cyclic peptide compound, KK-1, was originally isolated from the plant-pathogenic fungus Curvularia clavata. It consists of 10 amino acid residues, including five N-methylated amino acid residues, and has potent antifungal activity. Recently, the genome-sequencing analysis of C. clavata was completed, and the biosynthetic genes involved in KK-1 production were predicted by using a novel gene cluster mining tool, MIDDAS-M. These genes form an approximately 75-kb cluster, which includes nine open reading frames, containing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene. To determine whether the predicted genes were responsible for the biosynthesis of KK-1, we performed heterologous production of KK-1 in Aspergillus oryzae by introduction of the cluster genes into the genome of A. oryzae. The NRPS gene was split in two fragments and then reconstructed in the A. oryzae genome, because the gene was quite large (approximately 40 kb). The remaining seven genes in the cluster, excluding the regulatory gene kkR, were simultaneously introduced into the strain of A. oryzae in which NRPS had already been incorporated. To evaluate the heterologous production of KK-1 in A. oryzae, gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and KK-1 productivity was quantified by HPLC. KK-1 was produced in variable quantities by a number of transformed strains, along with expression of the cluster genes. The amount of KK-1 produced by the strain with the greatest expression of all genes was lower than that produced by the original producer, C. clavata. Therefore, expression of the cluster genes is necessary and sufficient for the heterologous production of KK-1 in A. oryzae, although there may be unknown factors limiting productivity in this species.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the new broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic paenibacterin in Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE Abstract: Paenibacterin is a novel lipopeptide antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive human pathogens. The antibiotic consists of a cyclic 13-residue peptide and an N-terminal C₁₅ fatty acyl chain. To elucidate the biosynthesis of paenibacterin, we determined the whole genome sequence of the producer strain Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, and the function of the peptide synthetase was confirmed experimentally. The gene cluster of paenibacterin was identified within a 52-kb DNA region, encoding thee non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, PbtA, PbtB and PbtC, and two ABC-transporters, PbtD and PbtE. Both PbtA and PbtB consist of five modules, whereas PbtC comprises three modules. Each of these 13 modules consists of three essential domains (condensation-adenylation-thiolation) and assembles an amino acid into the paenibacterin peptide. Selected adenylation domains in the NRPS were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the substrate specificity of each recombinant A-domain was studied in vitro by protein function analysis. The presence of four epimerization domains in paenibacterin peptide synthetases suggests that Orn₁, Orn₄, Lys₇ and Ser₈ in the paenibacterin molecule have d-configuration; the absolute configuration of two ornithine residues in paenibacterin was confirmed by chiral amino acid analysis using Marfey's reagents. Taken together, the findings enabled us to propose the biosynthetic pathway of paenibacterin.	1
Abstract2class: Fumonisin production in the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides: genetic basis of naturally occurring chemical variation Abstract: Fumonisins are polyketide-derived mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Previous analyses identified naturally occurring variants of the fungus that are deficient in fumonisin C-10 hydroxylation or that do not produce any fumonisins. In the current study, gene deletion and genetic complementation analyses localized the C-10 hydroxylation deficiency to a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster. Sequence analysis indicated that the hydroxylation deficiency resulted from a single nucleotide insertion that caused a frame shift in the coding region of the gene. Genetic complementation localized the fumonisin-nonproduction phenotype to the polyketide synthase gene in the FUM cluster, and sequence analysis indicated that the nonproduction phenotype resulted from a nucleotide substitution, which introduced a premature stop codon in the coding region. These results provide the first direct evidence that altered fumonisin production phenotypes of naturally occurring F. verticillioides variants can result from single point mutations in the FUM cluster.	1
Abstract2class: α-Methylene-β-Lactone Scaffold for Developing Chemical Probes at the Two Ends of the Selectivity Spectrum Abstract: The utilities of an α-methylene-β-lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac-alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe, but also recruits reduced endogenous glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH-β-lactone (GSH-Lac)-alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael or acyl addition. A peptide-centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac-alkyne as a high-coverage probe. The GSH-Lac-alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S-transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance. The assembly of the GSH-Lac probe exemplifies a modular and scalable route to develop selective probes with different recognizing moieties.	0
Abstract2class: Boundary cap cells are peripheral nervous system stem cells that can be redirected into central nervous system lineages Abstract: Boundary cap cells (BC), which express the transcription factor Krox20, participate in the formation of the boundary between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. To study BC stemness, we developed a method to purify and amplify BC in vitro from Krox20(Cre/+), R26R(YFP/+) mouse embryos. We show that BC progeny are EGF/FGF2-responsive, form spheres, and express neural crest markers. Upon growth factor withdrawal, BC progeny gave rise to multiple neural crest and CNS lineages. Transplanted into the developing murine forebrain, they successfully survived, migrated, and integrated within the host environment. Surprisingly, BC progeny generated exclusively CNS cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. In vitro experiments indicated that a sequential combination of ventralizing morphogens and glial growth factors was necessary to reprogram BC into oligodendrocytes. Thus, BC progeny are endowed with differentiation plasticity beyond the peripheral nervous system. The demonstration that CNS developmental cues can reprogram neural crest-derived stem cells into CNS derivatives suggests that BC could serve as a source of cell type-specific lineages, including oligodendrocytes, for cell-based therapies to treat CNS disorders.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of FdmV as an amide synthetase for fredericamycin A biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus ATCC 43944 Abstract: Fredericamycin (FDM) A is a pentadecaketide natural product that features an amide linkage. Analysis of the fdm cluster from Streptomyces griseus ATCC 43944, however, failed to reveal genes encoding the types of amide synthetases commonly seen in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro characterizations of FdmV, an asparagine synthetase (AS) B-like protein, as an amide synthetase that catalyzes the amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis. This is supported by the findings that (i) inactivation of fdmV in vivo afforded the ΔfdmV mutant strain SB4027 that abolished FDM A and FDM E production but accumulated FDM C, a biosynthetic intermediate devoid of the characteristic amide linkage; (ii) FdmV in vitro catalyzes conversion of FDM C to FDM B, a known intermediate for FDM A biosynthesis (apparent K(m) = 162 ± 67 μM and k(cat) = 0.11 ± 0.02 min(-1)); and (iii) FdmV also catalyzes the amidation of FDM M-3, a structural analog of FDM C, to afford amide FDM M-6 in vitro, albeit at significantly reduced efficiency. Preliminary enzymatic studies revealed that, in addition to the common nitrogen sources (L-Gln and free amine) of class II glutamine amidotransferases (to which AS B belongs), FdmV can also utilize L-Asn as a nitrogen donor. The amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis is proposed to occur after C-8 hydroxylation but before the carbaspirocycle formation.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of deoxynivalenol- and nivalenol-producing chemotypes of Gibberella zeae by using PCR Abstract: Gibberella zeae, a major cause of cereal scab, may be divided into two chemotypes based on production of the trichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). We cloned and sequenced the gene cluster for trichothecene biosynthesis from each chemotype. G. zeae H-11 is a DON producer isolated from corn, and G. zeae 88-1 is a NIV producer from barley. We sequenced a 23-kb gene cluster from H-11 and a 26-kb cluster from 88-1, along with the unlinked Tri101 genes. Each gene cluster contained 10 Tri gene homologues in the same order and transcriptional directions as those of Fusarium sporotrichioides. Between H-11 and 88-1 all of the Tri homologues except Tri7 were conserved, with identities ranging from 88 to 98% and 82 to 99% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The Tri7 sequences were only 80% identical at the nucleotide level. We aligned the Tri7 genes and found that the Tri7 open reading frame of H-11 carried several mutations and an insertion containing 10 copies of an 11-bp tandem repeat. The Tri7 gene from 88-1 carried neither the repeat nor the mutations. We assayed 100 G. zeae isolates of both chemotypes by PCR amplification with a primer pair derived from the Tri7 gene and could differentiate the chemotypes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PCR-based method developed in this study should provide a simple and reliable diagnostic tool for differentiating the two chemotypes of G. zeae.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical proteomic probes for profiling cytochrome p450 activities and drug interactions in vivo Abstract: The cytochrome P450 (P450) superfamily metabolizes many endogenous signaling molecules and drugs. P450 enzymes are regulated by posttranslational mechanisms in vivo, which hinders their functional characterization by conventional genomic or proteomic methods. Here we describe a chemical proteomic strategy to profile P450 activities directly in living systems. Derivatization of a mechanism-based inhibitor with a "clickable" handle provided an activity-based probe that labels multiple P450s both in proteomic extracts and in vivo. This probe was used to record alterations in liver P450 activities triggered by chemical agents, including inducers of P450 expression and direct P450 inhibitors. The chemical proteomic strategy described herein thus offers a versatile method to monitor P450 activities and small-molecule interactions in any biological system and, through doing so, should facilitate the functional characterization of this large and diverse enzyme class.	0
Abstract2class: mTORC1 senses lysosomal amino acids through an inside-out mechanism that requires the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase Abstract: The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that is stimulated by amino acids. Amino acids activate the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. We found that the vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) is necessary for amino acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino acid-sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP hydrolysis by the v-ATPase was necessary for amino acids to regulate the v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. Results obtained in vitro and in human cells suggest that amino acid signaling begins within the lysosomal lumen. These results identify the v-ATPase as a component of the mTOR pathway and delineate a lysosome-associated machinery for amino acid sensing.	0
Abstract2class: A dual anchoring strategy for the localization and activation of artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology Abstract: Artificial metalloenzymes result from anchoring an active catalyst within a protein environment. Toward this goal, various localization strategies have been pursued: covalent, supramolecular, or dative anchoring. Herein we show that introduction of a suitably positioned histidine residue contributes to firmly anchor, via a dative bond, a biotinylated rhodium piano stool complex within streptavidin. The in silico design of the artificial metalloenzyme was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The resulting artificial metalloenzyme displays significantly improved catalytic performance, both in terms of activity and selectivity in the transfer hydrogenation of imines. Depending on the position of the histidine residue, both enantiomers of the salsolidine product can be obtained.	0

Abstract2class: Uncovering the biosynthetic potential of rare metagenomic DNA using co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences Abstract: Sequencing of DNA extracted from environmental samples can provide key insights into the biosynthetic potential of uncultured bacteria. However, the high complexity of soil metagenomes, which can contain thousands of bacterial species per gram of soil, imposes significant challenges to explore secondary metabolites potentially produced by rare members of the soil microbiome. Here, we develop a targeted sequencing workflow termed CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) that detects physically clustered biosynthetic domains, a hallmark of bacterial secondary metabolism. Following targeted amplification of conserved biosynthetic domains in a highly partitioned metagenomic library, CONKAT-seq evaluates amplicon co-occurrence patterns across library subpools to identify chromosomally clustered domains. We show that a single soil sample can contain more than a thousand uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which originate from low frequency genomes which are practically inaccessible through untargeted sequencing. CONKAT-seq allows scalable exploration of largely untapped biosynthetic diversity across multiple soils, and can guide the discovery of novel secondary metabolites from rare members of the soil microbiome.	1
Abstract2class: Functional effects of increased copy number of the gene encoding proclavaminate amidino hydrolase on clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 Abstract: The effect of increasing levels of proclavaminate amidino hydrolase (Pah) on the rate of clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 was evaluated by knock-in a gene (pah2) encoding Pah. A strain (SMF5703) harboring a multicopy plasmid containing the pah2 gene showed significantly retarded cell growth and reduced clavulanic acid production, possibly attributable to the deleterious effects of the multicopy plasmid. In contrast, a strain (SMF5704) carrying a single additional copy of pah2 introduced into chromosome via an integrative plasmid showed enhanced production of clavulanic acid and increased levels of pah2 transcripts. Analysis of transcripts of other genes involved in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic pathway revealed a pattern similar to that seen in the parent. From these results, it appears that clavulanic acid production can be enhanced by duplication of pah2 through integration of a second copy of the gene into chromosome. However, increasing the copy number of only one gene, such as pah2, does not affect the expression of other pathway genes, and so only modest improvements in clavulanic acid production can be expected. Flux controlled by Pah did increase when the copy number of pah2 was doubled, suggesting that under these growth conditions, Pah levels may be a limiting factor regulating the rate of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus.	1
Abstract2class: Direct interaction of the mouse cytomegalovirus m152/gp40 immunoevasin with RAE-1 isoforms Abstract: Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are ubiquitous species-specific viruses that establish acute, persistent, and latent infections. Both human and mouse CMVs encode proteins that inhibit the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by downregulating cellular ligands for the NK cell activating receptor, NKG2D. The MCMV glycoprotein m152/gp40 downregulates the surface expression of RAE-1 to prevent NK cell control in vivo. So far, it is unclear if there is a direct interaction between m152 and RAE-1 and, if so, if m152 interacts differentially with the five identified RAE-1 isoforms, which are expressed as two groups in MCMV-susceptible or -resistant mouse strains. To address these questions, we expressed and purified the extracellular domains of RAE-1 and m152 and performed size exclusion chromatography binding assays as well as analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize these interactions quantitatively. We further evaluated the role of full-length and naturally glycosylated m152 and RAE-1 in cotransfected HEK293T cells. Our results confirmed that m152 binds RAE-1 directly, relatively tightly (K(d) < 5 microM), and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The binding is quantitatively different depending on particular RAE-1 isoforms, corresponding to the susceptibility to downregulation by m152. A PLWY motif found in RAE-1beta, although contributing to its affinity for m152, does not influence the affinity of RAE-1gamma or RAE-1delta, suggesting that other differences contribute to the RAE-1-m152 interaction. Molecular modeling of the different RAE-1 isoforms suggests a potential site for the m152 interaction.	0
Abstract2class: Analogy Powered by Prediction and Structural Invariants: Computationally Led Discovery of a Mesoporous Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Cage Crystal Abstract: Mesoporous molecular crystals have potential applications in separation and catalysis, but they are rare and hard to design because many weak interactions compete during crystallization, and most molecules have an energetic preference for close packing. Here, we combine crystal structure prediction (CSP) with structural invariants to continuously qualify the similarity between predicted crystal structures for related molecules. This allows isomorphous substitution strategies, which can be unreliable for molecular crystals, to be augmented by a priori prediction, thus leveraging the power of both approaches. We used this combined approach to discover a rare example of a low-density (0.54 g cm-3) mesoporous hydrogen-bonded framework (HOF), 3D-CageHOF-1. This structure comprises an organic cage (Cage-3-NH2) that was predicted to form kinetically trapped, low-density polymorphs via CSP. Pointwise distance distribution structural invariants revealed five predicted forms of Cage-3-NH2 that are analogous to experimentally realized porous crystals of a chemically different but geometrically similar molecule, T2. More broadly, this approach overcomes the difficulties in comparing predicted molecular crystals with varying lattice parameters, thus allowing for the systematic comparison of energy-structure landscapes for chemically dissimilar molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and identification of the lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from marine Streptomyces olivaceus strain FXJ7.023 Abstract: A full length about 105 kb gene cluster containing 35 open reading frames involved in the biosynthesis of lobophorins was cloned and sequenced from a fosmid genomic library of Streptomyces olivaceus strain FXJ7.023. The cluster was identified by genome wide annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters by anti SMASH and knockout of loading module-contained region of polyketide skeleton synthesis gene (the starter of lobS1). Gene cluster comparative analysis suggested that the cluster encoded the complete genes for lobophorin polyketide assembly, modification, substrate catalysis, regulation, transportation and resistance, and shows great identity to the newest reported lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127, but with a significant gene rearrangement in the PKS modules.	1
Abstract2class: Transcriptome profiling reveals the roles of pigment formation mechanisms in yellow Paeonia delavayi flowers Abstract: The yellow colour of ornamental varieties of tree peony originated from Paeonia delavayi. However, but P. delavayi and Paeonia suffruticosa belong to different subgroups, so hybridization is difficult and results in a long breeding cycle. However, no comprehensive transcriptomic profiling has focused on the colour formation mechanisms of yellow tree peony petals. Analysing the colour formation mechanism of yellow petals in P. delavayi is very important for directional molecular breeding. In this study, the transcriptional map of yellow pigment development in petals was used to analyse the mechanism of petal colour formation. We analysed the genes related to the metabolism of flavonoids and carotenoids and the transcription factors (TFs) involved in P. delavayi var. lutea (pure yellow individual) yellow pigment development using transcriptome sequence profiling. Transcriptome sequence profiles revealed three and four differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis, respectively. An analysis of DETs in the flavonoid pathway showed that chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone 2´-glucosyltransferases (THC2'GT) act in synergy to synthesize isosalipurposide (ISP). CHS and flavonol synthase (FLS) synergistically synthesize quercetin and kaempferol. DEG analysis of the carotenoid pathway revealed that phytoene synthase (PSY), carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) and β-carotene hydroxylases (CHYB) play a key role in regulating lutein formation, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) plays an important role in the degradation of carotenoids. These two pathways may be regulated by TF families such as bHLH, ARF, and MYB. The results of the transient overexpression of genes showed that CHS and CHI are regulated by PdMYB2. In this study, the molecular mechanism of ISP synthesis was analysed in depth, and the complete metabolic pathway of carotenoids in Paeonia L. was reported for the first time. By studying the formation mechanism of yellow pigment in P. delavayi petals, a breeding strategy for improving flavonol and carotenoid contents and reducing anthocyanin synthesis by genetic engineering was suggested.	0
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 Abstract: Saccharopolyspora erythraea is used for the industrial-scale production of the antibiotic erythromycin A, derivatives of which play a vital role in medicine. The sequenced chromosome of this soil bacterium comprises 8,212,805 base pairs, predicted to encode 7,264 genes. It is circular, like those of the pathogenic actinomycetes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but unlike the linear chromosomes of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the closely related Streptomyces avermitilis. The S. erythraea genome contains at least 25 gene clusters for production of known or predicted secondary metabolites, at least 72 genes predicted to confer resistance to a range of common antibiotic classes and many sets of duplicated genes to support its saprophytic lifestyle. The availability of the genome sequence of S. erythraea will improve insight into its biology and facilitate rational development of strains to generate high-titer producers of clinically important antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Biogenesis of Yersinia pestis PsaA in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine (RASV) strain Abstract: Yersinia pestis PsaA is an adhesin important for the establishment of bacterial infection. PsaA synthesis requires the products of the psaEFABC genes. Here, by prediction analysis, we identified a PsaA signal sequence with two signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage sites, type-I and type-II (SPase-I and SPase-II). By Edman degradation and site-directed mutagenesis, the precise site for one of these Spase-I PsaA cleavage sites was located between alanine and serine at positions 31 and 32, respectively. Yersinia pestis psaA expression and the role of the PsaB and PsaC proteins were evaluated in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains. PsaA was detected in total extracts as a major 15-kDa (mature) and 18-kDa (unprocessed) protein bands. PsaA synthesis was not altered by a DeltaA31-DeltaS32 double-deletion mutation. In contrast, the synthesis of PsaA (DeltaA31-DeltaS32) in Y. pestis and delivery to the supernatant was decreased. Otherwise, substitution of the amino acid cysteine at position 26 by valine involved in the SPase-II cleavage site did not show any effect on the secretion of PsaA in Salmonella and Yersinia. These results help clarify the secretion pathway of PsaA for the possible development of vaccines against Y. pestis.	0
Abstract2class: Yeast as a promising heterologous host for steroid bioproduction Abstract: With the rapid development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies, yeast has been generally considered as promising hosts for the bioproduction of secondary metabolites. Sterols are essential components of cell membrane, and are the precursors for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, signaling molecules, and defense molecules in the higher eukaryotes, which are of pharmaceutical and agricultural significance. In this mini-review, we summarize the recent engineering efforts of using yeast to synthesize various steroids, and discuss the structural diversity that the current steroid-producing yeast can achieve, the challenge and the potential of using yeast as the bioproduction platform of various steroids from higher eukaryotes.	0
Abstract2class: Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid Abstract: Enzymatic beacons, or E-beacons, are 1 : 1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C-terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E-beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C-terminal protein-cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site-specifically to mono-sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E-beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx-A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence-specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E-beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl-quenched E-beacons specific for SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E-beacons (80×10-12 M) reported wild-type SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at ≥1×10-9 M by increased bioluminescence of 8-fold. E-beacon prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E-beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E-beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.	0
Abstract2class: A Pathogen-Responsive Gene Cluster for Highly Modified Fatty Acids in Tomato Abstract: In response to biotic stress, plants produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionalities. Despite their chemical complexity and proposed roles in pathogen defense, little is known about the biosynthesis of decorated fatty acids in plants. Falcarindiol is a prototypical acetylenic lipid present in carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of fungi and human cancer cell lines. Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) required for falcarindiol production. By reconstituting initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host and generating transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role of the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in tomato leaves. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens and provides critical insight into the complex biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production.	1

Abstract2class: Conversion of viridicatic acid to crustosic acid by cytochrome P450 enzyme-catalysed hydroxylation and spontaneous cyclisation Abstract: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are considered nature's most versatile catalysts and play a crucial role in regio- and stereoselective oxidation reactions on a broad range of organic molecules. The oxyfunctionalisation of unactivated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds, in particular, represents a key step in the biosynthesis of many natural products as it provides substrates with increased reactivity for tailoring reactions. In this study, we investigated the function of the P450 enzyme TraB in the terrestric acid biosynthetic pathway. We firstly deleted the gene coding for the DNA repair subunit protein Ku70 by using split marker-based deletion plasmids for convenient recycling of the selection marker to improve gene targeting in Penicillium crustosum. Hereby, we reduced ectopic DNA integration and facilitated genetic manipulation in P. crustosum. Afterward, gene deletion in the Δku70 mutant of the native producer P. crustosum and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans with precursor feeding proved the involvement of TraB in the formation of crustosic acid by catalysing the essential hydroxylation reaction of viridicatic acid. KEY POINTS: •Deletion of Ku70 by using split marker approach for selection marker recycling. •Functional identification of the cytochrome P450 enzyme TraB. •Fulfilling the reaction steps in the terrestric acid biosynthesis.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering Pseudochelin Production in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Myxobacteria utilize the catechol natural products myxochelin A and B in order to maintain their iron homeostasis. Recently, the production of these siderophores, along with a new myxochelin derivative named pseudochelin A, was reported for the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas piscicida S2040. The latter derivative features a characteristic imidazoline moiety, which was proposed to originate from an intramolecular condensation reaction of the β-aminoethyl amide group in myxochelin B. To identify the enzyme catalyzing this conversion, we compared the myxochelin regulons of two myxobacterial strains that produce solely myxochelin A and B with those of P. piscicida S2040. This approach revealed a gene exclusive to the myxochelin regulon in P. piscicida S2040, coding for an enzyme of the amidohydrolase superfamily. To prove that this enzyme is indeed responsible for the postulated conversion, the reaction was reconstituted in vitro using a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein made in Escherichia coli, with myxochelin B as the substrate. To test the production of pseudochelin A under in vivo conditions, the amidohydrolase gene was cloned into the myxobacterial plasmid pZJY156 and placed under the control of a copper-inducible promoter. The resulting vector was introduced into the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus DSM 16526, a native producer of myxochelin A and B. Following induction with copper, the myxobacterial expression strain was found to synthesize small quantities of pseudochelin A. Replacement of the copper-inducible promoter with the constitutive pilA promoter led to increased production levels in M. xanthus, which facilitated the isolation and subsequent structural verification of the heterologously produced compound.IMPORTANCE In this study, an enzyme for imidazoline formation in pseudochelin biosynthesis was identified. Evidence for the involvement of this enzyme in the postulated reaction was obtained after in vitro reconstitution. Furthermore, the function of this enzyme was demonstrated in vivo by transferring the corresponding gene into the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, which thereby became a producer of pseudochelin A. In addition to clarifying the molecular basis of imidazoline formation in siderophore biosynthesis, we describe the heterologous expression of a gene in a myxobacterium without chromosomal integration. Due to its metabolic proficiency, M. xanthus represents an interesting alternative to established host systems for the reconstitution and manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. Since the plasmid used in this study is easily adaptable for the expression of other enzymes as well, we expand the conventional expression strategy for myxobacteria, which is based on the integration of biosynthetic genes into the host genome.	1
Abstract2class: Evidence for the involvement of human DNA polymerase N in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links Abstract: Human DNA polymerase N (PolN) is an A-family nuclear DNA polymerase whose function is unknown. This study examines the possible role of PolN in DNA repair in human cells treated with PolN-targeted siRNA. HeLa cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of PolN were more sensitive than control cells to DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC) but were not hypersensitive to UV irradiation. The MMC hypersensitivity of PolN knockdown cells was rescued by the overexpression of DNA polymerase-proficient PolN but not by DNA polymerase-deficient PolN. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that purified PolN conducts low-efficiency nonmutagenic bypass of a psoralen DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL), whose structure resembles an intermediate in the proposed pathway of ICL repair. These results suggest that PolN might play a role in translesion DNA synthesis during ICL repair in human cells.	0
Abstract2class: Origin of the allyl group in FK506 biosynthesis Abstract: FK506 (tacrolimus) is a secondary metabolite with a potent immunosuppressive activity, currently registered for use as immunosuppressant after organ transplantation. FK506 and FK520 are biogenetically related natural products that are synthesized by combined polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems. The entire gene cluster for biosynthesis of FK520 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus has been cloned and sequenced. On the other hand, the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 (ATCC55098) was sequenced only partially, and it was reasonable to expect that additional genes would be required for the provision of substrate supply. Here we report the identification of a previously unknown region of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488 containing genes encoding the provision of unusual building blocks for FK506 biosynthesis as well as a regulatory gene. Among others, we identified a group of genes encoding biosynthesis of the extender unit that forms the allyl group at carbon 21 of FK506. Interestingly, we have identified a small independent diketide synthase system involved in the biosynthesis of the allyl group. Inactivation of one of these genes, encoding an unusual ketosynthase domain, resulted in an FK506 nonproducing strain, and the production was restored when a synthetic analog of the allylmalonyl-CoA extender unit was added to the cultivation medium. Based on our results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for the provision of an unusual five-carbon extender unit, which is carried out by a novel diketide synthase complex.	1
Abstract2class: Direct prenylation of aromatic and alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxamides via iridium-catalyzed C-H oxidative addition-allene insertion Abstract: Exposure of aromatic carboxamides 1e-1m, heteroaromatic carboxamides 1n-1p, and alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxamides 1q-1s to 1,1-dimethylallene in the presence of the a cationic iridium complex derived from [Ir(cod)(2)]BAr(F)(4) and rac-BINAP results in direct C-H prenylation to furnish adducts 2e-2m, 2n-2p, and 2q-2s, respectively, in good isolated yields as single isomers.	0
Abstract2class: Acurin A, a novel hybrid compound, biosynthesized by individually translated PKS- and NRPS-encoding genes in Aspergillus aculeatus Abstract: This work presents the identification and proposed biosynthetic pathway for a compound of mixed polyketide-nonribosomal peptide origin that we named acurin A. The compound was isolated from an extract of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus, and its core structure resemble that of the mycotoxin fusarin C produced by several Fusarium species. Based on bioinformatics in combination with RT-qPCR experiments and gene-deletion analysis, we identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in A. aculeatus responsible for the biosynthesis of acurin A. Moreover, we were able to show that a polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzyme separately encoded by this BGC are responsible for the synthesis of the PK-NRP compound, acurin A, core structure. In comparison, the production of fusarin C is reported to be facilitated by a linked PKS-NRPS hybrid enzyme. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the PKS and NRPS in A. aculeatus resulted from a recent fission of an ancestral hybrid enzyme followed by gene duplication. In addition to the PKS- and NRPS-encoding genes of acurin A, we show that six other genes are influencing the biosynthesis including a regulatory transcription factor. Altogether, we have demonstrated the involvement of eight genes in the biosynthesis of acurin A, including an in-cluster transcription factor. This study highlights the biosynthetic capacity of A. aculeatus and serves as an example of how the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be exploited for the construction of fungal strains that can be readily engineered.	1
Abstract2class: Thermotoga neapolitana bglB gene, upstream of lamA, encodes a highly thermostable beta-glucosidase that is a laminaribiase Abstract: The gene for thermostable 1,3-beta-glucosidase BglB was cloned from the chromosome of Thermotoga neapolitana and its primary sequence was determined. The purified recombinant beta-glucosidase B had a monomer molecular mass of 81 kDa in accordance with the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of clone pTT51. It was a member of glycosylhydrolase family 3 and belonged to enzyme class EC 3.2.1.21. beta-Glucosidase B had a specific activity of 255 U mg-1 on 4-nitrophenyl(PNP)-beta-glucoside at the optima of pH (5.5) and temperature (90 degrees C), and K(m) values of 0.1, 10 and 50 mM for PNP-beta-glucoside, laminaribiose and cellobiose, respectively. The gene bglB was located immediately upstream of the laminarinase gene lamA. Both genes were transcribed from the same DNA strand and were not separated by a palindromic transcription terminator. The two purified enzymes 1,3-beta-glucosidase BglB (laminaribiase) and 1,3-beta-glucanase LamA (laminarinase) were together capable of completely degrading laminarin to glucose.	0
Abstract2class: Overproduction of Ristomycin A by activation of a silent gene cluster in Amycolatopsis japonicum MG417-CF17 Abstract: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria within the last decades is one reason for the urgent need for new antibacterial agents. A strategy to discover new anti-infective compounds is the evaluation of the genetic capacity of secondary metabolite producers and the activation of cryptic gene clusters (genome mining). One genus known for its potential to synthesize medically important products is Amycolatopsis. However, Amycolatopsis japonicum does not produce an antibiotic under standard laboratory conditions. In contrast to most Amycolatopsis strains, A. japonicum is genetically tractable with different methods. In order to activate a possible silent glycopeptide cluster, we introduced a gene encoding the transcriptional activator of balhimycin biosynthesis, the bbr gene from Amycolatopsis balhimycina (bbrAba), into A. japonicum. This resulted in the production of an antibiotically active compound. Following whole-genome sequencing of A. japonicum, 29 cryptic gene clusters were identified by genome mining. One of these gene clusters is a putative glycopeptide biosynthesis gene cluster. Using bioinformatic tools, ristomycin (syn. ristocetin), a type III glycopeptide, which has antibacterial activity and which is used for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, was deduced as a possible product of the gene cluster. Chemical analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the in silico prediction that the recombinant A. japonicum/pRM4-bbrAba synthesizes ristomycin A.	1
Abstract2class: Allenyl and alkynyl phenyl ethers from the endolichenic fungus Neurospora terricola Abstract: Terricollenes A-C (1-3), new allenyl phenyl ethers, and terricolynes (4-6), new alkynyl phenyl ethers, have been isolated from the crude extract of the endolichenic fungus Neurospora terricola. The structures of these compounds were elucidated primarily by NMR experiments. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by reversed-phase HPLC analysis on the o-tolylthiocarbamates of the liberated sugars upon acid hydrolysis, whereas that of 4 was assigned using the modified Mosher method. Compound 1 showed modest cytotoxicity against the human tumor cell lines HeLa and MCF-7.	0
Abstract2class: Dynamical Study of Adsorbate-Induced Restructuring Kinetics in Bimetallic Catalysts Using the PdAu(111) Model System Abstract: Dynamic restructuring of bimetallic catalysts plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity and selectivity. In particular, catalyst pretreatment with species such as carbon monoxide and oxygen has been shown to be an effective strategy for tuning the surface composition and morphology. Mechanistic and kinetic understanding of such restructuring is fundamental to the chemistry and engineering of surface active sites but has remained challenging due to the large structural, chemical, and temporal degrees of freedom. Here, we combine time-resolved temperature-programmed infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, ab initio thermodynamics, and machine-learning molecular dynamics to uncover previously unidentified timescale and kinetic parameters of in situ restructuring in Pd/Au(111), a highly relevant model system for dilute Pd-in-Au nanoparticle catalysts. The key innovation lies in utilizing CO not only as a chemically sensitive probe of surface Pd but also as an agent that induces restructuring of the surface. Upon annealing in vacuum, as-deposited Pd islands became encapsulated by Au and partially dissolved into the subsurface, leaving behind isolated Pd monomers on the surface. Subsequent exposure to 0.1 mbar CO enabled Pd monomers to repopulate the surface up to 373 K, above which complete Pd dissolution occurred by 473 K, with apparent activation energies of 0.14 and 0.48 eV, respectively. These restructuring processes occurred over the span of ∼1000 s at a given temperature. Such a minute-timescale dynamics not only elucidates the fluxional nature of alloy catalysts but also presents an opportunity to fine-tune the surface under moderate temperature and pressure conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Shared PKS Module in Biosynthesis of Synergistic Laxaphycins Abstract: Cyanobacteria produce a wide range of lipopeptides that exhibit potent membrane-disrupting activities. Laxaphycins consist of two families of structurally distinct macrocyclic lipopeptides that act in a synergistic manner to produce antifungal and antiproliferative activities. Laxaphycins are produced by range of cyanobacteria but their biosynthetic origins remain unclear. Here, we identified the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of the laxaphycins produced by Scytonema hofmannii PCC 7110. We show that these laxaphycins, called scytocyclamides, are produced by this cyanobacterium and are encoded in a single biosynthetic gene cluster with shared polyketide synthase enzymes initiating two distinct non-ribosomal peptide synthetase pathways. The unusual mechanism of shared enzymes synthesizing two distinct types of products may aid future research in identifying and expressing natural product biosynthetic pathways and in expanding the known biosynthetic logic of this important family of natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of a backbone hexasaccharide fragment of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I Abstract: Synthesis of the fully unprotected hexasaccharide backbone of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I is described. The strategy relies on iterative coupling of a common pentenyl disaccharide glycosyl donor followed by a late-stage oxidation of the C-6 positions of the galactose residues. The disaccharide donor is prepared by an efficient chemoselective armed-disarmed coupling of a thiophenyl rhamnoside donor with a pentenyl galactoside acceptor bearing the strongly electron-withdrawing pentafluorobenzoyl ester (PFBz) protective group.	0
Abstract2class: Pattern of tamoxifen-induced Tie2 deletion in endothelial cells in mature blood vessels using endo SCL-Cre-ERT transgenic mice Abstract: Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie2, also known as Tunica interna Endothelial cell Kinase or TEK plays a prominent role in endothelial responses to angiogenic and inflammatory stimuli. Here we generated a novel inducible Tie2 knockout mouse model, which targets mature (micro)vascular endothelium, enabling the study of the organ-specific contribution of Tie2 to these responses. Mice with floxed Tie2 exon 9 alleles (Tie2floxed/floxed) were crossed with end-SCL-Cre-ERT transgenic mice, generating offspring in which Tie2 exon 9 is deleted in the endothelial compartment upon tamoxifen-induced activation of Cre-recombinase (Tie2ΔE9). Successful deletion of Tie2 exon 9 in kidney, lung, heart, aorta, and liver, was accompanied by a heterogeneous, organ-dependent reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein expression. Microvascular compartment-specific reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein occurred in arterioles of all studied organs, in renal glomeruli, and in lung capillaries. In kidney, lung, and heart, reduced Tie2 expression was accompanied by a reduction in Tie1 mRNA expression. The heterogeneous, organ- and microvascular compartment-dependent knockout pattern of Tie2 in the Tie2floxed/floxed;end-SCL-Cre-ERT mouse model suggests that future studies using similar knockout strategies should include a meticulous analysis of the knockout extent of the gene of interest, prior to studying its role in pathological conditions, so that proper conclusions can be drawn.	0

Abstract2class: CaMKII enhances voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 activity and neuronal excitability Abstract: Nav1.6 is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel isoform expressed in mature axon initial segments and nodes, making it critical for initiation and propagation of neuronal impulses. Thus, Nav1.6 modulation and dysfunction may have profound effects on input-output properties of neurons in normal and pathological conditions. Phosphorylation is a powerful and reversible mechanism regulating ion channel function. Because Nav1.6 and the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are independently linked to excitability disorders, we sought to investigate modulation of Nav1.6 function by CaMKII signaling. We show that inhibition of CaMKII, a Ser/Thr protein kinase associated with excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitability disorders, with the CaMKII-specific peptide inhibitor CN21 reduces transient and persistent currents in Nav1.6-expressing Purkinje neurons by 87%. Using whole-cell voltage clamp of Nav1.6, we show that CaMKII inhibition in ND7/23 and HEK293 cells significantly reduces transient and persistent currents by 72% and produces a 5.8-mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Immobilized peptide arrays and nanoflow LC-electrospray ionization/MS of Nav1.6 reveal potential sites of CaMKII phosphorylation, specifically Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 within the first intracellular loop of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis to test multiple potential sites of phosphorylation, we show that Ala substitutions of Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 recapitulate the depolarizing shift in activation and reduction in current density. Computational simulations to model effects of CaMKII inhibition on Nav1.6 function demonstrate dramatic reductions in spontaneous and evoked action potentials in a Purkinje cell model, suggesting that CaMKII modulation of Nav1.6 may be a powerful mechanism to regulate neuronal excitability.	0
Abstract2class: Exploiting the natural diversity of microviridin gene clusters for discovery of novel tricyclic depsipeptides Abstract: Microviridins are ribosomally synthesized tricyclic depsipeptides produced by different genera of cyanobacteria. The prevalence of the microviridin gene clusters and the natural diversity of microviridin precursor sequences are currently unknown. Screening of laboratory strains and field samples of the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis via PCR revealed global occurrence of the microviridin pathway and an unexpected natural variety. We could detect 15 new variants of the precursor gene mdnA encoding microviridin backbones that differ in up to 4 amino acid positions from known isoforms of the peptide. The survey not only provides insights into the versatility of the biosynthetic enzymes in a closely related group of cyanobacteria, but also facilitates the discovery and characterization of cryptic microviridin variants. This is demonstrated for microviridin L in Microcystis aeruginosa strain NIES843 and heterologously produced variants.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and purification of a new kalimantacin/batumin-related polyketide antibiotic and elucidation of its biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Kal/bat, a polyketide, isolated to high purity (>95%) is characterized by strong and selective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus species (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.05 microg/mL), and no resistance was observed in strains already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The kal/bat biosynthesis gene cluster was determined to a 62 kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359. The kal/bat gene cluster consists of 16 open reading frames (ORF), encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS system, extended with trans-acting tailoring functions. A full model for kal/bat biosynthesis is postulated and experimentally tested by gene inactivation, structural confirmation (using NMR spectroscopy), and complementation. The structural and microbiological study of biosynthetic kal/bat analogs revealed the importance of the carbamoyl group and 17-keto group for antibacterial activity. The mechanism of self-resistance lies within the production of an inactive intermediate, which is activated in a one-step enzymatic oxidation upon export. The genetic basis and biochemical elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of this antibiotic will facilitate rational engineering for the design of novel structures with improved activities. This makes it a promising new therapeutic option to cope with multidrug-resistant clinical infections.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of a Cryptic Depsipeptide from Streptomyces ghanaensis via MALDI-MS-Guided High-Throughput Elicitor Screening Abstract: Microbial genomes harbor an abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters, but most are expressed at low levels and need to be activated for characterization of their cognate natural products. In this work, we report the combination of high-throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) for the rapid identification of cryptic peptide natural products. Application to Streptomyces ghanaensis identified amygdalin as an elicitor of a novel non-ribosomal peptide, which we term cinnapeptin. Complete structural elucidation revealed cinnapeptin as a cyclic depsipeptide with an unusual 2-methyl-cinnamoyl group. Insights into its biosynthesis were provided by whole genome sequencing and gene deletion studies, while bioactivity assays showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fission yeast. MALDI-HiTES is a broadly applicable tool for the discovery of cryptic peptides encoded in microbial genomes.	1
Abstract2class: DNA binding of the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog alters in vitro DNA flexibility Abstract: BpH1, the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog, interacts with chromosomal DNA. With DNase I protection assays, we demonstrate in this study that BpH1 binds DNA in a nonspecific manner and that it may cover DNA fragments from end to end. Although the binding was shown to be nonspecific, preferential binding sites and sites resistant to BpH1 binding were identified within and upstream of the pertussis toxin promoter sequence. In the presence of DNA ligase, BpH1 favored the formation of multimeric DNA fragments of various sizes and prevented ring closures, suggesting a diminished flexibility of the DNA fragments and thus indicating that BpH1 acts as a macromolecular crowding agent.	0
Abstract2class: Identifying the roles of amino acids, alcohols and 1,2-diamines as mediators in coupling of haloarenes to arenes Abstract: Coupling of haloarenes to arenes has been facilitated by a diverse range of organic additives in the presence of KO(t)Bu or NaO(t)Bu since the first report in 2008. Very recently, we showed that the reactivity of some of these additives (e.g., compounds 6 and 7) could be explained by the formation of organic electron donors in situ, but the role of other additives was not addressed. The simplest of these, alcohols, including 1,2-diols, 1,2-diamines, and amino acids are the most intriguing, and we now report experiments that support their roles as precursors of organic electron donors, underlining the importance of this mode of initiation in these coupling reactions.	0
Abstract2class: Structure Revision and the Biosynthetic Pathway of Tripartilactam Abstract: Tripartilactam (1) is a natural macrocyclic lactam originally reported to have a unique [18,8,4]-tricyclic framework. However, the validity of this structure has been contested since niizalactam C (2), bearing a [18,6,6]-tricyclic skeleton, was proposed as an alternative structure in 2015. In the present study, a comprehensive reinvestigation of NMR spectroscopic data and a 13C-13C COSY NMR experiment identified direct 13C-13C coupling, thus leading to the unequivocal revision of the structure of tripartilactam as niizalactam C (2). In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis of the tripartilactam-producing bacterial strain and subsequent bioinformatics and mutagenesis analyses identified its biosynthetic pathway, which probably utilizes one of the type I polyketide synthase (PKS) modules iteratively during its biosynthesis and exhibits spontaneous [4+2] cycloaddition from the precursor compound, sceliphrolactam, in the post-PKS process.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the terpene phenalinolactone in Streptomyces sp. Tü6071: analysis of the gene cluster and generation of derivatives Abstract: Phenalinolactones are terpene glycosides with antibacterial activity. A striking structural feature is a highly oxidized gamma-butyrolactone of elusive biosynthetic origin. To investigate the genetic basis of the phenalinolactones biosynthesis, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding gene cluster from the producer strain Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. Spanning a 42 kbp region, 35 candidate genes could be assigned to putatively encode biosynthetic, regulatory, and resistance-conferring functions. Targeted gene inactivations were carried out to specifically manipulate the phenalinolactones pathway. The inactivation of a sugar methyltransferase gene and a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase gene led to the production of modified phenalinolactone derivatives. The inactivation of a Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene disrupted the biosynthetic pathway within gamma-butyrolactone formation. The structure elucidation of the accumulating intermediate indicated that pyruvate is the biosynthetic precursor of the gamma butyrolactone moiety.	1
Abstract2class: RAN proteins and RNA foci from antisense transcripts in C9ORF72 ALS and frontotemporal dementia Abstract: The finding that a GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 ORF 72 (C9ORF72) gene is a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) links ALS/FTD to a large group of unstable microsatellite diseases. Previously, we showed that microsatellite expansion mutations can be bidirectionally transcribed and that these mutations express unexpected proteins by a unique mechanism, repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. In this study, we show that C9ORF72 antisense transcripts are elevated in the brains of C9ORF72 expansion-positive [C9(+)] patients, and antisense GGCCCC (G2C4) repeat-expansion RNAs accumulate in nuclear foci in brain. Additionally, sense and antisense foci accumulate in blood and are potential biomarkers of the disease. Furthermore, we show that RAN translation occurs from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts, resulting in the expression of six RAN proteins (antisense: Pro-Arg, Pro-Ala, Gly-Pro; and sense: Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Pro). These proteins accumulate in cytoplasmic aggregates in affected brain regions, including the frontal and motor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord neurons, with some brain regions showing dramatic RAN protein accumulation and clustering. The finding that unique antisense G2C4 RNA foci and three unique antisense RAN proteins accumulate in patient tissues indicates that bidirectional transcription of expanded alleles is a fundamental pathologic feature of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. Additionally, these findings suggest the need to test therapeutic strategies that target both sense and antisense RNAs and RAN proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD, and to more broadly consider the role of antisense expression and RAN translation across microsatellite expansion diseases.	0
Abstract2class: Indazole-type alkaloids from Nigella sativa seeds exhibit antihyperglycemic effects via AMPK activation in vitro Abstract: Six rare naturally occurring indazole-type alkaloids including two new compounds, 17-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)-4-O-methylnigellidine (1) and nigelanoid (2), and four known compounds (3-6) were isolated from a defatted extract of Nigella sativa (black cumin) seeds. 17-O-(β-d-Glucopyranosyl)-4-O-methylnigellidine (1) increased glucose consumption by liver hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Also, this is the first report of compounds 4 and 6 from a natural source.	0
Abstract2class: Rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unprotected NH imines assisted by a thiourea Abstract: Asymmetric hydrogenation of unprotected NH imines catalyzed by rhodium/bis(phosphine)-thiourea provided chiral amines with up to 97% yield and 95% ee. (1)H NMR studies, coupled with control experiments, implied that catalytic chloride-bound intermediates were involved in the mechanism through a dual hydrogen-bonding interaction. Deuteration experiments proved that the hydrogenation proceeded through a pathway consistent with an imine.	0
Abstract2class: Giant plasmid-encoded polyketide synthases produce the macrolide toxin of Mycobacterium ulcerans Abstract: Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), an emerging human pathogen harbored by aquatic insects, is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a devastating skin disease rife throughout Central and West Africa. Mycolactone, an unusual macrolide with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties, is responsible for the massive s.c. tissue destruction seen in Buruli ulcer. Here, we show that MU contains a 174-kb plasmid, pMUM001, bearing a cluster of genes encoding giant polyketide synthases (PKSs), and polyketide-modifying enzymes, and demonstrate that these are necessary and sufficient for mycolactone synthesis. This is a previously uncharacterized example of plasmid-mediated virulence in a Mycobacterium, and the emergence of MU as a pathogen most likely reflects the acquisition of pMUM001 by horizontal transfer. The 12-membered core of mycolactone is produced by two giant, modular PKSs, MLSA1 (1.8 MDa) and MLSA2 (0.26 MDa), whereas its side chain is synthesized by MLSB (1.2 MDa), a third modular PKS highly related to MLSA1. There is an extreme level of sequence identity within the different domains of the MLS cluster (>97% amino acid identity), so much so that the 16 ketosynthase domains seem functionally identical. This is a finding of significant consequence for our understanding of polyketide biochemistry. Such detailed knowledge of mycolactone will further the investigation of its mode of action and the development of urgently needed therapeutic strategies to combat Buruli ulcer.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of new antileishmanial leads from hits obtained by high-throughput screening Abstract: A previous screen of ~200,000 compounds from the PubChem database identified 70 compounds possessing 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) below 1 μM against Leishmania major promastigotes that were not toxic to mammalian epithelial cancer cells at this concentration (E. Sharlow et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 3:e540, 2009). Based on availability and chemical exclusion criteria, 31 of these compounds were purchased from commercial suppliers and evaluated for in vitro activity against intracellular L. donovani and L. amazonensis parasites. Benzothiazole cyanine compounds (PubChem 16196319 and 16196223) displayed potent activity against intracellular amastigotes, prompting a search for commercially available compounds that were structurally related. Pubchem 123859 (the cyanine dye thiazole orange) showed exceptionally potent activity against intracellular L. donovani in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 21 ± 12 nM) and low cytotoxicity against Vero cells (IC(50) = 7,800 ± 200 nM). Administration of 123859 and 16196319 at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 5 days resulted in 44% ± 4% and 42% ± 3% suppression of liver parasitemia in L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice, respectively, compared to the untreated control group (the reductions in liver parasitemia were 30% ± 5% and 27% ± 4%, respectively, compared to the (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin solution (HPβCD) vehicle control, which itself displayed some antileishmanial activity). Benzothiazole-containing cyanine dyes are thus potential lead compounds for the discovery of novel antileishmanial agents.	0
Abstract2class: Metabolically Active, Fully Hydrolysable Polymersomes Abstract: The synthesis and aqueous self-assembly of a new class of amphiphilic aliphatic polyesters are presented. These AB block polyesters comprise polycaprolactone (hydrophobe) and an alternating polyester from succinic acid and an ether-substituted epoxide (hydrophile). They self-assemble into biodegradable polymersomes capable of entering cells. Their degradation products are bioactive, giving rise to differentiated cellular responses inducing stromal cell proliferation and macrophage apoptosis. Both effects emerge only when the copolymers enter cells as polymersomes and their magnitudes are size dependent.	0

Abstract2class: Cloning and sequencing of the kedarcidin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus sp. ATCC 53650 revealing new insights into biosynthesis of the enediyne family of antitumor antibiotics Abstract: Enediyne natural product biosynthesis is characterized by a convergence of multiple pathways, generating unique peripheral moieties that are appended onto the distinctive enediyne core. Kedarcidin (KED) possesses two unique peripheral moieties, a (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and an iso-propoxy-bearing 2-naphthonate moiety, as well as two deoxysugars. The appendage pattern of these peripheral moieties to the enediyne core in KED differs from the other enediynes studied to date with respect to stereochemical configuration. To investigate the biosynthesis of these moieties and expand our understanding of enediyne core formation, the biosynthetic gene cluster for KED was cloned from Streptoalloteichus sp. ATCC 53650 and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis of the ked cluster revealed the presence of the conserved genes encoding for enediyne core biosynthesis, type I and type II polyketide synthase loci likely responsible for 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthonate formation, and enzymes known for deoxysugar biosynthesis. Genes homologous to those responsible for the biosynthesis, activation, and coupling of the l-tyrosine-derived moieties from C-1027 and maduropeptin and of the naphthonate moiety from neocarzinostatin are present in the ked cluster, supporting 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid as precursors, respectively, for the (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and the 2-naphthonate moieties in KED biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Therapeutic potency of compound RMY-205 for pulmonary fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is linked with a poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary fibrosis by activating pulmonary fibroblasts. N protein interacted with the transforming growth factor β receptor I (TβRI), to disrupt the interaction of TβRI-FK506 Binding Protein12 (FKBP12), which led to activation of TβRI to phosphorylate Smad3 and boost expression of pro-fibrotic genes and secretion of cytokines to promote pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified a compound, RMY-205, that bound to Smad3 to disrupt TβRI-induced Smad3 activation. The therapeutic potential of RMY-205 was strengthened in mouse models of N protein-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This study highlights a signaling pathway of pulmonary fibrosis induced by N protein and demonstrates a novel therapeutic strategy for treating pulmonary fibrosis by a compound targeting Smad3.	0
Abstract2class: Guide Strand 3'-End Modifications Regulate siRNA Specificity Abstract: Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-triggered gene knockdown through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is widely used to study gene function, and siRNA-based therapeutics are in development. However, as the guide strand of an siRNA can function like a natural microRNA (miRNA), siRNAs often repress hundreds of off-target transcripts with complementarity only to the seed region (nucleotides 2-8) of the guide strand. Here, we describe novel guide strand 3'-end modifications derived from 1-ethynylribose (1-ER) and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions and evaluate their impact on target versus miRNA-like off-target knockdown. Surprisingly, when positioned at the guide strand 3'-end, the parent 1-ER modification substantially reduced off-target knockdown while having no measurable effect on on-target knockdown potency. In addition, these modifications were shown to modulate siRNA affinity for the hAgo2 PAZ domain. However, the change in PAZ domain binding affinity was not sufficient to predict the modification's effect on miRNA-like off targeting.	0
Abstract2class: Two sets of paralogous genes encode the enzymes involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Recently, a second copy of a gene encoding proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah1), an enzyme involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus, was identified and isolated. Using Southern analysis, we have now isolated second copies of the genes encoding the carboxyethylarginine synthase (ceaS) and beta-lactam synthetase (bls) enzymes. These new paralogues are given the gene designations ceaS1 and bls1 and are located immediately upstream of pah1 on the chromosome. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the region downstream of pah1 revealed a second copy of a gene encoding ornithine acetyltransferase (oat1), thus indicating the presence of a cluster of paralogue genes. ceaS1, bls1, and oat1 display 73, 60, and 63% identities, respectively, at the nucleotide level to the original ceaS2, bls2, and oat2 genes from the clavulanic acid gene cluster. Single mutants defective in ceaS1, bls1, or oat1 were prepared and characterized and were found to be affected to variable degrees in their ability to produce clavulanic acid and clavam metabolites. Double mutants defective in both copies of the genes were also prepared and tested. The ceaS1/ceaS2 and the bls1/bls2 mutant strains were completely blocked in clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis. On the other hand, oat1/oat2 double mutants still produced some clavulanic acid and clavam metabolites. This may be attributed to the presence of the argJ gene in S. clavuligerus, which encodes yet another ornithine acetyltransferase enzyme that may be able to compensate for the lack of OAT1 and -2 in the double mutants.	1
Abstract2class: Expansion within the CYP71D subfamily drives the heterocyclization of tanshinones synthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza Abstract: Tanshinones are the bioactive nor-diterpenoid constituents of the Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza). These groups of chemicals have the characteristic furan D-ring, which differentiates them from the phenolic abietane-type diterpenoids frequently found in the Lamiaceae family. However, how the 14,16-epoxy is formed has not been elucidated. Here, we report an improved genome assembly of Danshen using a highly homozygous genotype. We identify a cytochrome P450 (CYP71D) tandem gene array through gene expansion analysis. We show that CYP71D373 and CYP71D375 catalyze hydroxylation at carbon-16 (C16) and 14,16-ether (hetero)cyclization to form the D-ring, whereas CYP71D411 catalyzes upstream hydroxylation at C20. In addition, we discover a large biosynthetic gene cluster associated with tanshinone production. Collinearity analysis indicates a more specific origin of tanshinones in Salvia genus. It illustrates the evolutionary origin of abietane-type diterpenoids and those with a furan D-ring in Lamiaceae.	1
Abstract2class: Structural basis of nonribosomal peptide macrocyclization in fungi Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) in fungi biosynthesize important pharmaceutical compounds, including penicillin, cyclosporine and echinocandin. To understand the fungal strategy of forging the macrocyclic peptide linkage, we determined the crystal structures of the terminal condensation-like (CT) domain and the holo thiolation (T)-CT complex of Penicillium aethiopicum TqaA. The first, to our knowledge, structural depiction of the terminal module in a fungal NRPS provides a molecular blueprint for generating new macrocyclic peptide natural products.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of large treponemes from the bovine rumen Abstract: Ten strains of strictly anaerobic spiral organisms were isolated in pure culture from a 10(-7) dilution of bovine rumen contents. Three strains were studied in detail. These strains morphologically resembled previously isolated and described rumen treponemes except the new isolates were larger, 0.7 micrometer wide and 12 to 25 micrometer long. They rapidly fermented pectin and, less readily, L-arabinose, inulin, and sucrose. Acetic and formic acid were the main fermentation products from pectin; small amounts of succinic acid were also formed.	0
Abstract2class: The anti-angiogenic agent fumagillin covalently binds and inhibits the methionine aminopeptidase, MetAP-2 Abstract: The inhibition of new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) is an effective means of limiting both the size and metastasis of solid tumors. The leading anti-angiogenic compound, TNP-470, has proven to be effective in in vitro and in animal model studies, and is currently being tested in phase III antitumor clinical trials. Despite many detailed pharmacological studies, little is known of the molecular mode of action of TNP-470. Using a derivative of the TNP-470 parent compound, the fungal metabolite, fumagillin, we have purified a mammalian protein that is selectively and covalently bound by this natural product. This fumagillin binding protein was found to be a metalloprotease, methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP-2), that is highly conserved between human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of MetAP-1, a distantly related methionine aminopeptidase, MetAP-2 function is essential for vegetative growth in yeast. We demonstrate that fumagillin selectively inhibits the S. cerevisiae MetAP-2 protein in vivo. The binding is highly specific as judged by the failure of fumagillin to inhibit MetAP-1 in vivo. Hence, these results identify MetAP-2 as an important target of study in the analysis of the potent biological activities of fumagillin.	1
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of the aureothin iterative type I polyketide synthase Abstract: The modular-type polyketide synthase (PKS) that is involved in aureothin (aur) biosynthesis represents one of the first examples in which a single PKS module (AurA) is used in an iterative fashion. Here we report on the heterologous expression of an engineered AurAB fusion protein that unequivocally proves the iterative nature of AurA. In addition, point mutations reveal that aur PKS module 4 participates in polyketide biosynthesis despite its aberrant acyltransferase domain.	1
Abstract2class: Photochemical regulation of restriction endonuclease activity Abstract: Removal by the light: The photochemical regulation of restriction endonucleases, which are important enzymes in molecular biology, has been investigated. Photolabile protecting groups have been installed on DNA substrates and have been demonstrated to inhibit restriction endonuclease activity until removed by UV light irradiation. Interestingly, these groups do not appear to dramatically affect initial binding of the enzyme to the DNA substrate, but rather prevent recognition of the specific cleavage site.	0
Abstract2class: Bre1 and Ubp8 regulate H2B mono-ubiquitination and the reversible yeast-hyphae transition in Candida albicans Abstract: The reversible yeast-hyphae transition of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is tightly linked to its pathogenicity. In this study, we show that histone H2B mono-ubiquitination (H2Bub) at lysine 123 was maintained at a low level in the yeast state, whereas it increased significantly during yeast-to-hyphae transition and decreased when hyphae converted to yeast. The increased H2Bub level is correlated with activation of the hyphal program. H2B ubiquitination and deubiquitination are dynamically regulated by the E3 ligase Bre1 and the deubiquitinase Ubp8 during the reversible yeast-hyphae transition. The functions of Bre1 and Ubp8 in hypha-specific gene (HSG) regulation appears to be direct because both are recruited to the coding regions of HSGs during hyphal induction. The sequential recruitment of Bre1 and Ubp8 to HSGs coding regions is important for the initiation and maintenance of HSG expression. Additionally, Ubp8 contributes to the pathogenicity of C. albicans during early infection in a mouse model. Our study is the first to link H2B ubiquitination to the morphological plasticity and pathogenicity of the human fungal pathogen C. albicans and shed light on potential antifungal treatments.	0
Abstract2class: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Biological Activity of the Cyclic Lipopeptide Anikasin Abstract: The class of cyclic lipopeptide natural products consists of compounds with a diverse range of bioactivities. In this study, we elucidated the structure of the cyclic lipopeptide anikasin using X-ray crystallography, analyzed its biosynthetic gene cluster, and investigated its natural role in the interaction between the producer strain Pseudomonas fluorescens HKI0770 and protozoal predators. These results led to the conclusion that anikasin has dual functionality enabling swarming motility and acting as a niche amoebicide, which effectively inhibits the social amoeba Polysphondylium violaceum and protects the producer strain from protozoal grazing.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: cluster analysis and assignment of functions Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin has been cloned from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Sequence analysis indicates that the macrolide ring of borrelidin is formed by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) (borA1-A6), a result that was confirmed by disruption of borA3. The borrelidin PKS is striking because only seven rather than the nine modules expected for a nonaketide product are encoded by borA1-A6. The starter unit of the PKS has been verified as trans-cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (trans-1,2-CPDA), and the genes involved in its biosynthesis identified. Other genes responsible for biosynthesis of the nitrile moiety, regulation, and self-resistance were also identified.	1
Abstract2class: Bactericidal efficiency and modes of action of the novel antimicrobial peptide T9W against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The antipseudomonal efficiency and mechanism of action of a novel engineered antimicrobial peptide, T9W, were evaluated in this study. T9W displayed high activity, with a lethal concentration (LC) of 1 to 4 μM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including against ciprofloxacin-, gentamicin-, and ceftazidime-resistant strains, even in the presence of 50 to 300 mM NaCl, 1 to 5 mM Ca(2+), or 0.5 to 2 mM Mg(2+). The time-kill curve (TKC) analysis demonstrated concentration-dependent activity, with T9W achieving complete killing in less than 30 min at 1× LC and in less than 5 min at 4× LC. Combination TKC analyses additionally demonstrated a synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The selectivity of T9W was further supported by its ability to specifically eliminate P. aeruginosa in a coculture with macrophages without toxicity to the mammalian cells. The results from fluorescent measurement indicated that T9W bound to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and induced P. aeruginosa membrane depolarization, and microscopic observations and flow cytometry further indicated that T9W targeted the P. aeruginosa cell membrane and disrupted cytoplasmic membrane integrity, thereby causing cellular content release leading to cell death. This study revealed the potential usefulness of T9W as a novel antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and action of the N-oxygenase AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: Nitro groups are found in a number of bioactive compounds. Most of them arise by a stepwise mono-oxygenation of amino groups. One of the involved enzymes is AurF participating in the biosynthesis of aureothin. Its structure was established at 2.1 A resolution showing a homodimer with a binuclear manganese cluster. The enzyme preparation, which yielded the analyzed crystals, showed activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. Chain fold and cluster are homologous with ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 and related enzymes. The two manganese ions and an iron content of about 15% were established by anomalous X-ray diffraction. A comparison of the cluster with more common di-iron clusters suggested an additional histidine in the coordination sphere to cause the preference for manganese over iron. There is no oxo-bridge. The substrate p-amino-benzoate was modeled into the active center. The model is supported by mutant activity measurements. It shows the geometry of the reaction and explains the established substrate spectrum.	1
Abstract2class: Vms1p is a release factor for the ribosome-associated quality control complex Abstract: Eukaryotic cells employ the ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) to maintain homeostasis despite defects that cause ribosomes to stall. The RQC comprises the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p, the ATPase Cdc48p, Rqc1p, and Rqc2p. Upon ribosome stalling and splitting, the RQC assembles on the 60S species containing unreleased peptidyl-tRNA (60S:peptidyl-tRNA). Ltn1p and Rqc1p facilitate ubiquitination of the incomplete nascent chain, marking it for degradation. Rqc2p stabilizes Ltn1p on the 60S and recruits charged tRNAs to the 60S to catalyze elongation of the nascent protein with carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine extensions (CAT tails). By mobilizing the nascent chain, CAT tailing can expose lysine residues that are hidden in the exit tunnel, thereby supporting efficient ubiquitination. If the ubiquitin-proteasome system is overwhelmed or unavailable, CAT-tailed nascent chains can aggregate in the cytosol or within organelles like mitochondria. Here we identify Vms1p as a tRNA hydrolase that releases stalled polypeptides engaged by the RQC.	0
Abstract2class: A kinase-independent activity of Cdk9 modulates glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene induction Abstract: A gene induction competition assay has recently uncovered new inhibitory activities of two transcriptional cofactors, NELF-A and NELF-B, in glucocorticoid-regulated transactivation. NELF-A and -B are also components of the NELF complex, which participates in RNA polymerase II pausing shortly after the initiation of gene transcription. We therefore asked if cofactors (Cdk9 and ELL) best known to affect paused polymerase could reverse the effects of NELF-A and -B. Unexpectedly, Cdk9 and ELL augmented, rather than prevented, the effects of NELF-A and -B. Furthermore, Cdk9 actions are not blocked either by Ckd9 inhibitors (DRB or flavopiridol) or by two Cdk9 mutants defective in kinase activity. The mode and site of action of NELF-A and -B mutants with an altered NELF domain are similarly affected by wild-type and kinase-dead Cdk9. We conclude that Cdk9 is a new modulator of GR action, that Ckd9 and ELL have novel activities in GR-regulated gene expression, that NELF-A and -B can act separately from the NELF complex, and that Cdk9 possesses activities that are independent of Cdk9 kinase activity. Finally, the competition assay has succeeded in ordering the site of action of several cofactors of GR transactivation. Extension of this methodology should be helpful in determining the site and mode of action of numerous additional cofactors and in reducing unwanted side effects.	0
Abstract2class: RNA-protein complexes mediate in vitro capping of the spliced-leader primary transcript and U-RNAs in Trypanosoma cruzi Abstract: A 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL) is joined to the 5' ends of trypanosome mRNAs in a bimolecular or trans-splicing process. The SL in Trypanosoma cruzi is transcribed as an approximately 110-nucleotide RNA (SL-RNA or SL primary transcript) bearing the 39-nucleotide SL at the 5' end. The SL-RNA is 5' capped by a guanylyltransferase activity prior to trans-splicing and trypanosome mRNAs thus obtain their mature caps from the SL by trans-splicing. We have previously characterized a guanylyltransferase activity from T. cruzi nuclear extracts and shown that this capping activity has an unusual ATP dependence and an apparent specificity for the SL-RNA and U-RNAs. Herein, we show that the capping activity sediments as a 12-15S particle during velocity sedimentation in glycerol gradients and fractionates as a greater than 150-kDa particle during large-pore gel filtration chromatography. Moreover, the endogenous substrate RNAs--the SL-RNA and U-RNAs--consistently copurify with the capping activity, suggesting that the activity and the substrates form a ribonucleoprotein particle. The capping activity and substrate RNAs are not dissociated in isopycnic Cs2SO4 gradients and band at a density expected for an RNA-protein complex, confirming the existence of ribonucleoprotein particles bearing both the activity and its substrate RNAs. Finally, we partially purified these ribonucleoprotein particles and showed that the capping activity remains ATP dependent and highly specific for the SL-RNA and the U-RNAs. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the functions of trans-splicing is for mRNA capping.	0
Abstract2class: Linker Flexibility Facilitates Module Exchange in Fungal Hybrid PKS-NRPS Engineering Abstract: Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) each give rise to a vast array of complex bioactive molecules with further complexity added by the existence of natural PKS-NRPS fusions. Rational genetic engineering for the production of natural product derivatives is desirable for the purpose of incorporating new functionalities into pre-existing molecules, or for optimization of known bioactivities. We sought to expand the range of natural product diversity by combining modules of PKS-NRPS hybrids from different hosts, hereby producing novel synthetic natural products. We succeeded in the construction of a functional cross-species chimeric PKS-NRPS expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. Module swapping of the two PKS-NRPS natural hybrids CcsA from Aspergillus clavatus involved in the biosynthesis of cytochalasin E and related Syn2 from rice plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae lead to production of novel hybrid products, demonstrating that the rational re-design of these fungal natural product enzymes is feasible. We also report the structure of four novel pseudo pre-cytochalasin intermediates, niduclavin and niduporthin along with the chimeric compounds niduchimaeralin A and B, all indicating that PKS-NRPS activity alone is insufficient for proper assembly of the cytochalasin core structure. Future success in the field of biocombinatorial synthesis of hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides relies on the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of inter-modular polyketide chain transfer. Therefore, we expressed several PKS-NRPS linker-modified variants. Intriguingly, the linker anatomy is less complex than expected, as these variants displayed great tolerance with regards to content and length, showing a hitherto unreported flexibility in PKS-NRPS hybrids, with great potential for synthetic biology-driven biocombinatorial chemistry.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of CYP76AH4 clarifies phenolic diterpenoid biosynthesis in the Lamiaceae Abstract: Miltiradiene (1) is the precursor of phenolic diterpenoids such as ferruginol (2), requiring aromatization and hydroxylation. While this has been attributed to a single cytochrome P450 (CYP76AH1), characterization of the rosemary ortholog CYP76AH4 led to the discovery that these CYPs simply hydroxylate the facilely oxidized aromatic intermediate abietatriene (3).	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the orthosomycin antibiotic avilamycin A: deductions from the molecular analysis of the avi biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and production of new antibiotics Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the producer of avilamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a heptasaccharide side chain and a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the avilamycin A biosynthesis is of major interest as this information might set the direction for the development of new antimicrobial agents.                  Results:                       A 60-kb section of the S. viridochromogenes Tü57 chromosome containing genes involved in avilamycin biosynthesis was sequenced. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 54 open reading frames. Based on the putative function of the gene products a model for avilamycin biosynthesis is proposed. Inactivation of aviG4 and aviH, encoding a methyltransferase and a halogenase, respectively, prevented the mutant strains from producing the complete dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety resulting in the accumulation of new antibiotics named gavibamycins.                  Conclusions:                       The avilamycin A biosynthetic gene cluster represents an interesting system to study the formation and attachment of unusual deoxysugars. Several enzymes putatively responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. Two genes encoding enzymes involved in post-PKS tailoring reactions were deleted allowing the production of new analogues of avilamycin A.	1
Abstract2class: The pvc gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: role in synthesis of the pyoverdine chromophore and regulation by PtxR and PvdS Abstract: A putative operon of four genes implicated in the synthesis of the chromophore moiety of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdine, dubbed pvcABCD (where pvc stands for pyoverdine chromophore), was cloned and sequenced. Mutational inactivation of the pvc genes abrogated pyoverdine biosynthesis, consistent with their involvement in the biosynthesis of this siderophore. pvcABCD expression was negatively regulated by iron and positively regulated by both PvdS, the alternate sigma factor required for pyoverdine biosynthesis, and PtxR, a LysR family activator previously implicated in exotoxin A regulation.	1
Abstract2class: Effects of transcriptional mode on promoter substitution and tandem engineering for the production of epothilones in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Promoter optimization is an economical and effective approach to overexpress heterologous genes and improve the biosynthesis of valuable products. In this study, we swapped the original promoter of the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster in Myxococcus xanthus with two endogenous strong promoters P pilA and P groEL1 , respectively, which, however, decreased the epothilone production ability. The transcriptional abilities by the two promoters were found to be bloomed in the growth stage but markedly decreased after the growth, whereas the original promoter P epo functioned majorly after the exponential growth stage. Tandem repeat engineering on the original promoter P epo remarkably increased epothilone production. The tandem promoter exerted similar expressional pattern as P epo did in M. xanthus. We demonstrated that differential transcriptional modes markedly affected the efficiency of promoters in controlling the gene expressions for the production of the secondary metabolite epothilones. Our study provides an insight into exploiting powerful promoters to produce valuable secondary metabolites, especially in host with limited known promoters.	0
Abstract2class: Wolff Rearrangement of Oxidatively Generated α-Oxo Gold Carbenes: An Effective Approach to Silylketenes Abstract: Gold-catalyzed oxidations of alkynes by N-oxides offer direct access to reactive α-oxo gold carbene intermediates from benign and readily available alkynes instead of hazardous diazo carbonyl compounds. Despite various versatile synthetic methods developed based on this strategy, one of the hallmarks of α-oxo carbene/carbenoid chemistry, that is, the Wolff rearrangement, has not been realized in this context. This study discloses the first examples that show the Wolff rearrangement can be readily realized by α-oxo gold carbenes oxidatively generated from TBS-terminated alkynes (TBS=tert-butyldimethylsilyl). The thus-generated silylketenes can be either isolated pure or subsequently trapped by various internal or external nucleophiles in one pot to afford α-silylated carboxylic acids, their derivatives, or TBS-substituted allenes.	0
Abstract2class: PWP2, a member of the WD-repeat family of proteins, is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene involved in cell separation Abstract: WD-repeat proteins contain four to eight copies of a conserved motif that usually ends with a tryptophan-aspartate (WD) dipeptide. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PWP2 gene, identified by sequencing of chromosome III, is predicted to contain eight so-called WD-repeats, flanked by nonhomologous extensions. This gene is expressed as a 3.2-kb mRNA in all cell types and encodes a protein of 104 kDa. The PWP2 gene is essential for growth because spores carrying the pwp2 delta 1::HIS3 disruption germinate before arresting growth with one or two large buds. The growth defect of pwp2 delta 1::HIS3 cells was rescued by expression of PWP2 or epitope-tagged HA-PWP2 using the galactose-inducible GALI promoter. In the absence of galactose, depletion of Pwp2p resulted in multibudded cells with defects in bud site selection, cytokinesis, and hydrolysis of the septal junction between mother and daughter cells. In cell fractionation studies, HA-Pwp2p was localized in the particulate component of cell lysates, from which it would be solubulized by high salt and alkaline buffer but not by nonionic detergents or urea. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that HA-Pwp2p was clustered at multiple points in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Pwp2p exists in a proteinaceous complex, possibly associated with the cytoskeleton, where it functions in control of cell growth and separation.	0
Abstract2class: Oxaspirol B with p97 Inhibitory Activity and Other Oxaspirols from Lecythophora sp. FL1375 and FL1031, Endolichenic Fungi Inhabiting Parmotrema tinctorum and Cladonia evansii Abstract: A new metabolite, oxaspirol D (4), together with oxaspirols B (2) and C (3) were isolated from Lecythophora sp. FL1375, an endolichenic fungus isolated from Parmotrema tinctorum, whereas Lecythophora sp. FL1031 inhabiting the lichen Cladonia evansii afforded oxaspirols A (1), B (2), and C (3). Of these, oxaspirol B (2) showed moderate p97 ATPase inhibitory activity. A detailed characterization of all oxaspirols was undertaken because structures proposed for known oxaspirols have involved incomplete assignments of NMR spectroscopic data leading only to their planar structures. Thus, the naturally occurring isomeric mixture (2a and 2b) of oxaspirol B was separated as their diacetates (5a and 5b) and the structures and absolute configurations of 1, 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 were determined by the application of spectroscopic techniques including two-dimensional NMR and the modified Mosher's ester method. Oxaspirol B (2) and its diacetates 5a and 5b were evaluated for their ATPase inhibitory activities of p97, p97 mutants, and other ATP-utilizing enzymes, and only 2 was found to be active, indicating the requirement of some structural features in oxaspirols for their activity. Additional biochemical and cellular assays suggested that 2 was a reversible, non-ATP competitive, and specific inhibitor of p97.	0
Abstract2class: Rapid PCR amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes leads to a predictive familial classification model Abstract: A universal PCR method for the rapid amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and the application of this methodology to clone remaining prototypical genes from producers of structurally determined enediynes in both family types are presented. A phylogenetic analysis of the new pool of bona fide enediyne PKS genes, consisting of three from 9-membered producers (neocarzinostatin, C1027, and maduropeptin) and three from 10-membered producers (calicheamicin, dynemicin, and esperamicin), reveals a clear genotypic distinction between the two structural families from which to form a predictive model. The results from this study support the postulation that the minimal enediyne PKS helps define the structural divergence of the enediyne core and provides the key tools for generating enediyne hybrid genes/molecular scaffolds; by using the model, a classification is also provided for the unknown enediyne PKS genes previously identified via genome scanning.	1
Abstract2class: Optimizing natural products by biosynthetic engineering: discovery of nonquinone Hsp90 inhibitors Abstract: A biosynthetic medicinal chemistry approach was applied to the optimization of the natural product Hsp90 inhibitor macbecin. By genetic engineering, mutants have been created to produce novel macbecin analogues including a nonquinone compound (5) that has significantly improved binding affinity to Hsp90 (Kd 3 nM vs 240 nM for macbecin) and reduced toxicity (MTD > or = 250 mg/kg). Structural flexibility may contribute to the preorganization of 5 to exist in solution in the Hsp90-bound conformation.	1
Abstract2class: Direct Comparison of d-DNA and l-DNA Strand-Displacement Reactions in Living Mammalian Cells Abstract: To overcome technical challenges associated with the use of DNA strand-displacement circuits in vivo, including degradation by cellular nucleases, researchers are increasingly turning to bio-orthogonal l-DNA. Although enhanced stability and improved performance of l-DNA-based circuits within living cells are often implied, direct experimental evidence has not been provided. Herein, we directly compare the functional stability and kinetics of d-DNA and l-DNA strand-displacement in live cells for the first time. We show that l-DNA strand-displacement reaction systems have minimal "leak", fast reaction kinetics, and prolonged stability inside living cells as compared to conventional d-DNA. Furthermore, using "heterochiral" strand-displacement, we demonstrate that biostable l-DNA reaction components can be easily interfaced with native DNA inside cells. Overall, our results strongly support the broader adoption of l-DNA in the field of DNA molecular circuitry, especially for in vivo applications.	0
Abstract2class: Novel South African Rare Actinomycete Kribbella speibonae Strain SK5: A Prolific Producer of Hydroxamate Siderophores Including New Dehydroxylated Congeners Abstract: In this paper, we report on the chemistry of the rare South African Actinomycete Kribbella speibonae strain SK5, a prolific producer of hydroxamate siderophores and their congeners. Two new analogues, dehydroxylated desferrioxamines, speibonoxamine 1 and desoxy-desferrioxamine D1 2, have been isolated, together with four known hydroxamates, desferrioxamine D1 3, desferrioxamine B 4, desoxy-nocardamine 5 and nocardamine 6, and a diketopiperazine (DKP) 7. The structures of 1-7 were characterized by the analysis of HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR data, as well as by comparison with the relevant literature. Three new dehydroxy desferrioxamine derivatives 8-10 were tentatively identified in the molecular network of K. speibonae strain SK5 extracts, and structures were proposed based on their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. A plausible spb biosynthetic pathway was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of desferrioxamines from the actinobacterial genus Kribbella.	1
Abstract2class: In Situ Single-Cell Western Blot on Adherent Cell Culture Abstract: Integrating 2D culture of adherent mammalian cells with single-cell western blotting (in situ scWB) uses microfluidic design to eliminate the requirement for trypsin release of cells to suspension, prior to single-cell isolation and protein analysis. To assay HeLa cells from an attached starting state, we culture adherent cells in fibronectin-functionalized microwells formed in a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel. To integrate the culture, lysis, and assay workflow, we introduce a one-step copolymerization process that creates protein-decorated microwells. After single-cell culture, we lyse each cell in the microwell and perform western blotting on each resultant lysate. We observe cell spreading after overnight microwell-based culture. scWB reports increased phosphorylation of MAP kinases (ERK1/2, p38) under hypertonic conditions. We validate the in situ scWB with slab-gel western blot, while revealing cell-to-cell heterogeneity in stress responses.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic analysis of violacein biosynthesis by Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Chromobacterium violaceum presents a distinctive phenotypic characteristic, the production of a deep violet pigment named violacein. Although the physiological function of this pigment is not well understood, the sequencing of the genome of this bacterium has given some insight into the mechanisms and control of violacein production. It was found that erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), a precursor to aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, is produced by the non-oxidative portion of the hexose monophosphate pathway, since it lacks 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. All genes leading from E4P plus phosphoenolpyruvate to tryptophan are present in the genome. Nevertheless, these genes are not organized in an operon, as in E. coli, indicating that other mechanisms are involved in expression. The sequencing data also indicated the presence and organization of an operon for violacein biosynthesis. Three of the four gene products of this operon presented similarity with nucleotide-dependent monooxygenases and one with a limiting enzyme polyketide synthase. As previously suggested, genes encoding proteins involved in quorum sensing control by N-hexanoyl-homoserine-lactone, an autoinducer signal molecule, are present in the bacterial genome. These data should help guide strategies to increase violacein biosynthesis, a potentially useful molecule.	1
Abstract2class: Clickable polyglycerol hyperbranched polymers and their application to gold nanoparticles and acid-labile nanocarriers Abstract: A one-step, large-scale preparation of alkyne-containing hyper-branched polyglycerols (HPG) is reported.

Abstract2class: Illuminating the diversity of aromatic polyketide synthases in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the ability to synthesize many more natural products (NPs) than are currently known, but methods for obtaining suitable expression of NPs have been inadequate. We have developed a successful strategy that bypasses normal regulatory mechanisms. By efficient gene targeting, we have replaced, en masse, the promoters of nonreducing polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) genes, key genes in NP biosynthetic pathways, and other genes necessary for NR-PKS product formation or release. This has allowed us to determine the products of eight NR-PKSs of Aspergillus nidulans, including seven novel compounds, as well as the NR-PKS genes required for the synthesis of the toxins alternariol (8) and cichorine (19).	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the leucine derived α-, β- and γ-hydroxynitrile glucosides in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Abstract: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) produces five leucine-derived hydroxynitrile glucosides (HNGs), of which only epiheterodendrin is a cyanogenic glucoside. The four non-cyanogenic HNGs are the β-HNG epidermin and the γ-HNGs osmaronin, dihydroosmaronin and sutherlandin. By analyzing 247 spring barley lines including landraces and old and modern cultivars, we demonstrated that the HNG level varies notably between lines whereas the overall ratio between the compounds is constant. Based on sequence similarity to the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes involved in dhurrin biosynthesis, we identified a gene cluster on barley chromosome 1 putatively harboring genes that encode enzymes in HNG biosynthesis. Candidate genes were functionally characterized by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Five multifunctional P450s, including two CYP79 family enzymes and three CYP71 family enzymes, and a single UDP-glucosyltransferase were found to catalyze the reactions required for biosynthesis of all five barley HNGs. Two of the CYP71 enzymes needed to be co-expressed for the last hydroxylation step in sutherlandin synthesis to proceed. This observation, together with the constant ratio between the different HNGs, suggested that HNG synthesis in barley is organized within a single multi-enzyme complex.	1
Abstract2class: Horizontal gene cluster transfer increased hallucinogenic mushroom diversity Abstract: Secondary metabolites are a heterogeneous class of chemicals that often mediate interactions between species. The tryptophan-derived secondary metabolite, psilocin, is a serotonin receptor agonist that induces altered states of consciousness. A phylogenetically disjunct group of mushroom-forming fungi in the Agaricales produce the psilocin prodrug, psilocybin. Spotty phylogenetic distributions of fungal compounds are sometimes explained by horizontal transfer of metabolic gene clusters among unrelated fungi with overlapping niches. We report the discovery of a psilocybin gene cluster in three hallucinogenic mushroom genomes, and evidence for its horizontal transfer between fungal lineages. Patterns of gene distribution and transmission suggest that synthesis of psilocybin may have provided a fitness advantage in the dung and late wood-decay fungal niches, which may serve as reservoirs of fungal indole-based metabolites that alter behavior of mycophagous and wood-eating invertebrates. These hallucinogenic mushroom genomes will serve as models in neurochemical ecology, advancing the (bio)prospecting and synthetic biology of novel neuropharmaceuticals.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis, characterization, and utility of thermoresponsive natural/unnatural product macroligands for affinity chromatography Abstract: [Structure: see text] The synthesis and characterization of thermoresponsive, water-soluble poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide (PNIPAM) derived macroligands displaying cyclosporin A (CsA) and dexamethasone (Dex) for use as novel affinity resins are described. Characterization of these soluble macroligands, including ligand loading and integrity, was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. One of the CsA macroligands was used in a protein affinity experiment to capture known binding proteins of CsA, the cyclophilins, from Jurkat T-cell lysates.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of Streptomyces rubellomurinus genes required for biosynthesis of antimalarial compound FR900098 Abstract: The antibiotics fosmidomycin and FR900098 are members of a unique class of phosphonic acid natural products that inhibit the nonmevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are potent antibacterial and antimalarial compounds, but despite their efficacy, little is known regarding their biosynthesis. Here we report the identification of the Streptomyces rubellomurinus genes required for the biosynthesis of FR900098. Expression of these genes in Streptomyces lividans results in production of FR900098, demonstrating their role in synthesis of the antibiotic. Analysis of the putative gene products suggests that FR900098 is synthesized by metabolic reactions analogous to portions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These data greatly expand our knowledge of phosphonate biosynthesis and enable efforts to overproduce this highly useful therapeutic agent.	1
Abstract2class: A novel mechanism of phase variation of virulence in Staphylococcus epidermidis: evidence for control of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesis by alternating insertion and excision of the insertion sequence element IS256 Abstract: Biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis on smooth polymer surfaces has been shown to be mediated by the ica operon. Upon activation of this operon, a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is synthesized that supports bacterial cell-to-cell contacts and triggers the production of thick, multilayered biofilms. Thus, the ica gene cluster represents a genetic determinant that significantly contributes to the virulence of specific Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. PIA synthesis has been reported recently to undergo a phase variation process. In this study, biofilm-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and their PIA-negative phase variants were analysed genetically to investigate the molecular mechanisms of phase variation. We have characterized biofilm-negative variants by Southern hybridization with ica-specific probes, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. The data obtained in these analyses suggested that in approximately 30% of the variants the missing biofilm formation was due to the inactivation of either the icaA or the icaC gene by the insertion of the insertion sequence element IS256. Furthermore, it was shown that the transposition of IS256 into the ica operon is a reversible process. After repeated passages of the PIA-negative insertional mutants, the biofilm-forming phenotype could be restored. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the revertants confirmed the complete excision of IS256, including the initially duplicated 8 bp target sites. These results elucidate, for the first time, a molecular mechanism mediating phase variation in staphylcocci, and they demonstrate that a naturally occurring insertion sequence element is actively involved in the modulation of expression of a Staphylococcus virulence factor.	0
Abstract2class: Organization of the genes encoding the biosynthesis of actagardine and engineering of a variant generation system Abstract: The biosynthetic pathway of the type B lantibiotic actagardine (formerly gardimycin), produced by Actinoplanes garbadinensis ATCC31049, has been cloned, sequenced and annotated. The gene cluster contains the gene garA that encodes the actagardine prepropeptide, a modification gene garM, involved in the dehydration and cyclization of the prepeptide, several putative transporter and regulatory genes as well as a novel luciferase-like monooxygenase gene designated garO. Expression of these genes in Streptomyces lividans resulted in the production of ala(0)-actagardine while deletion of the garA gene from A. garbadinensis generated a strain incapable of producing actagardine. Actagardine production was successfully restored however, by the delivery of the plasmid pAGvarX. This plasmid contains an engineered cassette of the actagardine encoding gene garA and offers an alternative route to generating extensive libraries of actagardine variants. Using this plasmid, an alanine scanning library has been constructed and the mutants analysed. Further modifications include the removal of the novel garO gene from A. garbadinensis. Deletion of this gene resulted in the production of deoxy variants of actagardine, demonstrating that the formation of the sulfoxide group is enzyme catalysed and not a spontaneous chemical modification as previously believed.	1
Abstract2class: β-Lactone formation during product release from a nonribosomal peptide synthetase Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multidomain modular biosynthetic assembly lines that polymerize amino acids into a myriad of biologically active nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). NRPS thioesterase (TE) domains employ diverse release strategies for off-loading thioester-tethered polymeric peptides from termination modules typically via hydrolysis, aminolysis, or cyclization to provide mature antibiotics as carboxylic acids/esters, amides, and lactams/lactones, respectively. Here we report the enzyme-catalyzed formation of a highly strained β-lactone ring during TE-mediated cyclization of a β-hydroxythioester to release the antibiotic obafluorin (Obi) from an NRPS assembly line. The Obi NRPS (ObiF) contains a type I TE domain with a rare catalytic cysteine residue that plays a direct role in β-lactone ring formation. We present a detailed genetic and biochemical characterization of the entire Obi biosynthetic gene cluster in plant-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 39502 that establishes a general strategy for β-lactone biogenesis.	1
Abstract2class: Resistance Gene-Guided Genome Mining: Serial Promoter Exchanges in Aspergillus nidulans Reveal the Biosynthetic Pathway for Fellutamide B, a Proteasome Inhibitor Abstract: Fungal genome projects are revealing thousands of cryptic secondary metabolism (SM) biosynthetic gene clusters that encode pathways that potentially produce valuable compounds. Heterologous expression systems should allow these clusters to be expressed and their products obtained, but approaches are needed to identify the most valuable target clusters. The inp cluster of Aspergillus nidulans contains a gene, inpE, that encodes a proteasome subunit, leading us to hypothesize that the inp cluster produces a proteasome inhibitor and inpE confers resistance to this compound. Previous efforts to express this cluster have failed, but by sequentially replacing the promoters of the genes of the cluster with a regulatable promotor, we have expressed them successfully. Expression reveals that the product of the inp cluster is the proteasome inhibitor fellutamide B, and our data allow us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the compound. By deleting inpE and activating expression of the inp cluster, we demonstrate that inpE is required for resistance to internally produced fellutamide B. These data provide experimental validation for the hypothesis that some fungal SM clusters contain genes that encode resistant forms of the enzymes targeted by the compound produced by the cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Nucleoid condensation and cell division in Escherichia coli MX74T2 ts52 after inhibition of protein synthesis Abstract: The reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid of an Escherichia coli mutant, MX74T2 ts52, was studied by electron microscopy after protein synthesis inhibition by using whole mounts of cell ghosts, ultrathin-sectioning, and freeze-etching. The bacterial nucleoid showed two morphological changes after chloramphenicol addition: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) localization and DNA condensation. DNA localization was observed 10 min after chloramphenicol addition; the DNA appeared as a compact, solid mass. DNA condensation was observed at 25 min; the nucleoid appeared as a cytoplasm-filled sphere, often opened at one end. Ribosomes were observed in the center. Giant nucleoids present in some mutant filaments showed fused, spherical nucleoids arranged linearly, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the nucleoid reflects the number of replicated genomes. Inhibitors which directly or indirectly blocked protein synthesis and caused DNA condensation were chloramphenicol, puromycin, amino acid starvation, rifampicin, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. All inhibitors that caused cell division in the mutant also caused condensation, although some inhibitors caused condensation without cell division. Nucleoid condensation appears to be related to chromosome structure rather than to DNA segregation upon cell division.	0
Abstract2class: The Aspergillus nidulans bimC4 mutation provides an excellent tool for identification of kinesin-14 inhibitors Abstract: Centrosome amplification is a hallmark of many types of cancer cells, and clustering of multiple centrosomes is critical for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Human kinesin-14 HSET/KFIC1 is essential for centrosome clustering, and its inhibition leads to the specific killing of cancer cells with extra centrosomes. Since kinesin-14 motor domains are conserved evolutionarily, we conceived a strategy of obtaining kinesin-14 inhibitors using Aspergillus nidulans, based on the previous result that loss of the kinesin-14 KlpA rescues the non-viability of the bimC4 kinesin-5 mutant at 42 °C. However, it was unclear whether alteration of BimC or any other non-KlpA protein would be a major factor reversing the lethality of the bimC4 mutant. Here we performed a genome-wide screen for bimC4 suppressors and obtained fifteen suppressor strains. None of the suppressor mutations maps to bimC. The vast majority of them contain mutations in the klpA gene, most of which are missense mutations affecting the C-terminal motor domain. Our study confirms that the bimC4 mutant is suitable for a cell-based screen for chemical inhibitors of kinesin-14. Since the selection is based on enhanced growth rather than diminished growth, cytotoxic compounds can be excluded.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of carnocyclin a, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307 Abstract: Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307, isolated from fresh pork, exhibits potent activity against a number of gram-positive organisms, including numerous Listeria species. Three bacteriocins were isolated from culture supernatant, and using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing, two of these bacteriocins were identified as piscicolin 126 and carnobacteriocin BM1, both of which have previously been described. The remaining bacteriocin, with a molecular mass of 5,862 Da, could not be sequenced by traditional methods, suggesting that the peptide was either cyclic or N-terminally blocked. This bacteriocin showed remarkable stability over a wide temperature and pH range and was unaffected by a variety of proteases. After digestion with trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin, the peptide was de novo sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and a linear sequence deduced, consisting of 60 amino acids. Based on this sequence, the molecular mass was predicted to be 5,880 Da, 18 units higher than the observed molecular mass, which suggested that the peptide has a cyclic structure. Identification of the genetic sequence revealed that this peptide is circular, formed by a covalent linkage between the N and C termini following cleavage of a 4-residue peptide leader sequence. The results of structural studies suggest that the peptide is highly structured in aqueous conditions. This bacteriocin, named carnocyclin A, is the first reported example of a circular bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium spp.	1
Abstract2class: Polyketides produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae induce Candida albicans growth Abstract: Metarhizium anisopliae is an important entomopathogenic species and model for arthropod-fungus interaction studies. This fungus harbors a diverse arsenal of unexplored secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, which are suggested to perform diverse roles during host interaction and soil subsistence as a saprophytic species. Here we explored an unusual carnitine acyltransferase domain-containing highly reducing polyketide synthase found in the genome of M. anisopliae. Employing heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans, two new polyketides were obtained, named BAA and BAB, as well as one known polyketide [(2Z,4E,6E)-octa-2,4,6-trienedioic acid]. Intra-hemocoel injection of the most abundant compound (BAA) in the model-arthropod Galleria mellonella larvae did not induce mortality or noticeable alterations, suggesting that this compound may not harbor insecticidal activity. Also, the potential role of such molecules in polymicrobial interactions was evaluated. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration assays using distinct fungal species revealed that BAA and BAB did not alter Cryptococcus neoformans growth, while BAA exhibited weak antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, these compounds increased Candida albicans growth compared to control conditions. Furthermore, BAA can mitigate the fungicidal effects of fluconazole over C. albicans. Although the exact role of these compounds on the M. anisopliae life cycle is elusive, the described results add up to the complexity of secondary metabolites produced by Metarhizium spp. Moreover, up to our knowledge, these are the first polyketides isolated from filamentous fungi that can boost the growth of another fungal species.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning of a Vibrio cholerae vibriobactin gene cluster: identification of genes required for early steps in siderophore biosynthesis Abstract: Vibrio cholerae secretes the catechol siderophore vibriobactin in response to iron limitation. Vibriobactin is structurally similar to enterobactin, the siderophore produced by Escherichia coli, and both organisms produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) as an intermediate in siderophore biosynthesis. To isolate and characterize V. cholerae genes involved in vibriobactin biosynthesis, we constructed a genomic cosmid bank of V. cholerae DNA and isolated clones that complemented mutations in E. coli enterobactin biosynthesis genes. V. cholerae homologs of entA, entB, entC, entD, and entE were identified on overlapping cosmid clones. Our data indicate that the vibriobactin genes are clustered, like the E. coli enterobactin genes, but the organization of the genes within these clusters is different. In this paper, we present the organization and sequences of genes involved in the synthesis and activation of DHBA. In addition, a V. cholerae strain with a chromosomal mutation in vibA was constructed by marker exchange. This strain was unable to produce vibriobactin or DHBA, confirming that in V. cholerae VibA catalyzes an early step in vibriobactin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster gene cypA is required for G aflatoxin formation Abstract: Aspergillus flavus isolates produce only aflatoxins B1 and B2, while Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus nomius produce aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2. Sequence comparison of the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway gene cluster upstream from the polyketide synthase gene, pksA, revealed that A. flavus isolates are missing portions of genes (cypA and norB) predicted to encode, respectively, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and an aryl alcohol dehydrogenase. Insertional disruption of cypA in A. parasiticus yielded transformants that lack the ability to produce G aflatoxins but not B aflatoxins. The enzyme encoded by cypA has highest amino acid identity to Gibberella zeae Tri4 (38%), a P450 monooxygenase previously shown to be involved in trichodiene epoxidation. The substrate for CypA may be an intermediate formed by oxidative cleavage of the A ring of O-methylsterigmatocystin by OrdA, the P450 monooxygenase required for formation of aflatoxins B1 and B2.	1
Abstract2class: Recognition of individual genes in a single bacterial cell by fluorescence in situ hybridization--RING-FISH Abstract: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes is a standard method for identification of microorganisms in environmental samples. Apart from its value as a phylogenetic marker ribosomal RNA has always been the favoured target molecule for FISH because of its abundance in all cells, whereas plasmids and DNA were regarded as unsuitable targets because of their low copy number. Here we present an improved FISH technique, which is based on polynucleotide probes. It goes beyond the detection of high copy intracellular nucleic acids such as rRNA (up to 10(4)-10(5) copies per cell) and allows for the first time the in situ detection of individual genes or gene fragments on plasmids (10(1)-10(3) copies per cell) and chromosomal DNA (<10 copies per cell) in a single cell. Using E. coli as model organism we were able to detect in situ cells harbouring the antibiotic resistance gene beta lactamase on high, medium and low copy plasmids as well as the chromosomal encoded housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, we detected the prepilin peptidase gene xpsO in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in situ. Because of the characteristic hybridization signal obtained with this method--a halo-like, ring-shaped concentration of fluorescence in the cell periphery--we coined the term RING-FISH (recognition of individual genes) to differentiate it from conventional FISH.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic gene cluster in Rhodobacter capsulatus which is specific for the biogenesis of dimethylsulfoxide reductase Abstract: The DMSO reductase of Rhodobacter capsulatus contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and is located in the periplasm. DNA sequence analysis identified four genes involved in the biosynthesis of the Moco (moaA, moaD, moeB and moaC) immediately downstream of the dor (DMSO respiratory) gene cluster. Rhodobacter capsulatus MoaA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His6-tagged protein. Although, the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies, EPR spectroscopy showed that MoaA contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster. A moaA mutant was constructed and its phenotype indicates that the Moco biosynthetic gene cluster downstream of the dor operon is specific for the biogenesis of DMSO reductase. Two forms of DMSO reductase were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the moaA mutant. A mature form of DMSO reductase was located in the periplasm and a precursor form was found in the cytoplasm.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and occurrence of the hydroxamate siderophores aerobactin, putrebactin, avaroferrin and ochrobactin C as virulence factors from entomopathogenic bacteria Abstract: Effective iron acquisition and fine-tuned intracellular iron storage systems are the main prerequisites for a successful host invasion by a pathogen. Bacteria have developed several different strategies to sequester this essential element from their environment, one relies on the secretion of low molecular weight compounds with high affinity for ferric iron, the so-called siderophores. Here, we report hydroxamate siderophore structures produced by entomopathogenic bacteria of the species Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, which are known for their potential to produce bioactive natural products, required for their role as nematode symbiont and insect pathogen. Four siderophores could be identified, namely aerobactin, putrebactin, avaroferrin and ochrobactin C, which was found previously only in marine bacteria. While the putrebactin and avaroferrin producing biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC) is more widespread and most likely was present in a common ancestor of these bacteria, the aerobactin and ochrobactin producing BGC was probably taken up by a few strains individually. For aerobactin a role in virulence towards Galleria mellonella larvae is shown.	1
Abstract2class: Phylogenomic Analysis of Natural Products Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Allows Discovery of Arseno-Organic Metabolites in Model Streptomycetes Abstract: Natural products from microbes have provided humans with beneficial antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of antibiotic discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads, a challenge that may better faced by unveiling chemical diversity produced by microbes. Current microbial genome mining approaches have revitalized research into antibiotics, but the empirical nature of these methods limits the chemical space that is explored.Here, we address the problem of finding novel pathways by incorporating evolutionary principles into genome mining. We recapitulated the evolutionary history of twenty-three enzyme families previously uninvestigated in the context of natural product biosynthesis in Actinobacteria, the most proficient producers of natural products. Our genome evolutionary analyses where based on the assumption that expanded-repurposed enzyme families-from central metabolism, occur frequently and thus have the potential to catalyze new conversions in the context of natural products biosynthesis. Our analyses led to the discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters coding for hidden chemical diversity, as validated by comparing our predictions with those from state-of-the-art genome mining tools; as well as experimentally demonstrating the existence of a biosynthetic pathway for arseno-organic metabolites in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans, Using a gene knockout and metabolite profile combined strategy.As our approach does not rely solely on sequence similarity searches of previously identified biosynthetic enzymes, these results establish the basis for the development of an evolutionary-driven genome mining tool termed EvoMining that complements current platforms. We anticipate that by doing so real 'chemical dark matter' will be unveiled.	1
Abstract2class: The cluster of penicillin biosynthetic genes. Identification and characterization of the pcbAB gene encoding the alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase and linkage to the pcbC and penDE genes Abstract: Penicillium chrysogenum DNA fragments cloned in EMBL3 or cosmid vectors from the upstream region of the pcbC-penDE cluster carry a gene (pcbAB) that complemented the deficiency of alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase of mutants npe5 and npe10, and restored penicillin production to mutant npe5. A protein of about 250 kDa was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of cell-free extracts of complemented strains that was absent in the npe5 and npe10 mutants but exists in the parental strain from which the mutants were obtained. Transcriptional mapping studies showed the presence of one long transcript of about 11.5 kilobases that hybridized with several probes internal to the pcbAB gene, and two small transcripts of 1.15 kilobases that hybridized with the pcbC or the penDE gene, respectively. The transcription initiation and termination regions of the pcbAB gene were mapped by hybridization with several small probes. The region has been completely sequenced. It includes an open reading frame of 11,376 nucleotides that encodes a protein with a deduced Mr of 425,971. Three repeated dominia were found in the alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase which have high homology with the gramicidin synthetase I and tyrocidine synthetase I. The pcbAB is linked to the pcbC and penDE genes and is transcribed in the opposite orientation to them.	1
Abstract2class: 2-Hydroxysorangiadenosine: Structure and Biosynthesis of a Myxobacterial Sesquiterpene-Nucleoside Abstract: Myxobacteria represent an under-investigated source for biologically active natural products featuring intriguing structural moieties with potential applications, e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry. Sorangiadenosine and the here-discovered 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine are myxobacterial sesquiterpene-nucleosides with an unusual structural moiety, a bicyclic eudesmane-type sesquiterpene. As the biosynthesis of these rare terpene-nucleoside hybrid natural products remains elusive, we investigated secondary metabolomes and genomes of several 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine-producing myxobacteria. We report the isolation and full structure elucidation of 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine and its cytotoxic and antibiotic activities and propose a biosynthetic pathway in the myxobacterium Vitiosangium cumulatum MCy10943T.	1
Abstract2class: A new strategy for aromatic ring alkylation in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis Abstract: Alkylation of aromatic rings with alkyl halides is an important transformation in organic synthesis, yet an enzymatic equivalent is unknown. Here, we report that cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis in Cylindrospermum licheniforme ATCC 29412 involves chlorination of an unactivated carbon center by a novel halogenase, followed by a previously uncharacterized enzymatic dimerization reaction featuring sequential, stereospecific alkylations of resorcinol aromatic rings. Discovery of the enzymatic machinery underlying this unique biosynthetic carbon-carbon bond formation has implications for biocatalysis and metabolic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Ubonodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Active against Members of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex Abstract: We report the heterologous expression, structure, and antimicrobial activity of a lasso peptide, ubonodin, encoded in the genome of Burkholderia ubonensis. The topology of ubonodin is unprecedented amongst lasso peptides, with 18 of its 28 amino acids found in the mechanically bonded loop segment. Ubonodin inhibits RNA polymerase in vitro and has potent antimicrobial activity against several pathogenic members of the Burkholderia genus, most notably B. cepacia and B. multivorans, causative agents of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.	1
Abstract2class: The N-terminus of the Begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (BV1) determines virulence or avirulence in Phaseolus vulgaris Abstract: The BV1 gene of the bipartite Begomovirus genome encodes a nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) that is also an avirulence determinant in common bean. The function of the NSP of two common bean-infecting bipartite begomoviruses, Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) and Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV), was investigated using a series of hybrid DNA-B components expressing chimeric BDMV and BGYMV NSP, and genotypes of the two major common bean gene pools: Andean (cv. Topcrop) and Middle American (cvs. Alpine and UI 114). BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG4 (BDMV DNA-B expressing the BGYMV NSP) and HBDBG9 (BDMV DNA-B expressing a chimeric NSP with the N-terminal 1 to 42 amino acids from BGYMV) overcame the BDMV resistance of UI 114. This established that the BDMV NSP is an avirulence determinant in UI 114, and mapped the domain involved in this response to the N-terminus, which is a variable surface-exposed region. BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG10, expressing a chimeric NSP with amino acids 43 to 92 from BGYMV, was not infectious, revealing an essential virus-specific domain. In the BGYMV background, the BDMV NSP was a virulence factor in the Andean cv. Topcrop, whereas it was an avirulence factor in the Middle American cultivars, particularly in the absence of the BGYMV NSP. The capsid protein (CP) also played a gene pool-specific role in viral infectivity; it was dispensable for infectivity in the Andean cv. Topcrop, but was required for infectivity of BDMV, BGYMV, and certain hybrid viruses in the Middle American cultivars. Redundancy of the CP and NSP, which are nuclear proteins involved directly or indirectly in viral movement, provides a masking effect that may allow the virus to avoid host defense responses.	0
Abstract2class: Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates in two cities of Turkey: description of a new family of genotypes that is phylogeographically specific for Asia Minor Abstract: Background:                       Population-based bacterial genetics using repeated DNA loci is an efficient approach to study the biodiversity and phylogeographical structure of human pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis. Indeed large genetic diversity databases are available for this pathogen and are regularly updated. No population-based polymorphism data were yet available for M. tuberculosis in Turkey, at the crossroads of Eurasia.                  Results:                       A total of 245 DNAs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from tuberculosis patients residing in Turkey (Malatya n = 147 or Ankara n = 98) were genotyped by spoligotyping, a high-throughput genotyping method based on the polymorphism of the Direct Repeat locus. Thirty-three spoligotyping-defined clusters including 206 patients and 39 unique patterns were found. The ST41 cluster, as designated according to the international SpolDB3 database project, represented one fourth and when gathered to three genotypes, ST53, ST50 and ST284, one half of all the isolates. Out of 34 clinical isolates harboring ST41 which were further genotyped by IS6110 and by MIRU-VNTR typing, a typical 2-copy IS6110-RFLP pattern and a "215125113322" MIRU-VNTR pattern were observed among 21 clinical isolates. Further search in various databases confirms the likely Turkish-phylogeographical specificity of this clonal complex.                  Conclusion:                       We described a new phylogeographically-specific clone of M. tuberculosis, designated LAM7-TUR. Further investigations to assess its frequency within all regions of Turkey and its phylogeographical origin and phylogenetic position within the global M. tuberculosis phylogenetic tree will shed new light on its endemicity in Asia Minor.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of Pseudodesmin and Viscosinamide Cyclic Lipopeptides Produced by Pseudomonads Associated with the Cocoyam Rhizosphere Abstract: Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) are encoded non-ribosomally by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and possess diverse biological activities. In this study, we conducted chemical structure and BGC analyses with antimicrobial activity assays for two CLPs produced by Pseudomonas strains isolated from the cocoyam rhizosphere in Cameroon and Nigeria. LC-MS and NMR analyses showed that the Pseudomonas sp. COR52 and A2W4.9 produce pseudodesmin and viscosinamide, respectively. These CLPs belong to the Viscosin group characterized by a nonapeptidic moiety with a 7-membered macrocycle. Similar to other Viscosin-group CLPs, the initiatory non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene of the viscosinamide BGC is situated remotely from the other two NRPS genes. In contrast, the pseudodesmin genes are all clustered in a single genomic locus. Nano- to micromolar levels of pseudodesmin and viscosinamide led to the hyphal distortion and/or disintegration of Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2 and Pythium myriotylum CMR1, whereas similar levels of White Line-Inducing Principle (WLIP), another member of the Viscosin group, resulted in complete lysis of both soil-borne phytopathogens. In addition to the identification of the biosynthetic genes of these two CLPs and the demonstration of their interaction with soil-borne pathogens, this study provides further insights regarding evolutionary divergence within the Viscosin group.	1
Abstract2class: A dual anchoring strategy for the localization and activation of artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology Abstract: Artificial metalloenzymes result from anchoring an active catalyst within a protein environment. Toward this goal, various localization strategies have been pursued: covalent, supramolecular, or dative anchoring. Herein we show that introduction of a suitably positioned histidine residue contributes to firmly anchor, via a dative bond, a biotinylated rhodium piano stool complex within streptavidin. The in silico design of the artificial metalloenzyme was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The resulting artificial metalloenzyme displays significantly improved catalytic performance, both in terms of activity and selectivity in the transfer hydrogenation of imines. Depending on the position of the histidine residue, both enantiomers of the salsolidine product can be obtained.	0
Abstract2class: Copper(II) carboxylate promoted intramolecular diamination of terminal alkenes: improved reaction conditions and expanded substrate scope Abstract: The copper(II) carboxylate promoted diamination reaction has been improved by the use of the organic soluble copper(II) neodecanoate [Cu(ND)2]. Cu(ND)2 allowed the less-polar solvent dichloroethane (DCE) to be used, and as a consequence, decomposition of less-reactive substrates could be avoided. High diastereoselectivity was observed in the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines. Ureas, bis(anilines), and alpha-amido pyrroles derived from 2-allylaniline could also participate in the diamination reaction.	0
Abstract2class: Mechanism-based tuning of a LOV domain photoreceptor Abstract: Phototropin-like LOV domains form a cysteinyl-flavin adduct in response to blue light but show considerable variation in output signal and the lifetime of the photo-adduct signaling state. Mechanistic studies of the slow-cycling fungal LOV photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) reveal the importance of reactive cysteine conformation, flavin electronic environment and solvent accessibility for adduct scission and thermal reversion. Proton inventory, pH effects, base catalysis and structural studies implicate flavin N(5) deprotonation as rate-determining for recovery. Substitutions of active site residues Ile74, Ile85, Met135 and Met165 alter photoadduct lifetimes by over four orders of magnitude in VVD, and similar changes in other LOV proteins show analogous effects. Adduct state decay rates also correlate with changes in conformational and oligomeric properties of the protein necessary for signaling. These findings link natural sequence variation of LOV domains to function and provide a means to design broadly reactive light-sensitive probes.	0
Abstract2class: A B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in oxetanocin A biosynthesis Abstract: Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the catalytic repertoire of Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Metabolic pathway monitoring of phenalinolactone biosynthesis from Streptomyces sp. Tü6071 by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry coupling Abstract: Rationale:                       A rapid and precise analytical method for the investigation of natural products is required for pathway monitoring of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Phenalinolactones, used in antibiotic research, are produced by Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. For the analysis of those compounds, prior to mass spectrometric analysis, an efficient separation technique is required.                  Methods:                       For the identification of phenalinolactones from liquid cultures of Streptomyces sp. Tü6071, a new method comprising the combination of solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) was established. MS/MS product ion scans were applied for phenalinolactone detection and structure elucidation, performed in negative mode and optimized for sensitivity and specificity. For the discovery of new intermediates, a MS/MS precursor ion scan was applied.                  Results:                       Analysis of the extracts revealed that the Oasis® MAX cartridge, containing a quaternary amine functionality, is the most efficient SPE material for purification of phenalinolactones, since it allowed sufficient enrichment and detection of intermediates from the biosynthetic pathway by LC/ESI-MS/MS. Using the precursor ion scan technique, two new secondary metabolites, PL IM1 with m/z 672.6 and PL IM2 with m/z 433.3, have been detected. The structures of the new intermediates are postulated and arranged into the biosynthetic pathway of phenalinolactones.                  Conclusions:                       A precise analytical method was established for the identification of phenalinolactones by combining purification from Streptomyces using SPE prior to LC/ESI-MS/MS. By optimising LC/ESI-MS/MS settings, this method has been successfully applied for pathway monitoring of secondary metabolites. Application of a precursor ion scan allowed for the identification of unknown intermediates in biosynthetic pathways.	1
Abstract2class: DNA polymerase delta isolated from Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains five subunits Abstract: DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) plays an essential role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We have purified pol delta from Schizosaccharomyces pombe more than 10(3)-fold and demonstrated that the polymerase activity of purified S. pombe pol delta is completely dependent on proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication factor C. SDS/PAGE analysis of the purified fraction indicated that the pol delta complex consists of five subunits that migrate with apparent molecular masses of 125, 55, 54, 42, and 22 kDa. Western blot analysis indicated that the 125, 55, and 54 kDa proteins are the large catalytic subunit (Pol3), Cdc1, and Cdc27, respectively. The identity of the other two subunits, p42 and p22, was determined following proteolytic digestion and sequence analysis of the resulting peptides. The peptide sequences derived from the p22 subunit indicated that this subunit is identical to Cdm1, previously identified as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive cdc1-P13 mutant, whereas peptide sequences derived from the p42 subunit were identical to a previously uncharacterized ORF located on S. pombe chromosome 1.	0
Abstract2class: Iterative Mechanism of Macrodiolide Formation in the Anticancer Compound Conglobatin Abstract: Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment, encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through engineering of the polyketide synthase.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of cationic nonribosomal peptides as Gram-negative antibiotics through global genome mining Abstract: The worldwide prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria poses a serious threat to public health due to the limited therapeutic alternatives. Cationic peptides represent a large family of antibiotics and have attracted interest due to their diverse chemical structures and potential for combating drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here, we analyze 7395 bacterial genomes to investigate their capacity for biosynthesis of cationic nonribosomal peptides with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Applying this approach, we identify two novel compounds (brevicidine and laterocidine) showing bactericidal activities against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli, and an apparently low risk of resistance. The two peptides show efficacy against E. coli in a mouse thigh infection model. These findings may contribute to the discovery and development of Gram-negative antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Integrated Omics Strategy Reveals Cyclic Lipopeptides Empedopeptins from Massilia sp. YMA4 and Their Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Empedopeptins-eight amino acid cyclic lipopeptides-are calcium-dependent antibiotics that act against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. However, to date, the biosynthetic mechanism of the empedopeptins has not been well identified. Through comparative genomics and metabolomics analysis, we identified empedopeptin and its new analogs from a marine bacterium, Massilia sp. YMA4. We then unveiled the empedopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. The core nonribosomal peptide gene null-mutant strains (ΔempC, ΔempD, and ΔempE) could not produce empedopeptin, while dioxygenase gene null-mutant strains (ΔempA and ΔempB) produced several unique empedopeptin analogs. However, the antibiotic activity of ΔempA and ΔempB was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type, demonstrating that the hydroxylated amino acid residues of empedopeptin and its analogs are important to their antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found seven bacterial strains that could produce empedopeptin-like cyclic lipopeptides using a genome mining approach. In summary, this study demonstrated that an integrated omics strategy can facilitate the discovery of potential bioactive metabolites from microbial sources without further isolation and purification.	1
Abstract2class: A new Myxococcus xanthus gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic saframycin Mx1 encoding a peptide synthetase Abstract: The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the heterocyclic quinone antibiotic saframycin Mx1 of Myxococcus xanthus DM504/15 was inactivated and tagged by Tn5 insertions. The tagged genes were cloned in Escherichia coli and used to select overlapping cosmid clones spanning 58 kb of the M. xanthus genome. Gene disruption experiments defined a > or = 18 kb contiguous DNA region involved in saframycin biosynthesis. Sequencing of part of this region revealed a large ORF containing two 600-amino-acid domains with similarity to peptide synthetase amino-acid-activating sequences, suggesting that saframycin Mx1 is synthesized by a nonribosomal multienzyme complex, similar to other bioactive peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical mechanisms involved during the biosynthesis of tropolones Abstract: Tropolones are seven-membered aromatic rings which feature in the core of several important bioactive natural products including colchicine and stipitatic acid. Studies of their biosynthesis over nearly 70 years have revealed four parallel routes from polyketide, terpene, alkaloid and shikimate precursors, but the key steps all involve ring expansion of an alkylated 6-membered ring. Recent studies in fungi have revealed details of the individual chemical steps at the molecular level, but detailed molecular biosynthetic pathways in other organisms remain obscure.	1
Abstract2class: Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA-Gapmer Approach Abstract: Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is to replace native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a "gapmer" architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ("gap") containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA) modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA-gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: i) the formation of stable ON-RNA duplexes with base-pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 °C; and ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA-gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and overexpression of ltnl, a novel gene which confers immunity to the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 Abstract: Production and immunity of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 is encoded by the 60-2 kb lactococcal plasmid pMRC01. A 12.6 kb region of this plasmid, containing ten genes in two divergently arranged gene clusters, has been subcloned in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and has been shown to confer both lacticin 3147 production and immunity. Further subcloning revealed that the smaller of the two clusters (ItnRIFE) confers immunity. Although the ItnF and E genes are homologous to ABC transporters which confer immunity to other lantibiotics, deletion analysis indicates that they do not play a role in the immunity exhibited by this subclone in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. Also, a deletion in ItnR (which resembles a family of transcriptional repressors) had no effect on immunity. The remaining gene, Itnl, encodes a 116 amino acid protein with a predicted membrane location which bears no homology to other bacteriocin immunity proteins. Confirmation of its role in immunity was obtained when it was observed that disruption of Itnl resulted in a complete loss of immunity. When Itnl was cloned into the expression vector pMG36e, the resulting construct conferred levels of immunity comparable to pMRC01. This confirmed that under the control of a strong promoter, the Itnl gene product alone is sufficient to confer lacticin immunity. In addition, heterologous expression of Itnl was observed in Enterococcus faecalis OG1X. On cloning Itnl behind a nisin-inducible promoter, it was observed that the level of immunity was dependent on nisin concentration. Using this construct, the authors have demonstrated a potential role for Itnl as food-grade selectable marker. Thus, Ltnl appears to represent a new class of lantibiotic immunity proteins.	1
Abstract2class: An evidence-based knowledgebase of pulmonary arterial hypertension to identify genes and pathways relevant to pathogenesis Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a major progressive form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) with more than 4800 patients in the United States. In the last two decades, many studies have identified numerous genes associated with this disease. However, there is no comprehensive research resource for PAH or other PH types that integrates various genetic studies and their related biological information. Thus, the number of associated genes, and their strength of evidence, is unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a web-based knowledgebase could be used to develop a biological map of highly interrelated, functionally important genes in PAH. We developed the pulmonary arterial hypertension knowledgebase (PAHKB, ), a comprehensive database with a user-friendly web interface. PAHKB extracts genetic data from all available sources, including those from association studies, genetic mutation, gene expression, animal model, supporting literature, various genomic annotations, gene networks, cellular and regulatory pathways, as well as microRNAs. Moreover, PAHKB provides online tools for data browsing and searching, data integration, pathway graphical presentation, and gene ranking. In the current release, PAHKB contains 341 human PH-related genes (293 protein coding and 48 non-coding genes) curated from over 1000 PubMed abstracts. Based on the top 39 ranked PAH-related genes in PAHKB, we constructed a core biological map. This core map was enriched with the TGF-beta signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and MAPK signaling. In addition, the reconstructed map elucidates several novel cancer signaling pathways, which may provide clues to support the application of anti-cancer therapeutics to PAH. In summary, we have developed a system for the identification of core PH-related genes and identified critical signaling pathways that may be relevant to PAH pathogenesis. This system can be easily applied to other pulmonary diseases.	0
Abstract2class: Eliciting the silent lucensomycin biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 via manipulation of the global regulatory gene adpA Abstract: Actinobacteria are among the most prolific sources of medically and agriculturally important compounds, derived from their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for specialized (secondary) pathways of metabolism. Genomics witnesses that the majority of actinobacterial BGCs are silent, most likely due to their low or zero transcription. Much effort is put into the search for approaches towards activation of silent BGCs, as this is believed to revitalize the discovery of novel natural products. We hypothesized that the global transcriptional factor AdpA, due to its highly degenerate operator sequence, could be used to upregulate the expression of silent BGCs. Using Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 as a test case, we showed that plasmids expressing either full-length adpA or its DNA-binding domain led to significant changes in the metabolome. These were evident as changes in the accumulation of colored compounds, bioactivity, as well as the emergence of a new pattern of secondary metabolites as revealed by HPLC-ESI-mass spectrometry. We further focused on the most abundant secondary metabolite and identified it as the polyene antibiotic lucensomycin. Finally, we uncovered the entire gene cluster for lucensomycin biosynthesis (lcm), that remained elusive for five decades until now, and outlined an evidence-based scenario for its adpA-mediated activation.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery and characterization of a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase in a lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Lasso peptides belong to a peculiar family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)-natural products with an unusual isopeptide-bonded slipknot structure. Except for assembling of this unusual lasso fold, several further post-translational modifications of lasso peptides, including C-terminal methylation, phosphorylation/poly-phosphorylation, citrullination, and acetylation, have been reported recently. However, most of their biosynthetic logic have not been elucidated except the phosphorylated paeninodin lasso peptide. Herein, we identified two novel lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathways and, for the first time, characterized a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase involved in these pathways. Our investigations revealed that this new family of methyltransferase could specifically methylate the C terminus of precursor peptide substrates, eventually leading to lassomycin-like C-terminal methylated lasso peptides. Our studies offer another rare insight into the extraordinary strategies of chemical diversification adopted by lasso peptide biosynthetic machinery and predicated two valuable sources for methylated lasso peptide discovery.	1
Abstract2class: Facile transfer of [2Fe-2S] clusters from the diabetes drug target mitoNEET to an apo-acceptor protein Abstract: MitoNEET (mNT) is an outer mitochondrial membrane target of the thiazolidinedione diabetes drugs with a unique fold and a labile [2Fe-2S] cluster. The rare 1-His and 3-Cys coordination of mNT's [2Fe-2S] leads to cluster lability that is strongly dependent on the presence of the single histidine ligand (His87). These properties of mNT are similar to known [2Fe-2S] shuttle proteins. Here we investigated whether mNT is capable of cluster transfer to acceptor protein(s). Facile [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer is observed between oxidized mNT and apo-ferredoxin (a-Fd) using UV-VIS spectroscopy and native-PAGE, as well as with a mitochondrial iron detection assay in cells. The transfer is unidirectional, proceeds to completion, and occurs with a second-order-reaction rate that is comparable to known iron-sulfur transfer proteins. Mutagenesis of His87 with Cys (H87C) inhibits transfer of the [2Fe-2S] clusters to a-Fd. This inhibition is beyond that expected from increased cluster kinetic stability, as the equivalently stable Lys55 to Glu (K55E) mutation did not inhibit transfer. The H87C mutant also failed to transfer its iron to mitochondria in HEK293 cells. The diabetes drug pioglitazone inhibits iron transfer from WT mNT to mitochondria, indicating that pioglitazone affects a specific property, [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer, in the cellular environment. This finding is interesting in light of the role of iron overload in diabetes. Our findings suggest a likely role for mNT in [2Fe-2S] and/or iron transfer to acceptor proteins and support the idea that pioglitazone's antidiabetic mode of action may, in part, be to inhibit transfer of mNT's [2Fe-2S] cluster.	0
Abstract2class: An unusual thioesterase promotes isochromanone ring formation in ajudazol biosynthesis Abstract: The ajudazols are antifungal secondary metabolites produced by a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) multienzyme "assembly line" in the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5. The most striking structural feature of these compounds is an isochromanone ring system; such an aromatic moiety is only known from two other complex polyketides, the electron transport inhibitor stigmatellin and the polyether lasalocid. The cyclization and aromatization reactions in the stigmatellin pathway are presumed to be catalyzed by a cyclase domain located at the end of the PKS, while the origin of the lasalocid benzenoid ring remains obscure. Notably, the ajudazol biosynthetic machinery does not incorporate a terminal cyclase, but instead a variant thioesterase (TE) domain. Here we present detailed phylogenetic and sequence analysis, coupled with experiments both in vitro and in vivo, that suggest that this TE promotes formation of the isochromanone ring, a novel reaction for this type of domain. As the ajudazol TE has homologues in several other secondary-metabolite pathways, these results are likely to be generalizable.	1
Abstract2class: Genome Mining and Biosynthesis of Primary Amine-Acylated Desferrioxamines in a Marine Gliding Bacterium Abstract: Genome mining of Fulvivirga sp. W222 revealed a desferrioxamine-like biosynthetic gene cluster containing an unknown gene fulF that is conserved in many Bacteroidetes species. A series of primary amine-acylated desferrioxamine G1 analogues, fulvivirgamides, were identified, and fulvivirgamides A2, B2, B3, and B4 (1-4) were purified and characterized. The function of FulF, which is a novel acyltransferase for the acylation of the primary amine of Desferrioxamine G1, was verified by heterologous expression and feeding experiments.	1
Abstract2class: Mosaic structure of p1658/97, a 125-kilobase plasmid harboring an active amplicon with the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene blaSHV-5 Abstract: Escherichia coli isolates recovered from patients during a clonal outbreak in a Warsaw, Poland, hospital in 1997 produced different levels of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) of the SHV type. The beta-lactamase hyperproduction correlated with the multiplication of ESBL gene copies within a plasmid. Here, we present the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid p1658/97 carried by the isolates recovered during the outbreak. The plasmid is 125,491 bp and shows a mosaic structure in which all modules constituting the plasmid core are homologous to those found in plasmids F and R100 and are separated by segments of homology to other known regions (plasmid R64, Providencia rettgeri genomic island R391, Vibrio cholerae STX transposon, Klebsiella pneumoniae or E. coli chromosomes). Plasmid p1658/97 bears two replication systems, IncFII and IncFIB; we demonstrated that both are active in E. coli. The presence of an active partition system (sopABC locus) and two postsegregational killing systems (pemIK and hok/sok) indicates that the plasmid should be stably maintained in E. coli populations. The conjugative transfer is ensured by the operons of the tra and trb genes. We also demonstrate that the plasmidic segment undergoing amplification contains the blaSHV-5 gene and is homologous to a 7.9-kb fragment of the K. pneumoniae chromosome. The amplicon displays the structure of a composite transposon of type I.	0
Abstract2class: Turnerbactin, a novel triscatecholate siderophore from the shipworm endosymbiont Teredinibacter turnerae T7901 Abstract: Shipworms are marine bivalve mollusks (Family Teredinidae) that use wood for shelter and food. They harbor a group of closely related, yet phylogenetically distinct, bacterial endosymbionts in bacteriocytes located in the gills. This endosymbiotic community is believed to support the host's nutrition in multiple ways, through the production of cellulolytic enzymes and the fixation of nitrogen. The genome of the shipworm endosymbiont Teredinibacter turnerae T7901 was recently sequenced and in addition to the potential for cellulolytic enzymes and diazotrophy, the genome also revealed a rich potential for secondary metabolites. With nine distinct biosynthetic gene clusters, nearly 7% of the genome is dedicated to secondary metabolites. Bioinformatic analyses predict that one of the gene clusters is responsible for the production of a catecholate siderophore. Here we describe this gene cluster in detail and present the siderophore product from this cluster. Genes similar to the entCEBA genes of enterobactin biosynthesis involved in the production and activation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) are present in this cluster, as well as a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). A novel triscatecholate siderophore, turnerbactin, was isolated from the supernatant of iron-limited T. turnerae T7901 cultures. Turnerbactin is a trimer of N-(2,3-DHB)-L-Orn-L-Ser with the three monomeric units linked by Ser ester linkages. A monomer, dimer, dehydrated dimer, and dehydrated trimer of 2,3-DHB-L-Orn-L-Ser were also found in the supernatant. A link between the gene cluster and siderophore product was made by constructing a NRPS mutant, TtAH03. Siderophores could not be detected in cultures of TtAH03 by HPLC analysis and Fe-binding activity of culture supernatant was significantly reduced. Regulation of the pathway by iron is supported by identification of putative Fur box sequences and observation of increased Fe-binding activity under iron restriction. Evidence of a turnerbactin fragment was found in shipworm extracts, suggesting the production of turnerbactin in the symbiosis.	1
Abstract2class: The effect of varying levels of sodium bicarbonate on polychlorinated biphenyl dechlorination in Hudson River sediment cultures Abstract: The addition of different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate had a profound effect on 2,3,4,5-chlorobiphenyl (2,3,4,5-CB) dechlorination in Hudson River sediment cultures. The most extensive dechlorination was observed in cultures to which 100 mg l(-1) bicarbonate was added. Cultures amended with 1000 mg l(-1) bicarbonate had the least extensive dechlorination, with 2,4-CB and 2,5-CB as predominant end-products. A significant loss of total chlorinated biphenyl mass was observed in cultures to which < or = 500 mg l(-1) bicarbonate was added, suggesting that degradation beyond chlorinated biphenyls occurred. The dynamics of acetate formation were different among the treatments, with high acetate concentrations detected throughout the 303-day experiment in cultures to which 1000 mg l(-1) bicarbonate had been added. Sodium bicarbonate addition also had a significant impact on bacterial community structure as detected by polymerase chain reaction-denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Three putative polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) dechlorinators were identified; one Dehalococcoides-like population was detected in all enrichment cultures, whereas two Dehalobacter-like populations were only detected in the enrichment cultures with the most extensive dechlorination. These results suggest that the availability of bicarbonate, and potentially sodium, may affect PCB dechlorination in Hudson River sediment and thus need to be taken into consideration when assessing the fate of PCBs or implementing bioremediation.	0
Abstract2class: Nasopharyngeal carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae among children younger than 5 years of age in Beijing, China Abstract: Background:                       Haemophilus influenzae is one of the main pathogens that cause community-acquired respiratory infections in children. Our previous study showed that H. influenzae is the second most common pathogen causing pneumonia and accounts for 30-50% of bacterial meningitis among Chinese children. H. influenzae carriage in children and its resistance to commonly used antimicrobials varies widely both geographically and over time.                  Results:                       Surveys of the nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae in children younger than 5 years of age with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) were conducted in Beijing Children's Hospital, China in 2000, 2002, 2010, and 2012. The overall annual carriage rates of H. influenzae among children younger than 5 years of age with ARI were 35.5%, 20.6%, 14.4%, and 18.7%, and the percentages of H. influenzae isolates producing β-lactamase were 4%, 13%, 27.1%, and 31%, respectively. The percentages of susceptibility to ampicillin progressively decreased from 96% (2000) to 87% (2002) to 63% (2010) to 61% (2012). All of the ampicillin-resistant isolates were found to be beta-lactamase producers. The susceptibility to tetracycline increased from 54% (2000) to 60% (2002) to 91.5% (2010) to 94.5% (2012). No statistically significant differences were observed in the susceptibility to cefaclor, cefuroxime, sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were the most effective antimicrobials for the isolates of H. influenzae across the 10-year period.                  Conclusions:                       This report on the H. influenzae carriage rates in children and the susceptibility of these bacteria to commonly used antibiotics showed that H. influenzae carriage decreased from 2000 to 2012. Additionally, the percentage of β-lactamase-producing isolates increased while their susceptibility to ampicillin progressively decreased during this time. These results indicate that the appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy should be changed for pediatric patients in China.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of the rhizopodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 by genome mining Abstract: The field of bacterial natural product research is currently undergoing a paradigm change concerning the discovery of natural products. Previously most efforts were based on isolation of the most abundant compound in an extract, or on tracking bioactivity. However, traditional activity-guided approaches are limited by the available test panels and frequently lead to the rediscovery of already known compounds. The constantly increasing availability of bacterial genome sequences provides the potential for the discovery of a huge number of new natural compounds by in silico identification of biosynthetic gene clusters. Examination of the information on the biosynthetic machinery can further prevent rediscovery of known compounds, and can help identify so far unknown biosynthetic pathways of known compounds. By in silico screening of the genome of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15, a trans-AT polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) gene cluster was identified that could not be correlated to any secondary metabolite known to be produced by this strain. Targeted gene inactivation and analysis of extracts from the resulting mutants by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS), in combination with the use of statistical tools resulted in the identification of a compound that was absent in the mutants extracts. By matching with our in-house database of myxobacterial secondary metabolites, this compound was identified as rhizopodin. A detailed analysis of the rhizopodin biosynthetic machinery is presented in this manuscript.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the polyketide synthase PKS7 responsible for the production of lecanoric acid and ethyl lecanorate in Claviceps purpurea Abstract: Claviceps purpurea is a plant pathogenic fungus which is still highly relevant in modern agriculture as it infects grasses such as rye and wheat. The disease caused by the consumption of contaminated grain or flour has been known since the Middle Ages and is termed ergotism. The main cause for the toxicity of this fungus is attributed to the ergot alkaloids. Apart from these alkaloids and the ergochromes known as ergot pigments, the secondary metabolism of C. purpurea is not well investigated. This study demonstrated the function of the polyketide synthase PKS7 in C. purpurea by determining the effect of its overexpression on metabolite profiles. For the first time, the depsides lecanoric acid, ethyl lecanorate, gerfelin, and C10-deoxy gerfelin were discovered as secondary metabolites of C. purpurea. Additionally, to estimate the contribution of isolated secondary metabolites to the toxic effects of C. purpurea, lecanoric acid, ethyl lecanorate, and orsellinic acid were tested on HepG2 and CCF-STTG1 cell lines. This study provides the first report on the function of C. purpurea PKS7 responsible for the production of depsides, among which lecanoric acid and ethyl lecanorate were identified as main secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Substrate-specific transcription of the enigmatic GH61 family of the pathogenic white-rot fungus Heterobasidion irregulare during growth on lignocellulose Abstract: The GH61 represents the most enigmatic Glycoside Hydrolase family (GH) regarding enzymatic activity and importance in cellulose degradation. Heterobasidion irregulare is a necrotizing pathogen and white-rot fungus that causes enormous damages in conifer forests. The genome of H. irregulare allowed identification of ten HiGH61 genes. qRT-PCR analysis separate the HiGH61 members into two groups; one that show up regulation on lignocellulosic substrates (HiGH61A, HiGH61B, HiGH61D, HiGH61G, HiGH61H, and HiGH61I) and a second showing either down-regulation or constitutive expression (HiGH61C, HiGH61E, HiGH61F, and HiGH61J). HiGH61H showed up to 17,000-fold increase on spruce heartwood suggesting a pivotal role in cellulose decomposition during saprotrophic growth. Sequence analysis of these genes reveals that all GH61s except HiGH61G possess the conserved metal-binding motif essential for activity. The sequences also divide into groups having either an insert near the N terminus or an insert near the second catalytic histidine, which may represent extensions of the substrate-binding surface. Three of the HiGH61s encode cellulose-binding modules (CBM1). Interestingly, HiGH61H and HiGH61I having CBM1s are up-regulated on pure cellulose. There was a common substrate-specific induction patterns of the HiGH61s with several reference cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic GHs, this taken together with their low transcript levels on media lacking lignocellulose, reflect the concerted nature of cell wall polymer degradation.	0
Abstract2class: Development of antibiotic activity profile screening for the classification and discovery of natural product antibiotics Abstract: Despite recognition of the looming antibiotic crisis by healthcare professionals, the number of new antibiotics reaching the clinic continues to decline sharply. This study aimed to establish an antibiotic profiling strategy using a panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains to create unique biological fingerprints for all major classes of antibiotics. Antibiotic mode of action profile (BioMAP) screening has been shown to effectively cluster antibiotics by structural class based on these fingerprints. Using this approach, we have accurately predicted the presence of known antibiotics in natural product extracts and have discovered a naphthoquinone-based antibiotic from our marine natural product library that possesses a unique carbon skeleton. We have demonstrated that bioactivity fingerprinting is a successful strategy for profiling antibiotic lead compounds and that BioMAP can be applied to the discovery of new natural product antibiotics leads.	0
Abstract2class: Replicon typing of plasmids carrying bla CTX-M-1 in Enterobacteriaceae of animal, environmental and human origin Abstract: Objectives:                       The aim of this work was to determine the plasmid replicon profiles of a collection of bla CTX-M-1-positive enterobacterial strains. The isolates originated from chicken in the production pyramid, healthy food-producing animals at slaughter (chicken, calves, and pigs), chicken retail meat, environmental isolates originating from water bodies, and isolates from humans. A selection of IncI and IncN plasmids were characterized by multilocus sequence typing in order to determine their epidemiological relatedness.                  Methods:                       Transconjugants of 74 bla CTX-M-1-positive isolates were analyzed by PCR-based replicon typing and by PCR-based plasmid multilocus sequence typing.                  Results:                       The incompatibility groups detected among the bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids included IncI1, IncN, IncHI1B, IncF, IncFIIS, IncFIB, and IncB/O, with plasmid lineage IncI1/ST3 predominating in isolates from chicken and from humans. Lineage IncN/ST1 was detected mainly in isolates from pigs. For the first time, bla CTX-M-1 genes encoded on IncHI1 plasmids were detected in isolates from cattle and from water bodies.                  Conclusions:                       This study identifies plasmid lineages that are contributing to the dissemination of bla CTX-M-1 genes in the food chain, the environment, and humans.	0
Abstract2class: RNAi screen identifies Brd4 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukaemia Abstract: Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.	0
Abstract2class: Glucocorticoid compounds modify smoothened localization and hedgehog pathway activity Abstract: The Hedgehog signaling pathway is linked to a variety of diseases, notably a range of cancers. The first generation of drug screens identified Smoothened (Smo), a membrane protein essential for signaling, as an attractive drug target. Smo localizes to the primary cilium upon pathway activation, and this transition is critical for the response to Hedgehog ligands. In a high content screen directly monitoring Smo distribution in Hedgehog-responsive cells, we identified different glucocorticoids as specific modulators of Smo ciliary accumulation. One class promoted Smo accumulation, conferring cellular hypersensitivity to Hedgehog stimulation. In contrast, a second class inhibited Smo ciliary localization and signaling activity by both wild-type Smo, and mutant forms of Smo, SmoM2, and SmoD473H, that are refractory to previously identified Smo antagonists. These findings point to the potential for developing glucocorticoid-based pharmacological modulation of Smo signaling to treat mutated drug-resistant forms of Smo, an emerging problem in long-term cancer therapy. They also raise a concern about potential crosstalk of glucocorticoid drugs in the Hedgehog pathway, if therapeutic administration exceeds levels associated with on-target transcriptional mechanisms of glucocorticoid action.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Aspergillus ochraceoroseus aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Production of carcinogenic aflatoxins has been reported from members of Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nidulantes and a newly proposed Aspergillus section Ochraceorosei that consists of Aspergillus ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii. Unlike members of section Flavi, A. ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii have been shown to accumulate both aflatoxin (AF) and the aflatoxin precursor sterigmatocystin (ST). Alhough morphologically distinct from A. nidulans, molecular characterization of A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST genes and physiological characteristics of AF/ST production indicated that A. ochraceoroseus is more closely related to A. nidulans than to A. flavus. Knowing that the A. nidulans ST gene cluster is organized differently from the A. flavus AF gene cluster, we determined the genetic organization of the AF/ST biosynthetic cluster in A. ochraceoroseus. Sequencing of overlapping lambda clones and genomic PCR fragments obtained by gene-walking techniques demonstrated that the A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST gene cluster is organized much like the A. nidulans ST gene cluster except that the region from aflN to aflW is located directly upstream of aflC and in reverse orientation such that aflW represents the distal end and aflY the proximal end of the cluster. The A. ochraceoroseus cluster genes demonstrated 62-76% nucleotide identity to their A. nidulans ST cluster gene homologs. Transformation of an A. nidulans aflR mutant with the A. ochraceoroseus aflR restored ST production in A. nidulans transformants. PCR amplification of A. rambellii genomic DNA demonstrated that the AF/ST gene cluster is organized in the same manner as that of A. ochraceoroseus.	1
Abstract2class: Structures and Biosynthetic Pathway of Pulvomycins B-D: 22-Membered Macrolides from an Estuarine Streptomyces sp Abstract: Pulvomycins B-D (1-3) were discovered from an estuarine Streptomyces strain along with the known pulvomycin (4). The 22-membered macrocyclic lactone structures of 1-3 were determined based on the interpretation of NMR, UV, and MS data, the modified Mosher's method, and Kishi's bidentate chiral solvent NMR spectroscopy. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain revealed the biosynthetic gene cluster of pulvomycin and enabled us to propose the trans-acyltransferase polyketide biosynthetic pathway. Pulvomycin D displayed potent cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of an Antibacterial Isoindolinone-Containing Tetracyclic Polyketide by Cryptic Gene Activation and Characterization of Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: The major setback in natural product screening is the decreasing hit rate of novel bioactive compounds containing new chemical skeletons. Here we report the identification and biosynthesis of isoindolinomycin (Idm), an unprecedented bioactive polyketide with a novel isoindolinone-containing tetracyclic skeleton. Idm was discovered through the screening of rifampicin-resistant ( rif) mutants that were generated from nine actinomycete strains used in this study. Of the 114 rif mutants isolated, the mutant S55-50-5 was found to overproduce Idm, which is almost undetectable in the wild-type Streptomyces sp. SoC090715LN-16. An in silico analysis coupled with gene deletion experiments revealed a biosynthetic idmB gene cluster that is responsible for the production of Idm. The biosynthetic studies of Idm primarily focused on the formation of the five-membered ring in the tetracyclic structure and the attachment of the methyl group to the core structure. In addition, a malachite green phosphate assay performed using a stand-alone adenylation domain ( idmB21) demonstrated the involvement of glycine in the formation of the isoindolinone-containing skeleton. This study contributes to an increase in the structural diversity of polyketides and paves the way toward an understanding of the complete biosynthetic pathway of a novel class of tetracyclic polyketides.	1
Abstract2class: Auroramycin: A Potent Antibiotic from Streptomyces roseosporus by CRISPR-Cas9 Activation Abstract: Silent biosynthetic gene clusters represent a potentially rich source of new bioactive compounds. We report the discovery, characterization, and biosynthesis of a novel doubly glycosylated 24-membered polyene macrolactam from a silent biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces roseosporus by using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene cluster activation strategy. Structural characterization of this polyketide, named auroramycin, revealed a rare isobutyrylmalonyl extender unit and a unique pair of amino sugars. Relative and absolute stereochemistry were determined by using a combination of spectroscopic analyses, chemical derivatization, and computational analysis. The activated gene cluster for auroramycin production was also verified by transcriptional analyses and gene deletions. Finally, auroramycin exhibited potent anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) activity towards clinical drug-resistant isolates.	1
Abstract2class: The proteomic profile of Fusobacterium nucleatum is regulated by growth pH Abstract: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a saccharolytic Gram-negative anaerobic organism believed to play an important role in the microbial succession associated with the development of periodontal disease. Its genome contains niche-specific genes shared with the other inhabitants of dental plaque, which may help to explain its ability to survive and grow in the changing environmental conditions experienced in the gingival sulcus during the transition from health to disease. The pH of the gingival sulcus increases during the development of periodontitis and this is thought to occur by the metabolism of nutrients supplied by gingival crevicular fluid. In comparison with other plaque inhabitants, F. nucleatum has the greatest ability to neutralize acidic environments. The differential expression of soluble cytoplasmic proteins induced by acidic (pH 6.4) or basic (pH 7.4 and 7.8) conditions, during long-term anaerobic growth in a chemostat, was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis software. Twenty-two proteins, found to have altered expression in response to external pH, were identified by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. Eight differentially expressed proteins associated with increased energy (ATP) production via the 2-oxoglutarate and Embden-Meyerhof pathways appeared to be directed towards either cellular biosynthesis or the maintenance of internal homeostasis. Overall, these results represent the first proteomic investigation of F. nucleatum and the identification of gene products which may be important in the organism's persistence during the transition from health to disease in vivo.	0
Abstract2class: Dihydroaeruginoic acid synthetase and pyochelin synthetase, products of the pchEF genes, are induced by extracellular pyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The siderophore pyochelin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is derived from one molecule of salicylate and two molecules of cysteine. Two cotranscribed genes, pchEF, encoding peptide synthetases have been identified and characterized. pchE was required for the conversion of salicylate to dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), the condensation product of salicylate and one cysteine residue and pchF was essential for the synthesis of pyochelin from Dha. The deduced PchE (156 kDa) and PchF (197 kDa) proteins had adenylation, thiolation and condensation/cyclization motifs arranged as modules which are typical of those peptide synthetases forming thiazoline rings. The pchEF genes were coregulated with the pchDCBA operon, which provides enzymes for the synthesis (PchBA) and activation (PchD) of salicylate as well as a putative thioesterase (PchC). Expression of a translational pchE'-'lacZ fusion was strictly dependent on the PchR regulator and was induced by extracellular pyochelin, the end product of the pathway. Iron replete conditions led to Fur (ferric uptake regulator)-dependent repression of the pchE'-'lacZ fusion. A translational pchD'-'lacZ fusion was also positively regulated by PchR and pyochelin and repressed by Fur and iron. Thus, autoinduction by pyochelin (or ferric pyochelin) and repression by iron ensure a sensitive control of the pyochelin pathway in P. aeruginosa.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of a cyclic peptide synthetase gene from Alternaria alternata apple pathotype whose product is involved in AM-toxin synthesis and pathogenicity Abstract: Afternaria afternata apple pathotype causes Alternaria blotch of susceptible apple cultivars through the production of a cyclic peptide host-specific toxin, AM-toxin. PCR (polymerase chain reaction), with primers designed to conserved domains of peptide synthetase genes, amplified several products from A. alternata apple pathotype that showed high similarity to other fungal peptide synthetases and were specific to the apple pathotype. Screening of a Lambda Zap genomic library with these PCR-generated probes identified overlapping clones containing a complete cyclic peptide synthetase gene of 13.1 kb in length with no introns. Disruption of this gene, designated AM-toxin synthetase (AMT), by transformation of wild-type A. afternata apple pathotype with disruption vectors resulted in toxin-minus mutants, which were also unable to cause disease symptoms on susceptible apple cultivars. AM-toxin synthetase is therefore a primary determinant of virulence and specificity in the A. alternata apple pathotype/apple interaction.	1
Abstract2class: A theoretical study on NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes and 3-aroylcoumarins: mechanism and enantioselectivity Abstract: NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes to 3-aroylcoumarins to yield dihydrocoumarin-fused dihydropyranones has been investigated using DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* and MPWB1K/6-311G** computational levels. Two plausible mechanisms have been studied: the "ketene-first" mechanism A and the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. An analysis of the activation Gibbs free energies involved in the two competitive pathways makes it possible to rule out the pathway associated with the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. The first step of the "ketene-first" mechanism A is the formation of zwitterionic intermediate IN1-Zvia a nucleophilic attack of NHC 1 on ketene 2. A [4 + 2] cycloaddition through the nucleophilic attack of enolate IN1-Z on the conjugated double bond of the benzoyl group of coumarin 3, viaTS3-SS-a2 or TS3-RR-a2, yields IN3. Finally, the extrusion of the catalyst through TS5 leads to the final products, either 4-SS or 4-RR. Enantioselectivity observed in the experimental results is determined in the transition states TS3-SS-a2/TS3-RR-a2. In this pathway, the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding between the hydroxyl group of the IN1-Z adduct and the carbonyl oxygen of the original ketene group directs the final stereochemistry throughout the entire process.	0
Abstract2class: Dependence of prePhoA-phospholipid interaction in vivo and in vitro on charge of signal peptide N-terminus and content of anionic phospholipids in membranes Abstract: Replacement of the positively charged signal peptide with neutral or negatively charged peptides due to substitution of Lys(-20) in the N-terminal region of the signal peptide leads to decreases in the rate of prePhoA membrane translocation in vivo and in the efficiency of prePhoA insertion into liposomes in vitro. The effect of anionic phospholipids on prePhoA insertion into model membranes is determined by the signal peptide N-terminus charge, while the dependence of prePhoA translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in vivo is not, under the studied variations in the content of anionic phospholipids. This is evidence of the possibility of direct electrostatic interaction between the signal peptide N-terminus and anionic phospholipids, which in vivo, however, seems to involve some proteins of the Sec machinery.	0
Abstract2class: The antibiotic CJ-15,801 is an antimetabolite that hijacks and then inhibits CoA biosynthesis Abstract: The natural product CJ-15,801 is an inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus, but not other bacteria. Its close structural resemblance to pantothenic acid, the vitamin precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), and its Michael acceptor moiety suggest that it irreversibly inhibits an enzyme involved in CoA biosynthesis or utilization. However, its mode of action and the basis for its specificity have not been elucidated to date. We demonstrate that CJ-15,801 is transformed by the uniquely selective S. aureus pantothenate kinase, the first CoA biosynthetic enzyme, into a substrate for the next enzyme, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, which is inhibited through formation of a tight-binding structural mimic of its native reaction intermediate. These findings reveal CJ-15,801 as a vitamin biosynthetic pathway antimetabolite with a mechanism similar to that of the sulfonamide antibiotics and highlight CoA biosynthesis as a viable antimicrobial drug target.	0
Abstract2class: Colorimetric Carbonyl Sulfide (COS)/Hydrogen Sulfide (H2 S) Donation from γ-Ketothiocarbamate Donor Motifs Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a biologically active molecule that exhibits protective effects in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although several H2 S-related biological effects have been discovered by using H2 S donors, knowing how much H2 S has been released from donors under different conditions remains challenging. Now, a series of γ-ketothiocarbamate (γ-KetoTCM) compounds that provide the first examples of colorimetric H2 S donors and enable direct quantification of H2 S release, were reported. These compounds are activated through a pH-dependent deprotonation/β-elimination sequence to release carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is quickly converted into H2 S by carbonic anhydrase. The p-nitroaniline released upon donor activation provides an optical readout that correlates directly to COS/H2 S release, thus enabling colorimetric measurement of H2 S donation.	0
Abstract2class: SPR741, an Antibiotic Adjuvant, Potentiates the In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of Rifampin against Clinically Relevant Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is responsible for 10% of all nosocomial infections and has >50% mortality rates when causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated SPR741, an antibiotic adjuvant that permeabilizes the Gram-negative membrane, in combination with rifampin against AB5075, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii strain. In standard in vitro assays and in a murine pulmonary model, we found that this drug combination can significantly reduce bacterial burden and promote animal survival despite an aggressive infection.	0
Abstract2class: Crystal structures of an oligopeptide-binding protein from the biosynthetic pathway of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid Abstract: Clavulanic acid (CA) is a clinically important beta-lactamase inhibitor that is produced by fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus. The CA biosynthesis pathway starts from arginine and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and proceeds via (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid, which is converted to (3R,5R)-clavaldehyde, the immediate precursor of (3R,5R)-CA. Open reading frames 7 (orf7) and 15 (orf15) of the CA biosynthesis cluster encode oligopeptide-binding proteins (OppA1 and OppA2), which are essential for CA biosynthesis. OppA1/2 are proposed to be involved in the binding and/or transport of peptides across the S. clavuligerus cell membrane. Peptide binding assays reveal that recombinant OppA1 and OppA2 bind di-/tripeptides containing arginine and certain nonapeptides including bradykinin. Crystal structures of OppA2 in its apo form and in complex with arginine or bradykinin were solved to 1.45, 1.7, and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. The overall fold of OppA2 consists of two lobes with a deep cavity in the center, as observed for other oligopeptide-binding proteins. The large cavity creates a peptide/arginine binding cleft. The crystal structures of OppA2 in complex with arginine or bradykinin reveal that the C-terminal arginine of bradykinin binds similarly to arginine. The results are discussed in terms of the possible roles of OppA1/2 in CA biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Targeted Genome Mining-From Compound Discovery to Biosynthetic Pathway Elucidation Abstract: Natural products are an important source of novel investigational compounds in drug discovery. Especially in the field of antibiotics, Actinobacteria have been proven to be a reliable source for lead structures. The discovery of these natural products with activity- and structure-guided screenings has been impeded by the constant rediscovery of previously identified compounds. Additionally, a large discrepancy between produced natural products and biosynthetic potential in Actinobacteria, including representatives of the order Pseudonocardiales, has been revealed using genome sequencing. To turn this genomic potential into novel natural products, we used an approach including the in-silico pre-selection of unique biosynthetic gene clusters followed by their systematic heterologous expression. As a proof of concept, fifteen Saccharothrixespanaensis genomic library clones covering predicted biosynthetic gene clusters were chosen for expression in two heterologous hosts, Streptomyceslividans and Streptomycesalbus. As a result, two novel natural products, an unusual angucyclinone pentangumycin and a new type II polyketide synthase shunt product SEK90, were identified. After purification and structure elucidation, the biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of pentangumycin and SEK90 were deduced using mutational analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster and feeding experiments with 13C-labelled precursors.	1
Abstract2class: 6-Thioguanine and S⁶-methylthioguanine are mutagenic in human cells Abstract: Thiopurines are effective immunosuppressants and anticancer agents. However, the long-term use of thiopurines was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of various types of cancer. To date, the specific mechanism(s) underlying the carcinogenicity associated with thiopurine treatment remain(s) unclear. Herein, we constructed duplex pTGFP-Hha10 shuttle vectors carrying a 6-thioguanine ((S)G) or S⁶-methylthioguanine (S⁶mG) at a unique site and allowed the vectors to propagate in three different human cell lines. Analysis of the replication products revealed that although neither thionucleoside blocked considerably DNA replication in any of the human cell lines, both (S)G and S⁶mG were mutagenic, resulting in G→A mutation at frequencies of ~8% and ~39%, respectively. Consistent with what was found from our previous study in E. coli cells, our data demonstrated that the mutagenic properties of (S)G and S⁶mG provided significant evidence for mutation induction as a potential carcinogenic mechanism associated with chronic thiopurine intervention.	0
Abstract2class: A melanin polyketide synthase (PKS) gene from Nodulisporium sp. that shows homology to the pks1 gene of Colletotrichum lagenarium Abstract: The melanin polyketide synthase (pks) gene of Nodulisporium sp. MF5954 (ATCC74245) was cloned by exploiting its homology to the Colletotrichum lagenarium pks1 gene. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this gene is 70% identical to the C. lagenarium pks1 gene. A gene disruption construct, designed to replace both the ketoacyl synthase and acyl transferase domains with a hygromycin resistance (Hyr) gene, was synthesized, and used to disrupt the Nodulisporium melanin pks1 gene via homologous recombination, resulting in a mel(-) phenotype. Sequence analyses of the gene and of cDNA segments generated by RT-PCR indicate that there are three introns in the 5' half of the gene. The proposed 2159-amino acid product is 72% identical and 78% similar to the 2187-amino acid sequence deduced from the C. lagenarium pks1 gene. This similarity is notable, considering that C. lagenarium is a member of the order Phyllachoales or Sordariales, whereas Nodulisporium is generally believed to be member of the order Xylariales. However, despite the strong resemblance between the amino acid sequences in the acyl transferase domains of the two proteins, only one in five codons are conserved in the DNA sequences that encode this motif. The Nodulisporium sp. pks1 gene sequence and the amino acid sequence deduced from its coding region have been deposited in Genbank under Accession No. AF151533.	1
Abstract2class: Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes Abstract: Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host-guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure-function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft-like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft-like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less-methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.	0
Abstract2class: Gibepyrone Biosynthesis in the Rice Pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi Is Facilitated by a Small Polyketide Synthase Gene Cluster Abstract: The 2H-pyran-2-one gibepyrone A and its oxidized derivatives gibepyrones B-F have been isolated from the rice pathogenic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi already more than 20 years ago. However, these products have not been linked to the respective biosynthetic genes, and therefore, their biosynthesis has not yet been analyzed on a molecular level. Feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors clearly supported a polyketide origin for the formal monoterpenoid gibepyrone A, whereas the terpenoid pathway could be excluded. Targeted gene deletion verified that the F. fujikuroi polyketide synthase PKS13, designated Gpy1, is responsible for gibepyrone A biosynthesis. Next to Gpy1, the ATP-binding cassette transporter Gpy2 is encoded by the gibepyrone gene cluster. Gpy2 was shown to have only a minor impact on the actual efflux of gibepyrone A out of the cell. Instead, we obtained evidence that Gpy2 is involved in gene regulation as it represses GPY1 gene expression. Thus, GPY1 was up-regulated and gibepyrone A production was enhanced both extra- and intracellularly in Δgpy2 mutants. Furthermore, expression of GPY genes is strictly repressed by members of the fungus-specific velvet complex, Vel1, Vel2, and Lae1, whereas Sge1, a major regulator of secondary metabolism in F. fujikuroi, affects gibepyrone biosynthesis in a positive manner. The gibepyrone A derivatives gibepyrones B and D were shown to be produced by cluster-independent P450 monooxygenases, probably to protect the fungus from the toxic product. In contrast, the formation of gibepyrones E and F from gibepyrone A is a spontaneous process and independent of enzymatic activity.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of elloramycin in Streptomyces olivaceus requires glycosylation by enzymes encoded outside the aglycon cluster Abstract: Elloramycin is an anthracycline-like antitumour drug produced by Streptomyces olivaceus Tü2353. Cosmid cos16F4 has been previously shown to direct the biosynthesis of the elloramycin aglycon 8-demethyltetracenomycin C (8-DMTC), but not elloramycin. Sequencing of the 24.2 kb insert in cos16F4 shows the presence of 17 genes involved in elloramycin biosynthesis (elm genes) together with another additional eight ORFs probably not involved in elloramycin biosynthesis. The 17 genes would code for the biosynthesis of the polyketide moiety, sugar transfer, methylation of the tetracyclic ring and the sugar moiety, and export. Four genes (rhaA, rhaB, rhaC and rhaD) encoding the enzymic activities required for the biosynthesis of the sugar l-rhamnose were also identified in the S. olivaceus chromosome. The involvement of this rhamnose gene cluster in elloramycin biosynthesis was demonstrated by insertional inactivation of the rhaB gene, generating a non-producer mutant that accumulates the 8-DMTC C aglycon. Coexpression of cos16F4 with pEM4RO (expressing the four rhamnose biosynthesis genes) in Streptomyces lividans led to the formation of elloramycin, demonstrating that both subclusters are required for elloramycin biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to most of the biosynthesis gene clusters from actinomycetes, genes involved in the biosynthesis of elloramycin are located in two chromosomal loci.	1
Abstract2class: Functional and structural impact of target uridine substitutions on the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particle pseudouridine synthase Abstract: Box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein protein particles catalyze the majority of pseudouridylation in functional RNA. Different from stand alone pseudouridine synthases, the RNP pseudouridine synthase comprises multiple protein subunits and an RNA subunit. Previous studies showed that each subunit, regardless its location, is sensitive to the step of subunit placement at the catalytic center and potentially to the reaction status of the substrate. Here we describe the impact of chemical substitutions of target uridine on enzyme activity and structure. We found that 3-methyluridine in place of uridine inhibited its isomerization while 2'-deoxyuridine or 4-thiouridine did not. Significantly, crystal structures of an archaeal box H/ACA RNP bound with the nonreactive and the two postreactive substrate analogues showed only subtle structural changes throughout the assembly except for a conserved tyrosine and a substrate anchoring loop of Cbf5. Our results suggest a potential role of these elements and the subunit that contacts them in substrate binding and product release.	0
Abstract2class: Novobiocin biosynthesis: inactivation of the putative regulatory gene novE and heterologous expression of genes involved in aminocoumarin ring formation Abstract: The left ends of the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin ( nov), clorobiocin ( clo) and coumermycin A(1) ( cou) from Streptomyces spheroides (syn. S. caeruleus) NCIMB 11891, S. roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976 and S. rishiriensis DSM 40489 were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison suggested that novE, cloE and couE, respectively, represent the borders of these three clusters. Inactivation of novE proved that novE does not have an essential catalytic role in novobiocin biosynthesis, but is likely to have a regulatory function. The gene products of novF and cloF show sequence similarity to prephenate dehydrogenase and may produce 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) as a precursor of the substituted benzoate moiety of novobiocin and clorobiocin. Coumermycin A(1) does not contain this benzoate moiety, and correspondingly the coumermycin cluster was found not to contain a functional novF homologue. The coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster apparently evolved from an ancestral cluster similar to those of novobiocin and clorobiocin, and parts of the ancestral novF homologue have been deleted in this process. No homologue to novC was identified in the gene clusters of clorobiocin and coumermycin, questioning the postulated involvement of novC in aminocoumarin biosynthesis. Heterologous expression of novDEFGHIJK in Streptomyces lividans resulted in the formation of 2,4-dihydroxy-alpha-oxy-phenylacetic acid, suggesting that at least one of the proteins encoded by these genes may participate in a hydroxylation reaction.	1
Abstract2class: Optimizing glycosyltransferase specificity via "hot spot" saturation mutagenesis presents a catalyst for novobiocin glycorandomization Abstract: A comprehensive two-phase "hot spot" saturation mutagenesis strategy for the rapid evolution of glycosyltransferase (GT) specificity for nonnatural acceptors is described. Specifically, the application of a high-throughput screen (based on the fluorescent acceptor umbelliferone) was used to identify key amino acid hot spots that contribute to GT proficiency and/or promiscuity. Saturation mutagenesis of the corresponding hot spots facilitated the utilization of a lower-throughput screen to provide OleD prodigy capable of efficiently glycosylating the nonnatural acceptor novobiocic acid with an array of unique sugars. Incredibly, even in the absence of a high-throughput screen for novobiocic acid glycosylation, this approach rapidly led to improvements in the desired catalytic activity of several hundred-fold.	0
Abstract2class: New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved processive exoribonucleolysis mechanism of the RNase J family Abstract: RNase J, a prokaryotic 5'-3' exo/endoribonuclease, contributes to mRNA decay, rRNA maturation and post-transcriptional regulation. Yet the processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism remains obscure. Here, we solved the first RNA-free and RNA-bound structures of an archaeal RNase J, and through intensive biochemical studies provided detailed mechanistic insights into the catalysis and processivity. Distinct dimerization/tetramerization patterns were observed for archaeal and bacterial RNase Js, and unique archaeal Loops I and II were found involved in RNA interaction. A hydrogen-bond-network was identified for the first time that assists catalysis by facilitating efficient proton transfer in the catalytic center. A conserved 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket that coordinates the RNA 5'-end ensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within the catalytic track; the 5'-capping residue Leu37 of the sandwich pocket coupled with the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket are dedicated to translocating and controlling the RNA orientation for each exoribonucleolytic cycle. The processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism was verified as conserved in bacterial RNase J and also exposes striking parallels with the non-homologous eukaryotic 5'-3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1. The findings in this work shed light on not only the molecular mechanism of the RNase J family, but also the evolutionary convergence of divergent exoribonucleases.	0
Abstract2class: Anatoxin-a synthetase gene cluster of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 37 and molecular methods to detect potential producers Abstract: Cyanobacterial mass occurrences are common in fresh and brackish waters. They pose a threat to water users due to toxins frequently produced by the cyanobacterial species present. Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are neurotoxins synthesized by various cyanobacteria, e.g., Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The biosynthesis of these toxins and the genes involved in anatoxin production were recently described for Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506 (A. Méjean et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131:7512-7513, 2009). In this study, we identified the anatoxin synthetase gene cluster (anaA to anaG and orf1; 29 kb) in Anabaena sp. strain 37. The gene (81.6% to 89.2%) and amino acid (78.8% to 86.9%) sequences were highly similar to those of Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, while the organization of the genes differed. Molecular detection methods for potential anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a producers of the genera Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Oscillatoria were developed by designing primers to recognize the anaC gene. Anabaena and Oscillatoria anaC genes were specifically identified in several cyanobacterial strains by PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the anaC amplicons enabled simultaneous identification of three producer genera: Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The molecular methods developed in this study revealed the presence of both Anabaena and Oscillatoria as potential anatoxin producers in Finnish fresh waters and the Baltic Sea; they could be applied for surveys of these neurotoxin producers in other aquatic environments.	1
Abstract2class: Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA from human fecal samples reveals stable and host-specific communities of active bacteria Abstract: The diversity of the predominant bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract was studied by using 16S rRNA-based approaches. PCR amplicons of the V6 to V8 regions of fecal 16S rRNA and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were analyzed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). TGGE of fecal 16S rDNA amplicons from 16 individuals showed different profiles, with some bands in common. Fecal samples from two individuals were monitored over time and showed remarkably stable profiles over a period of at least 6 months. TGGE profiles derived from 16S rRNA and rDNA amplicons showed similar banding patterns. However, the intensities of bands with similar mobilities differed in some cases, indicating a different contribution to the total active fraction of the prominent fecal bacteria. Most 16S rRNA amplicons in the TGGE pattern of one subject were identified by cloning and sequence analysis. Forty-five of the 78 clones matched 15 bands, and 33 clones did not match any visible band in the TGGE pattern. Nested PCR of amplified 16S rDNA indicated preferential amplification of a sequence corresponding to 12 of the 33 nonmatching clones with similar mobilities in TGGE. The sequences matching 15 bands in the TGGE pattern showed 91.5 to 98.7% homology to sequences derived from different Clostridium clusters. Most of these were related to strains derived from the human intestine. The results indicate that the combination of cloning and TGGE analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons is a reliable approach to monitoring different microbial communities in feces.	0
Abstract2class: Light-Dependent Cytoplasmic Recruitment Enhances the Dynamic Range of a Nuclear Import Photoswitch Abstract: Cellular signal transduction is often regulated at multiple steps to achieve more complex logic or precise control of a pathway. For instance, some signaling mechanisms couple allosteric activation with localization to achieve high signal to noise. Here, we create a system for light-activated nuclear import that incorporates two levels of control. It consists of a nuclear import photoswitch, light-activated nuclear shuttle (LANS), and a protein engineered to preferentially interact with LANS in the dark, Zdk2. First, Zdk2 is tethered to a location in the cytoplasm that sequesters LANS in the dark. Second, LANS incorporates a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is sterically blocked from binding to the nuclear import machinery in the dark. If activated with light, LANS both dissociates from its tethered location and exposes its NLS, which leads to nuclear accumulation. We demonstrate that this coupled system improves the dynamic range of LANS in mammalian cells, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans and provides tighter control of transcription factors that have been fused to LANS.	0
Abstract2class: Myxovirescin A biosynthesis is directed by hybrid polyketide synthases/nonribosomal peptide synthetase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthases, and trans-acting acyltransferases Abstract: Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 is shown to be a producer of myxovirescin (antibiotic TA) antibiotics. The myxovirescin biosynthetic gene cluster spans at least 21 open reading frames (ORFs) and covers a chromosomal region of approximately 83 kb. In silico analysis of myxovirescin ORFs in conjunction with genetic studies suggests the involvement of four type I polyketide synthases (PKSs; TaI, TaL, TaO, and TaP), one major hybrid PKS/NRPS (Ta-1), and a number of monofunctional enzymes similar to the ones involved in type II fatty-acid biosynthesis (FAB). Whereas deletion of either taI or taL causes a dramatic drop in myxovirescin production, deletion of both genes (DeltataIL) leads to the complete loss of myxovirescin production. These results suggest that both TaI and TaL PKSs might act in conjunction with a methyltransferase, reductases, and a monooxygenase to produce the 2-hydroxyvaleryl-S-ACP starter that is proposed to act as the biosynthetic primer in the initial condensation reaction with glycine. Polymerization of the remaining 11 acetates required for lactone formation is directed by 12 modules of Ta-1, TaO, and TaP megasynthetases. All modules, except for the first module of TaL, lack cognate acyltransferase (AT) domains. Furthermore, deletion of a discrete tandem AT-encoded by taV-blocks myxovirescin production; this suggests an "in trans" mode of action. To embellish the macrocycle with methyl and ethyl moieties, assembly of the myxovirescin scaffold is proposed to switch twice from PKS to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)-like biochemistry during biosynthesis. Disruption of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, TaQ, shifts production toward two novel myxovirescin analogues, designated myxovirescin Q(a) and myxovirescin Q(c). NMR analysis of purified myxovirescin Q(a) revealed the loss of the methoxy carbon atom. This novel analogue lacks bioactivity against E. coli.	1
Abstract2class: A Comprehensive Study of the Interaction between Peptidoglycan Fragments and the Extracellular Domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr Kinase PknB Abstract: The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr kinase PknB is implicated in the regulation of bacterial cell growth and cell division. The intracellular kinase function of PknB is thought to be triggered by peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments that are recognized by the extracytoplasmic domain of PknB. The PGN in the cell wall of M. tuberculosis has several unusual modifications, including the presence of N-glycolyl groups (in addition to N-acetyl groups) in the muramic acid residues and amidation of d-Glu in the peptide chains. Using synthetic PGN fragments incorporating these diverse PGN structures, we analyzed their binding characters through biolayer interferometry (BLI), NMR spectroscopy, and native mass spectrometry (nMS) techniques. The results of BLI showed that muropeptides containing 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc and longer glycan chains exhibited higher binding potency and that the fourth amino acid of the peptide stem, d-Ala, was crucial for protein recognition. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy indicated the major involvement of the stem peptide region in the PASTA-PGN fragment binding. nMS suggested that the binding stoichiometry was 1:1. The data provide the first molecular basis for the specific interaction of PGN with PknB and firmly establish PGNs as the effective ligands of PknB.	0
Abstract2class: Evaluation of rifamycin SV and rifampin kinetics in lactating ewes Abstract: Serum and milk concentrations of rifamycin SV and rifampin were determined in lactating ewes after a single intravenous injection, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated by the two-compartment open-system model. Rifampin was distributed throughout a greater volume than rifamycin SV and was eliminated more slowly from the body. The concentrations of the two drugs, both lipophilic weak acids, in milk after intravenous or intramuscular injection were lower than in serum, but rifampin was detected in milk sooner and for longer periods than rifamycin SV. Under constant serum drug concentrations, the observed milk/serum ultrafiltrate concentrations ratios (0.19 to 0.29 for rifamycin SV, and 0.90 to 1.28 for rifampin) were close to the calculated ratios derived from the pH-pK passive diffusion concept.	0
Abstract2class: A Two-Dimensional Zirconium Carbide by Selective Etching of Al3C3 from Nanolaminated Zr3Al3C5 Abstract: The room-temperature synthesis of a new two-dimensional (2D) zirconium-containing carbide, Zr3C2T(z) MXene is presented. In contrast to traditional preparation of MXene, the layered ternary Zr3Al3C5 material instead of MAX phases is used as source under hydrofluoric acid treatment. The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of the synthesized 2D carbide are investigated, combined with first-principles density functional calculations. A comparative study on the structrual stability of our obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) and Ti3C2T(z) MXenes at elevated temperatures is performed. The obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) exhibits relatively better ability to maintain 2D nature and strucural integrity compared to Ti-based Mxene. The difference in structural stability under high temperature condition is explained by a theoretical investigation on binding energy.	0
Abstract2class: Cyclic-di-AMP synthesis by the diadenylate cyclase CdaA is modulated by the peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzyme GlmM in Lactococcus lactis Abstract: The second messenger cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) plays important roles in growth, virulence, cell wall homeostasis, potassium transport and affects resistance to antibiotics, heat and osmotic stress. Most Firmicutes contain only one c-di-AMP synthesizing diadenylate cyclase (CdaA); however, little is known about signals and effectors controlling CdaA activity and c-di-AMP levels. In this study, a genetic screen was employed to identify components which affect the c-di-AMP level in Lactococcus. We characterized suppressor mutations that restored osmoresistance to spontaneous c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase gdpP mutants, which contain high c-di-AMP levels. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations were identified in the cdaA and gdpP genes, respectively, which led to lower c-di-AMP levels. A mutation was also identified in the phosphoglucosamine mutase gene glmM, which is commonly located within the cdaA operon in bacteria. The glmM I154F mutation resulted in a lowering of the c-di-AMP level and a reduction in the key peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in L. lactis. C-di-AMP synthesis by CdaA was shown to be inhibited by GlmM(I154F) more than GlmM and GlmM(I154F) was found to bind more strongly to CdaA than GlmM. These findings identify GlmM as a c-di-AMP level modulating protein and provide a direct connection between c-di-AMP synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.	0
Abstract2class: Syntheses and biological activities of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates Abstract: Twenty-two kinds of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates were synthesized by the reaction of 4-hydroxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one or 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (HMP) with a variety of substituted cinnamic acids, and their antifungal and plant growth inhibitory activities were investigated. Among the compounds prepared, 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)propenoate (H5) showed the strongest antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium dellfinii, and 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(2-methylphenyl)propenoate (H2) had the highest plant growth inhibitory activity toward Brassica rapa.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Novel Macrolide Antibiotic Anthracimycin Abstract: We report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the unusual antibiotic anthracimycin (atc) from the marine derived producer strain Streptomyces sp. T676 isolated off St. John's Island, Singapore. The 53 253 bps atc locus includes a trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) polyketide synthase (PKS), and heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor resulted in anthracimycin production. Analysis of the atc cluster revealed that anthracimycin is likely generated by four PKS gene products AtcC-AtcF without involvement of post-PKS tailoring enzymes, and a biosynthetic pathway is proposed. The availability of the atc cluster provides a basis for investigating the biosynthesis of anthracimycin and its subsequent bioengineering to provide novel analogues with improved pharmacological properties.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans biotin biosynthetic gene cluster and use of the bioDA gene as a new transformation marker Abstract: The genes involved in the biosynthesis of biotin were identified in the hyphal fungus Aspergillus nidulans through homology searches and complementation of Escherichia coli biotin-auxotrophic mutants. Whereas the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase and dethiobiotin synthetase are encoded by distinct genes in bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both activities are performed in A. nidulans by a single enzyme, encoded by the bifunctional gene bioDA. Such a bifunctional bioDA gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the ascomycete filamentous fungi and basidiomycetes, as well as in plants and oömycota. However, unlike in other eukaryota, the three bio genes contributing to the four enzymatic steps from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin are organized in a gene cluster in pezizomycotina. The A. nidulans auxotrophic mutants biA1, biA2 and biA3 were all found to have mutations in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase domain of the bioDA gene. Although biotin auxotrophy is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic manipulations due to cross-feeding of biotin, transformation of the biA1 mutant with the bioDA gene from either A. nidulans or Aspergillus fumigatus led to the recovery of well-defined biotin-prototrophic colonies. The usefulness of bioDA gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in co-transformation experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the laccase (yA) gene via homologous recombination in a mutant lacking non-homologous end-joining activity.	1
Abstract2class: Translational control of transcription termination at the attenuator of the Escherichia coli tryptophan operon Abstract: We have isolated two regulatory mutants altered in the leader region of the Escherichia coli tryptophan (trp) operon. In one mutant, trpL29, the AUG translation start codon for the trip leader peptide is replaced by AUA. The other mutant, trpL75, has a G leads to A change at residue 75, immediately after the UGA translation stop codon for the trp leader peptide. In vivo, trpL29 and trpL75 increase the efficiency of transcription termination at the trp attenuator 3- to 5-fold. trpL29 and trpL75 also fail to respond fully to tryptophan starvation and other conditions that normally relieve transcription termination at the trp attenuator. The trpL29 mutation, which presumably reduces synthesis of the trp leader peptide, is cis dominant. The effect of starvation for a number of the amino acids in the trp leader peptide was determined. Only starvation for tryptophan and arginine, amino acids that occur at residues 10, 11, and 12 of the 14-residue trp leader peptide, elicits relief of transcription termination. Our findings suggest that translation of trp leader RNA is involved in regulation of transcription termination at the attenuator. A model is discussed in which the location of the ribosome synthesizing the leader peptide is communicated to the RNA polymerase transcribing the leader region.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of the lomaiviticin biosynthetic gene cluster in Salinispora pacifica Abstract: The lomaiviticins are a family of cytotoxic marine natural products that have captured the attention of both synthetic and biological chemists due to their intricate molecular scaffolds and potent biological activities. Here we describe the identification of the gene cluster responsible for lomaiviticin biosynthesis in Salinispora pacifica strains DPJ-0016 and DPJ-0019 using a combination of molecular approaches and genome sequencing. The link between the lom gene cluster and lomaiviticin production was confirmed using bacterial genetics, and subsequent analysis and annotation of this cluster revealed the biosynthetic basis for the core polyketide scaffold. Additionally, we have used comparative genomics to identify candidate enzymes for several unusual tailoring events, including diazo formation and oxidative dimerization. These findings will allow further elucidation of the biosynthetic logic of lomaiviticin assembly and provide useful molecular tools for application in biocatalysis and synthetic biology.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of hepatitis B virus capsids by resistive-pulse sensing Abstract: We report characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids by resistive-pulse sensing through single track-etched conical nanopores formed in poly(ethylene terephthalate) membranes. The pores were ∼40 nm in diameter at the tip, and the pore surface was covalently modified with triethylene glycol to reduce surface charge density, minimize adsorption of the virus capsids, and suppress electroosmotic flow in the pore. The HBV capsids were assembled in vitro from Cp149, the assembly domain of HBV capsid protein. Assembled T = 3 (90 Cp149 dimer) and T = 4 (120 dimer) capsids are 31 and 36 nm in diameter, respectively, and were easily discriminated by monitoring the change in current as capsids passed through an electrically biased pore. The ratio of the number of T = 3 to T = 4 capsids transiting a pore did not reflect actual concentrations, but favored transport of smaller T = 3 capsids. These results combined with longer transit times for the T = 4 capsids indicated that the capsids must overcome an entropic barrier to enter a pore.	0
Abstract2class: A Phototheranostic Strategy to Continuously Deliver Singlet Oxygen in the Dark and Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment Abstract: Continuous irradiation during photodynamic therapy (PDT) inevitably induces tumor hypoxia, thereby weakening the PDT effect. In PDT-induced hypoxia, providing singlet oxygen from stored chemical energy may enhance the cell-killing effect and boost the therapeutic effect. Herein, we present a phototheranostic (DPPTPE@PEG-Py NPs) prepared by using a 2-pyridone-based diblock polymer (PEG-Py) to encapsulate a semiconducting, heavy-atom-free pyrrolopyrrolidone-tetraphenylethylene (DPPTPE) with high singlet-oxygen-generation ability both in dichloromethane and water. The PEG-Py can trap the 1 O2 generated from DPPTPE under laser irradiation and form a stable intermediate of endoperoxide, which can then release 1 O2 in the dark, hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, fluorescence-imaging-guided phototherapy demonstrates that this phototheranostic could completely inhibit tumor growth with the help of laser irradiation.	0
Abstract2class: The relationship between visible intracellular aggregates that appear after overexpression of Sup35 and the yeast prion-like elements [PSI(+)] and [PIN(+)] Abstract: Overproduced fusions of Sup35 or its prion domain with green fluorescent protein (GFP) have previously been shown to form frequent dots in [PSI(+)] cells. Rare foci seen in [psi(-)] cells were hypothesized to indicate the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] caused by the overproduced prion domain. Here, we describe novel ring-type aggregates that also appear in [psi(-)] cultures upon Sup35 overproduction and show directly that dot and ring aggregates only appear in cells that have become [PSI(+)]. The formation of either type of aggregate requires [PIN(+)], an element needed for the induction of [PSI(+)]. Although aggregates are visible predominantly in stationary-phase cultures, [PSI(+)] induction starts in exponential phase, suggesting that much smaller aggregates can also propagate [PSI(+)]. Such small aggregates are probably present in [PSI(+)] cells and, upon Sup35-GFP overproduction, facilitate the frequent formation of dot aggregates, but only the occasional appearance of ring aggregates. In contrast, rings are very frequent when [PSI(+)] cultures, including those lacking [PIN(+)], are grown in the presence of GuHCl or excess Hsp104 while overexpressing Sup35-GFP. Thus, intermediates formed during [PSI(+)] curing seem to facilitate ring formation. Surprisingly, GuHCl and excess Hsp104, which are known to promote loss of [PSI(+)], did not prevent the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] by excess Sup35 in [psi(-)][PIN(+)] strains.	0
Abstract2class: Correspondence regarding "Effect of active smoking on the human bronchial epithelium transcriptome" Abstract: Background:                       In the work of Chari et al. entitled "Effect of active smoking on the human bronchial epithelium transcriptome" the authors use SAGE to identify candidate gene expression changes in bronchial brushings from never, former, and current smokers. These gene expression changes are categorized into those that are reversible or irreversible upon smoking cessation. A subset of these identified genes is validated on an independent cohort using RT-PCR. The authors conclude that their results support the notion of gene expression changes in the lungs of smokers which persist even after an individual has quit.                  Results:                       This correspondence raises questions about the validity of the approach used by the authors to analyze their data. The majority of the reported results suffer deficiencies due to the methods used. The most fundamental of these are explained in detail: biases introduced during data processing, lack of correction for multiple testing, and an incorrect use of clustering for gene discovery. A randomly generated "null" dataset is used to show the consequences of these shortcomings.                  Conclusion:                       Most of Chari et al.'s findings are consistent with what would be expected by chance alone. Although there is clear evidence of reversible changes in gene expression, the majority of those identified appear to be false positives. However, contrary to the authors' claims, no irreversible changes were identified. There is a broad consensus that genetic change due to smoking persists once an individual has quit smoking; unfortunately, this study lacks sufficient scientific rigour to support or refute this hypothesis or identify any specific candidate genes. The pitfalls of large-scale analysis, as exemplified here, may not be unique to Chari et al.	0
Abstract2class: Nucleotide sequence analysis of a gene cloned from Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc which complements an argE defect in Escherichia coli Abstract: The genus Leptospira, as a member of the order Spirochaetales, forms one of the most ancient evolutionary branches of the eubacteria. These spirochetes are morphologically and physiologically different from most eubacteria, and little is known about Leptospira genetics. In this communication, we report the first nucleotide sequence of a Leptospira gene. A gene which complements an argE mutation in Escherichia coli was isolated from a plasmid-based genomic library composed of Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc DNA. The functional region for the complementing activity was localized by transposon mutagenesis and restriction enzyme mapping and by subcloning. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a single open reading frame within the region containing argE complementing activity. The size of the predicted protein, 31,071 daltons, was in excellent agreement with data obtained from coupled transcription-translation reactions primed with cloned L. biflexa DNA. One surprising result was that the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein closely resembles portions of the beta' subunits of RNA polymerases from bacteria and chloroplasts.	0
Abstract2class: Cytosolic ADP enhances the sensitivity to tolbutamide of ATP-dependent K+ channels from pancreatic B-cells Abstract: The effects of intracellular purine nucleotides on tolbutamide-induced block of ATP-dependent K+ channels from mouse pancreatic B-cells were studied using the patch-clamp technique. When applied to the inside of excised patches, tolbutamide alone blocked channel activity half-maximally at 55 microM and the concentration-response curve for the inhibition of K+ channels by tolbutamide was flat. ADP (1 mM), but not other nucleotides (AMP, GTP or GDP) increased the steepness of the concentration-response curve and decreased the half-maximally effective tolbutamide concentration to 4.2 microM. It is suggested that the ATP-dependent K+ channel or a closely related structure contains a receptor which is accessible for cytosolic ADP and controls the sensitivity to tolbutamide.	0
Abstract2class: A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription Abstract: Most mammalian cells in nature are quiescent but actively transcribing mRNA for normal physiological processes; thus, it is important to investigate how endogenous and exogenous DNA damage compromises transcription in cells. Here we describe a new competitive transcription and adduct bypass (CTAB) assay to determine the effects of DNA lesions on the fidelity and efficiency of transcription. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that the oxidatively induced lesions 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA) and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine (cdG) and the methylglyoxal-induced lesion N(2)-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CEdG) strongly inhibited transcription in vitro and in mammalian cells. In addition, cdA and cdG, but not N(2)-CEdG, induced transcriptional mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when located on the template DNA strand, all examined lesions were primarily repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells. This newly developed CTAB assay should be generally applicable for quantitatively assessing how other DNA lesions affect DNA transcription in vitro and in cells.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and Functional Analysis of the Mycophenolic Acid Gene Cluster of Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: The filamentous fungus Penicillium roqueforti is widely known as the ripening agent of blue-veined cheeses. Additionally, this fungus is able to produce several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound mycophenolic acid (MPA). Cheeses ripened with P. roqueforti are usually contaminated with MPA. On the other hand, MPA is a commercially valuable immunosuppressant. However, to date the molecular basis of the production of MPA by P. roqueforti is still unknown. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a genomic region of approximately 24.4 kbp containing a seven-gene cluster that may be involved in the MPA biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of these seven genes (named mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaDE, mpaF, mpaG and mpaH) resulted in dramatic reductions in MPA production, confirming that all of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the compound. Interestingly, the mpaF gene, originally described in P. brevicompactum as a MPA self-resistance gene, also exerts the same function in P. roqueforti, suggesting that this gene has a dual function in MPA metabolism. The knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of MPA in P. roqueforti will be important for the future control of MPA contamination in cheeses and the improvement of MPA production for commercial purposes.	1
Abstract2class: Construction of a protein-detection system using a loop peptide library with a fluorescence label Abstract: Construction of a novel protein-detection system was carried out using a designed peptide library with fluorescent labels based on loop structures. As a basic model study, detection of alpha-amylase using fluorescent-labeled peptides derived from an active loop of tendamistat was examined. The detection methods for proteins with immobilized peptides as well as peptides in solution have been successfully established. Based on these results, a loop peptide library that has various turn sequences grafted on a stable loop structure has been constructed. Various proteins with recognition patterns corresponding, for instance, to "protein fingerprints" could be detected using an immobilized peptide library. The present results suggest that the system can be applied to the development of a peptide microarray that behaves as a protein chip.	0
Abstract2class: ngl9: a third MADS box gene expressed in alfalfa root nodules Abstract: Expression of MADS box genes has previously been localized to the infected cells of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) root nodules. These genes represent the first putative transcription factors to be identified in nodules and are hypothesized to be involved in a signal transduction pathway initiated by the intracellular bacterium. The eventual activation of specific target genes defines pertinent characteristics of this nitrogen-fixing differentiated cell. In this study, we identify a third nodule MADS box gene, ngl9, and demonstrate that the DNA-binding activity of its protein product is dependent on the presence of a second MADS box protein, NMH7. Despite previous results to the contrary, both genes are expressed in the early stages of flower development, further strengthening the premise that nodule developmental programming may capitalize upon existing developmental cascades.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of homophenylalanine biosynthetic genes from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 and application to its microbial production by Escherichia coli Abstract: L-Homophenylalanine (L-Hph) is a useful chiral building block for synthesis of several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the novel proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. While the chemoenzymatic route of synthesis is fully developed, we investigated microbial production of L-Hph to explore the possibility of a more efficient and sustainable approach to L-Hph production. We hypothesized that L-Hph is synthesized from L-Phe via a mechanism homologous to 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid conversion to 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid during leucine biosynthesis. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we found three putative homophenylalanine biosynthesis genes, hphA (Npun_F2464), hphB (Npun_F2457), and hphCD (Npun_F2458), in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102, located around the gene cluster responsible for anabaenopeptin biosynthesis. We constructed Escherichia coli strains harboring hphABCD-expressing plasmids and achieved the fermentative production of L-Hph from L-Phe. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of the genes responsible for homophenylalanine synthesis in any organism. Furthermore, to improve the low conversion efficiency of the initial strain, we optimized the expression of hphA, hphB, and hphCD, which increased the yield to ∼630 mg/liter. The L-Hph biosynthesis and L-Leu biosynthesis genes from E. coli were also compared. This analysis revealed that HphB has comparatively relaxed substrate specificity and can perform the function of LeuB, but HphA and HphCD show tight substrate specificity and cannot complement the LeuA and LeuC/LeuD functions, and vice versa. Finally, the range of substrate tolerance of the L-Hph-producing strain was examined, which showed that m-fluorophenylalanine, o-fluorophenylalanine, and L-tyrosine were accepted as substrates and that the corresponding homoamino acids were generated.	1
Abstract2class: Enzymology of aminoglycoside biosynthesis-deduction from gene clusters Abstract: The classical aminoglycosides are, with very few exceptions, typically actinobacterial secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities all mediated by inhibiting translation on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Some chemically related natural products inhibit glucosidases by mimicking oligo-alpha-1,4-glucosides. The biochemistry of the aminoglycoside biosynthetic pathways is still a developing field since none of the pathways has been analyzed to completeness as yet. In this chapter we treat the enzymology of aminoglycoside biosyntheses as far as it becomes apparent from recent investigations based on the availability of DNA sequence data of biosynthetic gene clusters for all major structural classes of these bacterial metabolites. We give a more general overview of the field, including descriptions of some key enzymes in various aminoglycoside pathways, whereas in Chapter 20 provides a detailed account of the better-studied enzymology thus far known for the neomycin and butirosin pathways.	1
Abstract2class: P450-Mediated Coupling of Indole Fragments To Forge Communesin and Unnatural Isomers Abstract: Dimeric indole alkaloids are structurally diverse natural products that have attracted significant attention from the synthetic and biosynthetic communities. Here, we describe the characterization of a P450 monooxygenase CnsC from Penicillium that catalyzes the heterodimeric coupling between two different indole moieties, tryptamine and aurantioclavine, to construct vicinal quaternary stereocenters and yield the heptacyclic communesin scaffold. We show, via biochemical characterization, substrate analogues, and computational methods that CnsC catalyzes the C3-C3' carbon-carbon bond formation and controls the regioselectivities of the pair of subsequent aminal bond formations to yield the communesin core. Use of ω-N-methyltryptamine and tryptophol in place of tryptamine led to the enzymatic synthesis of isocommunesin compounds, which have not been isolated to date.	1
Abstract2class: LytM factors affect the recruitment of autolysins to the cell division site in Caulobacter crescentus Abstract: Most bacteria possess a peptidoglycan cell wall that determines their morphology and provides mechanical robustness during osmotic challenges. The biosynthesis of this structure is achieved by a large set of synthetic and lytic enzymes with varying substrate specificities. Although the biochemical functions of these proteins are conserved and well-investigated, the precise roles of individual factors and the regulatory mechanisms coordinating their activities in time and space remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively analyze the autolytic machinery of the alphaproteobacterial model organism Caulobacter crescentus, with a specific focus on LytM-like endopeptidases, soluble lytic transglycosylases and amidases. Our data reveal a high degree of redundancy within each protein family but also specialized functions for individual family members under stress conditions. In addition, we identify two lytic transglycosylases and an amidase as new divisome components that are recruited to midcell at distinct stages of the cell cycle. The midcell localization of these proteins is affected by two LytM factors with degenerate catalytic domains, DipM and LdpF, which may serve as regulatory hubs coordinating the activities of multiple autolytic enzymes during cell constriction and fission respectively. These findings set the stage for in-depth studies of the molecular mechanisms that control peptidoglycan remodeling in C. crescentus.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and an additional gene for resistance to the antituberculosis drug capreomycin Abstract: Capreomycin (CMN) belongs to the tuberactinomycin family of nonribosomal peptide antibiotics that are essential components of the drug arsenal for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Members of this antibiotic family target the ribosomes of sensitive bacteria and disrupt the function of both subunits of the ribosome. Resistance to these antibiotics in Mycobacterium species arises due to mutations in the genes coding for the 16S or 23S rRNA but can also arise due to mutations in a gene coding for an rRNA-modifying enzyme, TlyA. While Mycobacterium species develop resistance due to alterations in the drug target, it has been proposed that the CMN-producing bacterium, Saccharothrix mutabilis subsp. capreolus, uses CMN modification as a mechanism for resistance rather than ribosome modification. To better understand CMN biosynthesis and resistance in S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus, we focused on the identification of the CMN biosynthetic gene cluster in this bacterium. Here, we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of the CMN biosynthetic gene cluster from S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus ATCC 23892. We provide evidence for the heterologous production of CMN in the genetically tractable bacterium Streptomyces lividans 1326. Finally, we present data supporting the existence of an additional CMN resistance gene. Initial work suggests that this resistance gene codes for an rRNA-modifying enzyme that results in the formation of CMN-resistant ribosomes that are also resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin. Thus, S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus may also use ribosome modification as a mechanism for CMN resistance.	1
Abstract2class: Subtilomycin: a new lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans Abstract: Bacteriocins are attracting increased attention as an alternative to classic antibiotics in the fight against infectious disease and multidrug resistant pathogens. Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans displays a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, as well as several pathogenic Candida species. This activity is in part associated with a newly identified lantibiotic, herein named as subtilomycin. The proposed biosynthetic cluster is composed of six genes, including protein-coding genes for LanB-like dehydratase and LanC-like cyclase modification enzymes, characteristic of the class I lantibiotics. The subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster in B. subtilis strain MMA7 is found in place of the sporulation killing factor (skf) operon, reported in many B. subtilis isolates and involved in a bacterial cannibalistic behaviour intended to delay sporulation. The presence of the subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster appears to be widespread amongst B. subtilis strains isolated from different shallow and deep water marine sponges. Subtilomycin possesses several desirable industrial and pharmaceutical physicochemical properties, including activity over a wide pH range, thermal resistance and water solubility. Additionally, the production of the lantibiotic subtilomycin could be a desirable property should B. subtilis strain MMA7 be employed as a probiotic in aquaculture applications.	1
Abstract2class: Topology-directed design of porous organic frameworks and their advanced applications Abstract: Porous organic frameworks (POFs) as an important subclass of nanoporous materials are of great interest in materials science. In recent years, the discovery and creation of POFs with excellent properties for advanced applications have attracted much attention and intensive efforts have been contributed to this field. As a result, the design of materials with multi-functionalities is an ever-pursued dream of materials scientists and engineers. In this respect, a new concept based on topology chemistry is introduced for the rational and targeted synthesis of POF materials. The present feature article provides an overview of the relationship between building blocks or starting monomers, underlying topological nets, and pre-determined structures. Several important nets are included successively from one to three dimensions. In addition, special emphasis is given to the advanced applications of designed POF materials in the current paper.	0
Abstract2class: You get what you screen for: on the value of fermentation characterization in high-throughput strain improvements in industrial settings Abstract: While design and high-throughput build approaches in biotechnology have increasingly gained attention over the past decade, approaches to test strain performance in high-throughput have received less discussion in the literature. Here, we describe how fermentation characterization can be used to improve the overall efficiency of high-throughput DBTAL (design-build-test-analyze-learn) cycles in an industrial context. Fermentation characterization comprises an in-depth study of strain performance in a bioreactor setting and involves semi-frequent sampling and analytical measurement of substrates, cell densities and viabilities, and (by)products. We describe how fermentation characterization can be used to (1) improve (high-throughput) strain design approaches; (2) enable the development of bench-scale fermentation processes compatible with a wide diversity of strains; and (3) inform the development of high-throughput plate-based strain testing procedures for improved performance at larger scales.	0
Abstract2class: Nonregular structure-property relationships for inclusion parameters of tert-butylcalix[5]arene Abstract: The effect of macrocycle size on the structure-property relationships was studied for inclusion compounds of tert-butylcalix[n]arenes (n=4,5) with volatile organic guests having various molecular size and group composition. Vapor-sorption isotherms, guest-inclusion stoichiometry and Gibbs energy, thermostability parameters and decomposition enthalpies were determined for host-guest compounds (clathrates) obtained using saturation of solid calixarene powder with guest vapor. The increase of the host macrocycle in the studied calixarene pair changes the observed structure-property relationship from the guest-binding selectivity mostly seen in inclusion Gibbs energy to the high sensitivity for guest structure in inclusion stoichiometry. The host with the larger macrocycle has more clathrates with stepwise formation and decomposition. Specific types of guest binding with solid hosts are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Visible and infrared three-wavelength modulated multi-directional actuators Abstract: In recent years, light-guided robotic soft actuators have attracted intense scientific attention and rapidly developed, although it still remains challenging to precisely and reversibly modulate the moving directions and shape morphing modes of soft actuators with ease of stimulating operation. Here we report a strategy of building a multi-stimuli-responsive liquid crystal elastomer soft actuator system capable of performing not only multi-directional movement, but also different shape morphing modes. This strategy is based on the selective stimulation of specific domains of the hierarchical structured actuator through the modulation of three wavelength bands (520, 808, 980 nm) of light stimulus, which release the actuation system from light scanning position/direction restriction. Three near-infrared dual-wavelength modulated actuators and one visible/infrared tri-wavelength modulated multi-directional walker robot are demonstrated in this work. These devices have broad application prospects in robotic and biomimetic technology.	0
Abstract2class: In vivo effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on lymphocyte activation in response to alloantigens Abstract: We studied the effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on the events of lymphocyte activation in vivo by inoculating mice in the footpad with allogeneic spleen cells, and compared the effects with those of cyclosporin A (CyA). The administration of NKT-01 increased the numbers of cells recovered from the popliteal lymph node (PLN) 7 days after inoculation, but inhibited the proliferation of these cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). NKT-01 enhanced IL-2 production, but suppressed the production of macrophage activating factor (MAF) in the mixed lymphocyte reaction between the PLN cells and allogeneic spleen cells treated with mitomycin C. CyA decreased the numbers of PLN cells little, and suppressed the response to exogenous IL-2 and the production of both IL-2 and MAF. Results with tumor cells used as allogeneic cells suggested that there was a close relationship between the suppression of MAF production by NKT-01 and its inhibition of allograft rejection. The findings showed that NKT-01 inhibited both the MAF production by and the response to IL-2 of PLN cells, and that these effects were involved in the suppression of allograft rejection by NKT-01.	0
Abstract2class: Stable tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions Abstract: Three-component coupling reactions between trialkylphosphines, methyl propiolates, and aldehydes produced 1:1:1 dipolar adducts in moderate-to-excellent yields. The product phosphonium enolate zwitterions were isolated as crystalline solids. X-ray crystallographic analyses of these single crystals established unequivocally the dipolar structures of these tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions. Because phosphonium enolates are the first key intermediates in the nucleophilic phosphine-mediated catalysis of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, this study provides crucial insight into the mechanisms of Morita–Baylis–Hillman-type reactions.	0
Abstract2class: Lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis: sequence of biosynthetic gene cluster and identification of a novel aromatic prenyltransferase Abstract: The lyngbyatoxins are potent skin irritants produced by Lyngbya majuscula and cause a condition known as "Swimmer's Itch" off Honolulu, HI. Reported is the molecular cloning of the lyngbyatoxin (ltx) biosynthetic gene cluster from L. majuscula using a strategy based on its predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly. The biosynthetic gene cluster spans 11.3 kilobase pairs and encodes for a two-module NRPS (LtxA), a P450 monooxygenase (LtxB), an aromatic prenyltransferase (LtxC), and an oxidase/reductase protein (LtxD). LtxC was heterologously produced and purified from E. coli and shown to catalyze the transfer of a geranyl group to (-)-indolactam V as the final step in the biosynthesis of lyngbyatoxin A.	1
Abstract2class: An Aspergillus flavus secondary metabolic gene cluster containing a hybrid PKS-NRPS is necessary for synthesis of the 2-pyridones, leporins Abstract: The genome of the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus flavus, has been shown to harbor as many as 56 putative secondary metabolic gene clusters including the one responsible for production of the toxic and carcinogenic, polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived aflatoxins. Except for the production of aflatoxins, cyclopiazonic acid and several other metabolites the capability for metabolite production of most of these putative clusters is unknown. We investigated the regulation of expression of the PKS-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) containing cluster 23 and determined that it produces homologs of the known 2-pyridone leporin A. Inactivation and overexpression of a cluster 23 gene encoding a putative Zn(2)-Cys(6) transcription factor (AFLA_066900, lepE) resulted in downregulation of nine and up-regulation of 8, respectively, of the fifteen SMURF-predicted cluster 23 genes thus allowing delineation of the cluster. Overexpression of lepE (OE::lepE) resulted in transformants displaying orange-red pigmented hyphae. Mass spectral analysis of A. flavus OE::lepE extracts identified the known 2-pyridone metabolite, leporin B, as well as the previously unreported dehydroxy-precursor, leporin C. We provide strong evidence that leporin B forms a unique trimeric complex with iron, not found previously for other 2-pyridones. This iron complex demonstrated antiinsectan and antifeedant properties similar to those previously found for leporin A. The OE::lepE strain showed reduced levels of conidia and sclerotia suggesting that unscheduled leporin production affects fungal developmental programs.	1
Abstract2class: Production of optically pure D-lactic acid in mineral salts medium by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli W3110 Abstract: The resistance of polylactide to biodegradation and the physical properties of this polymer can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of L-lactic acid to D-lactic acid. Although the largest demand is for the L enantiomer, substantial amounts of both enantiomers are required for bioplastics. We constructed derivatives of Escherichia coli W3110 (prototrophic) as new biocatalysts for the production of D-lactic acid. These strains (SZ40, SZ58, and SZ63) require only mineral salts as nutrients and lack all plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes used during construction. D-Lactic acid production by these new strains approached the theoretical maximum yield of two molecules per glucose molecule. The chemical purity of this D-lactic acid was approximately 98% with respect to soluble organic compounds. The optical purity exceeded 99%. Competing pathways were eliminated by chromosomal inactivation of genes encoding fumarate reductase (frdABCD), alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE), and pyruvate formate lyase (pflB). The cell yield and lactate productivity were increased by a further mutation in the acetate kinase gene (ackA). Similar improvements could be achieved by addition of 10 mM acetate or by an initial period of aeration. All three approaches reduced the time required to complete the fermentation of 5% glucose. The use of mineral salts medium, the lack of antibiotic resistance genes or plasmids, the high yield of D-lactate, and the high product purity should reduce costs associated with nutrients, purification, containment, biological oxygen demand, and waste treatment.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization and analysis of the regulatory network involved in control of lipomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 Abstract: Analysis of the alpha-lipomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 led to the identification of five putative regulatory genes, which are congregated into a subcluster. Analysis of the lipReg1-4 and lipX1 showed that they encode components of two-component signal transduction systems (LipReg1 and LipReg2), multiple antibiotics resistance-type regulator (LipReg3), large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family-type regulator (LipReg4), and small ribonuclease (LipRegX1), respectively. A combination of targeted gene disruptions, complementation experiments, lipomycin production studies, and gene expression analysis via RT-PCR suggests that all regulatory lip genes are involved in alpha-lipomycin production. On the basis of the obtained data, we propose that LipReg2 controls the activity of LipReg1, which in its turn govern the expression of the alpha-lipomycin pathway-specific regulatory gene lipReg4. The ribonuclease gene lipX1 and the transporter regulator lipReg3 appear to work independently of genes lipReg1, lipReg2, and lipReg4.	1
Abstract2class: Tet-on, or Tet-off, that is the question: Advanced conditional gene expression in Aspergillus Abstract: In Aspergillus, controlled gene expression is often achieved using the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) dependent Tet-on system, whereby transcription is activated in a titratable manner by addition of the tetracycline derivative doxycycline. The complementary Tet-off system utilises the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) component to quantitatively reduce gene expression. In this study, we utilised a synthetic biological approach to engineer highly optimised Tet-off conditional expression systems in Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. Steps for delivery of these tools include utilising codon optimised cassette components, testing several promoters for improved genetic stability and validating two modified luciferase reporters for highly accurate measurements of gene expression. The Tet-off cassettes developed in this study enable facile and quantitative functional analysis, as validated by Tet-off analysis of genes involved in chitin synthesis and cell wall polarity in A. niger, and para-aminobenzoic acid synthesis in A. fumigatus. We also used a racA(G18V) dominant allele to demonstrate that Tet-off in A. niger enables gene over-expression and downregulation in a single isolate. Additionally, we used the improved luciferase reporters to show that the Tet-off cassette in A. niger enables quantification of gene oscillations. In order to demonstrate that synthetic biological approaches developed here are broadly applicable to engineering transcriptional circuits in filamentous fungi, we used our strategy for improving cassette stability by promoter replacement in the A. niger Tet-on system, which resulted in a modified Tet-on cassette with higher stability in recipient genomes.	0
Abstract2class: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei: characterization of the enzyme, cloning and sequencing of the gene, and expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei (optimal growth temperature, 100 to 103 degrees C) was purified to homogeneity. This enzyme was strictly phosphate dependent, utilized either NAD+ or NADP+, and was insensitive to pentalenolactone like the enzyme from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanothermus fervidus. The enzyme exhibited a considerable thermostability, with a 44-min half-life at 100 degrees C. The amino acid sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from P. woesei was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the coding gene. Compared with the enzyme homologs from mesophilic archaebacteria (Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanobacterium formicicum) and an extremely thermophilic archaebacterium (Methanothermus fervidus), the primary structure of the P. woesei enzyme exhibited a strikingly high proportion of aromatic amino acid residues and a low proportion of sulfur-containing residues. The coding gene of P. woesei was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, thus providing an ideal basis for detailed structural and functional studies of that enzyme.	0
Abstract2class: Biophysical Mechanistic Modelling Quantifies the Effects of Plant Traits on Fire Severity: Species, Not Surface Fuel Loads, Determine Flame Dimensions in Eucalypt Forests Abstract: The influence of plant traits on forest fire behaviour has evolutionary, ecological and management implications, but is poorly understood and frequently discounted. We use a process model to quantify that influence and provide validation in a diverse range of eucalypt forests burnt under varying conditions. Measured height of consumption was compared to heights predicted using a surface fuel fire behaviour model, then key aspects of our model were sequentially added to this with and without species-specific information. Our fully specified model had a mean absolute error 3.8 times smaller than the otherwise identical surface fuel model (p < 0.01), and correctly predicted the height of larger (≥1 m) flames 12 times more often (p < 0.001). We conclude that the primary endogenous drivers of fire severity are the species of plants present rather than the surface fuel load, and demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the model for quantifying this.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering biosynthesis of the RNA polymerase inhibitor streptolydigin and generation of glycosylated derivatives Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the dienoyltetramic acid streptolydigin was identified and characterized from the producer organism Streptomyces lydicus NRRL2433. Sequence analysis of an 80.8 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 38 ORFs, 29 of which are probably involved in streptolydigin biosynthesis and would code for all activities required for its biosynthesis. Six insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to prove its involvement in streptolydigin biosynthesis, to define the boundaries of the cluster, to functionally characterize some genes, and to generate novel derivatives. A model for streptolydigin biosynthesis is proposed that includes a probable domain skipping in the streptolydigin PKS and the participation of a free-standing adenylation domain protein. Some bioactive derivatives of streptolydigin with altered glycosylation pattern have been produced by combinatorial biosynthesis showing a certain degree of flexibility of the L-rhodinosyl transferase SlgG for the recognition of 2,3,6-trideoxyhexoses and 2,6-dideoxyhexoses, both in D- and L-configuration.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the antimicrobial peptide epilancin 15X and its N-terminal lactate Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. The recently discovered lantibiotic epilancin 15X produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 15X154 contains an unusual N-terminal lactate group. To understand its biosynthesis, the epilancin 15X biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The N-terminal lactate is produced by dehydration of a serine residue in the first position of the core peptide by ElxB, followed by proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP and hydrolysis of the resulting new N-terminal dehydroalanine. The pyruvate group thus formed is reduced to lactate by an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase designated ElxO. The enzymatic activity of ElxB, ElxP, and ElxO were investigated in vitro or in vivo and the importance of the N-terminal modification for peptide stability against bacterial aminopeptidases was assessed.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a 14-3-3 protein from Lentinus edodes that interacts with CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein), and conservation of this interaction in fission yeast Abstract: We previously identified a gene encoding a CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein) homologue from the edible Basidiomycete Lentinus edodes. To further discover the cellular functions of the CAP protein, we searched for CAP-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. Among the candidates thus obtained, many clones encoded the C-terminal half of an L. edodes 14-3-3 homologue (designated cip3). Southern blot analysis indicated that L. edodes contains only one 14-3-3 gene. Overexpression of the L. edodes 14-3-3 protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad24 null cells complemented the loss of endogenous 14-3-3 protein functions in cell morphology and UV sensitivity, suggesting functional conservation of 14-3-3 proteins between L. edodes and S. pombe. The interaction between L. edodes CAP and 14-3-3 protein was restricted to the N-terminal domain of CAP and was confirmed by in vitro co-precipitation. Results from both the two-hybrid system and in vivo co-precipitation experiments showed the conservation of this interaction in S. pombe. The observation that a 14-3-3 protein interacts with the N-terminal portion of CAP but not with full-length CAP in L. edodes and S. pombe suggests that the C-terminal region of CAP may have a negative effect on the interaction between CAP and 14-3-3 proteins, and 14-3-3 proteins may play a role in regulation of CAP function.	0
Abstract2class: Arixanthomycins A-C: Phylogeny-guided discovery of biologically active eDNA-derived pentangular polyphenols Abstract: Soil microbiomes are a rich source of uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Here we use short conserved biosynthetic gene sequences (natural product sequence tags) amplified from soil microbiomes as phylogenetic markers to correlate genotype to chemotype and target the discovery of novel bioactive pentangular polyphenols from the environment. The heterologous expression of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster (the ARX cluster), whose ketosynthase beta (KSβ) sequence tag was phylogenetically distinct from any known KSβ sequence, led to the discovery of the arixanthomycins. Arixanthomycin A (1) exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines.	1
Abstract2class: Complete Biosynthetic Pathway of Alazopeptin, a Tripeptide Consisting of Two Molecules of 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and One Molecule of Alanine Abstract: DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine), a diazo-containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60 years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala-DON-DON, which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N-acetyl-DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5-oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr-93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N-N bond formation.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Influenza Polymerase PA-PB1 Interaction Inhibitors Using an In Vitro Split-Luciferase Complementation-Based Assay Abstract: The limited therapeutic options and increasing drug-resistance call for next-generation influenza antivirals. Due to the essential function in viral replication and high sequence conservation among influenza viruses, influenza polymerase PA-PB1 protein-protein interaction becomes an attractive drug target. Here, we developed an in vitro split luciferase complementation-based assay to speed up screening of PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors. By screening 10,000 compounds, we identified two PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors, R160792 and R151785, with potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of influenza A and B viruses, including amantadine-, oseltamivir-, or dual resistant strains. Further mechanistic study reveals that R151785 inhibits PA nuclear localization, reduces the levels of viral RNAs and proteins, and inhibits viral replication at the intermediate stage, all of which are in line with its antiviral mechanism of action. Overall, we developed a robust high throughput-screening assay for screening broad-spectrum influenza antivirals targeting PA-PB1 interaction and identified R151785 as a promising antiviral drug candidate.	0
Abstract2class: Novel approaches for efficient in vivo fermentation production of noncoding RNAs Abstract: Genome-derived noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), play an essential role in the control of target gene expression underlying various cellular processes, and dysregulation of ncRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases in virtually all species including humans. Understanding ncRNA biology has opened new avenues to develop novel RNA-based therapeutics. Presently, ncRNA research and drug development is dominated by the use of ncRNA mimics that are synthesized chemically in vitro and supplemented with extensive and various types of artificial modifications and thus may not necessarily recapitulate the properties of natural RNAs generated and folded in living cells in vivo. Therefore, there are growing interests in developing novel technologies for in vivo production of RNA molecules. The two most recent major breakthroughs in achieving an efficient, large-scale, and cost-effective fermentation production of recombinant or bioengineered RNAs (e.g., tens of milligrams from 1 L of bacterial culture) are (1) using stable RNA carriers and (2) direct overexpression in RNase III-deficient bacteria, while other approaches offer a low yield (e.g., nano- to microgram scales per liter). In this article, we highlight these novel microbial fermentation-based technologies that have shifted the paradigm to the production of true biological ncRNA molecules for research and development.	0
Abstract2class: Design and synthesis of chiral and regenerable [2.2]paracyclophane-based NAD(P)H models and application in biomimetic reduction of flavonoids Abstract: With the rapid development of biomimetic asymmetric reduction, the demand for efficient chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models is growing rapidly. Herein, a new class of [2.2]paracyclophane-based chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models (CYNAMs) was designed and synthesized. The first enantioselective biomimetic reduction of tetrasubstituted alkene flavonoids has been successfully realized through enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation, giving chiral flavanones with up to 99% yield and 99% ee.	0
Abstract2class: Aromatic prenylation in phenazine biosynthesis: dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase from Streptomyces anulatus Abstract: The bacterium Streptomyces anulatus 9663, isolated from the intestine of different arthropods, produces prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. From this organism, we have identified the prenyltransferase gene ppzP. ppzP resides in a gene cluster containing orthologs of all genes known to be involved in phenazine 1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas strains as well as genes for the six enzymes required to generate dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway. This is the first complete gene cluster of a phenazine natural compound from streptomycetes. Heterologous expression of this cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the formation of prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. After inactivation of ppzP, only nonprenylated phenazine 1-carboxylic acid was formed. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of PpzP resulted in a 37-kDa soluble protein, which was identified as a 5,10-dihydrophenazine 1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase, forming a C-C bond between C-1 of the isoprenoid substrate and C-9 of the aromatic substrate. In contrast to many other prenyltransferases, the reaction of PpzP is independent of the presence of magnesium or other divalent cations. The K(m) value for dimethylallyl diphosphate was determined as 116 microm. For dihydro-PCA, half-maximal velocity was observed at 35 microm. K(cat) was calculated as 0.435 s(-1). PpzP shows obvious sequence similarity to a recently discovered family of prenyltransferases with aromatic substrates, the ABBA prenyltransferases. The present finding extends the substrate range of this family, previously limited to phenolic compounds, to include also phenazine derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: A proteome quality index Abstract: We present the Proteome Quality Index (PQI; http://pqi-list.org), a much-needed resource for users of bacterial and eukaryotic proteomes. Completely sequenced genomes for which there is an available set of protein sequences (the proteome) are given a one- to five-star rating supported by 11 different metrics of quality. The database indexes over 3000 proteomes at the time of writing and is provided via a website for browsing, filtering and downloading. Previous to this work, there was no systematic way to account for the large variability in quality of the thousands of proteomes, and this is likely to have profoundly influenced the outcome of many published studies, in particular large-scale comparative analyses. The lack of a measure of proteome quality is likely due to the difficulty in producing one, a problem that we have approached by integrating multiple metrics. The continued development and improvement of the index will require the contribution of additional metrics by us and by others; the PQI provides a useful point of reference for the scientific community, but it is only the first step towards a 'standard' for the field.	0
Abstract2class: Accramycin A, a New Aromatic Polyketide, from the Soil Bacterium, Streptomyces sp. MA37 Abstract: Drug-like molecules are known to contain many different building blocks with great potential as pharmacophores for drug discovery. The continued search for unique scaffolds in our laboratory led to the isolation of a novel Ghanaian soil bacterium, Streptomyces sp. MA37. This strain produces many bioactive molecules, most of which belong to carbazoles, pyrrolizidines, and fluorinated metabolites. Further probing of the metabolites of MA37 has led to the discovery of a new naphthacene-type aromatic natural product, which we have named accramycin A 1. This molecule was isolated using an HPLC-photodiode array (PDA) guided isolation process and MS/MS molecular networking. The structure of 1 was characterized by detailed analysis of LC-MS, UV, 1D, and 2D NMR data. Preliminary studies on the antibacterial properties of 1 using Group B Streptococcus (GBS) produced a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 27 µg/mL. This represents the first report of such bioactivity amongst the naphthacene-type aromatic polyketides, and also suggests the possibility for the further development of potent molecules against GBS based on the accramycin scaffold. A putative acc biosynthetic pathway for accramycin, featuring a tridecaketide-specific type II polyketide synthase, was proposed.	1
Abstract2class: Structures of darunavir-resistant HIV-1 protease mutant reveal atypical binding of darunavir to wide open flaps Abstract: The molecular basis for high resistance to clinical inhibitors of HIV-1 protease (PR) was examined for the variant designated PRP51 that was selected for resistance to darunavir (DRV). High resolution crystal structures of PRP51 with the active site D25N mutation revealed a ligand-free form and an inhibitor-bound form showing a unique binding site and orientation for DRV. This inactivating mutation is known to increase the dimer dissociation constant and decrease DRV affinity of PR. The PRP51-D25N dimers were in the open conformation with widely separated flaps, as reported for other highly resistant variants. PRP51-D25N dimer bound two DRV molecules and showed larger separation of 8.7 Å between the closest atoms of the two flaps compared with 4.4 Å for the ligand-free structure of this mutant. The ligand-free structure, however, lacked van der Waals contacts between Ile50 and Pro81' from the other subunit in the dimer, unlike the majority of PR structures. DRV is bound inside the active site cavity; however, the inhibitor is oriented almost perpendicular to its typical position and exhibits only 2 direct hydrogen bond and two water-mediated interactions with atoms of PRP51-D25N compared with 11 hydrogen bond interactions seen for DRV bound in the typical position in wild-type enzyme. The atypical location of DRV may provide opportunities for design of novel inhibitors targeting the open conformation of PR drug-resistant mutants.	0
Abstract2class: Construction of a cellulase hyper-expression system in Trichoderma reesei by promoter and enzyme engineering Abstract: Background:                       Trichoderma reesei is the preferred organism for producing industrial cellulases. However, a more efficient heterologous expression system for enzymes from different organism is needed to further improve its cellulase mixture. The strong cbh1 promoter of T. reesei is frequently used in heterologous expression, however, the carbon catabolite repressor CREI may reduce its strength by binding to the cbh1 promoter at several binding sites. Another crucial point to enhance the production of heterologous enzymes is the stability of recombinant mRNA and the prevention of protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, especially for the bacteria originated enzymes.In this study, the CREI binding sites within the cbh1 promoter were replaced with the binding sites of transcription activator ACEII and the HAP2/3/5 complex to improve the promoter efficiency. To further improve heterologous expression efficiency of bacterial genes within T. reesei, a flexible polyglycine linker and a rigid α-helix linker were tested in the construction of fusion genes between cbh1 from T. reesei and e1, encoding an endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus.                  Results:                       The modified promoter resulted in an increased expression level of the green fluorescent protein reporter by 5.5-fold in inducing culture medium and 7.4-fold in repressing culture medium. The fusion genes of cbh1 and e1 were successfully expressed in T. reesei under the control of promoter pcbh1m2. The higher enzyme activities and thermostability of the fusion protein with rigid linker indicated that the rigid linker might be more suitable for the heterologous expression system in T. reesei. Compared to the parent strain RC30-8, the FPase and CMCase activities of the secreted enzyme mixture from the corresponding transformant R1 with the rigid linker increased by 39% and 30% at 60°C, respectively, and the reduced sugar concentration in the hydrolysate of pretreated corn stover (PCS) was dramatically increased by 40% at 55°C and 169% at 60°C when its enzyme mixture was used in the hydrolysis.                  Conclusions:                       This study shows that optimizations of the promoter and linker for hybrid genes can dramatically improve the efficiency of heterologous expression of cellulase genes in T. reesei.	0
Abstract2class: A new macromolecular antitumor antibiotic, C-1027. III. Antitumor activity Abstract: C-1027, a new macromolecular antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces globisporus C-1027, showed extremely potent cytotoxicity toward cultured cancer cells. Compared in terms of IC50 values, antibiotic C-1027 showed much more potent cytotoxicity than doxorubicin, mitomycin C and neocarzinostatin. Spermatogonial assay, a prescreen for anticancer drugs, was highly sensitive for detection of C-1027. At tolerable doses, C-1027 exhibited marked inhibition on a panel of transplantable tumors in mice, which included leukemia L1210, P388, ascites hepatoma H22, sarcoma 180 and melanoma Harding-Passey.	0
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of the initiation enzyme of S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis in Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer glycoprotein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a is composed of repeating units [-->2)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-l-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->], with a 2-O-methyl modification of the terminal trisaccharide at the nonreducing end of the glycan chain, a core saccharide composed of two or three alpha-l-rhamnose residues, and a beta-d-galactose residue as a linker to the S-layer protein. In this study, we report the biochemical characterization of WsaP of the S-layer glycosylation gene cluster as a UDP-Gal:phosphoryl-polyprenol Gal-1-phosphate transferase that primes the S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a. Our results demonstrate that the enzyme transfers in vitro a galactose-1-phosphate from UDP-galactose to endogenous phosphoryl-polyprenol and that the C-terminal half of WsaP carries the galactosyltransferase function, as already observed for the UDP-Gal:phosphoryl-polyprenol Gal-1-phosphate transferase WbaP from Salmonella enterica. To confirm the function of the enzyme, we show that WsaP is capable of reconstituting polysaccharide biosynthesis in WbaP-deficient strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.	1
Abstract2class: Dihydrofolate reductase of the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. The enzyme and its coding gene Abstract: Halobacterium volcanii mutants that are resistant to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimethoprim contain DNA sequence amplifications. This paper describes the cloning and nucleic acid sequencing of the amplified DNA sequence of the H. volcanii mutant WR215. This sequence contains an open reading frame that codes for an amino acid sequence that is homologous to the amino acid sequences of dihydrofolate reductases from different sources. As a result of the gene amplification, the trimethoprim-resistant mutant overproduces dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate-mediated chromatographies. It is shown that the enzyme comprises 5% of the cell protein. The amino acid sequence of the first 15 amino acids of the enzyme fits the coding sequence of the gene. Preliminary biochemical characterization shows that the enzyme is unstable at salt concentrations lower than 2 M and that its activity increases with increase in the KCl or NaCl concentrations.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning, sequencing, and analysis of the griseusin polyketide synthase gene cluster from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: A fragment of DNA was cloned from the Streptomyces griseus K-63 genome by using genes (act) for the actinorhodin polyketide synthase (PKS) of Streptomyces coelicolor as a probe. Sequencing of a 5.4-kb segment of the cloned DNA revealed a set of five gris open reading frames (ORFs), corresponding to the act PKS genes, in the following order: ORF1 for a ketosynthase, ORF2 for a chain length-determining factor, ORF3 for an acyl carrier protein, ORF5 for a ketoreductase, and ORF4 for a cyclase-dehydrase. Replacement of the gris genes with a marker gene in the S. griseus genome by using a single-stranded suicide vector propagated in Escherichia coli resulted in loss of the ability to produce griseusins A and B, showing that the five gris genes do indeed encode the type II griseusin PKS. These genes, encoding a PKS that is programmed differently from those for other aromatic PKSs so far available, will provide further valuable material for analysis of the programming mechanism by the construction and analysis of strains carrying hybrid PKS.	1
Abstract2class: Intimate bacterial-fungal interaction triggers biosynthesis of archetypal polyketides in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungi produce numerous low molecular weight molecules endowed with a multitude of biological activities. However, mining the full-genome sequences of fungi indicates that their potential to produce secondary metabolites is greatly underestimated. Because most of the biosynthesis gene clusters are silent under laboratory conditions, one of the major challenges is to understand the physiological conditions under which these genes are activated. Thus, we cocultivated the important model fungus Aspergillus nidulans with a collection of 58 soil-dwelling actinomycetes. By microarray analyses of both Aspergillus secondary metabolism and full-genome arrays and Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrate at the molecular level that a distinct fungal-bacterial interaction leads to the specific activation of fungal secondary metabolism genes. Most surprisingly, dialysis experiments and electron microscopy indicated that an intimate physical interaction of the bacterial and fungal mycelia is required to elicit the specific response. Gene knockout experiments provided evidence that one induced gene cluster codes for the long-sought after polyketide synthase (PKS) required for the biosynthesis of the archetypal polyketide orsellinic acid, the typical lichen metabolite lecanoric acid, and the cathepsin K inhibitors F-9775A and F-9775B. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that orthologs of this PKS are widespread in nature in all major fungal groups, including mycobionts of lichens. These results provide evidence of specific interaction among microorganisms belonging to different domains and support the hypothesis that not only diffusible signals but intimate physical interactions contribute to the communication among microorganisms and induction of otherwise silent biosynthesis genes.	1
Abstract2class: Genome mining of the Streptomyces avermitilis genome and development of genome-minimized hosts for heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: To date, several actinomycete genomes have been completed and annotated. Among them, Streptomyces microorganisms are of major pharmaceutical interest because they are a rich source of numerous secondary metabolites. S. avermitilis is an industrial microorganism used for the production of an anthelmintic agent, avermectin, which is a commercially important antiparasitic agent in human and veterinary medicine, and agricultural pesticides. Genome analysis of S. avermitilis provides significant information for not only industrial applications but also understanding the features of this genus. On genome mining of S. avermitilis, the microorganism has been found to harbor at least 38 secondary metabolic gene clusters and 46 insertion sequence (IS)-like sequences on the genome, which have not been searched so far. A significant use of the genome data of Streptomyces microorganisms is the construction of a versatile host for heterologous expression of exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters by genetic engineering. Since S. avermitilis is used as an industrial microorganism, the microorganism is already optimized for the efficient supply of primary metabolic precursors and biochemical energy to support multistep biosynthesis. The feasibility of large-deletion mutants of S. avermitilis has been confirmed by heterologous expression of more than 20 exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: In situ transformation of TON silica zeolite into the less dense ITW: structure-direction overcoming framework instability in the synthesis of SiO2 zeolites Abstract: Under specific synthesis conditions the crystallization of a dense silica zeolite (TON) is followed by its in situ transformation into a less dense and, in the absence of occluded species, less stable zeolite (ITW). Periodic ab initio calculations including energy corrections for van der Waals interactions as well as zero-point and thermal effects are used first to assess the relative stability of both SiO(2) (calcined) phases and then to investigate host-guest interactions in the as-made zeolites, as well as their relative stability. The less dense SiO(2)-ITW is less stable than SiO(2)-TON, with an energy difference that is significantly larger than expected from their difference in molar volume. This extra destabilization is ascribed to the strained double 4-ring units of silica tetrahedra (D4R). Regarding the as-made materials, the organic cation fills in more efficiently the zeolitic voids in ITW than in TON, bringing about a larger stabilization in the former owing to the extension of the long-range addition of dispersion force contributions. On the other hand, fluoride induces a polarization of the silica framework that is highly localized in TON (showing pentacoordinated [SiO(4/2)F](-) units) but has a large global character in ITW (where fluoride is encapsulated into D4R units). We argue that the structure-directing role toward D4R materials that has been proposed for fluoride consists fundamentally in the ability to induce a global polarization of the silica framework that allows relaxation of the strain associated with these units. In this sense, fluoride stabilizes the otherwise strained D4R-SiO(2) frameworks making them reachable for crystallization. This work documents a case in which the structure directing agents "choose" a structure not kinetically but through stabilization.	0
Abstract2class: Escherichia coli induces DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells Abstract: Transient infection of eukaryotic cells with commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli of phylogenetic group B2 blocks mitosis and induces megalocytosis. This trait is linked to a widely spread genomic island that encodes giant modular nonribosomal peptide and polyketide synthases. Contact with E. coli expressing this gene cluster causes DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventually to cell death. Discovery of hybrid peptide-polyketide genotoxins in E. coli will change our view on pathogenesis and commensalism and open new biotechnological applications.	1
Abstract2class: A putative ABC transporter gene, ZRA1, is required for zearalenone production in Gibberella zeae Abstract: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Fusarium species and causes estrogenic disorders in humans and animals. Recent studies have identified the ZEA biosynthesis gene cluster in F. graminearum, but other genes such as transporters responsible for ZEA export have not been identified in the cluster. In this study, we performed microarray analyses from the wild-type strain with and without ZEA supplementation and ZEA-nonproducing strain zeb2 to discover other genes responsible for ZEA biosynthesis. Three putative ABC transporters were significantly down-regulated in the zeb2 and were under positive regulation of the ZEB2 gene, which functions as a transcriptional activator for ZEA production in this fungus. However, only one gene (ZRA1) was found to be up-regulated by 20-fold in the wild-type strain supplemented with ZEA, and deletion of ZRA1 resulted in reduced ZEA production. Deletions of the other two genes showed similar ZEA productions as the wild-type strain. ZRA1 localized to the plasma membrane and vacuoles indicating possible roles of ZRA1 as a transporter. This study indicated that ZRA1 is involved in ZEA production and shares a common regulatory mode with ZEA cluster genes by ZEB2.	1
Abstract2class: 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens Abstract: The microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. Earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a survey of cecal bacteria was done by retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. The ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in TTGE gels. A total of 1,656 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in the GenBank. The comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. Overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (Clostridium leptum, Sporomusa sp., Clostridium coccoides, and enterics). Sequences of members of the Bacteroides group, the Bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of Pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. Sequences related to those from the Escherichia sp. subgroup and from Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited in the GenBank. Sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. TTGE and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 interactions by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy Abstract: Neurotransmitter release depends critically on the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, which mediate membrane fusion by forming tight SNARE complexes that bridge the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. Interactions between the SNARE complex and the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin-1 (the C2A and C2B domains) are believed to play a key role in coupling Ca(2+) sensing to membrane fusion, but the nature of these interactions is unclear, in part because of a paucity of data obtained by quantitative biophysical methods. Here we have analyzed synaptotagmin-1/SNARE complex interactions by monitoring the decrease in the intensities of one-dimensional (13)C-edited (1)H NMR spectra of (13)C-labeled fragments of synaptotagmin-1 upon binding to unlabeled SNARE complex. Our results indicate that there is a primary binding mode between synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE complex that involves a polybasic region in the C2B domain and has a sub-micromolar affinity. Our NMR data, combined with precipitation assays, show that there are additional SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 interactions that lead to aggregation and that involve in part two arginines at the bottom of the C2B domain. Overall, this study shows the importance of disentangling the contributions of different types of interactions to SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 binding and illustrates the usefulness of one-dimensional NMR methods to analyze intricate protein interactions.	0
Abstract2class: Terpendole E, a kinesin Eg5 inhibitor, is a key biosynthetic intermediate of indole-diterpenes in the producing fungus Chaunopycnis alba Abstract: Terpendole E is the first natural product inhibitor of kinesin Eg5. Because terpendole E production is unstable, we isolated and analyzed the terpendole E biosynthetic gene cluster, which consists of seven genes encoding three P450 monooxygenases (TerP, TerQ, and TerK), an FAD-dependent monooxygenase (TerM), a terpene cyclase (TerB), and two prenyltransferases (TerC and TerF). Gene knockout and feeding experiments revealed that terpendole E is a key intermediate in terpendole biosynthesis and is produced by the action of the key enzyme TerQ from paspaline, a common biosynthetic intermediate of indole-diterpenes. TerP converts terpendole E to a downstream intermediate specific to terpendole biosynthesis and converts paspaline to shunt metabolites. We successfully overproduced terpendole E by disrupting the terP gene. We propose that terpendole E is a key biosynthetic intermediate of terpendoles and related indole-diterpenes.	1
Abstract2class: Simplified Monopalmitoyl Toll-like Receptor 2 Ligand Mini-UPam for Self-Adjuvanting Neoantigen-Based Synthetic Cancer Vaccines Abstract: Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3 CysSK4 . A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini-UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T-cell therapy. Homogeneous mini-UPam-SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid-phase synthesis that employed a mini-UPam building block pre-prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc-amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini-UPam-SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T-cells.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a novel type of silk protein and regulation of its expression Abstract: The silk of lepidopteran insects has been studied extensively as proteins of two categories: the fibroins, which are produced in the posterior section of silk glands, and the sericins, which are secreted in the middle section. We now describe a third category that is named seroins to accentuate the fact that both the sericin- and the fibroin-producing cells participate in seroin secretion. Using a probe derived from the N-terminal sequences of a 23-kDa components of Galleria mellonella silk, we isolated silk gland-specific cDNA encoding 167 amino acids, of which 17 constitute the signal peptide. The following 14 residues match the N-terminal sequences of the 23- and 22.5-kDa silk proteines. The reaction of these proteins with concanavalin A and the presence of two glycosylation sites in the seroin peptide sequence indicate that seroin is secreted in two forms that both contain a mannose-rich sugar moiety. Seroin is distinguished from other silk proteins by high proline content (34 residues or 20.26% by weight), lack of cysteines, and the presence of two kinds of short amino acid repeats. The seroin gene is expressed in both the posterior and middle silk gland sections. The expression fluctuates during development in correlation with the feeding regime and the changes in hormone titers: seroin mRNA is high in the silk glands of feeding larvae, declines at ecdysis, reaches a maximum during cocoon spinning, and thereafter rapidly drops to an undetectable level. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the drop is caused by ecdysteroid hormones and is prevented by juvenile hormones. N-terminal sequencing of several silk proteins of Bombyx mori revealed that the 8- and 13-kDa proteins share 5 or 6 out of 10 identified amino acids with the N terminus of Galleria seroin and obviously represent seroin homologues. The result suggests that seroin-type proteins are a general component of lepidopteran silk.	0
Abstract2class: Genome of Labrenzia sp. PHM005 Reveals a Complete and Active Trans-AT PKS Gene Cluster for the Biosynthesis of Labrenzin Abstract: The complete genome of the strain Labrenzia sp. PHM005, a free-living producer of a pederin analog 18-O-demethyl pederin, hereinafter labrenzin, has been sequenced. This strain contains two replicons comprising a circular chromosome of 6,167,349 bp and a circular plasmid (named p1BIR) of 19,450 bp. A putative gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of labrenzin (lab cluster) has been identified showing that it encodes a trans-AT mixed type PKS/NRPS biosynthetic pathway that is responsible for the synthesis of pederin and possibly an onnamide analog. The putative boundaries of the lab gene cluster were determined by genetic comparisons with other related strains, suggesting that the cluster consists of a 79-kb region comprising 3 genes encoding multidomain hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) proteins (PKS4, PKS/NRPS13, and PKS/NRPS15), and 16 auxiliary enzymes. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that all the genes of the cluster are expressed in our culture conditions (i.e., in minimal medium in the absence of any specific inducer) at detectable levels. We have developed genetic tools to facilitate the manipulation of this strain and the functional characterization of the cluster genes. We have created a site-directed mutant unable to produce pederin, demonstrating experimentally for the first time the role of the cluster in the synthesis of pederin. This work paves the way to unravel the clues of the biosynthesis of pederin family compounds and opens the door to modify and overproduce these anticancer drugs for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes.	1
Abstract2class: Structure determination and interception of biosynthetic intermediates for the plantazolicin class of highly discriminating antibiotics Abstract: The soil-dwelling, plant growth-promoting bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a prolific producer of complex natural products. Recently, a new FZB42 metabolite, plantazolicin (PZN), has been described as a member of the growing thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) family. TOMMs are biosynthesized from inactive, ribosomal peptides and undergo a series of cyclodehydrations, dehydrogenations, and other modifications to become bioactive natural products. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, chemoselective modification, genetic interruptions, and other spectroscopic tools, we have determined the molecular structure of PZN. In addition to two conjugated polyazole moieties, the amino-terminus of PZN has been modified to N(α),N(α)-dimethylarginine. PZN exhibited a highly selective antibiotic activity toward Bacillus anthracis, but no other tested human pathogen. By altering oxygenation levels during fermentation, PZN analogues were produced that bear variability in their heterocycle content, which yielded insight into the order of biosynthetic events. Lastly, genome-mining has revealed the existence of four additional PZN-like biosynthetic gene clusters. Given their structural uniqueness and intriguing antimicrobial specificity, the PZN class of antibiotics may hold pharmacological value.	1
Abstract2class: A Flavin-Dependent Decarboxylase-Dehydrogenase-Monooxygenase Assembles the Warhead of α,β-Epoxyketone Proteasome Inhibitors Abstract: The α,β-epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor TMC-86A was discovered as a previously unreported metabolite of Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC49982, and the gene cluster responsible for its biosynthesis was identified via genome sequencing. Incorporation experiments with [(13)C-methyl]l-methionine implicated an α-dimethyl-β-keto acid intermediate in the biosynthesis of TMC-86A. Incubation of the chemically synthesized α-dimethyl-β-keto acid with a purified recombinant flavin-dependent enzyme that is conserved in all known pathways for epoxyketone biosynthesis resulted in formation of the corresponding α-methyl-α,β-epoxyketone. This transformation appears to proceed via an unprecedented decarboxylation-dehydrogenation-monooxygenation cascade. The biosynthesis of the TMC-86A warhead is completed by cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation of the α-methyl-α,β-epoxyketone.	1
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of the gene cluster involved in production of the bacteriocin circularin A by Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752 Abstract: A region of 12 kb flanking the structural gene of the cyclic antibacterial peptide circularin A of Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752 was sequenced, and the putative proteins involved in the production and secretion of circularin A were identified. The genes are tightly organized in overlapping open reading frames. Heterologous expression of circularin A in Enterococcus faecalis was achieved, and five genes were identified as minimally required for bacteriocin production and secretion. Two of the putative proteins, CirB and CirC, are predicted to contain membrane-spanning domains, while CirD contains a highly conserved ATP-binding domain. Together with CirB and CirC, this ATP-binding protein is involved in the production of circularin A. The fifth gene, cirE, confers immunity towards circularin A when expressed in either Lactococcus lactis or E. faecalis and is needed in order to allow the bacteria to produce bacteriocin. Additional resistance against circularin A is conferred by the activity of the putative transporter consisting of CirB and CirD.	1
Abstract2class: Specificity of the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade for ubiquitin C-terminal sequences identified by phage display Abstract: Ubiquitin (UB) is a protein modifier that regulates many essential cellular processes. To initiate protein modification by UB, the E1 enzyme activates the C-terminal carboxylate of UB to launch its transfer through the E1-E2-E3 cascade onto target proteins. In this study, we used phage display to profile the specificity of the two human E1 enzymes, Ube1 and Uba6, toward the C-terminal sequence of UB ending with (71)LRLRGG(76). Phage selection revealed that while Arg72 of UB is absolutely required for E1 recognition, UB residues at positions 71, 73, and 74 can be replaced with bulky aromatic side chains, and Gly75 of UB can be changed to Ser, Asp, and Asn for efficient E1 activation. We have thus found that the E1 enzymes have substantial promiscuity regarding the UB C-terminal sequence. The UB variants from phage selection can also be transferred from E1 to E2 enzymes; however, they are blocked from further transfer to the E3 enzymes. This suggests that the C-terminal sequence of UB is important for its discharge from E2 and subsequent transfer to E3. In addition, we observed that the Leu73Phe and Leu73Tyr single mutants of UB are resistant to cleavage by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), although they can be assembled by the E1-E2-E3 cascade into poly-UB chains, thus indicating differences in UB C-terminal specificities between the E1 and DUBs. Consequently these UB mutants may provide stability to UB polymers attached to cellular proteins and facilitate the elucidation of the biological signals encoded in the UB chains.	0
Abstract2class: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the O-methyltransferase NovP from the novobiocin-biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovP (subunit MW = 29 967 Da; 262 amino acids), an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallized in space group P2, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.81, b = 46.04, c = 61.22 A, beta = 104.97 degrees. Native data to a maximum resolution of 1.4 A were collected from a single crystal at the synchrotron. NovP is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin that targets the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.	1
Abstract2class: The antimicrobial effect of Octenidine-dihydrochloride coated polymer tracheotomy tubes on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation Abstract: Background:                       The surface of polymeric tracheotomy tubes is a favourable environment for biofilm formation and therefore represents a potential risk factor for the development of pneumonia after tracheotomy. The aim of this in-vitro study was to develop octenidine-dihydrochloride (OCT) coated polymer tracheotomy tubes and investigate any effects on Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa colonization. Additionally the resistance of the OCT coating was tested using reprocessing procedures like brushing, rinsing and disinfection with glutaraldehyde                  Results:                       Contamination with S. aureus: Before any reprocessing, OCT coated tracheotomy tubes were colonized with 103 cfu/ml and uncoated tracheotomy tubes with 105 cfu/ml (P = 0.045). After reprocessing, no differences in bacterial concentration between modified and conventional tubes were observed.Contamination with P. aeruginosa: Before reprocessing, OCT coated tubes were colonized with 106 cfu/ml and uncoated tubes with 107 cfu/ml (P = 0.006). After reprocessing, no significant differences were observed.                  Conclusion:                       OCT coating initially inhibits S. aureus and P. aeruginosa colonisation on tracheotomy tubes. This effect, however, vanishes quickly after reprocessing of the tubes due to poor adhesive properties of the antimicrobial compound. Despite the known antimicrobial effect of OCT, its use for antimicrobial coating of tracheotomy tubes is limited unless methods are developed to allow sustained attachment to the tube.	0
Abstract2class: Low-diversity bacterial community in the gut of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster Abstract: The bacteria in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster of different life stages was quantified by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The sequence reads were dominated by 5 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at ≤ 97% sequence identity that could be assigned to Acetobacter pomorum, A. tropicalis, Lactobacillus brevis, L. fructivorans and L. plantarum. The saturated rarefaction curves and species richness indices indicated that the sampling (85,000-159,000 reads per sample) was comprehensive. Parallel diagnostic PCR assays revealed only minor variation in the complement of the five bacterial species across individual insects and three D. melanogaster strains. Other gut-associated bacteria included 6 OTUs with low %ID to previously reported sequences, raising the possibility that they represent novel taxa within the genera Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. A developmental change in the most abundant species, from L. fructivorans in young adults to A. pomorum in aged adults was identified; changes in gut oxygen tension or immune system function might account for this effect. Host immune responses and disturbance may also contribute to the low bacterial diversity in the Drosophila gut habitat.	0
Abstract2class: Lactoferrin is a natural inhibitor of plasminogen activation Abstract: The plasminogen system is essential for dissolution of fibrin clots, and in addition, it is involved in a wide variety of other physiological processes, including proteolytic activation of growth factors, cell migration, and removal of protein aggregates. On the other hand, uncontrolled plasminogen activation contributes to many pathological processes (e.g. tumor cells' invasion in cancer progression). Moreover, some virulent bacterial species (e.g. Streptococci or Borrelia) bind human plasminogen and hijack the host's plasminogen system to penetrate tissue barriers. Thus, the conversion of plasminogen to the active serine protease plasmin must be tightly regulated. Here, we show that human lactoferrin, an iron-binding milk glycoprotein, blocks plasminogen activation on the cell surface by direct binding to human plasminogen. We mapped the mutual binding sites to the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, encompassed also in the bioactive peptide lactoferricin, and kringle 5 of plasminogen. Finally, lactoferrin blocked tumor cell invasion in vitro and also plasminogen activation driven by Borrelia Our results explain many diverse biological properties of lactoferrin and also suggest that lactoferrin may be useful as a potential tool for therapeutic interventions to prevent both invasive malignant cells and virulent bacteria from penetrating host tissues.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and Ether-Bridge Formation in Nargenicin Macrolides Abstract: The nargenicin family of antibiotics are macrolides containing a rare ether-bridged cis-decalin motif. Several of these compounds are highly active against multi-drug resistant organisms. Despite the identification of the first members of this family almost 40 years ago, the genetic basis for the production of these molecules and the enzyme responsible for formation of the oxa bridge, remain unknown. Here, the 85 kb nargenicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from a human pathogenic Nocardia arthritidis isolate and this locus is solely responsible for nargenicin production. Further investigation of this locus revealed a putative iron-α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, which was found to be responsible for the formation of the ether bridge from the newly identified deoxygenated precursor, 8,13-deoxynargenicin. Uncovering the nargenicin biosynthetic locus provides a molecular basis for the rational bioengineering of these interesting antibiotic macrolides.	1

Abstract2class: Genome mining identifies cepacin as a plant-protective metabolite of the biopesticidal bacterium Burkholderia ambifaria Abstract: Beneficial microorganisms are widely used in agriculture for control of plant pathogens, but a lack of efficacy and safety information has limited the exploitation of multiple promising biopesticides. We applied phylogeny-led genome mining, metabolite analyses and biological control assays to define the efficacy of Burkholderia ambifaria, a naturally beneficial bacterium with proven biocontrol properties but potential pathogenic risk. A panel of 64 B. ambifaria strains demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against priority plant pathogens. Genome sequencing, specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster mining and metabolite analysis revealed an armoury of known and unknown pathways within B. ambifaria. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of the metabolite cepacin was identified and directly shown to mediate protection of germinating crops against Pythium damping-off disease. B. ambifaria maintained biopesticidal protection and overall fitness in the soil after deletion of its third replicon, a non-essential plasmid associated with virulence in Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria. Removal of the third replicon reduced B. ambifaria persistence in a murine respiratory infection model. Here, we show that by using interdisciplinary phylogenomic, metabolomic and functional approaches, the mode of action of natural biological control agents related to pathogens can be systematically established to facilitate their future exploitation.	1
Abstract2class: Multiple entry pathways within the efflux transporter AcrB contribute to multidrug recognition Abstract: AcrB is the major multidrug exporter in Escherichia coli. Although several substrate-entrances have been identified, the specificity of these various transport paths remains unclear. Here we present evidence for a substrate channel (channel 3) from the central cavity of the AcrB trimer, which is connected directly to the deep pocket without first passing the switch-loop and the proximal pocket . Planar aromatic cations, such as ethidium, prefer channel 3 to channels 1 and 2. The efflux through channel 3 increases by targeted mutations and is not in competition with the export of drugs such as minocycline and erythromycin through channels 1 and 2. A switch-loop mutant, in which the pathway from the proximal to the deep pocket is hindered, can export only channel 3-utilizing drugs. The usage of multiple entrances thus contributes to the recognition and transport of a wide range of drugs with different physicochemical properties.	0
Abstract2class: Diazaquinomycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters from Marine and Freshwater Actinomycetes Abstract: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of global concern. Members of the diazaquinomycin (DAQ) class of natural products have shown potent and selective activity against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, poor solubility has prevented further development of this compound class. Understanding DAQ biosynthesis may provide a viable route for the generation of derivatives with improved properties. We have sequenced the genomes of two actinomycete bacteria that produce distinct DAQ derivatives. While software tools for automated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) prediction failed to detect DAQ BGCs, comparative genomics using MAUVE alignment led to the identification of putative BGCs in the marine Streptomyces sp. F001 and in the freshwater Micromonospora sp. B006. Deletion of the identified daq BGC in strain B006 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing abolished DAQ production, providing experimental evidence for BGC assignment. A complete model for DAQ biosynthesis is proposed based on the genes identified. Insufficient knowledge of natural product biosynthesis is one of the major challenges of productive genome mining approaches. The results reported here fill a gap in knowledge regarding the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of DAQ antibiotics. Moreover, identification of the daq BGC shall enable future generations of improved derivatives using biosynthetic methods.	1
Abstract2class: Structure, bioactivity, and resistance mechanism of streptomonomicin, an unusual lasso Peptide from an understudied halophilic actinomycete Abstract: Natural products are the most historically significant source of compounds for drug development. However, unacceptably high rates of compound rediscovery associated with large-scale screening of common microbial producers have resulted in the abandonment of many natural product drug discovery efforts, despite the increasing prevalence of clinically problematic antibiotic resistance. Screening of underexplored taxa represents one strategy to avoid rediscovery. Herein we report the discovery, isolation, and structural elucidation of streptomonomicin (STM), an antibiotic lasso peptide from Streptomonospora alba, and report the genome for its producing organism. STM-resistant clones of Bacillus anthracis harbor mutations to walR, the gene encoding a response regulator for the only known widely distributed and essential two-component signal transduction system in Firmicutes. To the best of our knowledge, Streptomonospora had been hitherto biosynthetically and genetically uncharacterized, with STM being the first reported compound from the genus. Our results demonstrate that understudied microbes remain fruitful reservoirs for the rapid discovery of novel, bioactive natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Structural basis of head to head polyketide fusion by CorB Abstract: Corallopyronin A is a polyketide derived from the myxobacterium Corallococcus coralloides with potent antibiotic features. The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of corallopyronin A has been described recently, and it was proposed that CorB acts as a ketosynthase to interconnect two polyketide chains in a rare head-to-head condensation reaction. We determined the structure of CorB, the interconnecting polyketide synthase, to high resolution and found that CorB displays a thiolase fold. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the catalytic triad consisting of a cysteine, a histidine and an asparagine is crucial for catalysis, and that this triad shares similarities with the triad found in HMG-CoA synthases. We synthesized a substrate mimic to derivatize purified CorB and confirmed substrate attachment by ESI-MS. Structural analysis of the complex yielded an electron density-based model for the polyketide chain and showed that the unusually wide, T-shaped active site is able to accommodate two polyketides simultaneously. Our structural analysis provides a platform for understanding the unusual head-to-head polyketide-interconnecting reaction catalyzed by CorB.	0
Abstract2class: Positive GABA(A) receptor modulators from Acorus calamus and structural analysis of (+)-dioxosarcoguaiacol by 1D and 2D NMR and molecular modeling Abstract: In a two-microelectrode voltage clamp with Xenopus laevis oocytes, a petroleum ether extract of Acorus calamus rhizomes enhanced the GABA-induced chloride current through GABA(A) receptors of the α₁β₂γ(2S) subtype by 277% ± 9.7% (100 μg/mL). β-Asarone (1), (+)-dioxosarcoguaiacol (2), (+)-shyobunone (3), and (+)-preisocalamenediol (4) were subsequently identified as main active principles through HPLC-based activity profiling and targeted isolation. The compounds induced maximum potentiation of the chloride current ranging from 588% ± 126% (EC₅₀: 65.3 ± 21.6 μM) (2) to 1200% ± 163% (EC(50): 171.5 ± 34.6 μM) (1), whereas (-)-isoshyobunone (5) and (-)-acorenone (6) exhibited weak GABA(A) modulating properties (5: 164% ± 42.9%; EC₅₀: 109.4 ± 46.6 μM and 6: 241% ± 23.1%; EC₅₀: 34.0 ± 6.7 μM). The relative configuration of 2 was established as 4R*8S*10R* by NOESY experiments and conformational analysis.	0
Abstract2class: Covalent targeting of remote cysteine residues to develop CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinases 12 and 13 (CDK12 and CDK13) play critical roles in the regulation of gene transcription. However, the absence of CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors has hindered the ability to investigate the consequences of their inhibition in healthy cells and cancer cells. Here we describe the rational design of a first-in-class CDK12 and CDK13 covalent inhibitor, THZ531. Co-crystallization of THZ531 with CDK12-cyclin K indicates that THZ531 irreversibly targets a cysteine located outside the kinase domain. THZ531 causes a loss of gene expression with concurrent loss of elongating and hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. In particular, THZ531 substantially decreases the expression of DNA damage response genes and key super-enhancer-associated transcription factor genes. Coincident with transcriptional perturbation, THZ531 dramatically induced apoptotic cell death. Small molecules capable of specifically targeting CDK12 and CDK13 may thus help identify cancer subtypes that are particularly dependent on their kinase activities.	0
Abstract2class: Allele-Specific Inhibition of Histone Demethylases Abstract: Histone demethylases play a critical role in mammalian gene expression by removing methyl groups from lysine residues in degree- and site-specific manner. To specifically interrogate members and isoforms of this class of enzymes, we have developed demethylase variants with an expanded active site. The mutant enzymes are capable of performing lysine demethylation with wild-type proficiency, but are sensitive to inhibition by cofactor-competitive molecules embellished with a complementary steric "bump". The selected inhibitors show more than 20-fold selectivity over the wild-type demethylase, thus overcoming issues typical to pharmacological and genetic approaches. The mutant-inhibitor pairs are shown to act on a physiologically relevant full-length substrate. By engineering a conserved amino acid to achieve member-specific perturbation, this study provides a general approach for studying histone demethylases in diverse cellular processes.	0
Abstract2class: Genome sequencing reveals complex secondary metabolome in the marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica Abstract: Recent fermentation studies have identified actinomycetes of the marine-dwelling genus Salinispora as prolific natural product producers. To further evaluate their biosynthetic potential, we sequenced the 5,183,331-bp S. tropica CNB-440 circular genome and analyzed all identifiable secondary natural product gene clusters. Our analysis shows that S. tropica dedicates a large percentage of its genome ( approximately 9.9%) to natural product assembly, which is greater than previous Streptomyces genome sequences as well as other natural product-producing actinomycetes. The S. tropica genome features polyketide synthase systems of every known formally classified family, nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and several hybrid clusters. Although a few clusters appear to encode molecules previously identified in Streptomyces species, the majority of the 17 biosynthetic loci are novel. Specific chemical information about putative and observed natural product molecules is presented and discussed. In addition, our bioinformatic analysis not only was critical for the structure elucidation of the polyene macrolactam salinilactam A, but its structural analysis aided the genome assembly of the highly repetitive slm loci. This study firmly establishes the genus Salinispora as a rich source of drug-like molecules and importantly reveals the powerful interplay between genomic analysis and traditional natural product isolation studies.	1
Abstract2class: NOVEL Escherichia coli dnaB mutant: direct involvement of the dnaB252 gene product in the synthesis of an origin-ribonucleic acid species during initiaion of a round of deoxyribonucleic acid replication Abstract: The initiation process of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication in Escherichia coli has been studied using the thermoreversible dna initiation mutant E. coli HfrHl65/120/6 dna-252. This dna mutation was incorrectly classed as a dnaA mutation. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the dna-252 mutant is a novel dnaB mutant, possessing phenotypic properties which distinguish it from other dnaB mutants. Sensitivity of reinitiation in the dna-252 mutant to specific inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and DNA synthesis was studied. Reinitiation is shown to be sensitive to rifampin and streptolydigin but not to cholramphenicol. Thus, the dna-252 gene product appears to be required during the initiation process for a step occurring either before or during synthesis of an RNA species (origin-RNA). Using reversible inhibition of RNA synthesis by streptolydigin of a streptolydigin-sensitive derivative of the dna-252 mutant, the dna-252 gene product is shown to be directly involved in the synthesis of an orgin-RNA species. These results are included in a schematic model presented in the accompanying paper of the temporal sequence of events occurring during the initiation process.	0
Abstract2class: Preprosubtilisin Carlsberg processing and secretion is blocked after deletion of amino acids 97-101 in the mature part of the enzyme Abstract: During an investigation into the substrate specificity and processing of subtilisin Carlsberg from Bacillus licheniformis, two major independent findings were made: (i) as has been shown previously, a stretch of five amino acids (residues 97-101 of the mature enzyme) that loops out into the binding cleft is involved in substrate binding by subtilisin Carlsberg. In order to see whether this loop element also determines substrate specificity, the coding region for these five amino acids was deleted from the cloned gene for subtilisin Carlsberg by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly the resulting mutant preproenzyme (P42c, Mr = 42 kDa) was not processed to the mature form (Mr = 30 kDa) and was not released into the medium by a protease-deficient B. subtilis host strain; rather, it accumulated in the cell membrane. This result demonstrates that the integrity of this loop element, which is very distant from the processing cleavage sites in the preproenzyme, is required for secretion of subtilisin Carlsberg. (ii) In culture supernatants from B. subtilis harbouring the cloned wild-type subtilisin Carlsberg gene the transient appearance (at 0-3 h after onset of stationary phase) of a processing intermediate (P38c, Mr = 38 kDa) of this protease could be demonstrated. P38c very probably represents a genuine proform of subtilisin Carlsberg.	0
Abstract2class: Intriguing properties of the angucycline antibiotic auricin and complex regulation of its biosynthesis Abstract: Streptomyces bacteria are major producers of bioactive natural products, including many antibiotics. We identified a gene cluster, aur1, in a large linear plasmid of Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239. The cluster is responsible for the production of a new angucycline polyketide antibiotic auricin. Several tailoring biosynthetic genes were scatted in rather distant aur1 flanking regions. Auricin was produced in a very narrow growth phase interval of several hours after entry into stationary phase, after which it was degraded to non-active metabolites because of its instability at the high pH values reached after the production stage. Strict transcriptional regulation of the auricin biosynthetic gene cluster has been demonstrated, including feed-forward and feedback control by auricin intermediates via several of the huge number of regulatory genes present in the aur1 cluster. The complex mechanism may ensure strict confinement of auricin production to a specific growth stage.	1
Abstract2class: Regulatory mutations affecting the gluconate system in Escherichia coli Abstract: A spontaneously arising regulatory mutant of the gluconate system in Escherichia coli was isolated. This mutant became constitutive, probably in one step, for gluconate high-affinity transport, gluconokinase, and gluconate-6-P dehydrase. The mutation involved (gntR18) is cotransducible with asd. Pseudorevertants, derived from a mutant (M2) that shows a long lag for growth on gluconate mineral medium, were also isolated and characterized. They give constitutive levels of gluconokinase and gluconate-6-P dehydrase but lack high-affinity transport function. Genetic experiments performed with one of these pseudorevertants (M4) indicate that it carries a secondary mutation in the gntR gene. The M4 phenotype is thus the result of the interaction of expression of a constitutive mutation (gntR4) with the mutation of strain M2 (gntM2).	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the nargenicin A1 pyrrole moiety from Nocardia sp. CS682 Abstract: A number of structurally diverse natural products harboring pyrrole moieties possess a wide range of biological activities. Studies on biosynthesis of pyrrole ring have shown that pyrrole moieties are derived from L-proline. Nargenicin A(1), a saturated alicyclic polyketide from Nocardia sp. CS682, is a pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester of nodusmicin. We cloned and identified a set of four genes from Nocardia sp. CS682 that show sequence similarity to the respective genes involved in the biosynthesis of the pyrrole moieties of pyoluteorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens, clorobiocin in Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. Oscitans, coumermycin A(1) in Streptomyces rishiriensis, one of the pyrrole rings of undecylprodigiosin in Streptomyces coelicolor, and leupyrrins in Sorangium cellulosum. These genes were designated as ngnN4, ngnN5, ngnN3, and ngnN2. In this study, we presented the evidences that the pyrrole moiety of nargenicin A(1) was also derived from L-proline by the coordinated action of three proteins, NgnN4 (proline adenyltransferase), NgnN5 (proline carrier protein), and NgnN3 (flavine-dependent acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenases). Biosynthesis of pyrrole moiety in nargenicin A(1) is initiated by NgnN4 that catalyzes ATP-dependent activation of L-proline into L-prolyl-AMP, and the latter is transferred to NgnN5 to create prolyl-S-peptidyl carrier protein (PCP). Later, NgnN3 catalyzes the two-step oxidation of prolyl-S-PCP into pyrrole-2-carboxylate. Thus, this study presents another example of a pyrrole moiety biosynthetic pathway that uses a set of three genes to convert L-proline into pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis of the ABCD and ABCDE ring systems of azaspiracid-1 Abstract: The efficient syntheses of the ABCD ring system of the originally proposed structure of azaspiracid-1 and the ABCDE ring system of the revised structure of azaspiracid-1 containing the correct stereochemistry at C(6), C(10), C(13), C(14), C(16), C(17), C(19), C(21), C(22), C(24) and C(25) have been achieved.	0
Abstract2class: Human protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is a type III enzyme forming ω-NG-monomethylated arginine residues Abstract: Full-length human protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli was initially found to generate only ω-N(G)-monomethylated arginine residues in small peptides, suggesting that it is a type III enzyme. A later study, however, characterized fusion proteins of PRMT7 expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as a type II/type I enzyme, capable of producing symmetrically dimethylated arginine (type II activity) as well as small amounts of asymmetric dimethylarginine (type I activity). We have sought to clarify the enzymatic activity of human PRMT7. We analyzed the in vitro methylation products of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PRMT7 fusion protein with robust activity using a variety of arginine-containing synthetic peptides and protein substrates, including a GST fusion with the N-terminal domain of fibrillarin (GST-GAR), myelin basic protein, and recombinant human histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Regardless of the methylation reaction conditions (incubation time, reaction volume, and substrate concentration), we found that PRMT7 only produces ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine with these substrates. In control experiments, we showed that mammalian GST-PRMT1 and Myc-PRMT5 were, unlike PRMT7, able to dimethylate both peptide P-SmD3 and SmB/D3 to give the expected asymmetric and symmetric products, respectively. These experiments show that PRMT7 is indeed a type III human methyltransferase capable of forming only ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine, not asymmetric ω-N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine or symmetric ω-N(G),N(G')-dimethylarginine, under the conditions tested.	0
Abstract2class: Cereulide synthesis in emetic Bacillus cereus is controlled by the transition state regulator AbrB, but not by the virulence regulator PlcR Abstract: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to the antibiotic valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that cereulide is produced non-ribosomally by the plasmid-encoded peptide synthetase Ces. Using deletion mutants of the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72, the influence of the well-known transcription factors PlcR, Spo0A and AbrB on cereulide production and on the transcription of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster was investigated. Our data demonstrate that cereulide synthesis is independent of the B. cereus specific virulence regulator PlcR but belongs to the Spo0A-AbrB regulon. Although cereulide production turned out to be independent of sporulation, it required the activity of the sporulation factor Spo0A. The sigma(A)-promoted transcription of spo0A was found to be crucial for cereulide production, while the sigma(H)-driven transcription of spo0A did not affect cereulide synthesis. Overexpression of the transition state factor AbrB in B. cereus F4810/72 resulted in a non-toxic phenotype. Moreover, AbrB was shown to bind efficiently to the main promoter region of the ces operon, indicating that AbrB acts as a repressor of cereulide production by negatively affecting ces transcription.	1
Abstract2class: The Biosynthesis of Capuramycin-type Antibiotics: IDENTIFICATION OF THE A-102395 BIOSYNTHETIC GENE CLUSTER, MECHANISM OF SELF-RESISTANCE, AND FORMATION OF URIDINE-5'-CARBOXAMIDE Abstract: A-500359s, A-503083s, and A-102395 are capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics that were discovered using a screen to identify inhibitors of bacterial translocase I, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Like the parent capuramycin, A-500359s and A-503083s consist of three structural components: a uridine-5'-carboxamide (CarU), a rare unsaturated hexuronic acid, and an aminocaprolactam, the last of which is substituted by an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide in A-102395. The biosynthetic gene clusters for A-500359s and A-503083s have been reported, and two genes encoding a putative non-heme Fe(II)-dependent α-ketoglutarate:UMP dioxygenase and an l-Thr:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase were uncovered, suggesting that C-C bond formation during assembly of the high carbon (C6) sugar backbone of CarU proceeds from the precursors UMP and l-Thr to form 5'-C-glycyluridine (C7) as a biosynthetic intermediate. Here, isotopic enrichment studies with the producer of A-503083s were used to indeed establish l-Thr as the direct source of the carboxamide of CarU. With this knowledge, the A-102395 gene cluster was subsequently cloned and characterized. A genetic system in the A-102395-producing strain was developed, permitting the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the dioxygenase (cpr19) and transaldolase (cpr25), which abolished the production of A-102395, thus confirming their role in biosynthesis. Heterologous production of recombinant Cpr19 and CapK, the transaldolase homolog involved in A-503083 biosynthesis, confirmed their expected function. Finally, a phosphotransferase (Cpr17) conferring self-resistance was functionally characterized. The results provide the opportunity to use comparative genomics along with in vivo and in vitro approaches to probe the biosynthetic mechanism of these intriguing structures.	1
Abstract2class: Production of hygromycin A analogs in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 through identification and manipulation of the biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Hygromycin A, an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388, offers a distinct carbon skeleton structure for development of antibacterial agents targeting the bacterial ribosomal peptidyl transferase. A 31.5 kb genomic DNA region covering the hygromycin A biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified, cloned, and sequenced. The hygromycin gene cluster has 29 ORFs which can be assigned to hygromycin A resistance as well as regulation and biosynthesis of the three key moieties of hygromycin A (5-dehydro-alpha-L-fucofuranose, (E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylacrylic acid, and 2L-2-amino-2-deoxy-4,5-O-methylene-neo-inositol. The predicted Hyg26 protein has sequence homology to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases and is assigned to the final step in production of the 5-dehydro-alpha-L-fucofuranose, catalyzing the reduction of alpha-L-fucofuranose. A hyg26 mutant strain was generated and shown to produce no hygromycin A but 5''-dihydrohygromycin A, 5''-dihydromethoxyhygromycin A, and a 5''-dihydrohygromycin A product lacking the aminocyclitol moiety. To the best of our knowledge, these shunt metabolites of biosynthetic pathway intermediates have not previously been identified. They provide insight into the ordering of the multiple unusual steps which compromise the convergent hygromycin A biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Sensitive detection of a novel class of toluene-degrading denitrifiers, Azoarcus tolulyticus, with small-subunit rRNA primers and probes Abstract: Azoarcus tolulyticus is a new class of widely distributed toluene-degrading denitrifiers of potential importance in remediating benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX)-contaminated environments. To detect these organisms in the environment, 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic probes were developed. Two sets of specific PCR amplification primers and two oligonucleotide hybridization probes were designed and tested against both closely and distantly related environmental isolates. All of these primers and probes were specific to the species A. tolulyticus. The sensitivity of the PCR amplification primer sets was evaluated with DNA isolated from A. tolulyticus Tol-4 pure culture and from sterile soils seeded with a known number of Tol-4 and Escherichia coli cells. These primer sets were able to detect 1 fg to 1 pg of template DNA from the pure culture and 1.11 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(8) Tol-4 cells per g of soil in the presence of 1.56 x 10(10) E. coli cells. These two PCR amplification primers were also successfully tested at two field sites. The primers identified the A. tolulyticus strains among the toluene-degrading bacteria isolated from a low-O2-high-NO(3)- aquifer at Moffett Field, Calif. Also, the presence of A. tolulyticus was detected in the groundwater samples from a BTEX-contaminated aquifer at an industrial site in Detroit, Mich., which showed anaerobic toluene degradation.	0
Abstract2class: Stable benzotriazole esters as mechanism-based inactivators of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CL protease Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic locus for streptolysin S production by group A streptococcus Abstract: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis. Streptolysin S (SLS) is the cytolytic factor that creates the zone of beta-hemolysis surrounding GAS colonies grown on blood agar. We recently reported the discovery of a potential genetic determinant involved in SLS production, sagA, encoding a small peptide of 53 amino acids (S. D. Betschel, S. M. Borgia, N. L. Barg, D. E. Low, and J. C. De Azavedo, Infect. Immun. 66:1671-1679, 1998). Using transposon mutagenesis, chromosomal walking steps, and data from the GAS genome sequencing project (www.genome.ou.edu/strep. html), we have now identified a contiguous nine-gene locus (sagA to sagI) involved in SLS production. The sag locus is conserved among GAS strains regardless of M protein type. Targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis of each gene in the sag operon resulted in an SLS-negative phenotype. Targeted integrations (i) upstream of the sagA promoter and (ii) downstream of a terminator sequence after sagI did not affect SLS production, establishing the functional boundaries of the operon. A rho-independent terminator sequence between sagA and sagB appears to regulate the amount of sagA transcript produced versus transcript for the entire operon. Reintroduction of the nine-gene sag locus on a plasmid vector restored SLS activity to the nonhemolytic sagA knockout mutant. Finally, heterologous expression of the intact sag operon conferred the SLS beta-hemolytic phenotype to the nonhemolytic Lactococcus lactis. We conclude that gene products of the GAS sag operon are both necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Sequence homologies of sag operon gene products suggest that SLS is related to the bacteriocin family of microbial toxins.	1
Abstract2class: Evolutionary formation of gene clusters by reorganization: the meleagrin/roquefortine paradigm in different fungi Abstract: The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in fungi is catalyzed by enzymes encoded by genes linked in clusters that are frequently co-regulated at the transcriptional level. Formation of gene clusters may take place by de novo assembly of genes recruited from other cellular functions, but also novel gene clusters are formed by reorganization of progenitor clusters and are distributed by horizontal gene transfer. This article reviews (i) the published information on the roquefortine/meleagrin/neoxaline gene clusters of Penicillium chrysogenum (Penicillium rubens) and the short roquefortine cluster of Penicillium roqueforti, and (ii) the correlation of the genes present in those clusters with the enzymes and metabolites derived from these pathways. The P. chrysogenum roq/mel cluster consists of seven genes and includes a gene (roqT) encoding a 12-TMS transporter protein of the MFS family. Interestingly, the orthologous P. roquefortine gene cluster has only four genes and the roqT gene is present as a residual pseudogene that encodes only small peptides. Two of the genes present in the central region of the P. chrysogenum roq/mel cluster have been lost during the evolutionary formation of the short cluster and the order of the structural genes in the cluster has been rearranged. The two lost genes encode a N1 atom hydroxylase (nox) and a roquefortine scaffold-reorganizing oxygenase (sro). As a consequence P. roqueforti has lost the ability to convert the roquefortine-type carbon skeleton to the glandicoline/meleagrin-type scaffold and is unable to produce glandicoline B, meleagrin and neoxaline. The loss of this genetic information is not recent and occurred probably millions of years ago when a progenitor Penicillium strain got adapted to life in a few rich habitats such as cheese, fermented cereal grains or silage. P. roqueforti may be considered as a "domesticated" variant of a progenitor common to contemporary P. chrysogenum and related Penicillia.	1
Abstract2class: The structure of manumycin. I. Characterization, structure elucidation and biological activity Abstract: Manumycin (1), produced by Streptomyces parvulus (strain Tü 64), was isolated from the mycelium by extraction with acetone and could easily be purified chromatographically. Chemical degradation of 1 (C31H38N2O7) gave 2-acetamino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (2) by acetolysis, 2,4,6-trimethyl-2,4-decadienoic acid (3) by alkaline hydrolysis, and 2-(2,4,6-trimethyl-2,4-decadienoylamino)-5,6-epoxy-1,4-benzoquinon e (5) by chromic acid oxidation. In connection with a detailed spectroscopic analysis, the structure of 1 could be elucidated and the (E)-configuration of the double bonds in the triene and diene chain was established. Manumycin exhibits biological activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi and furthermore, an inhibition of the developmental processes of some insects.	0
Abstract2class: A stereoselective vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase in bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: Halogenases catalyze reactions that introduce halogen atoms into electron-rich organic molecules. Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases are generally considered to be promiscuous halogenating enzymes that have thus far been derived exclusively from eukaryotes, where their cellular function is often disputed. We now report the first biochemical characterization of a bacterial vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase, NapH1 from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525, which catalyzes a highly stereoselective chlorination-cyclization reaction in napyradiomycin antibiotic biosynthesis. This finding biochemically links a vanadium chloroperoxidase to microbial natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Sesquiterpene synthase from the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster of the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea Abstract: The fungus Botrytis cinerea is the causal agent of the economically important gray mold disease that affects more than 200 ornamental and agriculturally important plant species. B. cinerea is a necrotrophic plant pathogen that secretes nonspecific phytotoxins, including the sesquiterpene botrydial and the polyketide botcinic acid. The region surrounding the previously characterized BcBOT1 gene has now been identified as the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster.Five genes including BcBOT1 and BcBOT2 were shown by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to be co-regulated through the calcineurin signaling pathway. Inactivation of the BcBOT2 gene, encoding a putative sesquiterpene cyclase, abolished botrydial biosynthesis, which could be restored by in trans complementation.Inactivation of BcBOT2 also resulted in overproduction of botcinic acid that was observed to be strain-dependent. Recombinant BcBOT2 protein converted farnesyl diphosphate to the parent sesquiterpene of the botrydial biosynthetic pathway, the tricyclic alcohol presilphiperfolan-8beta-ol.	1
Abstract2class: Indexing the Pseudomonas specialized metabolome enabled the discovery of poaeamide B and the bananamides Abstract: Pseudomonads are cosmopolitan microorganisms able to produce a wide array of specialized metabolites. These molecules allow Pseudomonas to scavenge nutrients, sense population density and enhance or inhibit growth of competing microorganisms. However, these valuable metabolites are typically characterized one-molecule-one-microbe at a time, instead of being inventoried in large numbers. To index and map the diversity of molecules detected from these organisms, 260 strains of ecologically diverse origins were subjected to mass-spectrometry-based molecular networking. Molecular networking not only enables dereplication of molecules, but also sheds light on their structural relationships. Moreover, it accelerates the discovery of new molecules. Here, by indexing the Pseudomonas specialized metabolome, we report the molecular-networking-based discovery of four molecules and their evolutionary relationships: a poaeamide analogue and a molecular subfamily of cyclic lipopeptides, bananamides 1, 2 and 3. Analysis of their biosynthetic gene cluster shows that it constitutes a distinct evolutionary branch of the Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides. Through analysis of an additional 370 extracts of wheat-associated Pseudomonas, we demonstrate how the detailed knowledge from our reference index can be efficiently propagated to annotate complex metabolomic data from other studies, akin to the way in which newly generated genomic information can be compared to data from public databases.	1
Abstract2class: Nonribosomal biosynthesis of vancomycin-type antibiotics: a heptapeptide backbone and eight peptide synthetase modules Abstract: During analysis of the recently identified gene cluster for the glycopeptide antibiotic balhimycin, produced by Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM 5908, novel genes were identified and characterized in detail. The gene products of four of the identified genes (bpsA, bpsB, bpsC and bpsD) are nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs); one (Orf1-protein) shows similarities to small proteins associated with several NRPSs without an assigned function. BpsA and BpsB are composed of three modules each (modules 1-6), BpsC of one module (module 7) and BpsD of a minimal module (module 8). Thus, the balhimycin gene cluster encodes eight modules, whereas its biosynthetic product is a heptapeptide. Non-producing mutants were created by a gene disruption of bpsB, an in-frame deletion of bpsC and a gene replacement of bpsD. After establishment of a gene complementation system for Amycolatopsis strains, the replacement mutant of bpsD was complemented, demonstrating for the first time that BpsD, encoding the eighth module, is indeed involved in balhimycin biosynthesis. After feeding with beta-hydroxytyrosine the capability of the bpsD mutant to produce balhimycin was restored, demonstrating the participation of BpsD in the biosynthesis of this amino acid. The specificity of four of the eight adenylation domains was determined by ATP/PP(i) exchange assays: modules 4 and 5 activated L-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, module 6 activated beta-hydroxytyrosine and module 7 activated L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, which is in accordance with the sequence of the non-proteogenic amino acids 4 to 7 of the balhimycin backbone.	1
Abstract2class: High-throughput imaging assay of multiple proteins via target-induced DNA assembly and cleavage Abstract: This work integrates target-induced DNA assembly and cleavage on a DNA chip to design a versatile imaging strategy as an assay for multiple proteins. The DNA assembly is achieved via immunological recognition to trigger the proximity hybridization for releasing a DNA sequence, which then hybridizes with FITC-DNA1 immobilized on the chip to induce the enzymatic cleavage of DNA1 and thus decrease the signals. The signal readout is performed with both fluorescent imaging of the left FITC and chemiluminescent (CL) imaging, by adding peroxidase labelled anti-FITC in assembly solution and CL substrates to produce CL emission. This one-step incubation can be completed in 30 min. The imaging method shows wide detection ranges and detection limits down to pg mL-1 for the simultaneous detection of 4 protein biomarkers. This high-throughput strategy with good practicability can be easily extended to other protein analytes, providing a powerful protocol for protein analysis and clinical diagnosis.	0
Abstract2class: Transposition in Lactobacillus sake and its abolition of lactocin S production by insertion of IS1163, a new member of the IS3 family Abstract: This report presents the nucleotide sequence and insertional activity of IS1163, which is a new member of the IS3 family of transposable elements. Analysis of spontaneous mutants of the lactocin S-producing Lactobacillus sake strain L45 show that the bacteriocin-negative phenotype is due to either loss of the producer plasmid or the insertion of IS1163 into the lactocin S operon (las operon). The data further show that insertional inactivation of the lactocin S operon is the result of a transposition event involving a chromosomally located donor copy of IS1163. Although the insertions described are clustered within a 250-bp region of the las operon, there are no features of the insertion sites to suggest target-specific insertion of IS1163. The overlapping, frameshifted organization of the two major open reading frames found in IS1163 is typical for the IS3 family, but the structure of the putative frameshift region includes features which distinguish IS1163 from the other members of the group. The insertional activity of IS1163 in L. sake L45 has aided in identifying regions of pCIM1 essential for lactocin S production and may have further practical applications as a mutational tool in L. sake.	1
Abstract2class: Protein kinase C catalyzes phosphorylation of guanylate cyclase in vitro Abstract: Protein kinase C catalyzes phosphorylation of purified rat brain guanylate cyclase. The phosphorylation is marked by concomitant increase in guanylate cyclase activity. TPA further enhances both phosphorylation and activity of guanylate cyclase. Data seem to provide clues to the molecular mechanism of one of the transformation-like responses mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, i.e. the elevation of cyclic GMP. It is envisaged that protein kinase C may have a central role in the understanding of molecular events triggering carcinogenesis.	0
Abstract2class: The gene cluster for spectinomycin biosynthesis and the aminoglycoside-resistance function of spcM in Streptomyces spectabilis Abstract: The gene cluster for spectinomycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces spectabilis was analyzed completely and registered under the accession number EU255259 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Based on sequence analysis, spcM of the S. spectabilis cluster is the only methyltransferase candidate required for methylation in spectinomycin biosynthesis. It has high similarity with the conserved domain of DNA methylase, which contains both N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases and N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases. Nucleotide methylation can provide antibiotic resistance, such as 16S rRNA methyltransferase, to Enterobacteriaceae. We therefore tested a hypothesis that SpcM offers aminoglycoside resistance to bacteria. The heterologous expression of spcM in Escherichia coli and S. lividans enhanced resistance against spectinomycin and its relative aminoglycoside antibiotics. We therefore propose that one of the functions of SpcM may be conferring aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance to cells.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and Characterization of the Sulfazecin Monobactam Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: The monobactams, exemplified by the natural product sulfazecin, are the only class of β-lactam antibiotics not inactivated by metallo-β-lactamases, which confer bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance. We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the β-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and β-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic β-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: TrpE feedback mutants reveal roadblocks and conduits toward increasing secondary metabolism in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Small peptides formed from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are bioactive molecules produced by many fungi including the genus Aspergillus. A subset of NRPS utilizes tryptophan and its precursor, the non-proteinogenic amino acid anthranilate, in synthesis of various metabolites such as Aspergillus fumigatus fumiquinazolines (Fqs) produced by the fmq gene cluster. The A. fumigatus genome contains two putative anthranilate synthases - a key enzyme in conversion of anthranilic acid to tryptophan - one beside the fmq cluster and one in a region of co-linearity with other Aspergillus spp. Only the gene found in the co-linear region, trpE, was involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. We found that site-specific mutations of the TrpE feedback domain resulted in significantly increased production of anthranilate, tryptophan, p-aminobenzoate and fumiquinazolines FqF and FqC. Supplementation with tryptophan restored metabolism to near wild type levels in the feedback mutants and suggested that synthesis of the tryptophan degradation product kynurenine could negatively impact Fq synthesis. The second putative anthranilate synthase gene next to the fmq cluster was termed icsA for its considerable identity to isochorismate synthases in bacteria. Although icsA had no impact on A. fumigatus Fq production, deletion and over-expression of icsA increased and decreased respectively aromatic amino acid levels suggesting that IcsA can draw from the cellular chorismate pool.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the Aminosugar Biosynthetic and Regulatory Genes of Vicenistatin in Monodonata labio-Associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010 Abstract: Vicenistatin (1) is a potent polyketide antitumor antibiotic composed of a 20-membered macrolactam core appended to a unique aminosugar, vicenisamine. In this study, vicenistatin was isolated and its biosynthetic gene cluster identified from Monodonata labio-associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010. A set of five genes, vicC, vicD, vicE, vicF, and vicG, was confirmed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the aminosugar by gene inactivations. VicG was characterized as an N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of the 4'-amino group in the last step of the aminosugar biosynthetic pathway; the N-demethyl intermediate 4'-N-demethylvicenistatin (2) was isolated from the ΔvicG mutant strain. In addition, vicR1 was characterized as a positive pathway-specific regulatory gene. Notably, N-demethyl compound 2 was found to exert impressive antibacterial activities, with MIC values spanning 0.06-4 μg/mL, against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Helicobacter pylori, and mycobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Compound 2 was also found to display reduced cytotoxicities relative to vicenistatin, especially against noncancerous human cell lines.	1
Abstract2class: Bacterial communities in different sections of a municipal wastewater treatment plant revealed by 16S rDNA 454 pyrosequencing Abstract: In this study, we successfully demonstrated that 454 pyrosequencing was a powerful approach for investigating the bacterial communities in the activated sludge, digestion sludge, influent, and effluent samples of a full scale wastewater treatment plant treating saline sewage. For each sample, 18,808 effective sequences were selected and utilized to do the bacterial diversity and abundance analysis. In total, 2,455, 794, 1,667, and 1,932 operational taxonomic units were obtained at 3 % distance cutoff in the activated sludge, digestion sludge, influent, and effluent samples, respectively. The corresponding most dominant classes in the four samples are Alphaproteobacteria, Thermotogae, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. About 67 % sequences in the digestion sludge sample were found to be affiliated with the Thermotogales order. Also, these sequences were assigned into a recently proposed genus Kosmotoga by the Ribosomal Database Project classifier. In the effluent sample, we found high abundance of Mycobacterium and Vibrio, which are genera containing pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, in this study, we proposed a method to differentiate the "gene percentage" and "cell percentage" by using Ribosomal RNA Operon Copy Number Database.	0
Abstract2class: A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spore formers and other misplaced clostridia Abstract: The class Clostridia in the phylum Firmicutes (formerly low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria) includes diverse bacteria of medical, environmental and biotechnological importance. The Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa branch, which unifies members of the Firmicutes with Gram-negative-type cell envelopes, was recently moved from Clostridia to a separate class Negativicutes. However, draft genome sequences of the spore-forming members of the Negativicutes revealed typically clostridial sets of sporulation genes. To address this and other questions in clostridial phylogeny, we have compared a phylogenetic tree for a concatenated set of 50 widespread ribosomal proteins with the trees for beta subunits of the RNA polymerase (RpoB) and DNA gyrase (GyrB) and with the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny. The results obtained by these methods showed remarkable consistency, suggesting that they reflect the true evolutionary history of these bacteria. These data put the Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa group back within the Clostridia. They also support placement of Clostridium difficile and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae; we suggest resolving the long-standing naming conundrum by renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile. These data also indicate the existence of a group of cellulolytic clostridia that belong to the family Ruminococcaceae. As a tentative solution to resolve the current taxonomical problems, we propose assigning 78 validly described Clostridium species that clearly fall outside the family Clostridiaceae to six new genera: Peptoclostridium, Lachnoclostridium, Ruminiclostridium, Erysipelatoclostridium, Gottschalkia and Tyzzerella. This work reaffirms that 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein sequences are better indicators of evolutionary proximity than phenotypic traits, even such key ones as the structure of the cell envelope and Gram-staining pattern.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and functional characterization of NifA variants that are independent of GlnB activation in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum Abstract: The activity of NifA, the transcriptional activator of the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene, is tightly regulated in response to ammonium and oxygen. However, the mechanisms for the regulation of NifA activity are quite different among various nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Unlike the well-studied NifL-NifA regulatory systems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Azotobacter vinelandii, in Rhodospirillum rubrum NifA is activated by a direct protein-protein interaction with the uridylylated form of GlnB, which in turn causes a conformational change in NifA. We report the identification of several substitutions in the N-terminal GAF domain of R. rubrum NifA that allow NifA to be activated in the absence of GlnB. Presumably these substitutions cause conformational changes in NifA necessary for activation, without interaction with GlnB. We also found that wild-type NifA can be activated in a GlnB-independent manner under certain growth conditions, suggesting that some other effector(s) can also activate NifA. An attempt to use Tn5 mutagenesis to obtain mutants that altered the pool of these presumptive effector(s) failed, though much rarer spontaneous mutations in nifA were detected. This suggests that the necessary alteration of the pool of effector(s) for NifA activation cannot be obtained by knockout mutations.	0
Abstract2class: Lif, the lysostaphin immunity factor, complements FemB in staphylococcal peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge formation Abstract: The formation of the Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan pentaglycine interpeptide chain needs FemA and FemB for the incorporation of glycines Gly2-Gly3, and Gly4-Gly5, respectively. The lysostaphin immunity factor Lif was able to complement FemB, as could be shown by serine incorporation and by an increase in lysostaphin resistance in the wild-type as well as in a femB mutant. However, Lif could not substitute for FemA in femA or in femAB-null mutants. Methicillin resistance, which is dependent on functional FemA and FemB, was not complemented by Lif, suggesting that serine-substituted side chains are a lesser substrate for penicillin-binding protein PBP2' in methicillin resistance.	0
Abstract2class: Synthetic inositol phosphate analogs reveal that PPIP5K2 has a surface-mounted substrate capture site that is a target for drug discovery Abstract: Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 2 (PPIP5K2) is one of the mammalian PPIP5K isoforms responsible for synthesis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (inositol pyrophosphates; PP-InsPs), regulatory molecules that function at the interface of cell signaling and organismic homeostasis. The development of drugs that inhibit PPIP5K2 could have both experimental and therapeutic applications. Here, we describe a synthetic strategy for producing naturally occurring 5-PP-InsP4, as well as several inositol polyphosphate analogs, and we study their interactions with PPIP5K2 using biochemical and structural approaches. These experiments uncover an additional ligand-binding site on the surface of PPIP5K2, adjacent to the catalytic pocket. This site facilitates substrate capture from the bulk phase, prior to transfer into the catalytic pocket. In addition to demonstrating a "catch-and-pass" reaction mechanism in a small molecule kinase, we demonstrate that binding of our analogs to the substrate capture site inhibits PPIP5K2. This work suggests that the substrate-binding site offers new opportunities for targeted drug design.	0
Abstract2class: Expression analysis of the colibactin gene cluster coding for a novel polyketide in Escherichia coli Abstract: The recently described hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin, found in various Escherichia coli strains, invokes a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells upon cocultivation with these bacteria. However, not much is known so far about the transcriptional organization of the colibactin genes (clb) or the regulation of their transcription. Here, the operon structure of the colibactin gene cluster of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 was investigated by means of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and seven transcripts were found of which four are transcribed polycistronically. The polycistrons comprise the genes clbC to clbG, clbI to clbN, clbO to clbP, and clbR to clbA and span 6.3, 23.3, 3.9, and 0.9 kb, respectively. Furthermore, transcript levels for different cultivation conditions were determined by RT-PCR of the whole cluster as well as by luciferase reporter gene assays of the genes clbA, clbB, clbQ, and clbR. RT-PCR revealed an overall increased transcription in shaking cultures as well as of the genes clbA to clbH in general. Luciferase reporter gene fusions indicated an influence of the carbon source on clb gene expression.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster that encodes the bisindolylmaleimide methylarcyriarubin Abstract: Bisindolylmaleimides represent a naturally occurring class of metabolites that are of interest because of their protein kinase inhibition activity. From a metagenomic library constructed with soil DNA, we identified the four gene mar cluster, a bisindolylmaleimide gene cluster that encodes for methylarcyriarubin (1) production. Heterologous expression of the mar gene cluster in E. coli revealed that the Rieske dioxygenase MarC facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of a chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) intermediate to yield the bisindolylmaleimide core. The characterization of the mar cluster defines a new role for CPA in the biosynthesis of structurally diverse bacterial tryptophan dimers.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of saponins detoxification genes in Ilyonectria mors-panacis G3B inducing root rot of Panax notoginseng by RNA-Seq Abstract: Saponins are kinds of antifungal compounds produced by Panax notoginseng to resist invasion by pathogens. Ilyonectria mors-panacis G3B was the dominant pathogen inducing root rot of P. notoginseng, and the abilities to detoxify saponins were the key to infect P. notoginseng successfully. To research the molecular mechanisms of detoxifying saponins in I. mors-panacis G3B, we used high-throughput RNA-Seq to identify 557 and 1519 differential expression genes (DEGs) in I. mors-panacis G3B with saponins treatments for 4H (Hours) and 12H (Hours) compared with no saponins treatments, respectively. Among these DEGs, we found 93 genes which were simultaneously highly expressed in I. mors-panacis G3B with saponins treatments for 4H and 12H, they mainly belong to genes encoding transporters, glycoside hydrolases, oxidation-reduction enzymes, transcription factors and so on. In addition, there were 21 putative PHI (Pathogen-Host Interaction) genes out of those 93 up-regulated genes. In this report, we analyzed virulence-associated genes in I. mors-panacis G3B which may be related to detoxifying saponins to infect P. notoginseng successfully. They provided an excellent starting point for in-depth study on pathogenicity of I. mors-panacis G3B and developed appropriate root rot disease management strategies in the future.	0
Abstract2class: Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide transport to the outer membrane in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by peptidomimetic antibiotics Abstract: The asymmetric outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet and phospholipid in the inner leaflet. During OM biogenesis, LPS is transported from the periplasm into the outer leaflet by a complex comprising the OM proteins LptD and LptE. Recently, a new family of macrocyclic peptidomimetic antibiotics that interact with LptD of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was discovered. Here we provide evidence that the peptidomimetics inhibit the LPS transport function of LptD. One approach to monitor LPS transport involved studies of lipid A modifications. Some modifications occur only in the inner membrane while others occur only in the OM, and thus provide markers for LPS transport within the bacterial envelope. We prepared a conditional lptD mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 that allowed control of lptD expression from the rhamnose promoter. With this mutant, the effects caused by the antibiotic on the wild-type strain were compared with those caused by depleting LptD in the mutant strain. When LptD was depleted in the mutant, electron microscopy revealed accumulation of membrane-like material within cells and OM blebbing; this mirrored similar effects in the wild-type strain caused by the antibiotic. Moreover, the bacterium responded to the antibiotic, and to depletion of LptD, by introducing the same lipid A modifications, consistent with inhibition by the antibiotic of LptD-mediated LPS transport. This conclusion was further supported by monitoring the radiolabelling of LPS from [¹⁴C]acetate, and by fractionation of IM and OM components. Overall, the results provide support for a mechanism of action for the peptidomimetic antibiotics that involves inhibition of LPS transport to the cell surface.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Himeic Acid A: A Ubiquitin-Activating Enzyme (E1) Inhibitor in Aspergillus japonicus MF275 Abstract: Himeic acid A, which is produced by the marine fungus Aspergillus japonicus MF275, is a specific inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To elucidate the mechanism of himeic acid biosynthesis, feeding experiments with labeled precursors have been performed. The long fatty acyl side chain attached to the pyrone ring is of polyketide origin, whereas the amide substituent is derived from leucine. These results suggest that a polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase (PKS-NRPS) is involved in himeic acid biosynthesis. A candidate gene cluster was selected from the results of genome sequencing analysis. Disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation confirms that HimA PKS-NRPS is involved in himeic acid biosynthesis. Thus, the him biosynthetic gene cluster for himeic acid in A. japonicus MF275 has been identified.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Chlorinated Lactylates in Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249 Abstract: Lactylates are an important group of molecules in the food and cosmetic industries. A series of natural halogenated 1-lactylates, chlorosphaerolactylates (1-4), were recently reported from Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249. Here, we identify the cly biosynthetic gene cluster, containing all the necessary functionalities for the biosynthesis of the natural lactylates, based on in silico analyses. Using a combination of stable isotope incorporation experiments and bioinformatic analysis, we propose that dodecanoic acid and pyruvate are the key building blocks in the biosynthesis of 1-4. We additionally report minor analogues of these molecules with varying alkyl chains. This work paves the way to accessing industrially relevant lactylates through pathway engineering.	1
Abstract2class: The biological buffer bicarbonate/CO2 potentiates H2O2-mediated inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide is a cell signaling agent that inactivates protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) via oxidation of their catalytic cysteine residue. PTPs are inactivated rapidly during H(2)O(2)-mediated cellular signal transduction processes, but, paradoxically, hydrogen peroxide is a rather sluggish PTP inactivator in vitro. Here we present evidence that the biological buffer bicarbonate/CO(2) potentiates the ability of H(2)O(2) to inactivate PTPs. The results of biochemical experiments and high-resolution crystallographic analysis are consistent with a mechanism involving oxidation of the catalytic cysteine residue by peroxymonocarbonate generated via the reaction of H(2)O(2) with HCO(3)(-)/CO(2).	0
Abstract2class: Solution NMR approaches for establishing specificity of weak heterodimerization of membrane proteins Abstract: Solution NMR provides a powerful approach for detecting complex formation involving weak to moderate intermolecular affinity. However, solution NMR has only rarely been used to detect complex formation between two membrane proteins in model membranes. The impact of specific binding on the NMR spectrum of a membrane protein can be difficult to distinguish from spectral changes that are induced by nonspecific binding and/or by changes that arise from forced cohabitation of the two proteins in a single model membrane assembly. This is particularly the case when solubility limits make it impossible to complete a titration to the point of near saturation of complex formation. In this work experiments are presented that provide the basis for establishing whether specific complex formation occurs between two membrane proteins under conditions where binding is not of high avidity. Application of these methods led to the conclusion that the membrane protein CD147 (also known as EMMPRIN or basigin) forms a specific heterodimeric complex in the membrane with the 99-residue transmembrane C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (C99 or APP-βCTF), the latter being the immediate precursor of the amyloid-β polypeptides that are closely linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of a Cell-Active SuTEx Ligand of Prostaglandin Reductase 2 Abstract: Sulfonyl-triazoles have emerged as a new reactive group for covalent modification of tyrosine sites on proteins through sulfur-triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry. The extent to which this sulfur electrophile can be tuned for developing ligands with cellular activity remains largely underexplored. Here, we performed fragment-based ligand discovery in live cells to identify SuTEx compounds capable of liganding tyrosine sites on diverse protein targets. We verified our quantitative chemical proteomic findings by demonstrating concentration-dependent activity of SuTEx ligands, but not inactive counterparts, against recombinant protein targets directly in live cells. Our structure-activity relationship studies identified the SuTEx ligand HHS-0701 as a cell-active inhibitor capable of blocking prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) biochemical activity.	0
Abstract2class: Non-enzymatic pyridine ring formation in the biosynthesis of the rubrolone tropolone alkaloids Abstract: The pyridine ring is a potent pharmacophore in alkaloid natural products. Nonetheless, its biosynthetic pathways are poorly understood. Rubrolones A and B are tropolone alkaloid natural products possessing a unique tetra-substituted pyridine moiety. Here, we report the gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic pathway for rubrolones, identifying a key intermediate that accumulates upon inactivation of sugar biosynthetic genes. Critically, this intermediate was converted to the aglycones of rubrolones by non-enzymatic condensation and cyclization with either ammonia or anthranilic acid to generate the respective pyridine rings. We propose that this non-enzymatic reaction occurs via hydrolysis of the key intermediate, which possesses a 1,5-dione moiety as an amine acceptor capable of cyclization. This study suggests that 1,5-dione moieties may represent a general strategy for pyridine ring biosynthesis, and more broadly highlights the utility of non-enzymatic diversification for exploring and expanding natural product chemical space.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic analysis of biosurfactant production in Ustilago maydis Abstract: The dimorphic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis produces large amounts of surface-active compounds under conditions of nitrogen starvation. These biosurfactants consist of derivatives of two classes of amphipathic glycolipids. Ustilagic acids are cellobiose lipids in which the disaccharide is O-glycosidically linked to 15,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid. Ustilipids are mannosylerythritol lipids derived from acylated beta-d-mannopyranosyl-d-erythritol. Whereas the chemical structure of these biosurfactants has been determined, the genetic basis for their biosynthesis and regulation is largely unknown. Here we report the first identification of two genes, emt1 and cyp1, that are essential for the production of fungal extracellular glycolipids. emt1 is required for mannosylerythritol lipid production and codes for a protein with similarity to prokaryotic glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of macrolide antibiotics. We suggest that Emt1 catalyzes the synthesis of mannosyl-d-erythritol by transfer of GDP-mannose. Deletion of the gene cyp1 resulted in complete loss of ustilagic acid production. Cyp1 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase which is highly related to a family of plant fatty acid hydroxylases. Therefore we assume that Cyp1 is directly involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual 15,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid. We could show that mannosylerythritol lipid production is responsible for hemolytic activity on blood agar, whereas ustilagic acid secretion is required for long-range pheromone recognition. The mutants described here allow for the first time a genetic analysis of glycolipid production in fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of a bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing the 3-nitration of tyrosine in rufomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Rufomycin is a circular heptapeptide with anti-mycobacterial activity and is produced by Streptomyces atratus ATCC 14046. Its structure contains three non-proteinogenic amino acids, N-dimethylallyltryptophan, trans-2-crotylglycine, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NTyr). Although the rufomycin structure was already reported in the 1960s, its biosynthesis, including 3NTyr generation, remains unclear. To elucidate the rufomycin biosynthetic pathway, we assembled a draft genome sequence of S. atratus and identified the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ruf cluster), consisting of 20 ORFs (rufA-rufT). We found a putative heptamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by rufT, a putative tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase encoded by rufP, and a putative trimodular type I polyketide synthase encoded by rufEF Moreover, the ruf cluster contains an apparent operon harboring putative cytochrome P450 (rufO) and nitric oxide synthase (rufN) genes. A similar operon, txtDE, is responsible for the formation of 4-nitrotryptophan in thaxtomin biosynthesis; the cytochrome P450 TxtE catalyzes the 4-nitration of Trp. Therefore, we hypothesized that RufO should catalyze the Tyr 3-nitration. Disruption of rufO abolished rufomycin production by S. atratus, which was restored when 3NTyr was added to the culture medium of the disruptant. Recombinant RufO protein exhibited Tyr 3-nitration activity both in vitro and in vivo Spectroscopic analysis further revealed that RufO recognizes Tyr as the substrate with a dissociation constant of ∼0.1 μm These results indicate that RufO is an unprecedented cytochrome P450 that catalyzes Tyr nitration. Taken together with the results of an in silico analysis of the ruf cluster, we propose a rufomycin biosynthetic pathway in S. atratus.	1
Abstract2class: Structure of ribosome-bound azole-modified peptide phazolicin rationalizes its species-specific mode of bacterial translation inhibition Abstract: Ribosome-synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent a rapidly expanding class of natural products with various biological activities. Linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs) comprise a subclass of RiPPs that display outstanding diversity of mechanisms of action while sharing common structural features. Here, we report the discovery of a new LAP biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of Rhizobium Pop5, which encodes the precursor peptide and modification machinery of phazolicin (PHZ) - an extensively modified peptide exhibiting narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity against some symbiotic bacteria of leguminous plants. The cryo-EM structure of the Escherichia coli 70S-PHZ complex reveals that the drug interacts with the 23S rRNA and uL4/uL22 proteins and obstructs ribosomal exit tunnel in a way that is distinct from other compounds. We show that the uL4 loop sequence determines the species-specificity of antibiotic action. PHZ expands the known diversity of LAPs and may be used in the future as biocontrol agent for agricultural needs.	1
Abstract2class: Phosphorylated AbsA2 negatively regulates antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor through interactions with pathway-specific regulatory gene promoters Abstract: The AbsA two-component signal transduction system, comprised of the sensor kinase AbsA1 and the response regulator AbsA2, acts as a negative regulator of antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor, for which the phosphorylated form of AbsA2 (AbsA2 approximately P) is the agent of repression. In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that AbsA2 binds the promoter regions of actII-ORF4, cdaR, and redZ, which encode pathway-specific activators for actinorhodin, calcium-dependent antibiotic, and undecylprodigiosin, respectively. We confirm that these interactions also occur in vitro and that the binding of AbsA2 to each gene is enhanced by phosphorylation. Induced expression of actII-ORF4 and redZ in the hyperrepressive absA1 mutant (C542) brought about pathway-specific restoration of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin production, respectively. Our results suggest that AbsA2 approximately P interacts with as many as four sites in the region that includes the actII-ORF4 promoter. These data suggest that AbsA2 approximately P inhibits antibiotic production by directly interfering with the expression of pathway-specific regulators of antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: Membrane localization of the HflA regulatory protease of Escherichia coli by immunoelectron microscopy Abstract: The hflA locus of Escherichia coli specifies a multisubunit protease that selectively degrades the cII transcriptional activator of phage lambda. The regulated turnover of cII is critical for the choice between the lytic and lysogenic pathways of viral development. Previous cell fractionation work has indicated that HflA is associated with the inner membrane fraction. We have sought to demonstrate that the HflA protease is localized in the cell membrane of intact cells. To achieve this goal, we have combined electron microscopy of thin-sectioned E. coli cells with antibody tagging by a colloidal gold label. Using antibody to purified HflA protein, we have found preferential membrane labeling for hflA+ cells but not for hflA mutant cells. We conclude that HflA protease is localized in the cell membrane. The membrane location for HflA protein may serve as a component of a targeting mechanism to limit the action of the regulatory protease to selected cytoplasmic proteins.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the verruculogen prenyltransferase FtmPT3 by a combination of chemical, bioinformatic and biochemical approaches Abstract: Previous studies showed that verruculogen is the end product of a biosynthetic gene cluster for fumitremorgin-type alkaloids in Aspergillus fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri. In this study, we isolated fumitremorgin A from N. fischeri. This led to the identification of the responsible gene, ftmPT3, for O-prenylation of an aliphatic hydroxy group in verruculogen. This gene was found at a different location in the genome of N. fischeri than the identified cluster. The coding sequence of ftmPT3 was amplified by fusion PCR and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme product of the soluble His(8)-FtmPT3 with verruculogen and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) was identified unequivocally as fumitremorgin A by NMR and MS analyses. K(M) values of FtmPT3 were determined for verruculogen and DMAPP at 5.7 and 61.5 μM, respectively. Average turnover number (k(cat)) was calculated from kinetic parameters of verruculogen and DMAPP to be 0.069 s(-1). FtmPT3 also accepted biosynthetic precursors of fumitremorgin A, for example, fumitremorgin B and 12,13-dihydroxyfumitremorgin C, as substrates and catalyses their prenylation.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a new diterpene biosynthetic gene cluster that produces O-methylkolavelool in Herpetosiphon aurantiacus Abstract: Diterpenoids are usually found in plants and fungi, but are rare in bacteria. We have previously reported new diterpenes, named tuberculosinol and isotuberculosinol, which are generated from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene products Rv3377c and Rv3378c. No homologous gene was found at that time, but we recently found highly homologous proteins in the Herpetosiphon aurantiacus ATCC 23779 genome. Haur_2145 was a class II diterpene cyclase responsible for the conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate into kolavenyl diphosphate. Haur_2146, homologous to Rv3378c, synthesized (+)-kolavelool through the nucleophilic addition of a water molecule to the incipient cation formed after the diphosphate moiety was released. Haur_2147 afforded (+)-O-methylkolavelool from (+)-kolavelool, so this enzyme was an O-methyltransferase. This new diterpene was indeed detected in H. aurantiacus cells. This is the first report of the identification of a (+)-O-methylkolavelool biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Non-invasive and in situ characterization of the degradation of biomaterial scaffolds by volumetric photoacoustic microscopy Abstract: Degradation is among the most important properties of biomaterial scaffolds, which are indispensable for regenerative medicine. The currently used method relies on the measurement of mass loss across different samples and cannot track the degradation of an individual scaffold in situ. Here we report, for the first time, the use of multiscale photoacoustic microscopy to non-invasively monitor the degradation of an individual scaffold. We could observe alterations to the morphology and structure of a scaffold at high spatial resolution and deep penetration, and more significantly, quantify the degradation of an individual scaffold as a function of time, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the remodeling of vasculature inside a scaffold can be visualized simultaneously using a dual-wavelength scanning mode in a label-free manner. This optoacoustic method can be used to monitor the degradation of individual scaffolds, offering a new approach to non-invasively analyze and quantify biomaterial-tissue interactions in conjunction with the assessment of in vivo vascular parameters.	0
Abstract2class: Elucidation of DnaE as the Antibacterial Target of the Natural Product, Nargenicin Abstract: Resistance to existing classes of antibiotics drives the need for discovery of novel compounds with unique mechanisms of action. Nargenicin A1, a natural product with limited antibacterial spectrum, was rediscovered in a whole-cell antisense assay. Macromolecular labeling in both Staphylococcus aureus and an Escherichia coli tolC efflux mutant revealed selective inhibition of DNA replication not due to gyrase or topoisomerase IV inhibition. S. aureus nargenicin-resistant mutants were selected at a frequency of ∼1 × 10(-9), and whole-genome resequencing found a single base-pair change in the dnaE gene, a homolog of the E. coli holoenzyme α subunit. A DnaE single-enzyme assay was exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by nargenicin, and other in vitro characterization studies corroborated DnaE as the target. Medicinal chemistry efforts may expand the spectrum of this novel mechanism antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Designed Conformation and Fluorescence Properties of Self-Assembled Phenazine-Cored Platinum(II) Metallacycles Abstract: A series of platinum(II) metallacycles were prepared via the coordination-driven self-assembly of a phenazine-cored dipyridyl donor with a 90° Pt(II) acceptor and various dicarboxylate donors in a 1:1:2 ratio. While the metallacycles display similar absorption profiles, they exhibit a trend of blue-shifted fluorescence emission with the decrease in the bite angles between the carboxylate building blocks. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies as well as a computational approach were conducted, revealing that the difference in the degree of constraint imposed on the excited-state planarization of the phenazine core within these metallacycles results in their distinct photophysical behaviors. As such, a small initial difference in the dicarboxylate building blocks is amplified into distinct photophysical properties of the metallacycles, which is reminiscent of the efficient functional tuning observed in natural systems. In addition to the pre-assembly approach, the photophysical properties of a metallacycle can also be modulated using a post-assembly modification to the dicarboxylate building block, suggesting another strategy for functional tuning. This research illustrated the potential of coordination-driven self-assembly for the preparation of materials with precisely tailored functionalities at the molecular level.	0
Abstract2class: A hybrid non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase containing fatty-acyl ligase (FAAL) synthesizes the β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides puwainaphycins in the Cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum alatosporum Abstract: A putative operon encoding the biosynthetic pathway for the cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides puwainphycins was identified in Cylindrospermum alatosporum. Bioinformatics analysis enabled sequential prediction of puwainaphycin biosynthesis; this process is initiated by the activation of a fatty acid residue via fatty acyl-AMP ligase and continued by a multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase. High-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements proved the production of puwainaphycin F/G congeners differing in FA chain length formed by either 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl dodecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahdoa) or 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl tetradecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahtea). Because only one puwainaphycin operon was recovered in the genome, we suggest that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase and one of the amino acid adenylation domains (Asn/Gln) show extended substrate specificity. Our results provide the first insight into the biosynthesis of frequently occurring β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides in cyanobacteria, which may facilitate analytical assessment and development of monitoring tools for cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides.	1
Abstract2class: Multiplexing of combinatorial chemistry in antimycin biosynthesis: expansion of molecular diversity and utility Abstract: Diversity-oriented biosynthesis of a library of antimycin-like compounds (380 altogether) was accomplished by using multiplex combinatorial biosynthesis. The core strategy depends on the use of combinatorial chemistry at different biosynthetic stages. This approach is applicable for the diversification of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and the hybrids that share a similar biosynthetic logic.	1
Abstract2class: Purification and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide microcin N Abstract: Microcins are low-molecular-weight proteins secreted by certain bacteria that act by limiting the growth of other bacteria that share the same ecological niche. In the present work, the previous microcin 24 system was resequenced.We detected three nucleotide differences in the microcin-coding gene that partially change the amino acid sequence. According to the present microcin nomenclature, we renamed the five genes constituting this microcin system (mcnRINAB), which are arranged in an operon-like structure: mcnR codes for a putative histone-like nucleoid protein regulator; mcnI codes for the immunity protein; mcnN encodes microcin N; and mcnA and mcnB correspond to an ATP-binding cassette transporter system. Purified microcin N has a molecular weight of 7274.23 Da, as determined by MS. This peptide was stable up to 100°C, resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, and susceptible to degradation by proteinase K.	1
Abstract2class: Phenotypic and genetic characterization of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the tropics of Southeast Asia Abstract: Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem throughout the world. The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in hospital wastewater is a cause for great concern today. In this study, 276 Staph. aureus isolates were recovered from hospital wastewater samples in Malaysia. All of the isolates were screened for susceptibility to nine different classes of antibiotics: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and nalidixic acid. Screening tests showed that 100 % of Staph.aureus isolates exhibited resistance against kanamycin, vancomycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid. Additionally, 91, 87, 50, 43, 11 and 8.7 % of isolates showed resistance against erythromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline, respectively. Based on these results, 100 % of isolates demonstrated multidrug-resistant (MDR) characteristics, displaying resistance against more than three classes of antibiotics. Of 276 isolates, nine exhibited resistance to more than nine classes of tested antibiotics; these were selected for antibiotic susceptibility testing and examined for the presence of conserved ARGs. Interestingly, a high percentage of the selected MDR Staph.aureus isolates did not contain conserved ARGs. These results indicate that non-conserved MDR gene elements may have already spread into the environment in the tropics of Southeast Asia, and unique resistance mechanisms against several antibiotics may have evolved due to stable, moderate temperatures that support growth of bacteria throughout the year.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the tetrocarcin A gene cluster from Micromonospora chalcea NRRL 11289 reveals a highly conserved strategy for tetronate biosynthesis in spirotetronate antibiotics Abstract: Tetrocarcin A (TCA), produced by Micromonospora chalcea NRRL 11289, is a spirotetronate antibiotic with potent antitumor activity and versatile modes of action. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of TCA was cloned and localized to a 108-kb contiguous DNA region. In silico sequence analysis revealed 36 putative genes that constitute this cluster (including 11 for unusual sugar biosynthesis, 13 for aglycone formation, and 4 for glycosylations) and allowed us to propose the biosynthetic pathway of TCA. The formation of D-tetronitrose, L-amicetose, and L-digitoxose may begin with D-glucose-1-phosphate, share early enzymatic steps, and branch into different pathways by competitive actions of specific enzymes. Tetronolide biosynthesis involves the incorporation of a 3-C unit with a polyketide intermediate to form the characteristic spirotetronate moiety and trans-decalin system. Further substitution of tetronolide with five deoxysugars (one being a deoxynitrosugar) was likely due to the activities of four glycosyltransferases. In vitro characterization of the first enzymatic step by utilization of 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as the substrate and in vivo cross-complementation of the bifunctional fused gene tcaD3 (with the functions of chlD3 and chlD4) to Delta chlD3 and Delta chlD4 in chlorothricin biosynthesis supported the highly conserved tetronate biosynthetic strategy in the spirotetronate family. Deletion of a large DNA fragment encoding polyketide synthases resulted in a non-TCA-producing strain, providing a clear background for the identification of novel analogs. These findings provide insights into spirotetronate biosynthesis and demonstrate that combinatorial-biosynthesis methods can be applied to the TCA biosynthetic machinery to generate structural diversity.	1
Abstract2class: The transgenic expression of highly inhibitory monomeric forms of phospholamban in mouse heart impairs cardiac contractility Abstract: Transgenic mice were generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of the monomeric, dominant-acting, superinhibitory L37A and I40A mutant forms of phospholamban (PLN), and their phenotypes were compared with wild-type (wt) mice or 2-fold overexpressors of wt PLN (wtOE). The level of PLN monomer in cardiac microsomes was increased 11-13-fold, and the apparent affinity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase for Ca(2+) was decreased from pCa 6.22 in wt or 6.12 in wtOE to 5.81 in L37A and 5.72 in I40A. Basal physiological parameters, measured in isolated myocytes, indicated a significant reduction in the rates of shortening (+dL/dt) and relengthening (-dL/dt). Hemodynamic measurements indicated that peak systolic pressure was unaffected but that pressure changes (+dP/dt and -dP/dt) were lowered significantly in both mutant lines, and relaxation time (tau) was also lengthened significantly. Echocardiography for both mutants showed depressed systolic function and an increase in left ventricular mass of over 1.4-fold. Significant decreases in left ventricular shortening fraction and velocity of circumferential shortening and increases in ejection time were corrected by isoproterenol. The use of antibodies specific against Ser(16)- and Thr(17)-PLN peptides showed that phosphorylation of both pentameric and monomeric PLN were increased between 1.2- and 2.4-fold in both the L37A and I40A lines but not in the wtOE line. These observations show that overexpression of superinhibitory mutant forms of PLN causes depression of contractile parameters with induction of cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed with echocardiography.	0
Abstract2class: Th17 micro-milieu regulates NLRP1-dependent caspase-5 activity in skin autoinflammation Abstract: IL-1β is a potent player in cutaneous inflammation and central for the development of a Th17 micro-milieu in autoinflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Its production is controlled at the transcriptional level and by subsequent posttranslational processing via inflammatory caspases. In this study, we detected inflammatory caspase-5 active in epidermal keratinocytes and in psoriatic skin lesions. Further, interferon-γ and interleukin-17A synergistically induced caspase-5 expression in cultured keratinocytes, which was dependent on the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin (S100A7). However, diseases-relevant triggers for caspase-5 activity and IL-1β production remain unknown. Recently, extranuclear DNA has been identified as danger-signals abundant in the psoriatic epidermis. Here, we could demonstrate that cytosolic double-stranded (ds) DNA transfected into keratinocytes triggered the activation of caspase-5 and the release of IL-1β. Further, interleukin-17A promoted caspase-5 function via facilitation of the NLRP1-inflammasome. Anti-inflammatory vitamin D interfered with the IL-1β release and suppressed caspase-5 in keratinocytes and in psoriatic skin lesions. Our data link the disease-intrinsic danger signals psoriasin (S100A7) and dsDNA for NLPR1-dependent caspase-5 activity in psoriasis providing potential therapeutic targets in Th17-mediated skin autoinflammation.	0
Abstract2class: Organization and nucleotide sequences of two lactococcal bacteriocin operons Abstract: Two distinct regions of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 9B4 plasmid p9B4-6, each of which specified bacteriocin production as well as immunity, have been sequenced and analyzed by deletion and frameshift mutation analyses. On a 1.8-kb ScaI-ClaI fragment specifying low antagonistic activity, three open reading frames (ORFs) were present, which were organized in an operon. The first two ORFs, containing 69 and 77 codons, respectively, were involved in bacteriocin activity, whereas the third ORF, containing 154 codons, was essential for immunity. Primer extension analysis indicated the presence of a promoter upstream of the ORFs. Two ORFs were present on a 1.3-kb ScaI-HindII fragment specifying high antagonistic activity. The first ORF, containing 75 codons, specified bacteriocin activity. The second ORF, containing 98 codons, specified immunity. The nucleotide sequences of both fragments upstream of the first ORFs as well as the first 20 bp of the first ORF of both bacteriocin operons appeared to be identical.	1
Abstract2class: Bombyxamycins A and B, Cytotoxic Macrocyclic Lactams from an Intestinal Bacterium of the Silkworm Bombyx mori Abstract: Bombyxamycins A and B (1 and 2) were discovered from a silkworm gut Streptomyces bacterium. Spectroscopic analysis and multiple-step chemical derivatization identified them as 26-membered cyclic lactams with polyene features. Bombyxamycin A showed significant antibacterial and antiproliferative effects. The bombyxamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by genetic analysis. Gene deletion experiments confirmed that the cytochrome P450 BomK is responsible for the generation of 2, which unprecedentedly bears tetrahydrofuran in its macrocyclic ring.	1
Abstract2class: A labeling study to elucidate the biosynthesis of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one (raspberry ketone) by Nidula niveo-tomentosa Abstract: Submerged cells of the basidiomycete Nidula niveo-tomentosa, a microbial producer of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one, were supplemented with (13)C-labeled L-phenylalanines and with [1-(13)C]glucose. Labeled transformation products were detected by a novel method of analyzing stable isotope-labeled metabolites, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to an atomic emission detector, and by GC-mass spectrometry. A benzoate moiety was side chain elongated according to the poly-beta-keto scheme. The presence of an acetyl coenzyme A-carboxylase inhibitor shifted the spectrum of products to benzyl compounds. Hence, the fungal pathway differs from the one established for plant tissues.	0
Abstract2class: Two-dimensional, conductive niobium and molybdenum metal-organic frameworks Abstract: The incorporation of second-row transition metals into metal-organic frameworks could greatly improve the performance of these materials across a wide variety of applications due to the enhanced covalency, redox activity, and spin-orbit coupling of late-row metals relative to their first-row analogues. Thus far, however, the synthesis of such materials has been limited to a small number of metals and structural motifs. Here, we report the syntheses of the two-dimensional metal-organic framework materials (H2NMe2)2Nb2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Mo2(Cl2dhbq)3 (H2Cl2dhbq = 3,6-dichloro-2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone), which feature mononuclear niobium or molybdenum metal nodes and are formed through reactions driven by metal-to-ligand electron transfer. Characterization of these materials via X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests a local trigonal prismatic coordination geometry for both niobium and molybdenum, consistent with their increased covalency relative to related first-row transition metal compounds. A combination of vibrational spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, and electronic conductivity measurements reveal that these two frameworks possess distinct electronic structures. In particular, while the niobium compound displays evidence for redox-trapping and strong magnetic interactions, the molybdenum phase is valence-delocalized with evidence of large polaron formation. Weak interlayer interactions in the neutral molybdenum phase enable solvent-assisted exfoliation to yield few-layer hexagonal nanosheets. Together, these results represent the first syntheses of metal-organic frameworks containing mononuclear niobium and molybdenum nodes, establishing a route to frameworks incorporating a more diverse range of second- and third-row transition metals with increased covalency and the potential for improved charge transport and stronger magnetic coupling.	0
Abstract2class: A caged, destabilized, free radical intermediate in the q-cycle Abstract: The Rieske/cytochrome b complexes, also known as cytochrome bc complexes, catalyze a unique oxidant-induced reduction reaction at their quinol oxidase (Qo ) sites, in which substrate hydroquinone reduces two distinct electron transfer chains, one through a series of high-potential electron carriers, the second through low-potential cytochrome b. This reaction is a critical step in energy storage by the Q-cycle. The semiquinone intermediate in this reaction can reduce O2 to produce deleterious superoxide. It is yet unknown how the enzyme controls this reaction, though numerous models have been proposed. In previous work, we trapped a Q-cycle semiquinone anion intermediate, termed SQo , in bacterial cytochrome bc1 by rapid freeze-quenching. In this work, we apply pulsed-EPR techniques to determine the location and properties of SQo in the mitochondrial complex. In contrast to semiquinone intermediates in other enzymes, SQo is not thermodynamically stabilized, and can even be destabilized with respect to solution. It is trapped in Qo at a site that is distinct from previously described inhibitor-binding sites, yet sufficiently close to cytochrome bL to allow rapid electron transfer. The binding site and EPR analyses show that SQo is not stabilized by hydrogen bonds to proteins. The formation of SQo involves "stripping" of both substrate -OH protons during the initial oxidation step, as well as conformational changes of the semiquinone and Qo proteins. The resulting charged radical is kinetically trapped, rather than thermodynamically stabilized (as in most enzymatic semiquinone species), conserving redox energy to drive electron transfer to cytochrome bL while minimizing certain Q-cycle bypass reactions, including oxidation of prereduced cytochrome b and reduction of O2 .	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of mycobacteria isolated from seals Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) was diagnosed in 10 seals from three species (Arctocephalus australis, Arctocephalus tropicalis and Otaria flavescens) found in South America. The mycobacteria isolated from these cases belonged to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, as determined by RFLP using an IS6110 probe, spoligotyping, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and by PCR-restriction analysis of hsp65. Polymorphisms in gyrA, katG, oxyR and pncA were investigated in some of the isolates, as well as the presence of the MPB70 antigen. The insertion sequence IS6110 was present in three to seven copies in the genome of the mycobacteria isolated from seals. Using the IS6110 probe, six patterns (designated A, B, C, D, E and F) were identified from 10 different isolates. Patterns A and B were found for the mycobacteria isolated from two and four seals, respectively, indicating an epidemiological relationship between isolates grouped according to their IS6110 RFLP. The mycobacteria isolated from seals shared the majority of their IS6110 DNA-containing restriction fragments, and nine isolates had an identical spoligotype; only one isolate showed a minor difference in its spoligotype. In addition, none of these spoligotypes were found in other M. tuberculosis complex strains. These results suggest that the isolates from seals constitute a unique group of closely related strains. The mycobacteria isolated from seals showed polymorphisms at gyrA codon 95 and katG codon 463, as do group 1 M. tuberculosis, and M. bovis. Group 1 mycobacteria are associated with cluster cases. The spoligotypes found in the mycobacteria isolated from seals lack spacers 39-43, as does M. bovis, but the MPB70 antigen, which is highly expressed in M. bovis and minimally expressed in M. tuberculosis, was not detected in these mycobacteria. The mycobacteria isolated from seals also showed oxyR and pncA polymorphisms specific to M. tuberculosis. In conclusion, the mycobacteria that cause TB in seals in the South-Western Atlantic are a related group, and based on the combination of genetic characteristics, belong to a unique genotypic group within the M. tuberculosis complex.	0
Abstract2class: Lateral gene transfer of dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase revisited Abstract: In contrast to previous findings, we demonstrate that the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase genes (dsrAB) of Desulfobacula toluolica were vertically inherited. Furthermore, Desulfobacterium anilini and strain mXyS1 were identified, by dsrAB sequencing of 17 reference strains, as members of the donor lineage for those gram-positive Desulfotomaculum species which laterally acquired dsrAB.	0
Abstract2class: Macrolide resistance in microorganisms at antimicrobial-free Swine farms Abstract: To investigate the relationship between agricultural antimicrobial use and resistance, a variety of methods for quantification of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance were applied to organic swine farm manure samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to indirectly quantify the specific rRNA methylation resulting in MLS(B) resistance. Using this method, an unexpectedly high prevalence of ribosomal methylation and, hence, predicted MLS(B) resistance was observed in manure samples from two swine finisher farms that reported no antimicrobial use (37.6% +/- 6.3% and 40.5% +/- 5.4%, respectively). A culture-based method targeting relatively abundant clostridia showed a lower but still unexpectedly high prevalence of resistance at both farms (27.7% +/- 11.3% and 11.7% +/- 8.6%, respectively), while the prevalence of resistance in cultured fecal streptococci was low at both farms (4.0%). These differences in the prevalence of resistance across microorganisms suggest the need for caution when extrapolating from data obtained with indicator organisms. A third antimicrobial-free swine farm, a breeder-to-finisher operation, had low levels of MLS(B) resistance in manure samples with all methods used (<9%). Tetracycline antimicrobials were detected in manure samples from one of the finisher farms and may provide a partial explanation for the high level of MLS(B) resistance. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for a more fundamental understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial use and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.	0
Abstract2class: Analysis of coiled-coil interactions between core proteins of the spindle pole body Abstract: The spindle pole body (SPB) is a multiprotein complex that organizes microtubules in yeast. Due to its large size and association with the nuclear membrane, little is known about its detailed structure. In particular, although many SPB components and some of the interactions between them have been identified, the molecular details of how most of these interactions occur are not known. The prevalence of predicted coiled-coil regions in SPB proteins suggests that some interactions may occur via coiled coils. Here this hypothesis is supported by biochemical characterization of isolated coiled-coil peptides derived from SPB proteins. Formation of four strongly self-associating coiled-coil complexes from Spc29, Spc42, and Spc72 was demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Many weaker self- and heteroassociations were also detected by CD, FRET, and/or cross-linking. The thermal stabilities of nine candidate homooligomers were assessed; six unfolded cooperatively with melting temperatures ranging from <11 to >50 degrees C. Solution studies established that coiled-coil peptides derived from Spc42 and Spc72 form parallel dimers, and this was confirmed for Spc42 by a high-resolution crystal structure. These data contribute to a growing body of knowledge that will ultimately provide a detailed model of the SPB structure.	0
Abstract2class: Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from closely related Rhynchosporium species reveals extensive intron invasion Abstract: We sequenced and annotated the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of four closely related Rhynchosporium species that diverged ∼14,000-35,000years ago. During this time frame, three of the mt genomes expanded significantly due to an invasion of introns into three genes (cox1, cox2, and nad5). The enlarged mt genomes contained ∼40% introns compared to 8.1% in uninvaded relatives. Many intron gains were accompanied by co-conversion of flanking exonic regions. The comparative analysis revealed a highly variable set of non-intronic, free-standing ORFs of unknown function (uORFs). This is consistent with a rapidly evolving accessory compartment in the mt genome of these closely related species. Only one free-standing uORF was shared among all mt genomes analyzed. This uORF had a mutation rate similar to the core mt protein-encoding genes, suggesting conservation of function among the species. The nucleotide composition of the core protein-encoding genes significantly differed from those of introns and uORFs. The mt mutation rate was 77 times higher than the nuclear mutation rate, indicating that the phylogeny inferred from mt genes may better resolve the phylogenetic relationships among closely related Rhynchosporium species than phylogenies inferred from nuclear genes.	0
Abstract2class: Purification of mutacin III from group III Streptococcus mutans UA787 and genetic analyses of mutacin III biosynthesis genes Abstract: Previously, members of our group reported the isolation and characterization of mutacin II from Streptococcus mutans T8 and the genetic analyses of the mutacin II biosynthesis genes (J. Novak, P. W. Caufield, and E. J. Miller, J. Bacteriol. 176:4316-4320, 1994; F. Qi, P. Chen, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:652-658, 1999; P. Chen, F. Qi, J. Novak, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:1356-1360, 1999). In this study, we cloned and sequenced the mutacin III biosynthesis gene locus from a group III strain of S. mutans, UA787. DNA sequence analysis revealed eight open reading frames, which we designated mutR, -A, -A', -B, -C, -D, -P, and -T. MutR bears strong homology with MutR of mutacin II, while MutA, -B, -C, -D, -P, and -T are counterparts of proteins in the lantibiotic epidermin group. MutA' has 60% amino acid identity with MutA and therefore appears to be a duplicate of MutA. Insertional inactivation demonstrated that mutA is an essential gene for mutacin III production, while mutA' is not required. Mutacin III was purified to homogeneity by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. N-terminal peptide sequencing of the purified mutacin III determined mutA to be the structural gene for prepromutacin III. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was measured by laser disorption mass spectrophotometry and found to be 2,266.43 Da, consistent with our supposition that mutacin III has posttranslational modifications similar to those of the lantibiotic epidermin.	1
Abstract2class: Selective utilization of exogenous amino acids by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and its effects on growth and dechlorination activity Abstract: Bacteria of the genus Dehalococcoides are important members of bioremediation communities because of their ability to detoxify chloroethenes to the benign end product ethene. Genome-enabled studies conducted with Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 have revealed that two ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type amino acid transporters are expressed during its exponential growth stages. In light of previous findings that Casamino Acids enhanced its dechlorination activity, we hypothesized that strain 195 is capable of importing amino acids from its environment to facilitate dechlorination and growth. To test this hypothesis, we applied isotopomer-based dilution analysis with (13)C-labeled acetate to differentiate the amino acids that were taken up by strain 195 from those synthesized de novo and to determine the physiological changes caused by the significantly incorporated amino acids. Our results showed that glutamate/glutamine and aspartate/asparagine were almost exclusively synthesized by strain 195, even when provided in excess in the medium. In contrast, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and methionine were identified as the four most highly incorporated amino acids, at levels >30% of respective proteinogenic amino acids. When either phenylalanine or all four highly incorporated amino acids were added to the defined mineral medium, the growth rates, dechlorination activities, and yields of strain 195 were enhanced to levels similar to those observed with supplementation with 20 amino acids. However, genes for the putative ABC-type amino acids transporters and phenylalanine biosynthesis exhibited insignificant regulation in response to the imported amino acids. This study also demonstrates that using isotopomer-based metabolite analysis can be an efficient strategy for optimizing nutritional conditions for slow-growing microorganisms.	0
Abstract2class: Microbiota and mitobiota. Putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria Abstract: The recent revival of old theories and setting them on modern scientific rails to a large extent are also relevant to mitochondrial science. Given the widespread belief that mitochondria are symbionts of ancient bacterial origin, the processes inherent to mitochondrial physiology can be revised based on their comparative analysis with possible involvement of bacteria. Such comparison combined with discussion of the role of microbiota in pathogenesis allows discussion of the role of "mitobiota" (we introduce this term) as the combination of different phenotypic manifestations of mitochondria in the organism reflecting pathological changes in the mitochondrial genome. When putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria, we find similarity between the mitochondrial and bacterial theories of cancer. The presence of the term "bacterial infection" suggests "mitochondrial infection", and mitochondrial (oxidative) theory of aging can in some way be transformed into a "bacterial theory of aging". The possible existence of such processes and the data confirming their presence are discussed in this review. If such a comparison has the right to exist, the homeostasis of "mitobiota" is of not lesser physiological importance than homeostasis of microbiota, which has been so intensively discussed recently.	0
Abstract2class: Spatial and resource factors influencing high microbial diversity in soil Abstract: To begin defining the key determinants that drive microbial community structure in soil, we examined 29 soil samples from four geographically distinct locations taken from the surface, vadose zone, and saturated subsurface using a small-subunit rRNA-based cloning approach. While microbial communities in low-carbon, saturated, subsurface soils showed dominance, microbial communities in low-carbon surface soils showed remarkably uniform distributions, and all species were equally abundant. Two diversity indices, the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) and the log series index, effectively distinguished between the dominant and uniform diversity patterns. For example, the uniform profiles characteristic of the surface communities had diversity index values that were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than those for the high-dominance, saturated, subsurface communities. In a site richer in organic carbon, microbial communities consistently exhibited the uniform distribution pattern regardless of soil water content and depth. The uniform distribution implies that competition does not shape the structure of these microbial communities. Theoretical studies based on mathematical modeling suggested that spatial isolation could limit competition in surface soils, thereby supporting the high diversity and a uniform community structure. Carbon resource heterogeneity may explain the uniform diversity patterns observed in the high-carbon samples even in the saturated zone. Very high levels of chromium contamination (e.g., >20%) in the high-organic-matter soils did not greatly reduce the diversity. Understanding mechanisms that may control community structure, such as spatial isolation, has important implications for preservation of biodiversity, management of microbial communities for bioremediation, biocontrol of root diseases, and improved soil fertility.	0
Abstract2class: Directed evolution of alditol oxidase for the production of optically pure D-glycerate from glycerol in the engineered Escherichia coli Abstract: D-glycerate is an attractive chemical for a wide variety of pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biodegradable polymers, and other applications. Now several studies have been reported about the synthesis of glycerate by different biotechnological and chemical routes from glycerol or other feedstock. Here, we present the construction of an Escherichia coli engineered strain to produce optically pure D-glycerate by oxidizing glycerol with an evolved variant of alditol oxidase (AldO) from Streptomyces coelicolor. This is achieved by starting from a previously reported variant mAldO and employing three rounds of directed evolution, as well as the combination of growth-coupled high throughput selection with colorimetric screening. The variant eAldO3-24 displays a higher substrate affinity toward glycerol with 5.23-fold than the wild-type AldO, and a 1.85-fold increase of catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). Then we introduced an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 expression system in E. coli to overexpress the variant eAldO3-24, and deleted glucosylglycerate phosphorylase encoding gene ycjM to block the consumption of D-glycerate. Finally, the resulting strain TZ-170 produced 30.1 g/l D-glycerate at 70 h with a yield of 0.376 mol/mol in 5-l fed-batch fermentation.	0
Abstract2class: A Highly Conserved Basidiomycete Peptide Synthetase Produces a Trimeric Hydroxamate Siderophore Abstract: The model white-rot basidiomycete, Ceriporiopsis (Gelatoporia) subvermispora B, encodes putative natural product biosynthesis genes. Among them is the gene for the seven-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase CsNPS2. It is a member of the as-yet-uncharacterized fungal type VI siderophore synthetase family, which is highly conserved and widely distributed among the basidiomycetes. These enzymes include only one adenylation (A) domain, i.e., one complete peptide synthetase module, and two thiolation/condensation (T-C) didomain partial modules which together constitute an AT1C1T2C2T3C3 domain setup. The full-length CsNPS2 enzyme (274.5 kDa) was heterologously produced as a polyhistidine fusion in Aspergillus niger as a soluble and active protein. N 5-acetyl-N 5-hydroxy-l-ornithine (l-AHO) and N 5-cis-anhydromevalonyl-N 5 -hydroxy-l-ornithine (l-AMHO) were accepted as the substrates, based on results of an in vitro substrate-dependent [32P]ATP-pyrophosphate radioisotope exchange assay. Full-length holo-CsNPS2 catalyzed amide bond formation between three l-AHO molecules to release the linear l-AHO trimer, called basidioferrin, as the product in vitro, which was verified by liquid chromatography-high-resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that type VI family siderophore synthetases are widespread in mushrooms and evolved in a common ancestor of basidiomycetes.IMPORTANCE The basidiomycete nonribosomal peptide synthetase CsNPS2 represents a member of a widely distributed but previously uninvestigated class (type VI) of fungal siderophore synthetases. Genes orthologous to CsNPS2 are highly conserved across various phylogenetic clades of the basidiomycetes. Hence, our work serves as a broadly applicable model for siderophore biosynthesis and iron metabolism in higher fungi. Also, our results on the amino acid substrate preference of CsNPS2 support a further understanding of the substrate selectivity of fungal adenylation domains. Methodologically, this report highlights the Aspergillus niger/SM-Xpress-based system as a suitable platform to heterologously express multimodular basidiomycete biosynthesis enzymes in the >250-kDa range in soluble and active form.	1
Abstract2class: Complete microbial degradation of both enantiomers of the chiral herbicide mecoprop [(RS)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid] in an enantioselective manner by Sphingomonas herbicidovorans sp. nov Abstract: Sphingomonas herbicidovorans MH (previously designated Flavobacterium sp. strain MH) was able to utilize the chiral herbicide (RS)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid (mecoprop) as the sole carbon and energy source. When strain MH was offered racemic mecoprop as the growth substrate, it could degrade both the (R) and the (S) enantiomer to completion, as shown by biomass formation, substrate consumption, and stoichiometric chloride release. However, the (S) enantiomer disappeared much faster from the culture medium than the (R) enantiomer. These results suggest the involvement of specific enzymes for the degradation of each enantiomer. This view was substantiated by the fact that resting cells of strain MH grown on (S)-mecoprop were able to degrade the (S) but not the (R) enantiomer of mecoprop. Accordingly, resting cells of strain MH grown on (R)-mecoprop preferentially metabolized the (R) enantiomer. Nevertheless, such cells could transform (S)-mecoprop at low rates. Oxygen uptake rates with resting cells confirmed the above view, as oxygen consumption was strongly dependent on the growth substrate. Cells grown on (R)-mecoprop showed oxygen uptake rates more than two times higher upon incubation with the (R) than upon incubation with the (S) enantiomer and vice versa.	0
Abstract2class: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of the aflatoxin-like toxin, dothistromin Abstract: Dothistromin is a polyketide toxin, produced by a fungal forest pathogen, with structural similarity to the aflatoxin precursor versicolorin B. Biochemical and genetic studies suggested that there are common steps in the biosynthetic pathways for these metabolites and showed similarities between some of the genes. A polyketide synthase gene (pksA) was isolated from dothistromin-producing Dothistroma septosporum by hybridization with an aflatoxin ortholog from Aspergillus parasiticus. Inactivation of this gene in D. septosporum resulted in mutants that could not produce dothistromin but that could convert exogenous aflatoxin precursors, including norsolorinic acid, into dothistromin. The mutants also had reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type. So far four other genes are known to be clustered immediately alongside pksA. Three of these (cypA, moxA, avfA) are predicted to be orthologs of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. The other gene (epoA), located between avfA and moxA, is predicted to encode an epoxide hydrolase, for which there is no homolog in either the aflatoxin or sterigmatocystin gene clusters. The pksA gene is located on a small chromosome of approximately 1.3 Mb in size, along with the dothistromin ketoreductase (dotA) gene.	1
Abstract2class: Precisely Tailoring Upconversion Dynamics via Energy Migration in Core-Shell Nanostructures Abstract: Upconversion emission dynamics have long been believed to be determined by the activator and its interaction with neighboring sensitizers. Herein this assumption is, however, shown to be invalid for nanostructures. We demonstrate that excitation energy migration greatly affects upconversion emission dynamics. "Dopant ions' spatial separation" nanostructures are designed as model systems and the intimate link between the random nature of energy migration and upconversion emission time behavior is unraveled by theoretical modelling and confirmed spectroscopically. Based on this new fundamental insight, we have successfully realized fine control of upconversion emission time behavior (either rise or decay process) by tuning the energy migration paths in various specifically designed nanostructures. This result is significant for applications of this type of materials in super resolution spectroscopy, high-density data storage, anti-counterfeiting, and biological imaging.	0
Abstract2class: Migrastatin and dorrigocins are shunt metabolites of iso-migrastatin Abstract: Fermentation of Streptomyces platensis NRRL18993 typically accumulated migrastation (1), dorrigocin A (2) and B (3), and 13-epi-dorrigocin A (5). Supplement of XAD-16 resin to the fermentation, in contrast, resulted in exclusive production of iso-migrastatin (4). In vitro studies showed that 1, 2, 3, and 5 are stable in aqueous solution but 4 undergoes rapid conversion into 1, 2, 3, and 5 under the same condition. These results revealed that 4 is the only bona fide natural product biosynthesized by S. platensis, and 1, 2, 3, and 5 are shunt metabolites of 4. This study also established the stereochemistry of 2-5 with the exception of C-11 for 3 and 4. A mechanism for H2O-mediated regio- and stereospecific rearrangement of 4 to 1, 2, 3, and 5 is proposed and supported by incorporation of 18O from H218O.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of a Legionella pneumophila relA insertion mutant and toles of RelA and RpoS in virulence gene expression Abstract: To investigate the involvement of RelA in the regulation of Legionella pneumophila virulence, a deletion substitution was constructed in the relA gene. The relA knockout resulted in an undetectable level of ppGpp in the cells during the stationary phase, but the original level was restored when the relA gene product was supplied on a plasmid. The effect of the relA mutation was examined with two systems that are known to be expressed during the stationary phase in L. pneumophila. Pigment production was found to be dependent on the relA gene product, and only one-half as much pigment was produced by the relA mutant as by the wild-type strain. Flagellum gene expression was also found to be dependent on the relA gene product, as determined with a flaA::lacZ fusion. However, the relA gene product was found to be dispensable for intracellular growth both in HL-60-derived human macrophages and in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii. To determine the involvement of the relA gene product in expression of L. pneumophila genes required for intracellular growth (icm/dot genes), nine icm::lacZ fusions were constructed, and expression of these fusions in the wild-type strain was compared with their expression in relA mutant strains. Expression of only one of the icm::lacZ fusions was moderately reduced in the relA mutant strain. Expression of the nine icm::lacZ fusions was also examined in a strain containing an insertion in the gene that codes for the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS, and similar results were obtained. We concluded that RelA is dispensable for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in the two hosts examined and that both RelA and RpoS play minor roles in L. pneumophila icm/dot gene expression.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular basis of substrate promiscuity for the SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase NcsB1, involved in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin Abstract: The small molecule component of chromoprotein enediyne antitumor antibiotics is biosynthesized through a convergent route, incorporating amino acid, polyketide, and carbohydrate building blocks around a central enediyne hydrocarbon core. The naphthoic acid moiety of the enediyne neocarzinostatin plays key roles in the biological activity of the natural product by interacting with both the carrier protein and duplex DNA at the site of action. We have previously described the in vitro characterization of an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (NcsB1) in the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic pathway [Luo, Y., Lin, S., Zhang, J., Cooke, H. A., Bruner, S. D., and Shen, B. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 14694-14702]. Here we provide a structural basis for NcsB1 activity, illustrating that the enzyme shares an overall architecture with a large family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent proteins. In addition, NcsB1 represents the first enzyme to be structurally characterized in the biosynthetic pathway of neocarzinostatin. By cocrystallizing the enzyme with various combinations of the cofactor and substrate analogues, details of the active site structure have been established. Changes in subdomain orientation were observed via comparison of structures in the presence and absence of substrate, suggesting that reorientation of the enzyme is involved in binding of the substrate. In addition, residues important for substrate discrimination were predicted and probed through site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro biochemical characterization.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and heterologous expression of the actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Actinoallolides are anti-trypanosomal macrolides isolated from the secondary metabolites of two endophytic actinomycete strains, Actinoallomurus fulvus MK10-036 and K09-0307. A putative actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster was predicted from the genome sequence of the strain K09-0307. The gene cluster spans a contiguous 53 kb DNA region that comprises seven genes encoding three PKSs (aalA1, aalA2, and aalA3), cytochrome P450 (aalB), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (aalC), crotonyl-CoA reductase (aalD), and TetR family regulator (aalR). The entire gene cluster was cloned into a plasmid pYIK1 by assembling DNA fragments, which were obtained from two cosmids containing left and right parts of the gene cluster. Following the introduction of an ermE* promoter at 100bp upstream from the start codon of aalA1, the gene cluster was introduced into Streptomyces coelicolor M1152. Subsequent LC-MS analysis revealed production of actinoallolide A in the culture broth. Thus, the actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by heterologous expression in Streptomyces.	1
Abstract2class: Divergent Biosynthesis of C-Nucleoside Minimycin and Indigoidine in Bacteria Abstract: Minimycin (MIN) is a C-nucleoside antibiotic structurally related to pseudouridine, and indigoidine is a naturally occurring blue pigment produced by diverse bacteria. Although MIN and indigoidine have been known for decades, the logic underlying the divergent biosynthesis of these interesting molecules has been obscure. Here, we report the identification of a minimal 5-gene cluster (min) essential for MIN biosynthesis. We demonstrated that a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (MinA) governs "the switch" for the divergent biosynthesis of MIN and the cryptic indigoidine. We also demonstrated that MinCN (the N-terminal phosphatase domain of MinC), MinD (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase), and MinT (transporter) function together as the safeguard enzymes, which collaboratively constitute an unusual self-resistance system. Finally, we provided evidence that MinD, utilizing an unprecedented substrate-competition strategy for self-resistance of the producer cell, maintains competition advantage over the active molecule MIN-5'-monophosphate by increasing the UMP pool in vivo. These findings greatly expand our knowledge regarding natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Expression of the genes for guanyl-specific ribonucleases from Bacillus intermedius and Bacillus pumilus is regulated by the two component signal transduction system PhoP-PhoR in B. subtilis Abstract: Promoters of the genes for guanyl-specific ribonucleases, secreted by B. intermedius (binase) and B. pumilus (Rnase Bp) in phosphate deficient conditions, contain regions similar to appropriate consensus sequences in promoters of the PHO regulated genes of B. subtilis. A number of genes expressed in response to phosphate starvation in B. subtilis are regulated by the two component signal transduction system PhoP-PhoR. Expression of recombinant genes for binase and RNase Bp in B. subtilis strains with mutations in the regulatory protein genes of the PHO regulon was studied. Their expression is strongly regulated by the regulatory proteins of the B. subtilis PHO regulon.	0
Abstract2class: Optimization of growth media components for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from organic acids by Ralstonia eutropha Abstract: We employed systematic mixture analysis to determine optimal levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate for cell growth and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production by Ralstonia eutropha H16. Butyrate was the preferred acid for robust cell growth and high PHA production. The 3-hydroxyvalerate content in the resulting PHA depended on the proportion of propionate initially present in the growth medium. The proportion of acetate dramatically affected the final pH of the growth medium. A model was constructed using our data that predicts the effects of these acids, individually and in combination, on cell dry weight (CDW), PHA content (%CDW), PHA production, 3HV in the polymer, and final culture pH. Cell growth and PHA production improved approximately 1.5-fold over initial conditions when the proportion of butyrate was increased. Optimization of the phosphate buffer content in medium containing higher amounts of butyrate improved cell growth and PHA production more than 4-fold. The validated organic acid mixture analysis model can be used to optimize R. eutropha culture conditions, in order to meet targets for PHA production and/or polymer HV content. By modifying the growth medium made from treated industrial waste, such as palm oil mill effluent, more PHA can be produced.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor named marinostatin from a marine bacterium, Alteromonas sp. strain B-10-31 Abstract: The gene (mstI) encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor named marinostatin from marine Alteromonas sp. strain B-10-31 was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. A short open reading frame of 192 bp encoded 63 amino acids with a molecular weight of 6,985. Furthermore, the initial product of marinostatin (marinostatin L) was purified and its amino acid sequence was analyzed. These results indicate that marinostatin is produced as a unique precursor consisting of the mature peptide and the leader peptide for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and furthermore the initial product of marinostatin is dehydrated and processed by proteolysis to give homologous forms of marinostatin.	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis and pharmacological effects of the enantiomers of the N-phenethyl analogues of the ortho and para e- and f-oxide-bridged phenylmorphans Abstract: The N-phenethyl analogues of (1R*,4aR*,9aS*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol and (1R*,4aR*,9aR*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2.3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol, the ortho- (43) and para-hydroxy e- (20), and f-oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans (53 and 26) were prepared in racemic and enantiomerically pure forms from a common precursor, the quaternary salt 12. Optical resolutions were accomplished by salt formation with suitable enantiomerically pure chiral acids or by preparative HPLC on a chiral support. The N-phenethyl (-)- para-e enantiomer (1S,4aS,9aR-(-)-20) was found to be a mu-opioid agonist with morphine-like antinociceptive activity in a mouse assay. In contrast, the N-phenethyl (-)-ortho-f enantiomer (1R,4aR,9aR-(-)-53) had good affinity for the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 7 nM) and was found to be a mu-antagonist both in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S assay and in vivo. The molecular structures of these rigid enantiomers were energy minimized with density functional theory at the level B3LYP/6-31G* level, and then overlaid on a known potent mu-agonist. This superposition study suggests that the agonist activity of the oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans can be attributed to formation of a seven membered ring that is hypothesized to facilitate a proton transfer from the protonated nitrogen to a proton acceptor in the mu-opioid receptor.	0
Abstract2class: Genotypes of Cryptosporidium species infecting fur-bearing mammals differ from those of species infecting humans Abstract: Of 471 specimens examined from foxes, raccoons, muskrats, otters, and beavers living in wetlands adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay, 36 were positive for five types of Cryptosporidium, including the C. canis dog and fox genotypes, Cryptosporidium muskrat genotypes I and II, and Cryptosporidium skunk genotype. Thus, fur-bearing mammals in watersheds excreted host-adapted Cryptosporidium oocysts that are not known to be of significant public health importance.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of marneral synthase, which is critical for growth and development in Arabidopsis Abstract: Plants produce structurally diverse triterpenoids, which are important for their life and survival. Most triterpenoids and sterols share a common biosynthetic intermediate, 2,3-oxidosqualene (OS), which is cyclized by 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC). To investigate the role of an OSC, marneral synthase 1 (MRN1), in planta, we characterized a Arabidopsis mrn1 knock-out mutant displaying round-shaped leaves, late flowering, and delayed embryogenesis. Reduced growth of mrn1 was caused by inhibition of cell expansion and elongation. Marnerol, a reduced form of marneral, was detected in Arabidopsis overexpressing MRN1, but not in the wild type or mrn1. Alterations in the levels of sterols and triterpenols and defects in membrane integrity and permeability were observed in the mrn1. In addition, GUS expression, under the control of the MRN1 gene promoter, was specifically detected in shoot and root apical meristems, which are responsible for primary growth, and the mRNA expression of Arabidopsis clade II OSCs was preferentially observed in roots and siliques containing developing seeds. The eGFP:MRN1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in tobacco protoplasts. Taken together, this report provides evidence that the unusual triterpenoid pathway via marneral synthase is important for the growth and development of Arabidopsis.	1
Abstract2class: Extended sequence and functional analysis of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus circulans SANK 72073 Abstract: Butirosin produced by Bacillus circulans is among the clinically important 2-deoxystreptamine containing aminoglycoside antibiotics and its unique structure is found in (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxyburyric acid substituted at C-1 of 2-deoxystreptamine. Recently, the key part of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified from Bacillus circulans SANK 72073, however the whole gene for the biosynthesis awaited for identification. In the present study, we undertook extended analysis of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster and found nine additional open reading flames (ORFs), btrQ, btrR1, btrR2, btrT, btrU, btrV, btrW, btrX and orf1 in the cluster. In addition, we constructed disruption mutants of btrR1 and btrP-V, and found that the btr genes (ca. 24Kb) between btrR1 and btrP-V are at least required for the butirosin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Use of a phosphonate methyltransferase in the identification of the fosfazinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Natural product discovery has been boosted by genome mining approaches, but compound purification is often still challenging. We report an enzymatic strategy for "stable isotope labeling of phosphonates in extract" (SILPE) that facilitates their purification. We used the phosphonate methyltransferase DhpI involved in dehydrophos biosynthesis to methylate a variety of phosphonate natural products in crude spent medium with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled S-adenosyl methionine. Mass-guided fractionation then allowed straightforward purification. We illustrate its utility by purifying a phosphonate that led to the identification of the fosfazinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. This unusual natural product contains a hydrazide linker between a carboxylic acid and a phosphonic acid. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene cluster provides insights into how such a structure might be assembled.	1
Abstract2class: Phylogenetic diversity of marine cyanophage isolates and natural virus communities as revealed by sequences of viral capsid assembly protein gene g20 Abstract: In order to characterize the genetic diversity and phylogenetic affiliations of marine cyanophage isolates and natural cyanophage assemblages, oligonucleotide primers CPS1 and CPS8 were designed to specifically amplify ca. 592-bp fragments of the gene for viral capsid assembly protein g20. Phylogenetic analysis of isolated cyanophages revealed that the marine cyanophages were highly diverse yet more closely related to each other than to enteric coliphage T4. Genetically related marine cyanophage isolates were widely distributed without significant geographic segregation (i.e., no correlation between genetic variation and geographic distance). Cloning and sequencing analysis of six natural virus concentrates from estuarine and oligotrophic offshore environments revealed nine phylogenetic groups in a total of 114 different g20 homologs, with up to six clusters and 29 genotypes encountered in a single sample. The composition and structure of natural cyanophage communities in the estuary and open-ocean samples were different from each other, with unique phylogenetic clusters found for each environment. Changes in clonal diversity were also observed from the surface waters to the deep chlorophyll maximum layer in the open ocean. Only three clusters contained known cyanophage isolates, while the identities of the other six clusters remain unknown. Whether or not these unidentified groups are composed of bacteriophages that infect different Synechococcus groups or other closely related cyanobacteria remains to be determined. The high genetic diversity of marine cyanophage assemblages revealed by the g20 sequences suggests that marine viruses can potentially play important roles in regulating microbial genetic diversity.	0
Abstract2class: Precursor proteins are transported into mitochondria in the absence of proteolytic cleavage of the additional sequences Abstract: Many nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as larger precursor polypeptides that are proteolytically processed during import into the mitochondrion. This processing appears to be catalyzed by a soluble, metal-dependent protease localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In this report we employ an in vitro system to investigate the role of processing in protein import. Intact Neurospora crassa mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled precursors in the presence of the chelator o-phenanthroline. Under these conditions, the processing of the precursors of the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase (F1 beta) and subunit 9 of the F0F1-ATPase was strongly inhibited. Protease-mapping studies indicated that import of the precursor proteins into the mitochondria continued in the absence of processing. Upon readdition of divalent metal to the treated mitochondria, the imported precursors were quantitatively converted to their mature forms. This processing of imported precursors occurred in the absence of a mitochondrial membrane potential and was extremely rapid even at 0 degrees C. This suggests that all or part of the polypeptide chain of the imported precursors had been translocated into the matrix location of the processing enzyme. Localization experiments suggested that the precursor to F1 beta is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial membrane while the precursor to subunit 9 appeared to be tightly bound to the membrane. We conclude that proteolytic processing is not necessary for the translocation of precursor proteins across mitochondrial membranes, but rather occurs subsequent to this event. On the basis of these and other results, a hypothetical pathway for the import of F1 beta and subunit 9 is proposed.	0
Abstract2class: Photovoltaic performance of an ultrasmall band gap polymer Abstract: A conjugated polymer (PBTTQ) that consists of alternating electron-rich bithiophene and electron-deficient thiadiazoloquinoxaline units was synthesized via Yamamoto polymerization with Ni(cod)(2) and provides a band gap of 0.94 eV. This represents one of the smallest band gaps obtained for a soluble conjugated polymer. When applied in a bulk heterojunction solar cell together with [84]PCBM as the electron acceptor, the polymer affords a response up to 1.3 microm.	0
Abstract2class: Biotechnological potential and initial characterization of two novel sesquiterpene synthases from Basidiomycota Coniophora puteana for heterologous production of δ-cadinol Abstract: Background:                       Terpene synthases are versatile catalysts in all domains of life, catalyzing the formation of an enormous variety of different terpenoid secondary metabolites. Due to their diverse bioactive properties, terpenoids are of great interest as innovative ingredients in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Recent advances in genome sequencing have led to the discovery of numerous terpene synthases, in particular in Basidiomycota like the wood rotting fungus Coniophora puteana, which further enhances the scope for the manufacture of terpenes for industrial purposes.                  Results:                       In this study we describe the identification of two novel (+)-δ-cadinol synthases from C. puteana, Copu5 and Copu9. The sesquiterpene (+)-δ-cadinol was previously shown to exhibit cytotoxic activity therefore having an application as possible, new, and sustainably sourced anti-tumor agent. In an Escherichia coli strain, optimized for sesquiterpene production, titers of 225 mg l-1 and 395 mg l-1, respectively, could be achieved. Remarkably, both enzymes share the same product profile thereby representing the first two terpene synthases from Basidiomycota with identical product profiles. We solved the crystal structure of Copu9 in its closed conformation, for the first time providing molecular details of sesquiterpene synthase from Basidiomycota. Based on the Copu9 structure, we conducted structure-based mutagenesis of amino acid residues lining the active site, thereby altering the product profile. Interestingly, the mutagenesis study also revealed that despite the conserved product profiles of Copu5 and Copu9 different conformational changes may accompany the catalytic cycle of the two enzymes. This observation suggests that the involvement of tertiary structure elements in the reaction mechanism(s) employed by terpene synthases may be more complex than commonly expected.                  Conclusion:                       The presented product selectivity and titers of Copu5 and Copu9 may pave the way towards a sustainable, biotechnological production of the potentially new bioactive (+)-δ-cadinol. Furthermore, Copu5 and Copu9 may serve as model systems for further mechanistic studies of terpenoid catalysis.	1
Abstract2class: Patellamide A and C biosynthesis by a microcin-like pathway in Prochloron didemni, the cyanobacterial symbiont of Lissoclinum patella Abstract: Prochloron spp. are obligate cyanobacterial symbionts of many didemnid family ascidians. It has been proposed that the cyclic peptides of the patellamide class found in didemnid extracts are synthesized by Prochloron spp., but studies in which host and symbiont cells are separated and chemically analyzed to identify the biosynthetic source have yielded inconclusive results. As part of the Prochloron didemni sequencing project, we identified patellamide biosynthetic genes and confirmed their function by heterologous expression of the whole pathway in Escherichia coli. The primary sequence of patellamides A and C is encoded on a single ORF that resembles a precursor peptide. We propose that this prepatellamide is heterocyclized to form thiazole and oxazoline rings, and the peptide is cleaved to yield the two cyclic patellamides, A and C. This work represents the full sequencing and functional expression of a marine natural-product pathway from an obligate symbiont. In addition, a related cluster was identified in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, an important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of nocamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 and generation of new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Nocamycins I and II, produced by the rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, belong to the tetramic acid family natural products. Nocamycins show potent antimicrobial activity and they hold great potential for antibacterial agent design. However, up to now, little is known about the exact biosynthetic mechanism of nocamycin.                  Results:                       In this report, we identified the gene cluster responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis from S. syringae and generated new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating its gene cluster. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nocamycin contains a 61 kb DNA locus, consisting of 21 open reading frames (ORFs). Five type I polyketide synthases (NcmAI, NcmAII, NcmAIII, NcmAIV, NcmAV) and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NcmB) are proposed to be involved in synthesis of the backbone structure, a Dieckmann cyclase NcmC catalyze the releasing of linear chain and the formation of tetramic acid moiety, five enzymes (NcmEDGOP) are related to post-tailoring steps, and five enzymes (NcmNJKIM) function as regulators. Targeted inactivation of ncmB led to nocamycin production being completely abolished, which demonstrates that this gene cluster is involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. To generate new nocamycin derivatives, the gene ncmG, encoding for a cytochrome P450 oxidase, was inactivated. Two new nocamycin derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV were isolated from the ncmG deletion mutant strain and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strains, a biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins was proposed.                  Conclusion:                       These findings provide the basis for further understanding of nocamycin biosynthetic mechanism, and set the stage to rationally engineer new nocamycin derivatives via combinatorial biosynthesis strategy.	1
Abstract2class: Distinguishing reversible from irreversible virus capsid assembly Abstract: Capsids of spherical viruses may be constructed from hundreds or thousands of copies of the major capsid protein(s). These assembly reactions are poorly understood. Here we consider the predicted behavior for assembly where the component reactions have weak association energy and are reversible and compare them to essentially irreversible reactions. The comparisons are based on mass action calculations and the behavior predicted from kinetic simulations where assembly is described as a cascade of low order reactions. Reversible reactions are characterized by a pseudo-critical concentration, whereas irreversible reactions consume all free subunits. Irreversible reactions are more susceptible to kinetic traps comprised of numerous small intermediates. In the case where only the ultimate step is irreversible, very low concentrations of intermediates slow the completion of the reaction so that overall it closely matches the predictions for the reversible reactions that make up the majority of the cascade. Data in the literature strongly support the hypothesis that most viruses are held together by many weak interactions.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Organoarsenical Antibiotic Arsinothricin Abstract: The soil bacterium Burkholderia gladioli GSRB05 produces the natural compound arsinothricin [2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylarsinoyl) butanoate] (AST), which has been demonstrated to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic. To identify the genes responsible for AST biosynthesis, a draft genome sequence of B. gladioli GSRB05 was constructed. Three genes, arsQML, in an arsenic resistance operon were found to be a biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for synthesis of AST and its precursor, hydroxyarsinothricin [2-amino-4-(dihydroxyarsinoyl) butanoate] (AST-OH). The arsL gene product is a noncanonical radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that is predicted to transfer the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from SAM to the arsenic atom in inorganic arsenite, forming AST-OH, which is methylated by the arsM gene product, a SAM methyltransferase, to produce AST. Finally, the arsQ gene product is an efflux permease that extrudes AST from the cells, a common final step in antibiotic-producing bacteria. Elucidation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for this novel arsenic-containing antibiotic adds an important new tool for continuation of the antibiotic era. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging global public health crisis, calling for urgent development of novel potent antibiotics. We propose that arsinothricin and related arsenic-containing compounds may be the progenitors of a new class of antibiotics to extend our antibiotic era. Here, we report identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for arsinothricin and demonstrate that only three genes, two of which are novel, are required for the biosynthesis and transport of arsinothricin, in contrast to the phosphonate counterpart, phosphinothricin, which requires over 20 genes. Our discoveries will provide insight for the development of more effective organoarsenical antibiotics and illustrate the previously unknown complexity of the arsenic biogeochemical cycle, as well as bring new perspective to environmental arsenic biochemistry.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of antimycins with a reconstituted 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore in Escherichia coli Abstract: Antimycins are a family of natural products generated from a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line. Although they possess an array of useful biological activities, their structural complexity makes chemical synthesis challenging, and their biosynthesis has thus far been dependent on slow-growing source organisms. Here, we reconstituted the biosynthesis of antimycins in Escherichia coli, a versatile host that is robust and easy to manipulate genetically. Along with Streptomyces genetic studies, the heterologous expression of different combinations of ant genes enabled us to systematically confirm the functions of the modification enzymes, AntHIJKL and AntO, in the biosynthesis of the 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore of antimycins. Our E. coli-based antimycin production system can not only be used to engineer the increased production of these bioactive compounds, but it also paves the way for the facile generation of novel and diverse antimycin analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Chromosomal replication origin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi functions in Escherichia coli: oriC consensus sequence Abstract: The chromosomal replication origin (oriC) of Vibrio harveyi has been isolated on a plasmid and shown to function as an origin in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the V. harveyi oriC was determined. From a comparison of this sequence with oriC sequences of five enteric bacteria, we derived a consensus sequence of bacterial origins that function in E. coli. This consensus sequence identifies 122 positions within oriC where nucleotide substitutions can occur without loss of origin function. These positions are clustered rather than scattered. Four interrelated nine-base-pair repeats and eight of the dam methylation G-A-T-C sites are conserved in the consensus sequence. Very few relative insertion-deletion changes occur, and these are localized to one region of oriC. The genes for three polypeptides linked to the V. harveyi oriC were identified by using in vitro protein synthesis directed by deletion derivative plasmid templates. One of these genes, coding for a 58,000 Mr polypeptide and located 3.0 kilobase pairs from the V. harveyi oriC region, is lethal to E. coli when many copies (approximately 40 per cell) are present (high copy lethal or HCL gene). In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that a different gene, the gid gene to the left of oriC, is highly conserved between E. coli and V. harveyi, whereas the coding region to the right of oriC is much less conserved.	0

Abstract2class: Characterization of integration host factor (IHF) binding upstream of the cysteine-rich protein operon (omcAB) promoter of Chlamydia trachomatis LGV serovar L2 Abstract: Chlamydiae are bacterial parasites that carry out a distinct developmental cycle within host cells; however, the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate stage-specific gene expression are not known. We identified a DNA element located between nucleotide (nt) -135 and -90 upstream from the transcription start point of the late stage-specific CRP operon (omcAB) of Chlamydia trachomatis, to which a protein in extracts of chlamydiae harvested at 23 h after infection binds. A recombinant protein of C. trachomatis open reading frame (ORF) CT267, which is homologous to bacterial integration host factor (IHF) and the heat-unstable nucleoid protein (HU), bound to the same element and produced the same DNase I footprint as the protein in chlamydial extracts. Recombinant ORF CT267 protein bound with high affinity to the DNA element and induced a sharp bend in a DNA fragment containing the binding site, suggesting that ORF CT267 encodes a protein with IHF-like activity, and recombinant protein had a positive effect on in vitro transcription of the CRP operon. IHF-binding activity and IHF protein were detected in extracts of C. trachomatis during the early to intermediate phases of the late stage of the developmental cycle (between 17 and 30 h after infection), but were absent in the extreme late phase of the cycle and in the infectious form of chlamydiae. The presence of an IHF binding site upstream of the CRP operon and the presence of chlamydial IHF-like protein when late stage genes are transcribed suggests that the chlamydial IHF may play a role in stage-specific gene expression.	0
Abstract2class: Histone modification via rapid cleavage of C4'-oxidized abasic sites in nucleosome core particles Abstract: The C4'-oxidized abasic site is produced in DNA by a variety of oxidizing agents, including potent cytotoxic antitumor agents. Independent generation of this alkali-labile lesion at defined positions within nucleosome core particles reveals that the histone proteins increase strand scission between 130- and 550-fold. Strand scission proceeds via a Schiff base intermediate, but the DNA-protein cross-links are unstable. The oxidized abasic site is removed in its entirety from the DNA and transferred to the lysine-rich tail region of the proximal histone protein in the form of a lactam. The modification is distributed over several residues within the amino-terminal tail of the proximal histone. Transfer of DNA damage to histones could affect gene regulation.	0
Abstract2class: Overproduction of lactimidomycin by cross-overexpression of genes encoding Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins Abstract: The glutarimide-containing polyketides represent a fascinating class of natural products that exhibit a multitude of biological activities. We have recently cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic gene clusters for three members of the glutarimide-containing polyketides-iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS) from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993, lactimidomycin (LTM) from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, and cycloheximide (CHX) from Streptomyces sp. YIM56141. Comparative analysis of the three clusters identified mgsA and chxA, from the mgs and chx gene clusters, respectively, that were predicted to encode the PimR-like Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs) but failed to reveal any regulatory gene from the ltm gene cluster. Overexpression of mgsA or chxA in S. platensis NRRL 18993, Streptomyces sp. YIM56141 or SB11024, and a recombinant strain of Streptomyces coelicolor M145 carrying the intact mgs gene cluster has no significant effect on iso-MGS or CHX production, suggesting that MgsA or ChxA regulation may not be rate-limiting for iso-MGS and CHX production in these producers. In contrast, overexpression of mgsA or chxA in S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 resulted in a significant increase in LTM production, with LTM titer reaching 106 mg/L, which is five-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. These results support MgsA and ChxA as members of the SARP family of positive regulators for the iso-MGS and CHX biosynthetic machinery and demonstrate the feasibility to improve glutarimide-containing polyketide production in Streptomyces strains by exploiting common regulators.	0
Abstract2class: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin in Streptomyces ambofaciens Abstract: Spiramycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic used in human medicine, is produced by Streptomyces ambofaciens; it comprises a polyketide lactone, platenolide, to which three deoxyhexose sugars are attached. In order to characterize the gene cluster governing the biosynthesis of spiramycin, several overlapping cosmids were isolated from an S. ambofaciens gene library, by hybridization with various probes (spiramycin resistance or biosynthetic genes, tylosin biosynthetic genes), and the sequences of their inserts were determined. Sequence analysis showed that the spiramycin biosynthetic gene cluster spanned a region of over 85 kb of contiguous DNA. In addition to the five previously described genes that encode the type I polyketide synthase involved in platenolide biosynthesis, 45 other genes have been identified. It was possible to propose a function for most of the inferred proteins in spiramycin biosynthesis, in its regulation, in resistance to the produced antibiotic or in the provision of extender units for the polyketide synthase. Two of these genes, predicted to be involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis, were inactivated by gene replacement, and the resulting mutants were unable to produce spiramycin, thus confirming their involvement in spiramycin biosynthesis. This work reveals the main features of spiramycin biosynthesis and constitutes a first step towards a detailed molecular analysis of the production of this medically important antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Production of bioactive diterpenoids in the euphorbiaceae depends on evolutionarily conserved gene clusters Abstract: The Euphorbiaceae produce a diverse range of diterpenoids, many of which have pharmacological activities. These diterpenoids include ingenol mebutate, which is licensed for the treatment of a precancerous skin condition (actinic keratosis), and phorbol derivatives such as resiniferatoxin and prostratin, which are undergoing investigation for the treatment of severe pain and HIV, respectively. Despite the interest in these diterpenoids, their biosynthesis is poorly understood at present, with the only characterized step being the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate into casbene. Here, we report a physical cluster of diterpenoid biosynthetic genes from castor (Ricinus communis), including casbene synthases and cytochrome P450s from the CYP726A subfamily. CYP726A14, CYP726A17, and CYP726A18 were able to catalyze 5-oxidation of casbene, a conserved oxidation step in the biosynthesis of this family of medicinally important diterpenoids. CYP726A16 catalyzed 7,8-epoxidation of 5-keto-casbene and CYP726A15 catalyzed 5-oxidation of neocembrene. Evidence of similar gene clustering was also found in two other Euphorbiaceae, including Euphorbia peplus, the source organism of ingenol mebutate. These results demonstrate conservation of gene clusters at the higher taxonomic level of the plant family and that this phenomenon could prove useful in further elucidating diterpenoid biosynthetic pathways.	1
Abstract2class: An overproduction of astellolides induced by genetic disruption of chromatin-remodeling factors in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae is an important industrial mold. Recent genomic analysis indicated that A. oryzae has a large number of biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites (SMs), but many of the SMs they produce have not been identified. For better understanding of SMs production by A. oryzae, we screened a gene-disruption library of transcription factors including chromatin-remodeling factors and found two gene disruptions that show similarly altered SM production profiles. One is a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans cclA, a component of the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex of proteins associated with Set1 complex, and the other, sppA, is an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPP1, another component of a complex of proteins associated with Set1 complex. The cclA and sppA disruptions in A. oryzae are deficient in trimethylation of H3K4. Furthermore, one of the SMs that increased in the cclA disruptant was identified as astellolide F (14-deacetyl astellolide B). These data indicate that both cclA and sppA affect production of SMs including astellolides by affecting the methylation status of H3K4 in A. oryzae.	1

Abstract2class: Cryptosporioptide: a bioactive polyketide produced by an endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis sp Abstract: An antibiotic polyketide, Cryptosporioptide (1) was isolated from the culture extract of the endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis sp. The structure of Cryptosporioptide has been established with the help of 1D ((1)H, (13)C), 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, COSY, NOESY) techniques and mass spectrometry (FABMS, HRFABMS). The absolute configuration was established by means of electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Cryptosporioptide exhibited both lipoxygenase inhibitory and anti-Bacillus megaterium activities.	1
Abstract2class: Origin of Free Energy Barriers of Decarboxylation and the Reverse Process of CO2 Capture in Dimethylformamide and in Water Abstract: In aqueous solution, biological decarboxylation reactions proceed irreversibly to completion, whereas the reverse carboxylation processes are typically powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. The exchange of the carboxylate of ring-substituted arylacetates with isotope-labeled CO2 in polar aprotic solvents reported recently suggests a dramatic change in the partition of reaction pathways. Yet, there is little experimental data pertinent to the kinetic barriers for protonation and thermodynamic data on CO2 capture by the carbanions of decarboxylation reactions. Employing a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical simulation approach, we investigated the decarboxylation reactions of a series of organic carboxylate compounds in aqueous and in dimethylformamide solutions, revealing that the reverse carboxylation barriers in solution are fully induced by solvent effects. A linear Bell-Evans-Polanyi relationship was found between the rates of decarboxylation and the Gibbs energies of reaction, indicating diminishing recombination barriers in DMF. In contrast, protonation of the carbanions by the DMF solvent has large free energy barriers, rendering the competing exchange of isotope-labeled CO2 reversible in DMF. The finding of an intricate interplay of carbanion stability and solute-solvent interaction in decarboxylation and carboxylation could be useful to designing novel materials for CO2 capture.	0
Abstract2class: An Unusual Type II Polyketide Synthase System Involved in Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis Abstract: As a unique structural moiety in natural products, cinnamoyl lipids (CLs), are proposed to be assembled by unusual type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Herein, we demonstrate that the assembly of the CL compounds youssoufenes is accomplished by a PKS system that uniquely harbors three phylogenetically different ketosynthase/chain length factor (KS/CLF) complexes (YsfB/C, YsfD/E, and YsfJ/K). Through in vivo gene inactivation and in vitro reconstitution, as well as an intracellular tagged carrier-protein tracking (ITCT) strategy developed in this study, we successfully elucidated the isomerase-dependent ACP-tethered polyunsaturated chain elongation process. The three KS/CLFs were revealed to modularly assemble different parts of the youssoufene skeleton, during which benzene ring closure happens right after the formation of an ACP-tethered C18 polyene. Of note, the ITCT strategy could significantly contribute to the elucidation of other carrier-protein-dependent biosynthetic machineries.	1
Abstract2class: Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis Abstract: A revised structure of natural 14-mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid-phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell-based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90 %) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin-1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.	1
Abstract2class: Genome Mining of Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 as a Producer of an Anthraquinone-Fused Enediyne Abstract: A new anthraquinone-fused enediyne, yangpumicin A (YPM A, 1), along with four Bergman cyclization congeners (YPM B-E, 2-5), was isolated from Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 after mining enediyne biosynthetic gene clusters from public actinobacterial genome databases and prioritizing the hits by an enediyne genome neighborhood network analysis for discovery. YPM A is potent against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines. The discovery of 1 provides new opportunities for the functionalization of enediynes to develop new conjugation chemistries for antibody-drug conjugates.	1
Abstract2class: Metagenomic discovery of polybrominated diphenyl ether biosynthesis by marine sponges Abstract: Naturally produced polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) pervade the marine environment and structurally resemble toxic man-made brominated flame retardants. PBDEs bioaccumulate in marine animals and are likely transferred to the human food chain. However, the biogenic basis for PBDE production in one of their most prolific sources, marine sponges of the order Dysideidae, remains unidentified. Here, we report the discovery of PBDE biosynthetic gene clusters within sponge-microbiome-associated cyanobacterial endosymbionts through the use of an unbiased metagenome-mining approach. Using expression of PBDE biosynthetic genes in heterologous cyanobacterial hosts, we correlate the structural diversity of naturally produced PBDEs to modifications within PBDE biosynthetic gene clusters in multiple sponge holobionts. Our results establish the genetic and molecular foundation for the production of PBDEs in one of the most abundant natural sources of these molecules, further setting the stage for a metagenomic-based inventory of other PBDE sources in the marine environment.	1
Abstract2class: Ribosome Mechanics Informs about Mechanism Abstract: The essential aspects of the ribosome's mechanism can be extracted from coarse-grained simulations, including the ratchet motion, the movement together of critical bases at the decoding center, and movements of the peptide tunnel lining that assist in the expulsion of the synthesized peptide. Because of its large size, coarse graining helps to simplify and to aid in the understanding of its mechanism. Results presented here utilize coarse-grained elastic network modeling to extract the dynamics, and both RNAs and proteins are coarse grained. We review our previous results, showing the well-known ratchet motions and the motions in the peptide tunnel and in the mRNA tunnel. The motions of the lining of the peptide tunnel appear to assist in the expulsion of the growing peptide chain, and clamps at the ends of the mRNA tunnel with three proteins ensure that the mRNA is held tightly during decoding and essential for the helicase activity at the entrance. The entry clamp may also assist in base recognition to ensure proper selection of the incoming tRNA. The overall precision of the ribosome machine-like motions is remarkable.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the N-methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of toxoflavin, fervenulin and reumycin from Streptomyces hiroshimensis ATCC53615 Abstract: Toxoflavin (1), fervenulin (2), and reumycin (3), known to be produced by plant pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1, are structurally related 7-azapteridine antibiotics. Previous biosynthetic studies revealed that N-methyltransferase ToxA from B. glumae BGR1 catalyzed the sequential methylation at N6 and N1 in pyrimido[5,4-e]-as-triazine-5,7(6H,8H)-dione (4) to generate 1. However, the N8 methylation of 4 in the biosynthesis of fervenulin remains unclear. To explore the N-methyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, we identified and characterized the fervenulin and toxoflavin biosynthetic gene clusters in S. hiroshimensis ATCC53615. On the basis of the structures of intermediates accumulated from the four N-methyltransferase gene inactivation mutants and systematic enzymatic methylation reactions, the tailoring steps for the methylation order in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 were proposed. The N-methylation order and routes for the biosynthesis of fervenulin and toxoflavin in S. hiroshimensis are more complex and represent an obvious departure from those in B. glumae BGR1.	1
Abstract2class: Evaluating the estimation of genetic correlation and heritability using summary statistics Abstract: While novel statistical methods quantifying the shared heritability of traits and diseases between ancestral distinct populations have been recently proposed, a thorough evaluation of these approaches under differing circumstances remain elusive. Brown et al.2016 proposed the method Popcorn to estimate the shared heritability, i.e. genetic correlation, using only summary statistics. Here, we evaluate Popcorn under several parameters and circumstances: sample size, number of SNPs, sample size of external reference panel, various population pairs, inappropriate external reference panel, and admixed population involved. Our results determined the minimum sample size of the external reference panel, summary statistics, and number of SNPs required to accurately estimate both the genetic correlation and heritability. Moreover, the number of individuals and SNPs required to produce accurate and stable estimates was directly proportional with heritability in Popcorn. Misrepresentation of the reference panel overestimated the genetic correlation by 20% and heritability by 60%. Lastly, applying Popcorn to homogeneous (EUR) and admixed (ASW) populations underestimated the genetic correlation by 15%. Although statistical approaches estimating the shared heritability between ancestral populations will provide novel etiologic insight, caution is required ensuring results are based on the appropriate sample size, number of SNPs, and the generalizability of the reference panel to the discovery populations.	0
Abstract2class: Chain initiation in the leinamycin-producing hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140. Discrete, monofunctional adenylation enzyme and peptidyl carrier protein that directly load D-alanine Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide natural products are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are organized into modules. For a typical NRPS initiation module, an adenylation (A) domain activates an amino acid and installs it onto a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain as a thioester; an elongation module, which has a condensation (C) domain located between every consecutive pair of A and PCP domains, catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between the upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl-S-PCP and the free amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP. D-amino acid constituents in peptide natural products usually arise from the L-enantiomers through the action of integral epimerization (E) domains of an NRPS. The biosynthetic gene cluster for leinamycin, a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide containing a D-alanine moiety, does not encode a typical NRPS initiation module with the expected A-PCP-E domains; instead, it has only an A protein (LnmQ) and a PCP (LnmP), both of which are encoded by separate genes. Here we show the results of biochemical experiments as follows: (i) we demonstrate that LnmQ directly activates D-alanine as D-alaninyl-AMP and installs it onto LnmP to generate a D-alaninyl-S-PCP intermediate; (ii) we confirm that aminoacylation of LnmP by LnmQ in trans is the result of specific communication between the separate A and PCP proteins; and (iii) we reveal that leinamycin production can be improved by supplementation of exogenous D-alanine in the fermentation broth of Streptomyces atroolivaceous S-140. These findings unveil an unprecedented NRPS initiation module structure that is characterized by a discrete D-alanine-specific A protein and a PCP.	1
Abstract2class: Comparison of genetic maps for two Leptospira interrogans serovars provides evidence for two chromosomes and intraspecies heterogeneity Abstract: Genetic maps were constructed for Leptospira interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona. Previously we independently constructed physical maps of the genomes for these two serovars. The genomes of both serovars consist of a large replicon (4.4 to 4.6 Mb) and a small replicon (350 kb). Genes were localized on the physical maps by using Southern blot analysis with specific probes. Among the probes used were genes encoding a variety of essential enzymes and genes usually found near bacterial chromosomal replication origins. Most of the essential genes are on the larger replicon of each serovar. However, the smaller replicons of both serovars contain the asd gene. The asd gene encodes aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential in amino acid and cell wall biosyntheses. The finding that both L. interrogans replicons contain essential genes suggests that both replicons are chromosomes. Comparison of the genetic maps of the larger replicons of the two serovars showed evidence of large rearrangements. These data show that there is considerable intraspecies heterogeneity in L. interrogans.	0
Abstract2class: Structural and functional complexity of the genomic region controlling AK-toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in the Japanese pear pathotype of Alternaria alternata Abstract: The Japanese pear pathotype of Alternaria alternata produces host-specific AK-toxin and causes black spot of Japanese pear. Previously, a cosmid clone, pcAKT-1, was isolated that contains two genes, AKT1 and AKT2, within a 5.0-kb region required for AK-toxin biosynthesis. The wild-type strain has multiple, nonfunctional copies of these genes. In the present study, two additional genes, AKTR-1 and AKT3-1, downstream of AKT2 were identified. Transformation of the wild type with AKTR-1- and AKT3-1-targeting vectors produced toxin-deficient (Tox-), nonpathogenic mutants. DNA gel blot analysis, however, demonstrated that the fragments targeted in Tox- mutants were different from those containing AKTR-1 and AKT3-1 on the transforming vectors. A cosmid clone, pcAKT-2, containing the targeted DNA was isolated and shown to carry two genes, AKTR-2 and AKT3-2, with high similarity to AKTR-1 and AKT3-1, respectively. Transcripts from not only AKTR-2 and AKT3-2 but also AKTR-1 and AKT3-1 were found in the wild type. DNA gel blot analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and AKTR and their homologues are on a single chromosome. These results indicate the structural and functional complexity of the genomic region controlling AK-toxin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: The antibiotic planosporicin coordinates its own production in the actinomycete Planomonospora alba Abstract: Planosporicin is a ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Planomonospora alba. It contains one methyl-lanthionine and four lanthionine bridges and inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in other Gram-positive bacteria probably by binding to lipid II, the immediate precursor for cell wall biosynthesis. Planosporicin production, which is encoded by a cluster of 15 genes, is confined to stationary phase in liquid culture and to the onset of morphological differentiation when P. alba is grown on agar. This growth phase-dependent gene expression is controlled transcriptionally by three pathway-specific regulatory proteins: an extracytoplasmic function σ factor (PspX), its cognate anti-σ factor (PspW), and a transcriptional activator (PspR) with a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Using mutational analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, quantitative RT-PCR, and transcriptional fusions, we have determined the direct regulatory dependencies within the planosporicin gene cluster and present a model in which subinhibitory concentrations of the lantibiotic function in a feed-forward mechanism to elicit high levels of planosporicin production. We show that in addition to acting as an antibiotic, planosporicin can function as an extracellular signaling molecule to elicit precocious production of the lantibiotic, presumably ensuring synchronous and concerted lantibiotic biosynthesis in the wider population and, thus, the production of ecologically effective concentrations of the antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Commensal bacteria make GPCR ligands that mimic human signalling molecules Abstract: Commensal bacteria are believed to have important roles in human health. The mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood, but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions. Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119 agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential physiological role in humans. Our results suggest that chemical mimicry of eukaryotic signalling molecules may be common among commensal bacteria and that manipulation of microbiota genes encoding metabolites that elicit host cellular responses represents a possible small-molecule therapeutic modality (microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy).	1
Abstract2class: Natural Occurrence of Hybrid Polyketides from Two Distinct Biosynthetic Pathways in Streptomyces pactum Abstract: Nature has always been seemingly limitless in its ability to create new chemical entities. It provides vastly diverse natural compounds through a biomanufacturing process that involves myriads of biosynthetic machineries. Here we report a case of unusual formations of hybrid natural products that are derived from two distinct polyketide biosynthetic pathways, the NFAT-133 and conglobatin pathways, in Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456. Their chemical structures were determined by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis. Genome sequence analysis and gene inactivation experiments uncovered the biosynthetic gene cluster of conglobatin in S. pactum. Biochemical studies of the recombinant thioesterase (TE) domain of the conglobatin polyketide synthase (PKS) as well as its S74A mutant revealed that the formation of these hybrid compounds requires an active TE domain. We propose that NFAT-133 can interfere with conglobatin biosynthesis by reacting with the TE-domain-bound intermediates in the conglobatin PKS assembly line to form hybrid NFAT-133/conglobatin products.	0
Abstract2class: Phylogenetic characterization and promoter expression analysis of a novel hybrid protein disulfide isomerase/cargo receptor subfamily unique to plants and chromalveolates Abstract: Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) play critical roles in protein folding by catalyzing the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in nascent secretory proteins. There are six distinct PDI subfamilies in terrestrial plants. A unique feature of PDI-C subfamily members is their homology to the yeast retrograde (Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum) cargo receptor proteins, Erv41p and Erv46p. Here, we demonstrate that plant Erv41p/Erv46p-like proteins are divided into three subfamilies: ERV-A, ERV-B and PDI-C, which all possess the N-proximal and C-proximal conserved domains of yeast Erv41p and Erv46p. However, in PDI-C isoforms, these domains are separated by a thioredoxin domain. The distribution of PDI-C isoforms among eukaryotes indicates that the PDI-C subfamily likely arose through an ancient exon-shuffling event that occurred before the divergence of plants from stramenopiles and rhizarians. Arabidopsis has three PDI-C genes: PDI7, PDI12, and PDI13. PDI12- and PDI13-promoter: β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusions are co-expressed in pollen and stipules, while PDI7 is distinctly expressed in the style, hydathodes, and leaf vasculature. The PDI-C thioredoxin domain active site motif CxxS is evolutionarily conserved among land plants. Whereas PDI12 and PDI13 retain the CxxS motif, PDI7 has a CxxC motif similar to classical PDIs. We hypothesize that PDI12 and PDI13 maintain the ancestral roles of PDI-C in Arabidopsis, while PDI7 has undergone neofunctionalization. The unusual PDI/cargo receptor hybrid arrangement in PDI-C isoforms has no counterpart in animals or yeast, and predicts the need for pairing redox functions with cargo receptor processes during protein trafficking in plants and other PDI-C containing organisms.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of Cryptic Largimycins in Streptomyces Reveals Novel Biosynthetic Avenues Enriching the Structural Diversity of the Leinamycin Family Abstract: Largimycins are hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketides that constitute a new group of metabolites in the leinamycin family of natural products displaying unique structural features such as containing an oxazole instead of a thiazole ring or being oxime ester macrocycles, unprecedented in nature, rather than macrolactams. Their discovery in Streptomyces argillaceus and Streptomyces canus has relied on the activation of two homologous silent gene clusters by overexpressing a transcriptional activator and cultivating in specific media. The proposed biosynthesis of largimycins includes the key action of the oxidoreductase LrgO, responsible for the formation of the oxime group involved in macrocyclization, and two putative cryptic biosynthetic steps consisting of chlorination of l-Thr by the NRPS loading module and incorporation of an olefinic exomethylene group by LrgJ PKS. The discovery of largimycins uncovers novel biosynthetic avenues employed in nature to enrich the structural diversity of leinamycins and provides tools for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa antimetabolite L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid Abstract: L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB) is a potent antibiotic and toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using a novel biochemical assay combined with site-directed mutagenesis in strain PAO1, we have identified a five-gene cluster specifying AMB biosynthesis, probably involving a thiotemplate mechanism. Overexpression of this cluster in strain PA7, a natural AMB-negative isolate, led to AMB overproduction.	1
Abstract2class: Decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids via photoredox catalysis: a one-step conversion of biomass to drug pharmacophore Abstract: The direct decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids has been achieved via visible light-mediated photoredox catalysis. This method offers rapid entry to prevalent benzylic amine architectures from an abundant biomass, specifically α-amino acid precursors. Significant substrate scope is observed with respect to both the amino acid and arene components.	0
Abstract2class: Regulation of penicillinase synthesis: a mutation in Staphylococcus aureus unlinked to the penicillinase plasmid that reduced penicillinase inducibility Abstract: A mutant of Staphylococcus aureus strain 655 was isolated that is restricted in penicillinase induction. Wild-type plasmids that bear penicillinase determinants could not be fully induced in this mutant, 655par-1; hence, the responsible mutation is not located on the plasmid. Mutant plasmid PI(258)penI443, which produces penicillinase constitutively in wild-type cells, was fully constitutive for penicillinase production when it was harbored by mutant 655par-1. Therefore, the bacterial mutation does not interfere directly with the transcription of the penZ gene or translation of the penicillinase messenger ribonucleic acid. Mutant plasmid PII(147)penI220 was fully inducible in the mutant bacterium, even though the wild-type plasmid PII(147) was only partially inducible in the par-1 mutant. Thus, in the presence of inducer, complementation appears to occur between the product of the par-1 gene and the product of the penI220 gene. These results suggest that the par-1 gene codes for a penicillinase antire-pressor.	0
Abstract2class: Microbial conversion of epsilon-pyrromycinone and epsilon-isorhodomycinone to 1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomcyin and N-formyl-1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin and their bioactivities Abstract: New anthracycline antibiotics, 1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin and N-formyl-1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin were biosynthesized by a blocked mutant of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ME130-A4 from epsilon-pyrromycinone or epsilon-isorhodomycinone.	0
Abstract2class: Biological dinitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) associated with Florida mangroves Abstract: Biological dinitrogen fixation in mangrove communities of the Tampa Bay region of South Florida was investigated using the acetylene reduction technique. Low rates of acetylene reduction (0.01 to 1.84 nmol of C(2)H(4)/g [wet weight] per h) were associated with plant-free sediments, while plant-associated sediments gave rise to slightly higher rates. Activity in sediments increased greatly upon the addition of various carbon sources, indicating an energy limitation for nitrogenase (C(2)H(2)) activity. In situ determinations of dinitrogen fixation in sediments also indicated low rates and exhibited a similar response to glucose amendment. Litter from the green macroalga, Ulva spp., mangrove leaves, and sea grass also gave rise to significant rates of acetylene reduction. Higher rates of nitrogenase activity (15 to 53 nmol of C(2)H(4)/g [wet weight] per h were associated with washed excised roots of three Florida mangrove species [Rhizophora mangle L., Avicennia germinans (L) Stern, and Laguncularia racemosa Gaertn.] as well as with isolated root systems of intact plants (11 to 58 mug of N/g [dry weight] per h). Following a short lag period, root-associated activity was linear and did not exhibit a marked response to glucose amendment. It appears that dinitrogen-fixing bacteria in the mangrove rhizoplane are able to use root exudates and/or sloughed cell debris as energy sources for dinitrogen fixation.	0
Abstract2class: Complex genetic architecture of Drosophila aggressive behavior Abstract: Epistasis and pleiotropy feature prominently in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits but are difficult to assess in outbred populations. We performed a diallel cross among coisogenic Drosophila P-element mutations associated with hyperaggressive behavior and showed extensive epistatic and pleiotropic effects on aggression, brain morphology, and genome-wide transcript abundance in head tissues. Epistatic interactions were often of greater magnitude than homozygous effects, and the topology of epistatic networks varied among these phenotypes. The transcriptional signatures of homozygous and double heterozygous genotypes derived from the six mutations imply a large mutational target for aggressive behavior and point to evolutionarily conserved genetic mechanisms and neural signaling pathways affecting this universal fitness trait.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery and characterization of a group of fungal polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferases Abstract: The prenyltransferase (PTase) gene vrtC was proposed to be involved in viridicatumtoxin (1) biosynthesis in Penicillium aethiopicum. Targeted gene deletion and reconstitution of recombinant VrtC activity in vitro established that VrtC is a geranyl transferase that catalyzes a regiospecific Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the naphthacenedione carboxamide intermediate 2 at carbon 6 with geranyl diphosphate. VrtC can function in the absence of divalent ions and can utilize similar naphthacenedione substrates, such as the acetyl-primed TAN-1612 (4). Genome mining using the VrtC protein sequence leads to the identification of a homologous group of PTase genes in the genomes of human and animal-associated fungi. Three enzymes encoded by this new subgroup of PTase genes from Neosartorya fischeri, Microsporum canis, and Trichophyton tonsurans were shown to be able to catalyze transfer of dimethylallyl to several tetracyclic naphthacenedione substrates in vitro. In total, seven C(5)- or C(10)-prenylated naphthacenedione compounds were generated. The regioselectivity of these new polycyclic PTases (pcPTases) was confirmed by characterization of product 9 obtained from biotransformation of 4 in Escherichia coli expressing the N. fischeri pcPTase gene. The discovery of this new subgroup of PTases extends our enzymatic tools for modifying polycyclic compounds and enables genome mining of new prenylated polyketides.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous expression of the thiopeptide antibiotic GE2270 from Planobispora rosea ATCC 53733 in Streptomyces coelicolor requires deletion of ribosomal genes from the expression construct Abstract: GE2270 is a thiopeptide antibiotic generated by extensive posttranslational modifications of a ribosomally generated precursor peptide. Thiopeptides are especially active against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In this study the GE2270 biosynthetic gene cluster (pbt) from Planobispora rosea ATCC 53733 was successfully expressed in the heterologous host strain Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. Notably, exconjugants containing the pbt gene cluster could only be obtained after deletion of the major part of the ribosomal genes flanking the gene cluster. This is a striking example that genes belonging to primary metabolism can prevent the successful conjugative transfer of DNA from phylogenetic distant species and thus complicate heterologous expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters. GE2270 production in the heterologous producer strain increased after introduction of the constitutive ermE* promoter upstream of the GE2270 resistance gene tuf from P. rosea. Insertion of the inducible tcp830 promoter resulted in inducible GE2270 production. When the regulatory gene pbtR was deleted, the resulting strain ceased to produce GE2270, suggesting an essential role of PbtR as a putative transcriptional activator of GE2270 expression.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and structural characterisation of a catecholate-type siderophore produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a Abstract: Siderophores are produced by several bacteria that utilise iron in various environments. Elucidating the structure of a specific siderophore may have valuable applications in drug development. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a Gram-negative bacterium that inhabits a wide range of environments and can cause pneumonia, produces siderophores. However, the structure was unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate it. We purified siderophores from cultures of S. maltophilia K279a using preparative reversed-phase HPLC. The structure was analysed through LC-MS and 1H and 13C NMR. The results demonstrated that S. maltophilia K279a produces 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine (DHBS), a monomer unit of enterobactin. We suggested the uptake of Iron(III) by the DHBS complex. DHBS production by S. maltophilia K279a could be attributed to an incomplete enterobactin pathway. Drugs targeting DHBS synthesis could prevent S. maltophilia infection.	1
Abstract2class: Chemical reporter for visualizing metabolic cross-talk between carbohydrate metabolism and protein modification Abstract: Metabolic chemical reporters have been largely used to study posttranslational modifications. Generally, it was assumed that these reporters entered one biosynthetic pathway, resulting in labeling of one type of modification. However, because they are metabolized by cells before their addition onto proteins, metabolic chemical reporters potentially provide a unique opportunity to read-out on both modifications of interest and cellular metabolism. We report here the development of a metabolic chemical reporter 1-deoxy-N-pentynyl glucosamine (1-deoxy-GlcNAlk). This small-molecule cannot be incorporated into glycans; however, treatment of mammalian cells results in labeling of a variety proteins and enables their visualization and identification. Competition of this labeling with sodium acetate and an acetyltransferase inhibitor suggests that 1-deoxy-GlcNAlk can enter the protein acetylation pathway. These results demonstrate that metabolic chemical reporters have the potential to isolate and potentially discover cross-talk between metabolic pathways in living cells.	0
Abstract2class: Cretaceous origin of the unique prey-capture apparatus in mega-diverse genus: stem lineage of Steninae rove beetles discovered in Burmese amber Abstract: Stenus is the largest genus of rove beetles and the second largest among animals. Its evolutionary success was associated with the adhesive labial prey-capture apparatus, a unique apomorphy of that genus. Definite Stenus with prey-capture apparatus are known from the Cenozoic fossils, while the age and early evolution of Steninae was hardly ever hypothesized. Our study of several Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions revealed a stem lineage of Steninae that possibly possesses the Stenus-like prey-capture apparatus. Phylogenetic analysis of extinct and extant taxa of Steninae and putatively allied subfamilies of Staphylinidae with parsimony and Bayesian approaches resolved the Burmese amber lineage as a member of Steninae. It justified the description of a new extinct stenine genus Festenus with two new species, F. robustus and F. gracilis. The Late Cretaceous age of Festenus suggests an early origin of prey-capture apparatus in Steninae that, perhaps, drove the evolution towards the crown Stenus. Our analysis confirmed the well-established sister relationships between Steninae and Euaesthetinae and resolved Scydmaeninae as their next closest relative, the latter having no stable position in recent phylogenetic studies of rove beetles. Close affiliation of Megalopsidiinae, a subfamily often considered as a sister group to Euaesthetinae + Steninae clade, is rejected.	0
Abstract2class: Effects of geminal methyl groups on the tunnelling rates in the ring opening of cyclopropylcarbinyl radical at cryogenic temperature Abstract: CVT + SCT calculations on the rate of tunnelling at 20 K in the ring opening of cyclopropylcarbinyl radical, substituted with geminal methyl groups at a ring carbon (1b), have been performed. The calculations predict that, contrary to expectations based on the effect of mass on the rate of tunnelling, the geminal methyl substituents in 1b should make the rate of ring opening to 1,1-dimethyl-3-butenyl radical (2b) 10(4) times faster than the rate of ring opening of unsubstituted cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (1a) to 3-butenyl radical (2a) and almost 10(6) times faster than the rate of ring opening of 1b to 2,2-dimethyl-3-butenyl radical (2c). The reasons for these unexpected findings are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Coordination of export and glycosylation of landomycins in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 Abstract: In Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 gene cluster for biosynthesis of polyglycosylated angucycline landomycin A (LaA), a divergently oriented gene pair for a TetR-family regulator (lanK) and an efflux protein (lanJ) is located, whose functions remained obscure. Overexpression and disruption studies showed that lanK and lanJ genes control LaA resistance. Also, a constitutive lanK overexpression led to predominant accumulation of LaA precursors bearing shorter glycoside chains. These data as well as the results of in vitro and in vivo assays of LanK activity are consistent with the idea that LanK represses lanJ and some downstream genes involved in conversion of landomycin D (a disaccharide LaA precursor) into LaA. LaA and some of its precursors accumulate in the producing cell and relieve repression by LanK, thus amplifying the biosynthesis and export of landomycins with long glycoside chains. Therefore, the main biological role of LanK appears to be the inhibition of premature extrusion of early LaA precursors from the cells, which in turn creates the optimal conditions for accumulation of LaA as the major landomycin in S. cyanogenus S136.	1
Abstract2class: Regulation of secondary metabolism by chromatin structure and epigenetic codes Abstract: Chromatin, composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, is the relevant substrate for all genetic processes in eukaryotic nuclei. Changes in chromatin structure are associated with the activation and silencing of gene transcription and reversible post-translational modifications of histones are now known to direct chromatin structure transitions. Recent studies in several fungal species have identified a chromatin-based regulation of secondary metabolism (SM) gene clusters representing an upper-hierarchical level for the coordinated control of large chromosomal elements. Regulation by chromatin transition processes provides a mechanistic model to explain how different SM clusters located at dispersed genomic regions can be simultaneously silenced during primary metabolism. Activation of SM clusters has been shown to be associated with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and, consequently, inhibition of histone de-acetylase activities also leads to increased production of secondary metabolites. New findings suggest that SM clusters are silenced by heterochromatic histone marks and that the "closed" heterochromatic structures are reversed during SM activation. This process is mediated by the conserved activator of SM, LaeA. Despite the increase in knowledge about these processes, much remains to be learned from chromatin-level regulation of SM. For example, which proteins "position" the chromatin restructuring signal onto SM clusters or how exactly LaeA works to mediate the low level of heterochromatic marks inside different clusters remain open questions. Answers to these and other chromatin-related questions would certainly complete our understanding of SM gene regulation and signaling and, because for many predicted SM clusters corresponding products have not been identified so far, anti-silencing strategies would open new ways for the identification of novel bioactive substances.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of Neuroprotective Spoxazomicin and Oxachelin Glycosides via Chemoenzymatic Glycosyl-Scanning Abstract: The assessment of glycosyl-scanning to expand the molecular and functional diversity of metabolites from the underground coal mine fire-associated Streptomyces sp. RM-14-6 is reported. Using the engineered glycosyltransferase OleD Loki and a 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen, six metabolites were identified as substrates of OleD Loki, from which 12 corresponding metabolite glycosides were produced and characterized. This study highlights the first application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen toward an unbiased set of unique microbial natural products and the first reported application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based transglycosylation reaction for the corresponding preparative synthesis of target glycosides. Bioactivity analysis (including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and EtOH damage neuroprotection assays) revealed glycosylation to attenuate the neuroprotective potency of 4, while glycosylation of the structurally related inactive spoxazomicin C (3) remarkably invoked neuroprotective activity.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Peptide Antibiotic Feglymycin by a Linear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Mechanism Abstract: Feglymycin, a peptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp. DSM 11171, consists mostly of nonproteinogenic phenylglycine-type amino acids. It possesses antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and antiviral activity against HIV. Inhibition of the early steps of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis indicated a mode of action different from those of other peptide antibiotics. Here we describe the identification and assignment of the feglymycin (feg) biosynthesis gene cluster, which codes for a 13-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system. Inactivation of an NRPS gene and supplementation of a hydroxymandelate oxidase mutant with the amino acid l-Hpg proved the identity of the feg cluster. Feeding of Hpg-related unnatural amino acids was not successful. This characterization of the feg cluster is an important step to understanding the biosynthesis of this potent antibacterial peptide.	1
Abstract2class: A peptide ligase and the ribosome cooperate to synthesize the peptide pheganomycin Abstract: Peptide antibiotics are typically biosynthesized by one of two distinct machineries in a ribosome-dependent or ribosome-independent manner. Pheganomycin (PGM (1)) and related analogs consist of the nonproteinogenic amino acid (S)-2-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl)phenyl-2-guanidinoacetic acid (2) and a proteinogenic core peptide, making their origin uncertain. We report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cirratus responsible for PGM production. Unexpectedly, the cluster contains a gene encoding multiple precursor peptides along with several genes plausibly encoding enzymes for the synthesis of amino acid 2. We identified PGM1, which has an ATP-grasp domain, as potentially capable of linking the precursor peptides with 2, and validate this hypothesis using deletion mutants and in vitro reconstitution. We document PGM1's substrate permissivity, which could be rationalized by a large binding pocket as confirmed via structural and mutagenesis experiments. This is to our knowledge the first example of cooperative peptide synthesis achieved by ribosomes and peptide ligases using a peptide nucleophile.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery and Characterization of a Class IV Lanthipeptide with a Nonoverlapping Ring Pattern Abstract: Lanthipeptides constitute a major family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). They are classified into four subfamilies, based on the characteristics of their lanthipeptide synthetases. While over a hundred lanthipeptides have been discovered to date, very few of them are class IV lanthipeptides and the latter are all structurally similar. Here, we identified an uncharacterized group of class IV lanthipeptides using bioinformatics analysis. One representative pathway from Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1022 was expressed in Escherichia coli, which generated a lanthipeptide with two nonoverlapping rings that have not been reported for known class IV lanthipeptides. Further investigation into the biosynthetic mechanism revealed that multiple modification pathways are in operation in which dehydration and cyclization occur in parallel. While peptidases for maturation of class IV lanthipeptides have been elusive, two aminopeptidases encoded in the genome of Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1022 were shown to process the modified peptide by the dual endopeptidase/aminopeptidase activity. This work opens doors to discover more class IV lanthipeptides with interesting structural features and biological activities.	1
Abstract2class: Evolutionary Trajectories for the Functional Diversification of Anthracycline Methyltransferases Abstract: Microbial natural products are an important source of chemical entities for drug discovery. Recent advances in understanding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites has revealed how this rich chemical diversity is generated through functional differentiation of biosynthetic enzymes. For instance, investigations into anthracycline anticancer agents have uncovered distinct S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent proteins: DnrK is a 4-O-methyltransferase involved in daunorubicin biosynthesis, whereas RdmB (52% sequence identity) from the rhodomycin pathway catalyzes 10-hydroxylation. Here, we have mined unknown anthracycline gene clusters and discovered a third protein subclass catalyzing 10-decarboxylation. Subsequent isolation of komodoquinone B from two Streptomyces strains verified the biological relevance of the decarboxylation activity. Phylogenetic analysis inferred two independent routes for the conversion of methyltransferases into hydroxylases, with a two-step process involving loss-of-methylation and gain-of-hydroxylation presented here. Finally, we show that simultaneously with the functional differentiation, the evolutionary process has led to alterations in substrate specificities.	1
Abstract2class: Structure of the nucleotide radical formed during reaction of CDP/TTP with the E441Q-alpha2beta2 of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase Abstract: The Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleotides and requires a diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor for catalysis. RNR is composed of a 1:1 complex of two homodimeric subunits: alpha and beta. Incubation of the E441Q-alpha mutant RNR with substrate CDP and allosteric effector TTP results in loss of the tyrosyl radical and formation of two new radicals on the 200 ms to min time scale. The first radical was previously established by stopped flow UV/vis spectroscopy and pulsed high field EPR spectroscopy to be a disulfide radical anion. The second radical was proposed to be a 4'-radical of a 3'-keto-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate. To identify the structure of the nucleotide radical [1'-(2)H], [2'-(2)H], [4'-(2)H], [5'-(2)H], [U-(13)C, (15)N], [U-(15)N], and [5,6 -(2)H] CDP and [beta-(2)H] cysteine-alpha were synthesized and incubated with E441Q-alpha2beta2 and TTP. The nucleotide radical was examined by 9 GHz and 140 GHz pulsed EPR spectroscopy and 35 GHz ENDOR spectroscopy. Substitution of (2)H at C4' and C1' altered the observed hyperfine interactions of the nucleotide radical and established that the observed structure was not that predicted. DFT calculations (B3LYP/IGLO-III/B3LYP/TZVP) were carried out in an effort to recapitulate the spectroscopic observations and lead to a new structure consistent with all of the experimental data. The results indicate, unexpectedly, that the radical is a semidione nucleotide radical of cytidine 5'-diphosphate. The relationship of this radical to the disulfide radical anion is discussed.	0
Abstract2class: A sigmaB-like factor responsible for carotenoid biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Self-cloning experiments with a high-copy-number plasmid and Streptomyces griseus IFO13350 led to the cloning of a 11-kb DNA fragment that conferred yellow pigment production on the host. The cloned fragment contained a gene cluster for carotenoid biosynthesis, in which two polycistrons, crtE (encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase)-crtI (phytoene dehydrogenase)-crtB (phytoene synthase)-crtV (functionally unknown methyltransferase-like protein) and crtY (lycopene cyclase)-crtT (functionally unknown methyltransferase-like protein)-crtU (beta-carotene dehydrogenase), were present in a convergent way. Since strain IFO13350 produced no detectable amount of carotenoids, an increase in the copy number of the crt gene cluster led to production of carotenoids at a detectable level. Overexpression of the stress-responsive sigmaB-like protein CrtS from Streptomyces setonii also activated the cryptic crt genes in S. griseus and conferred pigmentation. A CrtS homologue (sigmaCrtS) in S. griseus, which was predicted by a computer-aided homology search, caused carotenogenesis to the same extent as CrtS of S. setonii, indicating that the two sigmaB-like proteins were functionally the same. Yellow pigment production by S. griseus containing crtS under the control of a strong promoter on a high-copy-number plasmid resulted from activation of transcription of the crt genes, because overexpression of sigmaCrtS in S. griseus led to transcriptional activation of the promoters in front of crtE and crtY. S1 nuclease mapping showed that crtS itself was transcribed at a low level under the laboratory conditions, which may account for undetectable production of carotenoids. The crt genes were suggested to locate very near one end of the linear chromosome, since they were completely deleted in mutant HH1 having large deletions at both ends. The gene organization of crt in S. griseus is similar to that in S. coelicolor A3(2) where the whole crt gene set is near one end of the chromosome.	1
Abstract2class: Enantioselective Decarboxylative Arylation of α-Amino Acids via the Merger of Photoredox and Nickel Catalysis Abstract: An asymmetric decarboxylative Csp(3)-Csp(2) cross-coupling has been achieved via the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of naturally abundant α-amino acids and readily available aryl halides into valuable chiral benzylic amines in high enantiomeric excess, thereby producing motifs found in pharmacologically active agents.	0
Abstract2class: A preliminary investigation of the Nostoc punctiforme proteome Abstract: Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 is a filamentous terrestrial cyanobacterium (prokaryote) that expresses several different phenotypes in response to environmental cues. When grown in nitrogen-deficient media the most abundant proteins in addition to phycobiliproteins were superoxide dismutase, ATP synthase, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. A methylated peptide from an akinete marker protein was also identified, suggesting that methylation could potentially play a regulatory role through signaling. C-phycocyanin alpha-chain was methylated at the C-terminal end of the protein and tandem mass spectrometric data also identified peptides that were deamidated. Since a significant number of putative polyketide/non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes are present in the annotated genome, an analysis of a methanolic extract of whole cells was also performed, and a series of nostopeptolides were identified.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the natural fluorophore legioliulin from legionella Abstract: Let it shine: The biosynthesis of the UV fluorophore legioliulin (1) from Legionella spp. was elucidated and the phenylalanine ammonium lyase LglD responsible for the formation of the starter unit cinnamic acid was biochemically characterized. Additionally, two novel derivatives differing in the starter unit have been identified by mutasynthesis experiments.	1
Abstract2class: Streamlined syntheses of (-)-dictyostatin, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin, and 6-epi-16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin Abstract: The dictyostatins are a promising class of potential anti-cancer drugs because they are powerful microtubule-stabilizing agents, but the complexity of their chemical structures is a severe impediment to their further development. On the basis of both synthetic and medicinal chemistry analyses, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6 epimer were chosen as potentially potent yet accessible dictyostatin analogues, and three new syntheses were developed. A relatively classical synthesis involving vinyllithium addition and macrocyclization gave way to a newer and more practical approach based on esterification and ring-closing metathesis reaction. Finally, aspects of these two approaches were combined to provide a third new synthesis based on esterification and Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction. This was used to prepare the target dihydro analogues and the natural product. All of the syntheses are streamlined because of their high convergency. The work provided several new analogues of dictyostatin, including a truncated macrolactone and a C10 E-alkene, which were 400- and 50-fold less active than (-)-dictyostatin, respectively. In contrast, the targeted 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin analogues retained almost complete activity in preliminary biological assays.	0
Abstract2class: Production of new anthracycline antibiotics 1-hydroxy-oxaunomycin and 6-deoxyoxaunomycin by limited biosynthetic conversion using a daunorubicin-negative mutant Abstract: A limited biosynthetic conversion of some known anthracyclinones using a specific daunorubicin-nonproducing mutant provided four new anthracycline antibiotics: 1-Hydroxy-10-methoxycarbonyl-13-deoxocarminomycin; 1-hydroxy-13-deoxocarminomycin; 1-hydroxyoxaunomycin and 6-deoxyoxaunomycin. Their isolation and purification from bioconversion broth, structural determination and antitumor activities against leukemic L1210 cells are described.	0
Abstract2class: Matching Glycosyl Donor Reactivity to Sulfonate Leaving Group Ability Permits SN2 Glycosylations Abstract: Here we demonstrate that highly β-selective glycosylation reactions can be achieved when the electronics of a sulfonyl chloride activator and the reactivity of a glycosyl donor hemiacetal are matched. While these reactions are compatible with the acid- and base-sensitive protecting groups that are commonly used in oligosaccharide synthesis, these protecting groups are not relied upon to control selectivity. Instead, β-selectivity arises from the stereoinversion of an α-glycosyl arylsulfonate in an SN2-like mechanism. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by NMR studies, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements, and DFT calculations.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a hybrid PKS-NRPS required for the biosynthesis of NG-391 in Metarhizium robertsii Abstract: The fungal entomopathogen Metarhizium robertsii (formerly known as M. anisopliae var. anisopliae) is a prolific producer of secondary metabolites of which very little is known at the genetic level. To establish the genetic bases for the biosynthesis of the mutagenic compound NG- 391, we identified a 19,818 kb genomic region harboring the predicted hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase NGS1, plus five additional ORFs. NGS1 knockouts generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation failed to produce detectable levels of NG-391, indicating the involvement of this locus in its biosynthesis. NGS1 deletion mutants had no significant changes in virulence levels against larvae of Spodoptera exigua and in resistance to hydrogen peroxide-generated oxidative stress compared to the wild-type strain. All 6 ORFs were expressed in medium supporting production of NG-391, and NGS1 was expressed during the interaction with the S. exigua host. The use of an NGS1 promoter-GFP reporter fusion showed that during in vitro growth in still broth cultures, NGS1 expression is restricted to the early exponential phase and is affected by M. robertsii cell density.	1
Abstract2class: PreQ0 base, an unusual metabolite with anti-cancer activity from Streptomyces qinglanensis 172205 Abstract: PreQ0 base (7-cyano-7-deazaguanine, compound 1) is the biosynthetic precursor of queuosine-tRNA and important synthetic intermediate for bioactive compounds. It was obtained for the first time as a new natural product from a mangrove actinomycete Streptomyces qinglanensis 172205, during the course of searching for anti-cancer compounds from marine microbes. PreQ0 base showed anti-HeLa (IC50 = 62.0 μg/ml) and anti-HepG2 (IC50 = 80.6 μg/ml) activities, higher cytotoxicity than the positive control, fluorouracil. Furthermore, it exhibited weak α -glucosidase inhibitory activity, but no obvious antimicrobial and Aβ1-42 fibrillation inhibitory activities. In silico analysis of the genome of the strain 172205 revealed a putative biosynthetic gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of PreQ0 base. The gene cluster only contained three Open Reading Frames (ORFs), queC, queD and queE. The absence of the key gene queF encoding 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase catalyzing PreQ0 base to PreQ1 base suggested that the strain only has the capacity of accumulation of PreQ0 base as a metabolite, consistent with our observation in chemical identification.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation, sequencing and characterization of cluster genes involved in the biosynthesis and utilization of the siderophore of marine fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus Abstract: In fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus MVP01, the isolated 11-gene cluster consisted of two divergently transcribed, Fe(3+) and ferric uptake regulator (Fur) regulated operons, pvsABCDE and psuA-pvuABCDE, sharing high similarity with that related to siderophore biosynthesis and transportation locus in V. parahaemolyticus. Siderophore biosynthesis or utilization was blocked when pvsA and pvsD of the pvsABCDE operon or pvuA, pvuB and pvuE of the psuA-pvuABCDE operon was single-gene in-frame mutated, demonstrating their essential roles for siderophore biosynthesis or utilization in V. alginolyticus MVP01. Addition of the purified siderophore restored the cell growth in siderophore biosynthesis mutants, but not in siderophore uptake mutants.	1
Abstract2class: Geographic distance and pH drive bacterial distribution in alkaline lake sediments across Tibetan Plateau Abstract: Continent-scale biogeography has been extensively studied in soils and marine systems, but little is known about biogeographical patterns in non-marine sediments. We used barcode pyrosequencing to quantify the effects of local geochemical properties and geographic distance for bacterial community structure and membership, using sediment samples from 15 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (4-1670 km apart). Bacterial communities were surprisingly diverse, and distinct from soil communities. Four of 26 phyla detected were dominant: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, albeit 20.2% of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. As previously observed in acidic soil, pH was the dominant factor influencing alkaline sediment community structure, phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r=0.443, P=0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%). Together, our results show that pH is the best predictor of bacterial community structure in alkaline sediments, and confirm that both geographic distance and chemical factors govern bacterial biogeography in lake sediments.	0
Abstract2class: Breaking up is easy to do (if you're a DNA enzyme that cleaves RNA) Abstract: In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Cruz et al. use in vitro selection to select deoxyribozymes that collectively cleave almost any RNA dinucleotide junction. More remarkable is the finding that the new enzymes are related to the 8-17 deoxyribozyme that cleaves AG dinucleotide junctions.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of caerulomycin A gene cluster implicates a tailoring amidohydrolase Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for caerulomycin A (1) was cloned and characterized from the marine actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6, which revealed an unusual hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system. The crmL disruption mutant accumulated caerulomycin L (2) with an extended L-leucine at C-7, implicating an amidohydrolase activity for CrmL. The leucine-removing activity was confirmed for crude CrmL enzymes. Heterologous expression of the 1 gene cluster led to 1 production in Streptomyces coelicolor.	1
Abstract2class: Differential Survivability of Two Genetically Similar Salmonella Thompson Strains on Pre-harvest Sweet Basil ( Ocimum basilicum) Leaves Abstract: Although conventionally considered an animal pathogen, recent evidence increasingly suggests that fresh produce may act as significant transmission vehicles and alternative hosts to Salmonella. This study reports the differential survivability of two genetically similar Salmonella Thompson strains (ST 889B and ST 688C) on the adaxial surface of pre-harvest basil (Ocimum basilicum) leaves. Upon inoculation, two distinct phenomena, a dried water-print or a macroscopic lesion, were observed within 24 h. ST 889B survived better than ST 688C on healthy-looking leaves without lesions, possibly due to its higher biofilm-forming ability. Both strains survived better on the leaves with lesions than on the healthy-looking leaves (ST 688C: 4.39 ± 0.68 vs. 2.18 ± 0.29; ST 889B: 4.78 ± 0.12 vs. 2.83 ± 0.18 log CFU per sample at 6 days post-inoculation). ST 889B caused the formation of lesions at a higher frequency [70/117 leaves (59.8%)] than ST 688C [35/96 leaves (36.5%)]. Thus, we highlighted two distinct Salmonella survival strategies in the basil pathosystem and demonstrated gene expression polymorphism (variations in the expression of the same set of genes) as an indispensable strategy in the colonization of plants as hosts by the human pathogens.	0
Abstract2class: A hydrated crystalline calcium carbonate phase: Calcium carbonate hemihydrate Abstract: As one of the most abundant materials in the world, calcium carbonate, CaCO3, is the main constituent of the skeletons and shells of various marine organisms. It is used in the cement industry and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and formation of sedimentary rocks. For more than a century, only three polymorphs of pure CaCO3-calcite, aragonite, and vaterite-were known to exist at ambient conditions, as well as two hydrated crystal phases, monohydrocalcite (CaCO3·1H2O) and ikaite (CaCO3·6H2O). While investigating the role of magnesium ions in crystallization pathways of amorphous calcium carbonate, we unexpectedly discovered an unknown crystalline phase, hemihydrate CaCO3·½H2O, with monoclinic structure. This discovery may have important implications in biomineralization, geology, and industrial processes based on hydration of CaCO3.	0
Abstract2class: Draft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. oscitans DS 12.976, Producer of the Aminocoumarin Antibiotic Clorobiocin Abstract: Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. oscitans DS 12.976 is the producer of the gyrase-inhibiting aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin. Here, we present a draft genome sequence of this strain, in which we identified the clorobiocin gene cluster as well as an unusually high number (43) of further putative secondary metabolite clusters.	1
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of genes for biosynthesis of pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboxamide from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Abstract: Two seven-gene phenazine biosynthetic loci were cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The operons, designated phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2, are homologous to previously studied phenazine biosynthetic operons from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Functional studies of phenazine-nonproducing strains of fluorescent pseudomonads indicated that each of the biosynthetic operons from P. aeruginosa is sufficient for production of a single compound, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). Subsequent conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is mediated in P. aeruginosa by two novel phenazine-modifying genes, phzM and phzS, which encode putative phenazine-specific methyltransferase and flavin-containing monooxygenase, respectively. Expression of phzS alone in Escherichia coli or in enzymes, pyocyanin-nonproducing P. fluorescens resulted in conversion of PCA to 1-hydroxyphenazine. P. aeruginosa with insertionally inactivated phzM or phzS developed pyocyanin-deficient phenotypes. A third phenazine-modifying gene, phzH, which has a homologue in Pseudomonas chlororaphis, also was identified and was shown to control synthesis of phenazine-1-carboxamide from PCA in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Our results suggest that there is a complex pyocyanin biosynthetic pathway in P. aeruginosa consisting of two core loci responsible for synthesis of PCA and three additional genes encoding unique enzymes involved in the conversion of PCA to pyocyanin, 1-hydroxyphenazine, and phenazine-1-carboxamide.	1
Abstract2class: Modified 'one amino acid-one codon' engineering of high GC content TaqII-coding gene from thermophilic Thermus aquaticus results in radical expression increase Abstract: Background:                       An industrial approach to protein production demands maximization of cloned gene expression, balanced with the recombinant host's viability. Expression of toxic genes from thermophiles poses particular difficulties due to high GC content, mRNA secondary structures, rare codon usage and impairing the host's coding plasmid replication.TaqII belongs to a family of bifunctional enzymes, which are a fusion of the restriction endonuclease (REase) and methyltransferase (MTase) activities in a single polypeptide. The family contains thermostable REases with distinct specificities: TspGWI, TaqII, Tth111II/TthHB27I, TspDTI and TsoI and a few enzymes found in mesophiles. While not being isoschizomers, the enzymes exhibit amino acid (aa) sequence homologies, having molecular sizes of ~120 kDa share common modular architecture, resemble Type-I enzymes, cleave DNA 11/9 nt from the recognition sites, their activity is affected by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).                  Results:                       We describe the taqIIRM gene design, cloning and expression of the prototype TaqII. The enzyme amount in natural hosts is extremely low. To improve expression of the taqIIRM gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli), we designed and cloned a fully synthetic, low GC content, low mRNA secondary structure taqIIRM, codon-optimized gene under a bacteriophage lambda (λ) PR promoter. Codon usage based on a modified 'one amino acid-one codon' strategy, weighted towards low GC content codons, resulted in approximately 10-fold higher expression of the synthetic gene. 718 codons of total 1105 were changed, comprising 65% of the taqIIRM gene. The reason for we choose a less effective strategy rather than a resulting in high expression yields 'codon randomization' strategy, was intentional, sub-optimal TaqII in vivo production, in order to decrease the high 'toxicity' of the REase-MTase protein.                  Conclusions:                       Recombinant wt and synthetic taqIIRM gene were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The modified 'one amino acid-one codon' method tuned for thermophile-coded genes was applied to obtain overexpression of the 'toxic' taqIIRM gene. The method appears suited for industrial production of thermostable 'toxic' enzymes in E. coli. This novel variant of the method biased toward increasing a gene's AT content may provide economic benefits for industrial applications.	0
Abstract2class: Nisin J, a Novel Natural Nisin Variant, Is Produced by Staphylococcus capitis Sourced from the Human Skin Microbiota Abstract: The skin microbiota is thought to play a key role in host protection from infection. Nisin J is a novel nisin variant produced by Staphylococcus capitis APC 2923, a strain isolated from the toe web space area in a screening study performed on the human skin microbiota. Whole-genome sequencing and mass spectrometry of the purified peptide confirmed that S. capitis APC 2923 produces a 3,458-Da bacteriocin, designated nisin J, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Cutibacterium acnes The gene order in the nisin J gene cluster (nsjFEGBTCJP) differs from that of other nisin variants in that it is lacking the nisin regulatory genes, nisRK, as well as the nisin immunity gene nisI Nisin J has 9 amino acid changes compared to prototypical nisin A, with 8 amino acid substitutions, 6 of which are not present in other nisin variants (Ile4Lys, Met17Gln, Gly18Thr, Asn20Phe, Met21Ala, Ile30Gly, Val33His, and Lys34Thr), and an extra amino acid close to the C terminus, rendering nisin J the only nisin variant to contain 35 amino acids. This is the first report of a nisin variant produced by a Staphylococcus species and the first nisin producer isolated from human skin.IMPORTANCE This study describes the characterization of nisin J, the first example of a natural nisin variant, produced by a human skin isolate of staphylococcal origin. Nisin J displays inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial targets, including MRSA. This work demonstrates the potential of human commensals as a source for novel antimicrobials that could form part of the solution to antibiotic resistance across a broad range of bacterial pathogens.	1
Abstract2class: A novel New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase variant, NDM-14, isolated in a Chinese Hospital possesses increased enzymatic activity against carbapenems Abstract: A novel New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) variant, NDM-14, was identified in clinical isolate Acinetobacter lwoffii JN49-1, which was recovered from an intensive care unit patient at a local hospital in China. NDM-14, which differs from other existing enzymes by an amino acid substitution at position 130 (Asp130Gly), possesses enzymatic activity toward carbapenems that is greater than that of NDM-1. Kinetic data indicate that NDM-14 has a higher affinity for imipenem and meropenem.	0
Abstract2class: Structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery of therapeutics for cocaine overdose and addiction Abstract: (-)-Cocaine is a widely abused drug and there is currently no available anti-cocaine therapeutic. Promising agents, such as anti-cocaine catalytic antibodies and high-activity mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), for therapeutic treatment of cocaine overdose have been developed through structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery. In particular, a unique computational design strategy based on the modeling and simulation of the rate-determining transition state has been developed and used to design and discover desirable high-activity mutants of BChE. One of the discovered high-activity mutants of BChE has a approximately 456-fold improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine. The encouraging outcome of the structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery effort demonstrates that the unique computational design approach based on transition state modeling and simulation is promising for rational enzyme redesign and drug discovery. The general approach of the structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery may be used to design high-activity mutants of any enzyme or catalytic antibody.	0
Abstract2class: Arginyltransferase is an ATP-independent self-regulating enzyme that forms distinct functional complexes in vivo Abstract: Posttranslational arginylation mediated by arginyl transferase (ATE1) plays an important role in cardiovascular development, cell motility, and regulation of cytoskeleton and metabolic enzymes. This protein modification was discovered decades ago, however, the arginylation reaction and the functioning of ATE1 remained poorly understood because of the lack of good biochemical models. Here, we report the development of an in vitro arginylation system, in which ATE1 function and molecular requirements can be tested using purified recombinant ATE1 isoforms supplemented with a controlled number of components. Our results show that arginylation reaction is a self-sufficient, ATP-independent process that can affect different sites in a polypeptide and that arginyl transferases form different molecular complexes in vivo, associate with components of the translation machinery, and have distinct, partially overlapping subsets of substrates, suggesting that these enzymes play different physiological functions.	0
Abstract2class: 5-thiomannosides block the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides and mimic class I congenital disorders of glycosylation Abstract: In a cell-based assay for novel inhibitors, we have discovered that two glycosides of 5-thiomannose, each containing an interglycosidic nitrogen atom, prevented the correct zymogen processing of the prohormone proopiomelanocortinin (POMC) and the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in mouse pituitary cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, respectively. In the case of SREBP-2, these effects were correlated with the altered N-linked glycosylation of subtilisin/kexin-like isozyme-1 (SKI-1), the protease responsible for SREBP-2 processing under sterol-limiting conditions. Further examination of the effects of these compounds in CHO cells showed that they cause extensive protein hypoglycosylation in a manner similar to type I congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) since the remaining N-glycans in treated cells were complete (normal) structures. The under-glycosylation of glycoproteins in 5-thiomannoside-treated cells is now shown to be caused by the compromised biosynthesis of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (DLO) N-glycosylation donor, although the nucleotide sugars required for the synthesis of DLOs were neither reduced under these conditions, nor were their effects reversed upon the addition of exogenous mannose. Analysis of DLO intermediates by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis demonstrated that 5-thiomannose-containing glycosides block DLO biosynthesis most likely at a stage prior to the GlcNAc(2) Man(3) intermediate, on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum.	0
Abstract2class: Biochemical characterization and subcellular localization of the sterol C-24(28) reductase, erg4p, from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The yeast ERG4 gene encodes sterol C-24(28) reductase which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of ergosterol. Deletion of ERG4 resulted in a complete lack of ergosterol and accumulation of the precursor ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol. An erg4 mutant strain exhibited pleiotropic defects such as hypersensitivity to divalent cations and a number of drugs such as cycloheximide, miconazole, 4-nitroquinoline, fluconazole, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Similar to erg6 mutants, erg4 mutants are sensitive to the Golgi-destabilizing drug brefeldin A. Enzyme activity measurements with isolated subcellular fractions revealed that Erg4p is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This view was confirmed in vivo by fluorescence microscopy of a strain expressing a functional fusion of Erg4p to enhanced green fluorescent protein. We conclude that ergosterol biosynthesis is completed in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the final product is supplied from there to its membranous destinations.	0
Abstract2class: Bacteriophage T7 morphogenesis and gene 10 frameshifting in Escherichia coli showing different degrees of ribosomal fidelity Abstract: Bacteriophage T7 infection has been studied in Escherichia coli strains showing both increased and decreased ribosome fidelity and in the presence of streptomycin, which stimulates translational misreading, in an effort to determine effects on the apparent programmed translational frameshift that occurs during synthesis of the gene 10 capsid protein. Quantitation of the protein bands from SDS-PAGE failed to detect any significant effects on the amounts of the shifted 10B protein relative to the in-frame 10A protein under all fidelity conditions tested. However, any changes in fidelity conditions led to inhibition of phage morphogenesis in single-step growth experiments, which could not be accounted for by reduced amounts of phage protein synthesis, nor, at least in the case of decreased accuracy, by reduced amounts of phage DNA synthesis. Reduction in phage DNA synthesis did appear to account for a substantial proportion of the reduction in phage yield seen under conditions of increased accuracy. Similar effects of varying ribosomal fidelity on growth were also seen with phage T3, and to a lesser extent with phage T4. The absence of change in the high-frequency T7 gene 10 frameshift differs from earlier reports that ribosomal fidelity affects low-frequency frameshift errors.	0
Abstract2class: Formation of an Angular Aromatic Polyketide from a Linear Anthrene Precursor via Oxidative Rearrangement Abstract: Bacterial aromatic polyketides are a group of natural products synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) that show diverse structures and biological activities. They are structurally subclassified into linear, angular, and discoid aromatic polyketides, the formation of which is commonly determined by the shaping and folding of the poly-β-keto intermediates under the concerted actions of the minimal PKSs, cyclases and ketoreductases. Murayaquinone, found in several streptomycetes, possesses an unusual tricyclic angular aromatic polyketide core containing a 9,10-phenanthraquinone. In this study, genes essential for murayaquinone biosynthesis were identified, and a linear anthraoxirene intermediate was discovered. A unique biosynthetic model for the angular aromatic polyketide formation was discovered and confirmed through in vivo and in vitro studies. Three oxidoreductases, MrqO3, MrqO6, and MrqO7, were identified to catalyze the conversion of the linear aromatic polyketide intermediate into the final angularly arranged framework, which exemplifies a novel strategy for the biosynthesis of angular aromatic polyketides.	1
Abstract2class: Restricted expression of Epstein-Barr virus latent genes in murine B cells derived from embryonic stem cells Abstract: Background:                       Several human malignancies are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and more than 95% of the adult human population carries this virus lifelong. EBV efficiently infects human B cells and persists in this cellular compartment latently. EBV-infected B cells become activated and growth transformed, express a characteristic set of viral latent genes, and acquire the status of proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines in vitro. Because EBV infects only primate cells, it has not been possible to establish a model of infection in immunocompetent rodents. Such a model would be most desirable in order to study EBV's pathogenesis and latency in a suitable and amenable host.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       We stably introduced recombinant EBV genomes into mouse embryonic stem cells and induced their differentiation to B cells in vitro to develop the desired model. In vitro differentiated murine B cells maintained the EBV genomes but expression of viral genes was restricted to the latent membrane proteins (LMPs). In contrast to human B cells, EBV's nuclear antigens (EBNAs) were not expressed detectably and growth transformed murine B cells did not arise in vitro. Aberrant splicing and premature termination of EBNA mRNAs most likely prevented the expression of EBNA genes required for B-cell transformation.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Our findings indicate that fundamental differences in gene regulation between mouse and man might block the route towards a tractable murine model for EBV.	0
Abstract2class: An unusually large multifunctional polypeptide in the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.	1
Abstract2class: Salivaricin D, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c isolated from a healthy infant Abstract: In this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin D) from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c. Salivaricin D is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 Da); the locus of the gene encoding this peptide is a 16.5-kb DNA segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an ABC transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and ABC transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. The immunity gene (salI) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin D, confirming its immunity function. Salivaricin D is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. It is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of Gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a probiotic bacterium.	1
Abstract2class: Genotyping of Bacillus cereus strains by microarray-based resequencing Abstract: The ability to distinguish microbial pathogens from closely related but nonpathogenic strains is key to understanding the population biology of these organisms. In this regard, Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes inhalational anthrax, is of interest because it is closely related and often difficult to distinguish from other members of the B. cereus group that can cause diverse diseases. We employed custom-designed resequencing arrays (RAs) based on the genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis to generate 422 kb of genomic sequence from a panel of 41 Bacillus cereus sensu lato strains. Here we show that RAs represent a "one reaction" genotyping technology with the ability to discriminate between highly similar B. anthracis isolates and more divergent strains of the B. cereus s.l. Clade 1. Our data show that RAs can be an efficient genotyping technology for pre-screening the genetic diversity of large strain collections to selected the best candidates for whole genome sequencing.	0
Abstract2class: Inhibition of heat shock transcription factor binding by a linear polyamide binding in an unusual 1:1 mode Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to protect cells from heat, oxidative stress, and the cytotoxic effects of drugs, and thus can enhance cancer cell survival. As a result, HSPs are a newly emerging class of protein targets for chemotherapy. Among the various HSPs, the HSP70 family is the most highly conserved and prevalent. Herein we describe the development of a β-alanine rich linear polyamide that binds the GGA heat shock elements (HSEs) 3 and 4 in the HSP70 promoter in an unusual 1:1 mode and inhibits heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) binding in vitro.	0
Abstract2class: The neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces carzinostaticus ATCC 15944 involving two iterative type I polyketide synthases Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin (NCS) was localized to 130 kb continuous DNA from Streptomyces carzinostaticus ATCC15944 and confirmed by gene inactivation. DNA sequence analysis of 92 kb of the cloned region revealed 68 open reading frames (ORFs), 47 of which were determined to constitute the NCS cluster. Sequence analysis of the genes within the NCS cluster suggested dNDP-D-mannose as a precursor for the deoxy aminosugar, revealed two distinct type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), and supported a convergent model for NCS chromophore biosynthesis from the deoxy aminosugar, naphthoic acid, and enediyne core building blocks. These findings shed light into deoxysugar biosynthesis, further support the iterative type I PKS paradigm for enediyne core biosynthesis, and unveil a mechanism for microbial polycyclic aromatic polyketide biosynthesis by an iterative type I PKS.	1
Abstract2class: Dual Role of Surface Hydroxyl Groups in the Photodynamics and Performance of NiO-Based Photocathodes Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells containing photocathodes based on functionalized NiO show a promising solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Here, we present mechanistic understanding of the photoinduced charge transfer processes occurring at the photocathode/electrolyte interface. We demonstrate via advanced photophysical characterization that surface hydroxyl groups formed at the NiO/water interface not only promote photoinduced hole transfer from the dye into NiO, but also enhance the rate of charge recombination. Both processes are significantly slower when the photocathode is exposed to dry acetonitrile, while in air an intermediate behavior is observed. These data suggest that highly efficient devices can be developed by balancing the quantity of surface hydroxyl groups of NiO, and presumably of other p-type metal oxide semiconductors.	0
Abstract2class: Measurement of endothelial cell free radical generation: evidence for a central mechanism of free radical injury in postischemic tissues Abstract: Oxygen free radicals have been demonstrated to be important mediators of postischemic reperfusion injury in a broad variety of tissues; however, the cellular source of free radical generation is still unknown. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate that bovine endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation become potent generators of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A prominent DMPO-OH signal aN = aH = 14.9 G is observed on reoxygenation after 45 min of anoxic incubation. Quantitative measurements of this free radical generation and the time course of radical generation are performed. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase totally abolish this radical signal, suggesting that O2 is sequentially reduced from O2-. to H2O2 to OH.. Addition of ethanol resulted in trapping of the ethoxy radical, further confirming the generation of OH.. Endothelial radical generation was shown to cause cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake. Radical generation was partially inhibited and partially scavenged by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Marked inhibition of radical generation was observed with the potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, conditions observed in ischemic and reperfused tissues, generate a burst of superoxide-derived hydroxyl free radicals that in turn cause cell injury and cell death. Most of this free radical generation appears to be from the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Thus, endothelial cell free radical generation may be a central mechanism of cellular injury in postischemic tissues.	0
Abstract2class: A high-throughput screen for chemical inhibitors of exocytic transport in yeast Abstract: Most of the components of the membrane and protein traffic machinery were discovered by perturbing their functions, either with bioactive compounds or by mutations. However, the mechanisms responsible for exocytic transport vesicle formation at the Golgi and endosomes are still largely unknown. Both the exocytic traffic routes and the signaling pathways that regulate these routes are highly complex and robust, so that defects can be overcome by alternate pathways or mechanisms. A classical yeast genetic screen designed to account for the robustness of the exocytic pathway identified a novel conserved gene, AVL9, which functions in late exocytic transport. We now describe a chemical-genetic version of the mutant screen, in which we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen of a large compound library and identified novel small-molecule secretory inhibitors. To maximize the number and diversity of our hits, the screen was performed in a pdr5Delta snq2Delta mutant background, which lacks two transporters responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance. However, we found that deletion of both transporters reduced the fitness of our screen strain, whereas the pdr5Delta mutation had a relatively small effect on growth and was also the more important transporter mutation for conferring sensitivity to our hits. In this and similar chemical-genetic yeast screens, using just a single pump mutation might be sufficient for increasing hit diversity while minimizing the physiological effects of transporter mutations.	0
Abstract2class: Accurate prediction of secondary metabolite gene clusters in filamentous fungi Abstract: Biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites from fungi are currently subject to an intense effort to elucidate the genetic basis for these compounds due to their large potential within pharmaceutics and synthetic biochemistry. The preferred method is methodical gene deletions to identify supporting enzymes for key synthases one cluster at a time. In this study, we design and apply a DNA expression array for Aspergillus nidulans in combination with legacy data to form a comprehensive gene expression compendium. We apply a guilt-by-association-based analysis to predict the extent of the biosynthetic clusters for the 58 synthases active in our set of experimental conditions. A comparison with legacy data shows the method to be accurate in 13 of 16 known clusters and nearly accurate for the remaining 3 clusters. Furthermore, we apply a data clustering approach, which identifies cross-chemistry between physically separate gene clusters (superclusters), and validate this both with legacy data and experimentally by prediction and verification of a supercluster consisting of the synthase AN1242 and the prenyltransferase AN11080, as well as identification of the product compound nidulanin A. We have used A. nidulans for our method development and validation due to the wealth of available biochemical data, but the method can be applied to any fungus with a sequenced and assembled genome, thus supporting further secondary metabolite pathway elucidation in the fungal kingdom.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic pathway for mannopeptimycins, lipoglycopeptide antibiotics active against drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens Abstract: The mannopeptimycins are a novel class of lipoglycopeptide antibiotics active against multidrug-resistant pathogens with potential as clinically useful antibacterials. This report is the first to describe the biosynthesis of this novel class of mannosylated lipoglycopeptides. Included here are the cloning, sequencing, annotation, and manipulation of the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 30439. Encoded by genes within the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic gene cluster are enzymes responsible for the generation of the hexapeptide core (nonribosomal peptide synthetases [NRPS]) and tailoring reactions (mannosylation, isovalerylation, hydroxylation, and methylation). The NRPS system is noncanonical in that it has six modules utilizing only five amino acid-specific adenylation domains and it lacks a prototypical NRPS macrocyclizing thioesterase domain. Analysis of the mannopeptimycin gene cluster and its engineering has elucidated the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic pathway and provides the framework to make new and improved mannopeptimycins biosynthetically.	1
Abstract2class: Production of lipopeptides in Bacillus sp. CS93 isolated from Pozol Abstract: Bacillus sp. strain CS93, which was previously isolated from Pozol, was previously shown to produce iturin A, bacilysin and chlorotetaine. To investigate the biosynthetic mechanism of chlorotetaine production, the bac genes were amplified from genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. CS93 by PCR and sequenced. The genes bacABCDE were determined, but no gene that might code for a halogenating enzyme was detected either within the gene cluster or in the flanking sequences. Following further analysis of culture supernatants that were active against bacteria by liquid chromatography-MS, it was not possible to detect bacilysin/chlorotetaine. However, in methanolic fractions containing antibacterial activity, molecular ions characteristic of surfactins and fengycin were detectable by electrospray MS. Using primers complementary for conserved regions of nonribosomal peptide synthase, it was possible to amplify gene fragments that had a high degree of homology with known surfactin and fengycin biosynthetic genes. Thus, in addition to the known antimicrobial compounds, we have shown that this strain produces other bioactive lipopeptides, which might account for some of the medicinal properties of Pozol.	1
Abstract2class: The insect pathogen Serratia marcescens Db10 uses a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase to produce the antibiotic althiomycin Abstract: There is a continuing need to discover new bioactive natural products, such as antibiotics, in genetically-amenable micro-organisms. We observed that the enteric insect pathogen, Serratia marcescens Db10, produced a diffusible compound that inhibited the growth of Bacillis subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus. Mapping the genetic locus required for this activity revealed a putative natural product biosynthetic gene cluster, further defined to a six-gene operon named alb1-alb6. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by alb1-6 predicted a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) assembly line (Alb4/5/6), tailoring enzymes (Alb2/3) and an export/resistance protein (Alb1), and suggested that the machinery assembled althiomycin or a related molecule. Althiomycin is a ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic whose biosynthetic machinery had been elusive for decades. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed that wild type S. marcescens produced althiomycin and that production was eliminated on disruption of the alb gene cluster. Construction of mutants with in-frame deletions of specific alb genes demonstrated that Alb2-Alb5 were essential for althiomycin production, whereas Alb6 was required for maximal production of the antibiotic. A phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was also identified. Expression of Alb1, a predicted major facilitator superfamily efflux pump, conferred althiomycin resistance on another, sensitive, strain of S. marcescens. This is the first report of althiomycin production outside of the Myxobacteria or Streptomyces and paves the way for future exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery, since S. marcescens represents a convenient and tractable producing organism.	1
Abstract2class: Endophytic Bacterium-Triggered Reactive Oxygen Species Directly Increase Oxygenous Sesquiterpenoid Content and Diversity in Atractylodes lancea Abstract: Oxygenous terpenoids are active components of many medicinal plants. However, current studies that have focused on enzymatic oxidation reactions cannot comprehensively clarify the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis and diversity. This study shows that an endophytic bacterium can trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that directly increase oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in Atractylodes lancea. A. lancea is a famous but endangered Chinese medicinal plant that contains abundant oxygenous sesquiterpenoids. Geo-authentic A. lancea produces a wider range and a greater abundance of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids than the cultivated herb. Our previous studies have shown the mechanisms behind endophytic promotion of the production of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbon scaffolds; however, how endophytes promote the formation of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids and their diversity is unclear. After colonization by Pseudomonas fluorescens ALEB7B, oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in A. lancea occur synchronously. Treatment with exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or singlet oxygen induces oxidative burst and promotes oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in planta. Conversely, pretreatment of plantlets with the ROS scavenger ascorbic acid significantly inhibits the oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation induced by P. fluorescens ALEB7B. Further in vitro oxidation experiments show that several oxygenous sesquiterpenoids can be obtained from direct oxidation caused by H2O2 or singlet oxygen. In summary, this study demonstrates that endophytic bacterium-triggered ROS can directly oxidize oxygen-free sesquiterpenoids and increase the oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in A. lancea, providing a novel explanation of the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis in planta and an essential complementarity to enzymatic oxidation reactions.	0
Abstract2class: Nucleic acid aptamers: an emerging frontier in cancer therapy Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of nucleic acid aptamers in a variety of fields, including target analysis, disease therapy, and molecular and cellular engineering. The efficient and widely applicable aptamer selection, reproducible chemical synthesis and modification, generally impressive target binding selectivity and affinity, relatively rapid tissue penetration, low immunogenicity, and rapid systemic clearance make aptamers ideal recognition elements for use as therapeutics or for in vivo delivery of therapeutics. In this feature article, we discuss the development and biomedical application of nucleic acid aptamers, with emphasis on cancer cell aptamer isolation, targeted cancer therapy, oncology biomarker identification and drug discovery.	0
Abstract2class: The novel gluconeogenesis inhibitors FR225659 and FR225656 from Helicomyces sp. No. 19353. III. Structure determination Abstract: During the course of screening for novel gluconeogenesis inhibitors, FR225659 and its related compounds were isolated from a fermentation broth of Helicomyces sp. No. 19353. Spectroscopic analysis concluded that FR225659 is an N-acyl tripeptide consisting of a novel acyl, a 3-chloro-4-hydroxyarginine, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylproline and a dehydrovaline. Degradation study allowed assignment of the absolute configuration of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylproline to be (2S,3R). FR225656 was shown to possess a dehydroisoleucine instead of the dehydrovaline of FR225659.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the pyrrolidine protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin involves novel gene ensemble and cryptic biosynthetic steps Abstract: The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin features a unique benzylpyrrolidine system and exhibits diverse biological and pharmacologic activities. Its biosynthetic origin has remained obscure for more than 60 y, however. Here we report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of anisomycin in Streptomyces hygrospinosus var. beijingensis by a bioactivity-guided high-throughput screening method. Using a combination of bioinformatic analysis, reverse genetics, chemical analysis, and in vitro biochemical assays, we have identified a core four-gene ensemble responsible for the synthesis of the pyrrolidine system in anisomycin: aniQ, encoding a aminotransferase that catalyzes an initial deamination and a later reamination steps; aniP, encoding a transketolase implicated to bring together an glycolysis intermediate with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid to form the anisomycin molecular backbone; aniO, encoding a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes a cryptic glycosylation crucial for downstream enzyme processing; and aniN, encoding a bifunctional dehydrogenase that mediates multistep pyrrolidine formation. The results reveal a BGC for pyrrolidine alkaloid biosynthesis that is distinct from known bacterial alkaloid pathways, and provide the signature sequences that will facilitate the discovery of BGCs encoding novel pyrrolidine alkaloids in bacterial genomes. The biosynthetic insights from this study further set the foundation for biosynthetic engineering of pyrrolidine antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Druggability-Improved Analogues by Investigation of the LL-D49194α1 Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of antitumor antibiotic LL-D49194α1 (LLD) was identified and comparatively analyzed with that of trioxacarcins. The tailoring genes encoding glycosyltransferase, methyltransferase and cytochrome P450 were systematically deleted, which led to the discovery of eight compounds from the mutants. Preliminary pharmaceutical evaluation revealed two intermediates exhibiting higher cytotoxicity, stability and solubility. These results highlighted the modification pathway for LLD biosynthesis, and provided highly potent, structurally simplified "unnatural" natural products with improved druggability.	1
Abstract2class: Harnessing the synthetic capabilities of glycopeptide antibiotic tailoring enzymes: characterization of the UK-68,597 biosynthetic cluster Abstract: In this study, a draft genome sequence of Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 53533 was assembled, and an 81-kb biosynthetic cluster for the unusual sulfated glycopeptide UK-68,597 was identified. Glycopeptide antibiotics are important in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Glycopeptides contain heptapeptide backbones that are modified by many tailoring enzymes, including glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, methyltransferases, and halogenases, generating extensive chemical and functional diversity. Several tailoring enzymes in the cluster were examined in vitro for their ability to modify glycopeptides, resulting in the synthesis of novel molecules. Tailoring enzymes were also expressed in the producer of the glycopeptide aglycone A47934, generating additional chemical diversity. This work characterizes the biosynthetic program of UK-68,597 and demonstrates the capacity to expand glycopeptide chemical diversity by harnessing the unique chemistry of tailoring enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Comparative characterization of fungal anthracenone and naphthacenedione biosynthetic pathways reveals an α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen-like cyclization catalyzed by a dimanganese thioesterase Abstract: The linear tetracyclic TAN-1612 (1) and BMS-192548 (2) were isolated from different filamentous fungal strains and have been examined as potential neuropeptide Y and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, respectively. Although the biosynthesis of fungal aromatic polyketides has attracted much interest in recent years, the biosynthetic mechanism for such naphthacenedione-containing products has not been established. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we first located the ada gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015. The connection between 1 and the ada pathway was verified through overexpression of the Zn(2)Cys(6)-type pathway-specific transcriptional regulator AdaR and subsequent gene expression analysis. The enzymes encoded in the ada gene cluster share high sequence similarities to the known apt pathway linked to the biosynthesis of anthraquinone asperthecin 3. Subsequent comparative investigation of these two highly homologous gene clusters by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a novel α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen cyclization cascade, which involves a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that hydroxylates the α-carbon of an acyl carrier protein-bound polyketide and a bifunctional metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase (MβL-TE). The bifunctional MβL-TE catalyzes the fourth ring cyclization to afford the naphthacenedione scaffold upon α-hydroxylation, whereas it performs hydrolytic release of an anthracenone product in the absence of α-hydroxylation. Through in vitro biochemical characterizations and metal analyses, we verified that the apt MβL-TE is a dimanganese enzyme and requires both Mn(2+) cations for the observed activities. The MβL-TE is the first example of a thioesterase in polyketide biosynthesis that catalyzes the Claisen-like condensation without an α/β hydrolase fold and forms no covalent bond with the substrate. These mechanistic features should be general to the biosynthesis of tetracyclic naphthacenedione compounds in fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Neuronal store-operated calcium entry pathway as a novel therapeutic target for Huntington's disease treatment Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion within Huntingtin (Htt) protein. In the phenotypic screen we identified a class of quinazoline-derived compounds that delayed a progression of a motor phenotype in transgenic Drosophila HD flies. We found that the store-operated calcium (Ca(2+)) entry (SOC) pathway activity is enhanced in neuronal cells expressing mutant Htt and that the identified compounds inhibit SOC pathway in HD neurons. The same compounds exerted neuroprotective effects in glutamate-toxicity assays with YAC128 medium spiny neurons primary cultures. We demonstrated a key role of TRPC1 channels in supporting SOC pathway in HD neurons. We concluded that the TRPC1-mediated neuronal SOC pathway constitutes a novel target for HD treatment and that the identified compounds represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for treatment of HD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.	0
Abstract2class: Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and tailoring enzymes in the biosynthesis of the tetracyclic quinone glycoside antibiotic polyketomycin Abstract: Polyketomycin is a tetracyclic quinone glycoside produced by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü6028. It shows cytotoxic and antibiotic activity, in particular against Gram-positive multi-drug-resistant strains (for example, MRSA). The polyketomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and characterised. Its identity was proven by inactivation of a alpha-ketoacyl synthase gene (pokP1) of the "minimal polyketide synthase II" system. In order to obtain valuable information about tailoring steps, we performed further gene-inactivation experiments. The generation of mutants with deletions in oxygenase genes (pokO1, pokO2, both in parallel and pokO4) and methyltransferase genes (pokMT1, pokMT2 and pokMT3) resulted in new polyketomycin derivatives, and provided information about the organisation of the biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: The mcyF gene of the microcystin biosynthetic gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa encodes an aspartate racemase Abstract: Microcystins are hepatotoxic, non-ribosomal peptides produced by several genera of freshwater cyanobacteria. Among other enzymic activities, in particular those of peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases, microcystin biosynthesis requires racemases that provide D-aspartate and D-glutamate. Here, we report on the cloning, expression and characterization of an open reading frame, mcyF, that is part of the mcy gene cluster involved in microcystin biosynthesis in the Microcystis aeruginosa strain PCC 7806. Conserved amino acid sequence motifs suggest a function of the McyF protein as an aspartate racemase. Heterologous expression of mcyF in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 yielded an active His(6)-tagged protein that was purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-nitriloacetate affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant protein racemized in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-independent manner L-aspartate, but not L-glutamate. Furthermore, we have identified a putative glutamate racemase gene that is located outside the mcy gene cluster in the M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 genome. Whereas homologues of this glutamate racemase gene are present in all the Microcystis strains examined, mcyF could only be detected in microcystin-producing strains.	1
Abstract2class: Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) to unlock natural product biosynthetic potential Abstract: Specialized metabolites from bacteria are an important source of inspiration for drug development. The genes required for the biosynthesis of such metabolites in bacteria are usually organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Using modern bioinformatic tools, the wealth of genomic data can be scanned for such BGCs and the expected products can often structurally be predicted in silico. This facilitates the directed discovery of putatively novel bacterial metabolites. However, the production of these molecules often requires genetic manipulation of the BGC for activation or the expression of the pathway in a heterologous host. The latter necessitates the transplantation of the BGC into a suitable expression system. To achieve this goal, powerful cloning strategies based on in vivo homologous recombination have recently been developed. This includes LCHR and LLHR in E. coli as well as TAR cloning in yeast. Here, we present Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) as an efficient complementary BGC capturing strategy that relies on long-amplicon PCR and in vitro DNA assembly. This straightforward approach facilitates full pathway assembly, BGC refactoring and direct transfer into any vector backbone in vitro. The broad applicability and efficiency of DiPaC is demonstrated by the discovery of a new phenazine from Serratia fonticola, the first heterologous production of anabaenopeptins from Nostoc punctiforme and the transfer of the native erythromycin BGC from Saccharopolyspora erythraea into Streptomyces. Due to its simplicity, we envisage DiPaC to become an essential method for BGC cloning and metabolic pathways construction with significant applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and biotechnology.	1
Abstract2class: Yeast homologous recombination-based promoter engineering for the activation of silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Large-scale sequencing of prokaryotic (meta)genomic DNA suggests that most bacterial natural product gene clusters are not expressed under common laboratory culture conditions. Silent gene clusters represent a promising resource for natural product discovery and the development of a new generation of therapeutics. Unfortunately, the characterization of molecules encoded by these clusters is hampered owing to our inability to express these gene clusters in the laboratory. To address this bottleneck, we have developed a promoter-engineering platform to transcriptionally activate silent gene clusters in a model heterologous host. Our approach uses yeast homologous recombination, an auxotrophy complementation-based yeast selection system and sequence orthogonal promoter cassettes to exchange all native promoters in silent gene clusters with constitutively active promoters. As part of this platform, we constructed and validated a set of bidirectional promoter cassettes consisting of orthogonal promoter sequences, Streptomyces ribosome binding sites, and yeast selectable marker genes. Using these tools we demonstrate the ability to simultaneously insert multiple promoter cassettes into a gene cluster, thereby expediting the reengineering process. We apply this method to model active and silent gene clusters (rebeccamycin and tetarimycin) and to the silent, cryptic pseudogene-containing, environmental DNA-derived Lzr gene cluster. Complete promoter refactoring and targeted gene exchange in this "dead" cluster led to the discovery of potent indolotryptoline antiproliferative agents, lazarimides A and B. This potentially scalable and cost-effective promoter reengineering platform should streamline the discovery of natural products from silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Abstract2class: A complex ergovaline gene cluster in epichloe endophytes of grasses Abstract: Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes of the genera Epichloë and Neotyphodium form symbioses with grasses of the subfamily Pooideae, in which they can synthesize an array of bioprotective alkaloids. Some strains produce the ergopeptine alkaloid ergovaline, which is implicated in livestock toxicoses caused by ingestion of endophyte-infected grasses. Cloning and analysis of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene from Neotyphodium lolii revealed a putative gene cluster for ergovaline biosynthesis containing a single-module NRPS gene, lpsB, and other genes orthologous to genes in the ergopeptine gene cluster of Claviceps purpurea and the clavine cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. Despite conservation of gene sequence, gene order is substantially different between the N. lolii, C. purpurea, and A. fumigatus ergot alkaloid gene clusters. Southern analysis indicated that the N. lolii cluster was linked with previously identified ergovaline biosynthetic genes dmaW and lpsA. The ergovaline genes are closely associated with transposon relics, including retrotransposons and autonomous and nonautonomous DNA transposons. All genes in the cluster were highly expressed in planta, but expression was very low or undetectable in mycelia from axenic culture. This work provides a genetic foundation for elucidating biochemical steps in the ergovaline pathway, the ecological role of individual ergot alkaloid compounds, and the regulation of their synthesis in planta.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of a novel plasmid-borne thiopeptide gene cluster in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 115 Abstract: Thiopeptides are small (12- to 17-amino-acid), heavily modified peptides of bacterial origin. This antibiotic family, with more than 100 known members, is characterized by the presence of sulfur-containing heterocyclic rings and dehydrated residues within a macrocyclic peptide structure. Thiopeptides, including micrococcin P1, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and even protozoa. Micrococcin P1 is known to target the ribosome; however, like those of other thiopeptides, its biosynthesis and mechanisms of self-immunity are poorly characterized. We have discovered an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harboring the genes for thiopeptide production and self-protection on a 24-kb plasmid. Here we report the characterization of this plasmid, identify the antimicrobial peptide that it encodes, and provide evidence of a target replacement-mediated mechanism of self-immunity.	1
Abstract2class: Microbial features of mature and abandoned soils in refractory clay deposits Abstract: Processes of soil restoration in anthropogenically disturbed soils is an urgent topic in modern ecology and nature management. Being mediator between mineral soil composition and plant vegetation, soil microbial community is important factor of soil restoration processes. Analysis of main soil nutrition components followed by 16S amplicon sequencing are sufficient methods for primary analysis of novel locations. Here is the primary analysis in a novel location in Northwest Europe (Russia). Main nutrition parameters (pH, P, Na and NH4+) and 16S rDNA Illumina amplicons were explored in abandoned soils from sandy pit quarry (2 sites) and refractory clay mining dumps (4 sites).Microbial communities of mature soils and dumps are variable and different in terms both nutritional and microbial components. pH, N and TOC are strong predictors for microbial composition. Dumps of refractory clays pQ_2 are non-developed soils, highly acidic and form specific microbial community. Differences between dumps and mature soils in both pre-quaternary and quaternary soils are connected with specific bacterial taxa. Those taxa are connected more with plant composition, not the soil properties themselves. The exact changes in microbial community are unique for different soils and areas.	0
Abstract2class: Partial activation of a silent angucycline-type gene cluster from a rubromycin beta producing Streptomyces sp. PGA64 Abstract: In the course of DNA-fingerprinting our strain collection for antibiotic biosynthesis genes, two different type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters were observed from Streptomyces sp. PGA64. Phylogenetic analysis placed these together with known rubromycin and angucycline biosynthetic gene clusters. The host strain itself has a very clean production profile of secondary metabolites, which composes mainly of rubromycin beta under typical fermentation conditions. Sequencing of a 16.5 kb fragment from the putative angucycline cluster revealed eight genes that were homologous to typical type II PKS genes responsible for synthesizing aromatic polyketides. These genes were especially similar to genes from known angucycline biosynthetic gene clusters and also synteny to these clusters was observed. In addition, three genes were recognized that are needed for priming the minimal PKS complex before polyketide synthesis can initiate, but which are not normally found to cluster with antibiotic biosynthesis genes. A putative repressor gene that was dissimilar to repressor genes found from well-characterized antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters was also discovered. Gene disruption of the repressor resulted in partial activation of the cluster and production of two angucycline metabolites, UWM6 and rabelomycin. The results confirm that the DNA-fingerprinting method we have developed can be used to correctly detect compounds that are not visible in chemical screens.	1
Abstract2class: Oxidase domains in epothilone and bleomycin biosynthesis: thiazoline to thiazole oxidation during chain elongation Abstract: The natural products epothilone and bleomycin are assembled by hybrid polyketide/nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Of note in these assembly lines is the conversion of internal cysteine residues into thiazolines and their subsequent oxidation to heteroaromatic thiazole rings. We have excised the EpoB oxidase domain, EpoB-Ox, proposed to be responsible for thiazoline to thiazole oxidation in epothilone biosynthesis, and expressed it in soluble form in Escherichia coli. The purified domain is an FMN-containing flavoprotein that demonstrates thiazoline to thiazole oxidase activity when incubated with thioester substrate mimics. Kinetic parameters were determined for both thiazoline and oxazoline substrates, with k(cat) values ranging between 48.8 and 0.55 min(-1). While the physiological electron acceptor is not yet known, molecular oxygen is needed in these in vitro assays to mediate reoxidation of reduced FMN. Additionally, the oxidase domain-containing BlmIII from the bleomycin assembly line was heterologously expressed and purified. BlmIII is also an FMN-containing protein with activity similar to EpoB-Ox. This work marks the first direct characterization of nonribosomal peptide synthetase oxidase domain activity and will lead to further exploration of these flavoproteins.	1
Abstract2class: High-resolution NMR analysis of the conformations of native and base analog substituted retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon PPT primers Abstract: A purine-rich region of the plus-strand RNA genome of retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons, known as the polypurine tract (PPT), is resistant to hydrolysis by the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT) and ultimately serves as a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. The mechanisms underlying PPT resistance and selective processing remain largely unknown. Here, two RNA/DNA hybrids derived from the PPTs of HIV-1 and Ty3 were probed using high-resolution NMR for preexisting structural distortions in the absence of RT. The PPTs were selectively modified through base-pair changes or by incorporation of the thymine isostere, 2,4-difluoro-5-methylbenzene (dF), into the DNA strand. Although both wild-type (WT) and mutated hybrids adopted global A-form-like helical geometries, observed structural perturbations in the base-pair and dF-modified hybrids suggested that the PPT hybrids may function as structurally coupled domains.	0
Abstract2class: Some properties of site-specific nickase BspD6I and the possibility of its use in hybridization analysis of DNA Abstract: A new method for hybridization analysis of nucleic acids is proposed on the basis of the ability of site-specific nickases to cleave only one DNA strand. The method is based on the use of a labeled oligonucleotide with the recognition site of the nickase hybridized with the target (DNA or RNA) at an optimal temperature of the enzyme (55 degrees C). The two shorter oligonucleotides formed after the cleavage with the nickase do not complex with the target. Thus, a multiple cleavage of the labeled oligonucleotide takes place on one target molecule. The cleavage of the nucleotide is recorded either by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (when a radioactive labeled oligonucleotide is used) or by fluorescence measurements (if the oligonucleotide has the structure of a molecular beacon). The new method was tested on nickase BspD6I and a radioactive oligonucleotide complementary to the polylinker region of the viral DNA strand in bacteriophage M13mp19. Unfortunately, nickase BspD6I does not cleave DNA in the RNA-DNA duplexes and therefore cannot be used for detection of RNA targets.	0
Abstract2class: The AcbC protein from Actinoplanes species is a C7-cyclitol synthase related to 3-dehydroquinate synthases and is involved in the biosynthesis of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose Abstract: The putative biosynthetic gene cluster for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose was identified in the producer Actinoplanes sp. 50/110 by cloning a DNA segment containing the conserved gene for dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, acbB. The two flanking genes were acbA (dTDP-D-glucose synthase) and acbC, encoding a protein with significant similarity to 3-dehydroquinate synthases (AroB proteins). The acbC gene was overexpressed heterologously in Streptomyces lividans 66, and the product was shown to be a C7-cyclitol synthase using sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate, but not ido-heptulose 7-phosphate, as its substrate. The cyclization product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanon-2,3,4,5-tetrol), is a precursor of the valienamine moiety of acarbose. A possible five-step reaction mechanism is proposed for the cyclization reaction catalyzed by AcbC based on the recent analysis of the three-dimensional structure of a eukaryotic 3-dehydroquinate synthase domain (Carpenter, E. P., Hawkins, A. R., Frost, J. W., and Brown, K. A. (1998) Nature 394, 299-302).	1

Abstract2class: Peplomycin sulfate and pulmonary fibrosis: hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase in lungs of hamsters treated with peplomycin Abstract: Effect of peplomycin sulfate (PLM) on pulmonary fibrosis was examined. Hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16) in lungs of hamsters treated with PLM were studied and compared with those of hamsters treated with bleomycin (BLM). PLM, when administered intraperitoneally, one injection daily for 10 consecutive days, at either a high- (5 mg/kg) or low- (2.8 mg/kg) dosage-level, caused no significant increase of lung hydroxyproline and uronic acid as compared with controls. BLM on the other hand effected a significant increase in lung hydroxyproline on the high-dosage level (5 mg/kg) but not on the low-dosage level (2.8 mg/kg). In contrast, when administering PLM intratracheally, the concentrations of hydroxyproline in lungs increased 20% over the control levels. A transient increase of proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase also occurred shortly after the instillation. These increases were also observed in the corresponding groups treated with BLM, which confirmed the previous observations by other investigators. However, the magnitude of the increase was relatively lower in those values of PLM as compared with those of BLM. These data suggested that (1) PLM, when administered with multiple dosages intraperitoneally, showed no significant effect on the elevation of lung hydroxyproline; (2) PLM, when administered with a dose intratracheally, induced pulmonary fibrosis similar to that caused by BLM. However, the hydroxyproline accumulation in lungs of PLM-treated hamsters was less than in those of the BLM-treated; (3) The fibrotic effect on the lungs caused by either PLM or BLM was probably attributed to acceleration of the syntheses of collagen and acidic glycosaminoglycans.	0
Abstract2class: Probing the Action of Chemical Denaturant on an Intrinsically Disordered Protein by Simulation and Experiment Abstract: Chemical denaturants are the most commonly used agents for unfolding proteins and are thought to act by better solvating the unfolded state. Improved solvation is expected to lead to an expansion of unfolded chains with increasing denaturant concentration, providing a sensitive probe of the denaturant action. However, experiments have so far yielded qualitatively different results concerning the effects of chemical denaturation. Studies using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other methods found an increase in radius of gyration with denaturant concentration, but most small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies found no change. This discrepancy therefore challenges our understanding of denaturation mechanism and more generally the accuracy of these experiments as applied to unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we use all-atom molecular simulations to investigate the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride on the structure of the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR, which can be studied by experiment over a wide range of denaturant concentration. Using unbiased molecular simulations with a carefully calibrated denaturant model, we find that the protein chain indeed swells with increasing denaturant concentration. This is due to the favorable association of urea or guanidinium chloride with the backbone of all residues and with the side-chains of almost all residues, with denaturant-water transfer free energies inferred from this association in reasonable accord with experimental estimates. Interactions of the denaturants with the backbone are dominated by hydrogen bonding, while interactions with side-chains include other contributions. By computing FRET efficiencies and SAXS intensities at each denaturant concentration, we show that the simulation trajectories are in accord with both experiments on this protein, demonstrating that there is no fundamental inconsistency between the two types of experiment. Agreement with experiment also supports the picture of chemical denaturation described in our simulations, driven by weak association of denaturant with the protein. Our simulations support some assumptions needed for each experiment to accurately reflect changes in protein size, namely, that the commonly used FRET chromophores do not qualitatively alter the results and that possible effects such as preferential solvent partitioning into the interior of the chain do not interfere with the determination of radius of gyration from the SAXS experiments.	0
Abstract2class: Assembly of dimeric variants of coumermycins by tandem action of the four biosynthetic enzymes CouL, CouM, CouP, and NovN Abstract: Coumermycin A(1) is a member of the aminocoumarin family of antibiotics. Unlike its structural relatives, novobiocin and clorobiocin, coumermycin A(1) is a dimer built on a 3-methyl-2,4-dicarboxypyrrole scaffold and bears two decorated noviose sugar components which are the putative target binding motifs for DNA gyrase. Starting with this scaffold, we have utilized the ligase CouL for mono- and bisamide formation with aminocoumarins to provide substrates for the glycosyltransferase CouM. CouM was subsequently shown to catalyze mono- and bisnoviosylation of the resulting CouL products. CouP was shown to possess 4'-O-methyltransferase activity on products from tandem CouL, CouM assays. A fourth enzyme, NovN, the 3'-O-carbamoyltransferase from the novobiocin operon, was then able to carbamoylate either or both arms of the CouP product. The tandem action of CouL, CouM, CouP, and NovN thus generates a biscarbamoyl analogue of the pseudodimer coumermycin A(1). Starting from alternative dicarboxy scaffolds, these four enzymes can be utilized in tandem to create additional variants of dimeric aminocoumarin antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic structure of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1-encoded cytolytic toxin system and its relationship to lantibiotic determinants Abstract: Pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids are unique to the species Enterococcus faecalis. Many pheromone-responsive plasmids, including those frequently isolated from sites of infection, express a novel cytolysin that possesses both hemolytic and bacteriocin activities. Further, this cytolysin has been shown to be a toxin in several disease models. In the present study, nucleotide sequence determination, mutagenesis, and complementation analysis were used to determine the organization of the E. faecalis plasmid pAD1 cytolysin determinant. Four open reading frames are required for expression of the cytolysin precursor (cylLL, cylLS, cylM, and cylB). The inferred products of two of these open reading frames, CyILL and CyILS, constitute the cytolysin precursor and bear structural resemblance to posttranslationally modified bacteriocins termed lantibiotics. Similarities between the organization of the E. faecalis cytolysin determinant and expression units for lantibiotics exist, indicating that the E. faecalis cytolysin represents a new branch of this class and is the first known to possess toxin activity.	1
Abstract2class: Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy for volumetric and spectral analysis of histological and immunochemical samples Abstract: Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an imaging modality with superb penetration depth and excellent absorption contrast. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that this technique can advance quantitative analysis of conventional chromogenic histochemistry. Because OR-PAM can quantify the absorption contrast at different wavelengths, it is feasible to spectrally resolve the specific biomolecules involved in a staining color. Furthermore, the tomographic capability of OR-PAM allows for noninvasive volumetric imaging of a thick sample without microtoming it. By immunostaining the sample with different chromogenic agents, we further demonstrated the ability of OR-PAM to resolve different types of cells in a coculture sample with imaging depths up to 1 mm. Taken together, the integration of OR-PAM with (immuno)histochemistry offers a simple and versatile technique with broad applications in cell biology, pathology, tissue engineering, and related biomedical studies.	0
Abstract2class: Reevaluation of the violacein biosynthetic pathway and its relationship to indolocarbazole biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic pathways for violacein and for indolocarbazoles (rebeccamycin, staurosporine) include a decarboxylative fusion of two tryptophan units. However, in the case of violacein, one of the tryptophans experiences an unusual 1-->2 shift of the indole ring. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster was previously reported to consist of four genes, vioABCD. Here we studied the violacein pathway through expression of vio genes in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces albus. A pair of genes (vioAB), responsible for the earliest steps in violacein biosynthesis, was functionally equivalent to the homologous pair in the indolocarbazole pathway (rebOD), directing the formation of chromopyrrolic acid. However, chromopyrrolic acid appeared to be a shunt product, not a violacein intermediate. In addition to vioABCD, a fifth gene (vioE) was essential for violacein biosynthesis, specifically for production of the characteristic 1-->2 shift of the indole ring. We also report new findings on the roles played by the VioC and VioD oxygenases, and on the origin of violacein derivatives of the chromoviridans type.	1
Abstract2class: Enantioselective Phenol Coupling by Laccases in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Dimeric Naphthopyrones Abstract: Biaryl compounds are ubiquitous metabolites that are often formed by dimerization through oxidative phenol coupling. Hindered rotation around the biaryl bond can cause axial chirality. In nature, dimerizations are catalyzed by oxidative enzymes such as laccases. This class of enzymes is known for non-specific oxidase reactions while inherent enantioselectivity is hitherto unknown. Here, we describe four related fungal laccases that catalyze γ-naphthopyrone dimerization in a regio- and atropselective manner. In vitro assays revealed that three enzymes were highly P-selective (ee >95 %), while one enzyme showed remarkable flexibility. Its selectivity for M- or P-configured dimers varied depending on the reaction conditions. For example, a lower enzyme concentration yielded primarily (P)-ustilaginoidin A, whereas the M atropisomer was favored at higher concentration. These results demonstrate inherent enantioselectivity in an enzyme class that was previously thought to comprise only non-selective oxidases.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Venturicidin Congeners and Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-4 Abstract: Chemical screening of Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-4 with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the following chromatographic isolation led to the discovery of four 20-membered macrolides, venturicidin A (4) and three new congeners venturicidins D-F (1-3). Genome sequencing of strain S-4 revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding glycosylated type I polyketides (PKS). The BGC designated to venturicidin biosynthesis (ven) was supported by the proposed biosynthetic pathway and confirmed by inactivation of the core PKS gene of venK. Bioinformatic analyses on the conserved motifs and known stereospecificities in PKS modules are consistent with the structure and absolute configuration. This is the first report of venturicidin BGC since the discovery of the macrolide in 1961. In the biological assays, venturicidin A (4) and E (2) displayed a high selective cytotoxicity against acute monocytic leukemia MV-4-11 cells with IC50 values of 0.09 and 0.94 μM, respectively. Venturicidin A (4) also showed a weak inhibitory activity on FMS-like-tyrosine kinase.	1
Abstract2class: Hypoxia enhances stimulus-dependent induction of E-selectin on aortic endothelial cells Abstract: In many diseases, tissue hypoxia occurs in conjunction with other inflammatory processes. Since previous studies have demonstrated a role for leukocytes in ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that endothelial hypoxia may "superinduce" expression of an important leukocyte adhesion molecule, E-selectin (ELAM-1, CD62E). Bovine aortic endothelial monolayers were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell surface E-selectin was quantitated by whole cell ELISA or by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-E-selectin sera. Endothelial mRNA levels were assessed using ribonuclease protection assays. Hypoxia alone did not induce endothelial E-selectin expression. However, enhanced induction of E-selectin was observed with the combination of hypoxia and TNF-alpha (270% increase over normoxia and TNF-alpha) or hypoxia and LPS (190% increase over normoxia and LPS). These studies revealed that a mechanism for such enhancement may be hypoxia-elicited decrements in endothelial intracellular levels of cAMP (<50% compared with normoxia). Addition of forskolin and isobutyl-methyl-xanthine during hypoxia resulted in reversal of cAMP decreases and a loss of enhanced E-selectin surface expression with the combination of TNF-alpha and hypoxia. We conclude that endothelial hypoxia may provide a novel signal for superinduction of E-selectin during states of inflammation.	0
Abstract2class: Bioavailability of Carbohydrate Content in Natural and Transgenic Switchgrasses for the Extreme Thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor bescii Abstract: Improving access to the carbohydrate content of lignocellulose is key to reducing recalcitrance for microbial deconstruction and conversion to fuels and chemicals. Caldicellulosiruptor bescii completely solubilizes naked microcrystalline cellulose, yet this transformation is impeded within the context of the plant cell wall by a network of lignin and hemicellulose. Here, the bioavailability of carbohydrates to C. bescii at 70°C was examined for reduced lignin transgenic switchgrass lines COMT3(+) and MYB Trans, their corresponding parental lines (cultivar Alamo) COMT3(-) and MYB wild type (WT), and the natural variant cultivar Cave-in-Rock (CR). Transgenic modification improved carbohydrate solubilization by C. bescii to 15% (2.3-fold) for MYB and to 36% (1.5-fold) for COMT, comparable to the levels achieved for the natural variant, CR (36%). Carbohydrate solubilization was nearly doubled after two consecutive microbial fermentations compared to one microbial step, but it never exceeded 50% overall. Hydrothermal treatment (180°C) prior to microbial steps improved solubilization 3.7-fold for the most recalcitrant line (MYB WT) and increased carbohydrate recovery to nearly 50% for the least recalcitrant lines [COMT3(+) and CR]. Alternating microbial and hydrothermal steps (T→M→T→M) further increased bioavailability, achieving carbohydrate solubilization ranging from 50% for MYB WT to above 70% for COMT3(+) and CR. Incomplete carbohydrate solubilization suggests that cellulose in the highly lignified residue was inaccessible; indeed, residue from the T→M→T→M treatment was primarily glucan and inert materials (lignin and ash). While C. bescii could significantly solubilize the transgenic switchgrass lines and natural variant tested here, additional or alternative strategies (physical, chemical, enzymatic, and/or genetic) are needed to eliminate recalcitrance.IMPORTANCE Key to a microbial process for solubilization of plant biomass is the organism's access to the carbohydrate content of lignocellulose. Economically viable routes will characteristically minimize physical, chemical, and biological pretreatment such that microbial steps contribute to the greatest extent possible. Recently, transgenic versions of plants and trees have been developed with the intention of lowering the barrier to lignocellulose conversion, with particular focus on lignin content and composition. Here, the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was used to solubilize natural and genetically modified switchgrass lines, with and without the aid of hydrothermal treatment. For lignocellulose conversion, it is clear that the microorganism, plant biomass substrate, and processing steps must all be considered simultaneously to achieve optimal results. Whether switchgrass lines engineered for low lignin or natural variants with desirable properties are used, conversion will depend on microbial access to crystalline cellulose in the plant cell wall.	0
Abstract2class: Effects of ionic strength on bacterial adhesion and stability of flocs in a wastewater activated sludge system Abstract: The success of biological wastewater treatment is to a large extent governed by the ability of bacteria to induce floc formation, thereby facilitating the separation of particles from the treated water. We performed studies on the dynamics of floc stability, the desorption of cells from the flocs, and the reflocculation of detached material. The floc stability was affected by the ionic strength of the medium in a way that strongly suggests that the interactions between the floc components can be explained by the theory of Derjaugin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO theory). At increasing concentrations of electrolytes, the stability of the flocs increased. However, above an ionic strength of about 0.1 the floc stability decreased, and it seems that at this high electrolyte concentration the DLVO theory cannot be applied. The reversibility of the electrostatic double-layer effects was experimentally shown by treating the sludge repeatedly with a low-ionic-strength solution until parts of the flocs detached. When salt was added at this point, flocs re-form, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the turbidity of the supernatant liquid. Both reflocculation and detachment of floc material were seen with calcium as well as with potassium. This finding clearly indicates that the reflocculation and destabilization of flocs were due to changes in double-layer thickness rather than bridging effects of multivalent ions such as calcium. The results indicate that the ionic strength may well be an important factor for the floc stability in wastewater in situ.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of a new diol-containing polyketide by heterologous expression of a silent biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lavendulae FRI-5 Abstract: The genome of streptomycetes has the ability to produce many novel and potentially useful bioactive compounds, but most of which are not produced under standard laboratory cultivation conditions and are referred to as silent/cryptic secondary metabolites. Streptomyces lavendulae FRI-5 produces several types of bioactive compounds. However, this strain may also have the potential to biosynthesize more useful secondary metabolites. Here, we activated a silent biosynthetic gene cluster of an uncharacterized compound from S. lavendulae FRI-5 using heterologous expression. The engineered strain carrying the silent gene cluster produced compound 5, which was undetectable in the culture broth of S. lavendulae FRI-5. Using various spectroscopic analyses, we elucidated the chemical structure of compound 5 (named lavendiol) as a new diol-containing polyketide. The proposed assembly line of lavendiol shows a unique biosynthetic mechanism for polyketide compounds. The results of this study suggest the possibility of discovering more silent useful compounds from streptomycetes by genome mining and heterologous expression.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic variation at the O-antigen biosynthetic locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The outer carbohydrate layer, or O antigen, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa varies markedly in different isolates of these bacteria, and at least 20 distinct O-antigen serotypes have been described. Previous studies have indicated that the major enzymes responsible for O-antigen synthesis are encoded in a cluster of genes that occupy a common genetic locus. We used targeted yeast recombinational cloning to isolate this locus from the 20 internationally recognized serotype strains. DNA sequencing of these isolated segments revealed that at least 11 highly divergent gene clusters occupy this region. Homology searches of the encoded protein products indicated that these gene clusters are likely to direct O-antigen biosynthesis. The O15 serotype strains lack functional gene clusters in the region analyzed, suggesting that O-antigen biosynthesis genes for this serotype are harbored in a different portion of the genome. The overall pattern underscores the plasticity of the P. aeruginosa genome, in which a specific site in a well-conserved genomic region can be occupied by any of numerous islands of functionally related DNA with diverse sequences.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular cloning of the gene cluster for lariatin biosynthesis of Rhodococcus jostii K01-B0171 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for lariatins A and B, anti-mycobacterial peptide antibiotics with a unique "lasso" structure, was cloned from Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus jostii K01-B0171. Random transposition mutagenesis using IS1415 derivative was carried out to identify a chromosomal locus involved in lariatin biosynthesis and six independent lariatin non-producing variants were obtained. Arbitrary PCR revealed that one insertion was located near the region involved in lariatin biosynthesis. Using the lariatin gene as a probe, a genomic library of R. jostii K01-B0171 was screened by colony hybridization, and two clones were obtained. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed that the gene cluster for lariatin biosynthesis spanning about 4.5 kb consisted of five open reading frames (larA to larE). We proposed that the linear precursor LarA is processed by LarB, LarC, and LarD, and the mature lariatin is exported by LarE.	1
Abstract2class: Changes in human fecal microbiota due to chemotherapy analyzed by TaqMan-PCR, 454 sequencing and PCR-DGGE fingerprinting Abstract: Background:                       We investigated whether chemotherapy with the presence or absence of antibiotics against different kinds of cancer changed the gastrointestinal microbiota.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       Feces of 17 ambulant patients receiving chemotherapy with or without concomitant antibiotics were analyzed before and after the chemotherapy cycle at four time points in comparison to 17 gender-, age- and lifestyle-matched healthy controls. We targeted 16S rRNA genes of all bacteria, Bacteroides, bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa as well as C. difficile with TaqMan qPCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing. After a significant drop in the abundance of microbiota (p = 0.037) following a single treatment the microbiota recovered within a few days. The chemotherapeutical treatment marginally affected the Bacteroides while the Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. DGGE fingerprinting showed decreased diversity of Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa in response to chemotherapy with cluster IV diversity being particularly affected by antibiotics. The occurrence of C. difficile in three out of seventeen subjects was accompanied by a decrease in the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Veillonella and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Enterococcus faecium increased following chemotherapy.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Despite high individual variations, these results suggest that the observed changes in the human gut microbiota may favor colonization with C. difficile and Enterococcus faecium. Perturbed microbiota may be a target for specific mitigation with safe pre- and probiotics.	0
Abstract2class: Uncovering production of specialized metabolites by Streptomyces argillaceus: Activation of cryptic biosynthesis gene clusters using nutritional and genetic approaches Abstract: Sequencing of Streptomyces genomes has revealed they harbor a high number of biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC), which uncovered their enormous potentiality to encode specialized metabolites. However, these metabolites are not usually produced under standard laboratory conditions. In this manuscript we report the activation of BGCs for antimycins, carotenoids, germicidins and desferrioxamine compounds in Streptomyces argillaceus, and the identification of the encoded compounds. This was achieved by following different strategies, including changing the growth conditions, heterologous expression of the cluster and inactivating the adpAa or overexpressing the abrC3 global regulatory genes. In addition, three new carotenoid compounds have been identified.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes of the pyripyropene biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium coprobium Abstract: Pyripyropenes are potent inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, which were initially discovered to be produced by Aspergillus fumigatus. Recently, Penicillium coprobium PF1169 has also found to produce pyripyropene A (PyA), which exhibits insecticidal properties. Pyripyropenes are natural hybrid products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. In our research, based on data generated using the Genome Sequencer FLX for P. coprobium PF1169, we predicted the biosynthetic gene cluster of PyA by blast analysis comparing with polyketide synthase and prenyltransferase of other species. By screening the genomic fosmid library, nine open reading frames (ppb1 to ppb9) related to the biosynthesis of PyA were deduced. Among them, two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (ppb3 and ppb4) were separately introduced into the model fungus A. oryzae. Bioconversion of certain predicted intermediates in the transformants has elucidated the manner of hydroxylation in the biosynthetic pathway by the expressed products of these two genes (P450-1 and P450-2). That is, P450-1 exhibits monooxygenase activity and plays the hydroxylation role at C-11 of pyripyropene E. While P450-2 plays an active role in the hydroxylation of C-7 and C-13 of pyripyropene O.	1
Abstract2class: Antibacterial and synergy of berberines with antibacterial agents against clinical multi-drug resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Abstract: Antibacterial activity of berberine (Ber) and 8-acetonyl-dihydroberberine (A-Ber) alone and combined uses with antibacterial agents ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), cefazolin (CFZ) and levofloxacin (LEV) was studied on 10 clinical isolates of SCCmec III type methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Susceptibility to each agent alone was tested using a broth microdilution method and the chequerboard and time-kill tests for the combined evaluations, respectively. The alone MICs/MBCs (μg/mL) ranges were 32-128/64-256 (Ber) and 32-128/128-512 (A-Ber). Significant synergies were observed for the Ber (A-Ber)/AZM and Ber (A-Ber)/LEV combinations against 90% of the tested MRSA strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) values ranged from 0.188 to 0.500. An additivity result was also observed for the Ber/AZM combination by time-kill curves. These results demonstrated for the first time that Ber and A-Ber enhanced the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of AZM and LEV to a same extent, which had potential for further investigation in combinatory therapeutic applications of patients infected with MRSA.	0
Abstract2class: Calcium is sufficient but not necessary for activation of sheep platelet cytosolic phospholipase A2 Abstract: In this study we demonstrate that: (1) although the major phospholipase A2 present in sheep platelets is activated by calcium ions, it can effectively catalyze hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester linkage in phospholipids in the absence of calcium; (2) expression of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity can be induced by NaCl utilizing purified (but not crude) cytosolic enzyme; and (3) calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity is regulated by a reconstitutable cytosolic protein. Collectively, these results underscore the fundamental catalytic differences between extracellular and intracellular calcium-dependent phospholipases A2 and demonstrate that calcium is sufficient, but not necessary, for the activation of this class of intracellular phospholipases A2.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and heterologous expression of the spectinabilin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spectabilis Abstract: Spectinabilin is a rare nitrophenyl-substituted polyketide metabolite. Here we report the cloning and heterologous expression of the spectinabilin gene cluster from Streptomyces spectabilis. Unexpectedly, this gene cluster is evolutionarily closer to the aureothin gene cluster than to the spectinabilin gene cluster from Streptomyces orinoci. Moreover, the two nearly identical spectinabilin gene clusters use a distinctly different regulation mechanism.	1
Abstract2class: Crystallographic analysis of human serum albumin complexed with 4Z,15E-bilirubin-IXalpha Abstract: Bilirubin, an insoluble yellow-orange pigment derived from heme catabolism, accumulates to toxic levels in individuals with impaired or immature liver function. The resulting jaundice may be managed with phototherapy to isomerize the biosynthetic 4Z,15Z-bilirubin-IXalpha to more soluble and excretable isomers, such as 4Z,15E-bilirubin. Bilirubin and its configurational isomers are transported to the liver by human serum albumin (HSA) but their precise binding location(s) on the protein have yet to be determined. To investigate the molecular details of their interaction, we co-crystallised bilirubin with HSA. Strikingly, the crystal structure--determined to 2.42 A resolution--revealed the 4Z,15E-bilirubin-IXalpha isomer bound to an L-shaped pocket in sub-domain IB. We also determined the co-crystal structure of HSA complexed with fusidic acid, an antibiotic that competitively displaces bilirubin from the protein, and showed that it binds to the same pocket. These results provide the first crystal structure of a natural bilirubin pigment bound to serum albumin, challenge some of the present conceptions about HSA-bilirubin interactions, and provide a sound structural framework for finally resolving the long-standing question of where 4Z,15Z-bilirubin-IXalpha binds to the protein.	0
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of a biosynthetic cluster essential for production of 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, a germination-arrest factor from Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 Abstract: Rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 produces the germination-arrest factor 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG). FVG has previously been shown to both arrest the germination of weedy grasses and inhibit the growth of the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Very little is known about the mechanism by which FVG is produced. Although a previous study identified a region of the genome that may be involved in FVG biosynthesis, it has not yet been determined which genes within that region are sufficient and necessary for FVG production. In the current study, we explored the role of each of the putative genes encoded in that region by constructing deletion mutations. Mutant strains were assayed for their ability to produce FVG with a combination of biological assays and TLC analyses. This work defined the core FVG biosynthetic gene cluster and revealed several interesting characteristics of FVG production. We determined that FVG biosynthesis requires two small ORFs of less than 150 nucleotides and that multiple transporters have overlapping but distinct functionality. In addition, two genes in the centre of the biosynthetic gene cluster are not required for FVG production, suggesting that additional products may be produced from the cluster. Transcriptional analysis indicated that at least three active promoters play a role in the expression of genes within this cluster. The results of this study enrich our knowledge regarding the diversity of mechanisms by which bacteria produce non-proteinogenic amino acids like vinylglycines.	1
Abstract2class: Electronic and Steric Control of n→π* Interactions: Stabilization of the α-Helix Conformation without a Hydrogen Bond Abstract: The preferred conformations of peptides and proteins are dependent on local interactions that bias the conformational ensemble. The n→π* interaction between consecutive carbonyls promotes compact conformations, including the α-helix and polyproline II helix. In order to further understand the n→π* interaction and to develop methods to promote defined conformational preferences through acyl N-capping motifs, a series of peptides was synthesized in which the electronic and steric properties of the acyl group were modified. Using NMR spectroscopy, van't Hoff analysis of enthalpies, X-ray crystallography, and computational investigations, we observed that more electron-rich donor carbonyls (pivaloyl, iso-butyryl, propionyl) promote stronger n→π* interactions and more compact conformations than acetyl or less electron-rich donor carbonyls (methoxyacetyl, fluoroacetyl, formyl). X-ray crystallography indicates a strong, electronically tunable preference for the α-helix conformation, as observed directly on the φ and ψ torsion angles. Electron-donating acyl groups promote the α-helical conformation, even in the absence of the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the α-helix. In contrast, electron-withdrawing acyl groups led to more extended conformations. More sterically demanding groups can promote trans amide bonds independent of the electronic effect on n→π* interactions. Chloroacetyl groups additionally promote n→π* interactions through the interaction of the chlorine lone pair with the proximal carbonyl π*. These data provide additional support for an important role of n→π* interactions in the conformational ensemble of disordered or unfolded proteins. Moreover, this work suggests that readily incorporated acyl N-capping motifs that modulate n→π* interactions may be employed rationally to promote conformational biases in peptides, with potential applications in molecular design and medicinal chemistry.	0
Abstract2class: Lincosamide synthetase--a unique condensation system combining elements of nonribosomal peptide synthetase and mycothiol metabolism Abstract: In the biosynthesis of lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin and celesticetin, the amino acid and amino sugar units are linked by an amide bond. The respective condensing enzyme lincosamide synthetase (LS) is expected to be an unusual system combining nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) components with so far unknown amino sugar related activities. The biosynthetic gene cluster of celesticetin was sequenced and compared to the lincomycin one revealing putative LS coding ORFs shared in both clusters. Based on a bioassay and production profiles of S. lincolnensis strains with individually deleted putative LS coding genes, the proteins LmbC, D, E, F and V were assigned to LS function. Moreover, the newly recognized N-terminal domain of LmbN (LmbN-CP) was also assigned to LS as a NRPS carrier protein (CP). Surprisingly, the homologous CP coding sequence in celesticetin cluster is part of ccbZ gene adjacent to ccbN, the counterpart of lmbN, suggesting the gene rearrangement, evident also from still active internal translation start in lmbN, and indicating the direction of lincosamide biosynthesis evolution. The in vitro test with LmbN-CP, LmbC and the newly identified S. lincolnensis phosphopantetheinyl transferase Slp, confirmed the cooperation of the previously characterized NRPS A-domain LmbC with a holo-LmbN-CP in activation of a 4-propyl-L-proline precursor of lincomycin. This result completed the functional characterization of LS subunits resembling NRPS initiation module. Two of the four remaining putative LS subunits, LmbE/CcbE and LmbV/CcbV, exhibit low but significant homology to enzymes from the metabolism of mycothiol, the NRPS-independent system processing the amino sugar and amino acid units. The functions of particular LS subunits as well as cooperation of both NRPS-based and NRPS-independent LS blocks are discussed. The described condensing enzyme represents a unique hybrid system with overall composition quite dissimilar to any other known enzyme system.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of functionally important conserved trans-membrane residues of bacterial PIB -type ATPases Abstract: Powered by ATP hydrolysis, P(IB) -ATPases drive the energetically uphill transport of transition metals. These high affinity pumps are essential for heavy metal detoxification and delivery of metal cofactors to specific cellular compartments. Amino acid sequence alignment of the trans-membrane (TM) helices of P(IB)-ATPases reveals a high degree of conservation, with ∼ 60-70 fully conserved positions. Of these conserved positions, 6-7 were previously identified to be important for transport. However, the functional importance of the majority of the conserved TM residues remains unclear. To investigate the role of conserved TM residues of P(IB)-ATPases we conducted an extensive mutagenesis study of a Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) P(IB)-ATPase from Rhizobium radiobacter (rrZntA) and seven other P(IB)-ATPases. Of the 38 conserved positions tested, 24 had small effects on metal tolerance. Fourteen mutations compromised in vivo metal tolerance and in vitro metal-stimulated ATPase activity. Based on structural modelling, the functionally important residues line a constricted 'channel', tightly surrounded by the residues that were found to be inconsequential for function. We tentatively propose that the distribution of the mutable and immutable residues marks a possible trans-membrane metal translocation pathway. In addition, by substituting six trans-membrane amino acids of rrZntA we changed the in vivo metal specificity of this pump from Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) to Ag(+).	0
Abstract2class: Pressure-tuning the quantum spin Hamiltonian of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cs2CuCl4 Abstract: Quantum triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are important prototype systems to investigate numerous phenomena of the geometrical frustration in condensed matter. Apart from highly unusual magnetic properties, they possess a rich phase diagram (ranging from an unfrustrated square lattice to a quantum spin liquid), yet to be confirmed experimentally. One major obstacle in this area of research is the lack of materials with appropriate (ideally tuned) magnetic parameters. Using Cs2CuCl4 as a model system, we demonstrate an alternative approach, where, instead of the chemical composition, the spin Hamiltonian is altered by hydrostatic pressure. The approach combines high-pressure electron spin resonance and r.f. susceptibility measurements, allowing us not only to quasi-continuously tune the exchange parameters, but also to accurately monitor them. Our experiments indicate a substantial increase of the exchange coupling ratio from 0.3 to 0.42 at a pressure of 1.8 GPa, revealing a number of emergent field-induced phases.	0
Abstract2class: Intraspecies comparison of Streptomyces pratensis genomes reveals high levels of recombination and gene conservation between strains of disparate geographic origin Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces are widespread bacteria that contribute to the terrestrial carbon cycle and produce the majority of clinically useful antibiotics. While interspecific genomic diversity has been investigated among Streptomyces, information is lacking on intraspecific genomic diversity. Streptomyces pratensis has high rates of homologous recombination but the impact of such gene exchange on genome evolution and the evolution of natural product gene clusters remains uncharacterized.                  Results:                       We report draft genome sequences of four S. pratensis strains and compare to the complete genome of Streptomyces flavogriseus IAF-45-CD (=ATCC 33331), a strain recently reclassified to S. pratensis. Despite disparate geographic origins, the genomes are highly similar with 85.9% of genes present in the core genome and conservation of all natural product gene clusters. Natural products include a novel combination of carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor gene clusters. While high intraspecies recombination rates abolish the phylogenetic signal across the genome, intraspecies recombination is suppressed in two genomic regions. The first region is centered on an insertion/deletion polymorphism and the second on a hybrid NRPS-PKS gene. Finally, two gene families accounted for over 25% of the divergent genes in the core genome. The first includes homologs of bldB (required for spore development and antibiotic production) while the second includes homologs of an uncharacterized protein with a helix-turn-helix motif (hpb). Genes from these families co-occur with fifteen pairs spread across the genome. These genes have evidence for co-evolution of co-localized pairs, supporting previous assertions that these genes may function akin to a toxin-antitoxin system.                  Conclusions:                       S. pratensis genomes are highly similar with exceptional levels of recombination which erase phylogenetic signal among strains of the species. This species has a large core genome and variable terminal regions that are smaller than those found in interspecies comparisons. There is no geographic differentiation between these strains, but there is evidence for local linkage disequilibrium affecting two genomic regions. We have also shown further observational evidence that the DUF397-HTH (bldB and hpb) are a novel toxin-antitoxin pair.	1
Abstract2class: In vitro activity of plant extracts and alkaloids against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains Abstract: The antibacterial activity of 80% ethanol extracts of 10 medicinal plants collected in Yunnan (Southwest China), was tested against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. Their MIC values ranged between 1.56-12.50 mg/mL. The most active plant extract was Chelidonium majus L. (MIC = 1.56 mg/mL). Two potent isoquinoline alkaloids, 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine and 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine, were identified as the major active principles through bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of the active ethyl acetate fraction from C. majus, with minimum MIC/MBC values of 15.63/62.50 mg/mL.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a eukaryotic reductive dechlorinase and characterization of its mechanism of action on its natural substrate Abstract: Chlorinated compounds are important environmental pollutants whose biodegradation may be limited by inefficient dechlorinating enzymes. Dictyostelium amoebae produce a chlorinated alkyl phenone called DIF which induces stalk cell differentiation during their multicellular development. Here we describe the identification of DIF dechlorinase. DIF dechlorinase is active when expressed in bacteria, and activity is lost from Dictyostelium cells when its gene, drcA, is knocked out. It has a K(m) for DIF of 88 nM and K(cat) of 6.7 s(-1). DrcA is related to glutathione S-transferases, but with a key asparagine-to-cysteine substitution in the catalytic pocket. When this change is reversed, the enzyme reverts to a glutathione S-transferase, thus suggesting a catalytic mechanism. DrcA offers new possibilities for the rational design of bioremediation strategies.	0
Abstract2class: Genome mining in streptomyces. Discovery of an unprecedented P450-catalyzed oxidative rearrangement that is the final step in the biosynthesis of pentalenolactone Abstract: The penM and pntM genes from the pentalenolactone biosynthetic gene clusters of Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319 and Streptomyces arenae TÜ469 were predicted to encode orthologous cytochrome P450s, CYP161C3 and CYP161C2, responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone (1). Synthetic genes optimized for expression in Escherichia coli were used to obtain recombinant PenM and PntM, each carrying an N-terminal His(6)-tag. Both proteins showed typical reduced-CO UV maxima at 450 nm, and each bound the predicted substrate, pentalenolactone F (4), with K(D) values of 153 ± 14 and 126 ± 11 μM for PenM and PntM, respectively, as determined by UV shift titrations. PenM and PntM both catalyzed the oxidative rearrangement of 4 to 1 when incubated in the presence of NADPH, spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and O(2). The steady-state kinetic parameters were k(cat) = 10.5 ± 1.7 min(-1) and K(m) = 340 ± 100 μM 4 for PenM and k(cat) = 8.8 ± 0.9 min(-1) and K(m) = 430 ± 100 μM 4 for PntM. The in vivo function of both gene products was confirmed by the finding that the corresponding deletion mutants S. exfoliatus/ΔpenM ZD22 and S. arenae/ΔpntM ZD23 no longer produced pentalenolactone but accumulated the precursor pentalenolactone F. Complementation of each deletion mutant with either penM or pntM restored production of antibiotic 1. Pentalenolactone was also produced by an engineered strain of Streptomyces avermitilis that had been complemented with pntE, pntD, and either pntM or penM, as well as the S. avermitilis electron-transport genes for ferredoxin and ferrodoxin reductase, fdxD and fprD.	1
Abstract2class: Fused dithienogermolodithiophene low band gap polymers for high-performance organic solar cells without processing additives Abstract: We report the synthesis of a novel ladder-type fused ring donor, dithienogermolodithiophene, in which two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units are held coplanar by a bridging dialkyl germanium. Polymerization of this extended monomer with N-octylthienopyrrolodione by Stille polycondensation afforded a polymer, pDTTG-TPD, with an optical band gap of 1.75 eV combined with a high ionization potential. Bulk heterojunction solar cells based upon pDTTG-TPD:PC(71)BM blends afforded efficiencies up to 7.2% without the need for thermal annealing or processing additives.	0
Abstract2class: Detection and characterization of a rare two-component lantibiotic, amyloliquecidin GF610 produced by Bacillus velezensis, using a combination of culture, molecular and bioinformatic analyses Abstract: Aim:                       To detect and characterize novel lantibiotics from a collection of Bacillus spp. using a multifaceted analytical approach.                  Methods and results:                       A previously completed microassay identified 45 Bacillus isolates with anti-Listeria activity. The isolates were PCR screened using degenerate primers targeting conserved sequences in lanM-type lantibiotics. B. velezensis GF610 produced a PCR product whose sequence, along with genome mining and bioinformatics, guided the liquid chromatographic analysis of strain's cell-free extracts and the mass spectrometry of purified fractions. Results revealed a new amyloliquecidin variant (designated GF610) produced by the strain. Amyloliquecidin GF610 is a two-component lantibiotic with α and β peptides having monoisotopic masses of 3026 and 2451 Da, and molecular formulae C130 H191 N35 O39 S5 and C110 H158 N26 O30 S4 , respectively. Amyloliquecidin GF610 is active against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridioides difficile, Staphylococcus aureus and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range of 0.5-7.0 µmol l-1 .                  Conclusions:                       The proposed multifaceted analytical approach was valuable to provide a deep and proper characterization of a novel bacteriocin, amyloliquecidin GF610, with high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.                  Significance and impact:                       The discovered Amyloliquecidin GF610 is potentially useful in food, agricultural or medical applications. The analytical approach followed may facilitate future discoveries of two-component lantibiotics, which are challenging compounds to detect and characterize.	1
Abstract2class: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Unprotected β2-Amino Acids Abstract: We report here a scalable, catalytic one-pot approach to enantiopure and unmodified β2-amino acids. A newly developed confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalyzes a broadly applicable reaction of diverse bis-silyl ketene acetals with a silylated aminomethyl ether, followed by hydrolytic workup, to give free β2-amino acids in high yields, purity, and enantioselectivity. Importantly, both aromatic and aliphatic β2-amino acids can be obtained using this method. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the aminomethylation to proceed via silylium-based asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis (Si-ACDC) and a transition state to explain the enantioselectivity is suggested on the basis of density functional theory calculation.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of Two Polyketide Synthases Involved in Sorbicillinoid Biosynthesis by Acremonium chrysogenum Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System Abstract: Acremonium chrysogenum is an important fungal strain used for cephalosporin C production. Many efforts have been made to develop versatile genome-editing tools to better understand the mechanism of A. chrysogenum. Here, we developed a feasible and efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two genes responsible for the synthesis of yellow pigments (sorbicillinoids) were chosen as targets, and plasmids expressing both the Cas9 protein and single-guide RNAs were constructed. After introducing the plasmids into the protoplasts of A. chrysogenum, 83 to 93% albino mutants harboring the expected genomic alteration, on average, were obtained. We have generated two mutant strains that respectively disrupt sorA and sorB by flexible CRISPR/Cas9 system. We further confirmed that the sorbicillinoid biosynthetic gene cluster is regulated by an autoinduction mechanism. This work will lay a solid foundation for gene function research and regulation in the sorbicillinoid biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: The complete biosynthetic gene cluster of the 28-membered polyketide macrolactones, halstoctacosanolides, from Streptomyces halstedii HC34 Abstract: Halstoctacoanolides A and B are 28-membered polyketide macrolactones and were isolated from Streptomyces halstedii HC34. The biosynthetic gene cluster (hls cluster) of halstoctacosanolides was completely identified from the genome library of Streptomyces halstedii HC34. DNA sequence analysis of ca. 100 kb region revealed that there were seven type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) and two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in this cluster. Involvement of the gene cluster in the halstoctacosanolide biosynthesis was demonstrated by the gene disruption of P450 monooxygenase genes. The mutants produced a new deoxygenated halstoctacosanolide derivative, halstoctacosanolide C, which confirmed that the hls gene cluster was essential for the biosynthesis of halstoctacosanolides.	1
Abstract2class: A new arylsulfate sulfotransferase involved in liponucleoside antibiotic biosynthesis in streptomycetes Abstract: Sulfotransferases are involved in a variety of physiological processes and typically use 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulfate donor substrate. In contrast, microbial arylsulfate sulfotransferases (ASSTs) are PAPS-independent and utilize arylsulfates as sulfate donors. Yet, their genuine acceptor substrates are unknown. In this study we demonstrate that Cpz4 from Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2 is an ASST-type sulfotransferase responsible for the formation of sulfated liponucleoside antibiotics. Gene deletion mutants showed that cpz4 is required for the production of sulfated caprazamycin derivatives. Cloning, overproduction, and purification of Cpz4 resulted in a 58-kDa soluble protein. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of a sulfate group from p-nitrophenol sulfate (K(m) 48.1 microM, k(cat) 0.14 s(-1)) and methyl umbelliferone sulfate (K(m) 34.5 microM, k(cat) 0.15 s(-1)) onto phenol (K(m) 25.9 and 29.7 mM, respectively). The Cpz4 reaction proceeds by a ping pong bi-bi mechanism. Several structural analogs of intermediates of the caprazamycin biosynthetic pathway were synthesized and tested as substrates of Cpz4. Des-N-methyl-acyl-caprazol was converted with highest efficiency 100 times faster than phenol. The fatty acyl side chain and the uridyl moiety seem to be important for substrate recognition by Cpz4. Liponucleosides, partially purified from various mutant strains, were readily sulfated by Cpz4 using p-nitrophenol sulfate. No product formation could be observed with PAPS as the donor substrate. Sequence homology of Cpz4 to the previously examined ASSTs is low. However, numerous orthologs are encoded in microbial genomes and represent interesting subjects for future investigations.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of tailoring genes involved in the modification of geldanamycin polyketide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus JCM4427 Abstract: Geldanamycin and its analogs are important anticancer agents that inhibit the newly targeted, heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90, which is a chaperone protein in eukaryotic cells. To resolve which geldanamycin biosynthetic genes are responsible for particular post-polyketide synthase (PKS) processing steps and in which order the reactions occur, we individually inactivated candidate genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. duamyceticus JCM4427, and isolated and elucidated the structures of intermediates from each mutant. The results indicated that gel7 governs at least one of the benzoquinone ring oxidation steps. In addition, gel16 was found to be involved in double-bond formation between C-4 and C-5 of 4,5-dihydrogeldanamycin, which confirmed our previous findings that this double bond reduced during the post-PKS modification of the polyketide assembly. In addition, pro-geldanamycin, which does not possess a double bond at C-4/5, was purified from the gel7 and 8 double-gene-inactivated mutant.	1
Abstract2class: The ornibactin biosynthesis and transport genes of Burkholderia cenocepacia are regulated by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor which is a part of the Fur regulon Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia mutants that fail to produce the siderophore ornibactin were obtained following mutagenesis with mini-Tn5Tp. These mutants were shown to be growth restricted under conditions of iron depletion. In eight of the mutants, the transposon had integrated into one of two genes, orbI and orbJ, encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In the other mutant, the transposon had inserted into an open reading frame, orbS, located upstream from orbI. The polypeptide product of orbS exhibits a high degree of similarity to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor PvdS but possesses an N-terminal extension of approximately 29 amino acids that is not present in PvdS. Three predicted OrbS-dependent promoters were identified within the ornibactin gene cluster, based on their similarity to PvdS-dependent promoters. The iron-regulated activity of these promoters was shown to require OrbS. Transcription of the orbS gene was found to be under the control of an iron-regulated sigma(70)-dependent promoter. This promoter, but not the OrbS-dependent promoters, was shown to be a target for repression by the global regulator Fur. Our results demonstrate that production of ornibactin by B. cenocepacia in response to iron starvation requires transcription of an operon that is dependent on the Fur-regulated ECF sigma factor gene orbS. A mechanism is also proposed for the biosynthesis of ornibactin.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the microbiota in long- and short-term natural indigo fermentation Abstract: The duration for which the indigo-reducing state maintenance in indigo natural fermentation in batch dependent. The microbiota was analyzed in two batches of sukumo fermentation fluids that lasted for different durations (Batch 1: less than 2 months; Batch 2: nearly 1 year) to understand the mechanisms underlying the sustainability and deterioration of this natural fermentation process. The transformation of the microbiota suggested that the deterioration of the fermentation fluid is associated with the relative abundance of Alcaligenaceae. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the microbial community maintained a very stable state in only the long-term Batch 2. Therefore, entry of the microbiota into a stable state under alkaline anaerobic condition is an important factor for maintenance of indigo fermentation for long duration. This is the first report on the total transformation of the microbiota for investigation of long-term maintenance mechanisms and to address the problem of deterioration in indigo fermentation.	0
Abstract2class: Simple model of protein folding kinetics Abstract: A simple model of the kinetics of protein folding is presented. The reaction coordinate is the "correctness" of a configuration compared with the native state. The model has a gap in the energy spectrum, a large configurational entropy, a free energy barrier between folded and partially folded states, and a good thermodynamic folding transition. Folding kinetics is described by a master equation. The folding time is estimated by means of a local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption and then is calculated both numerically and analytically by solving the master equation. The folding time has a maximum near the folding transition temperature and can have a minimum at a lower temperature.	0
Abstract2class: Conformational cycle of the ABC transporter MsbA in liposomes: detailed analysis using double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy Abstract: Driven by the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis, ATP-binding cassette transporters alternate between inward- and outward-facing conformations, allowing vectorial movement of substrates. Conflicting models have been proposed to describe the conformational motion underlying this switch in access of the transport pathway. One model, based on three crystal structures of the lipid flippase MsbA, envisions a large-amplitude motion that disengages the nucleotide-binding domains and repacks the transmembrane helices. To test this model and place the crystal structures in a mechanistic context, we use spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to define the nature and amplitude of MsbA conformational change during ATP hydrolysis cycle. For this purpose, spin labels were introduced at sites selected to provide a distinctive pattern of distance changes unique to the crystallographic transformation. Distance changes in liposomes, induced by the transition from nucleotide-free MsbA to the highest energy intermediate, fit a simple pattern whereby residues on the cytoplasmic side undergo 20-30 A closing motion while a 7- to 10-A opening motion is observed on the extracellular side. The transmembrane helices undergo relative movement to create the outward opening consistent with that implied by the crystal structures. Double electron-electron resonance distance distributions reveal asymmetric backbone flexibility on the two sides of the transporter that correlates with asymmetric opening of the substrate-binding chamber. Together with extensive accessibility analysis, our results suggest that these structures capture features of the motion that couples ATP energy expenditure to work, providing a framework for the mechanism of substrate transport.	0
Abstract2class: Distinct Mechanisms for Processing Autophagy Protein LC3-PE by RavZ and ATG4B Abstract: Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens in eukaryotic cells. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4-mediated deconjugation of LC3-PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the Legionella effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3-PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3-PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semisynthetic LC3-PE proteins containing C-terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C-terminal structure of LC3-PE with ATG4/RavZ-mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln116, Phe119 and Gly120 of LC3-PE are required for cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, whereas Glu117(LC3) is specific to cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B, but not in RavZ. Met63 and Gln64 at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C-terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of the LC3 C-terminal motif (116-120) with ATG4 and RavZ might determine the specificity of cleavage site.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters and functional analysis of labdane-related diterpene cyclases in Phomopsis amygdali Abstract: Two diterpene biosynthesis gene clusters in the fusicoccin-producing fungus, Phomopsis amygdali, were identified by genome walking from PaGGS1 and PaGGS4 which encode the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthases. The diterpene cyclase-like genes, PaDC1 and PaDC2, were respectively located proximal to PaGGS1 and PaGGS4. The amino acid sequences of these two enzymes were similar to those of fungal labdane-related diterpene cyclases. Recombinant PaDC1 converted GGDP mainly into phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol via (+)-copalyl diphosphate (CDP) and trace amounts of several labdane-related hydrocarbons which had been identified from the P. amygdali F6 mycelia. Since phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol had not been identified in P. amygdali F6 mycelia, we isolated phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol from the mycelia. Recombinant PaDC2 converted GGDP into (+)-CDP. Furthermore, we isolated the novel diterpenoid, phyllocladan-11 alpha,16 alpha,18-triol, which is a possible metabolite of phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol in the mycelia. We propose that genome walking offers a useful strategy for the discovery of novel natural products in fungi.	1
Abstract2class: The mystery of missing heritability: Genetic interactions create phantom heritability Abstract: Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of "missing heritability" of common traits. Although studies have discovered >1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator--that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating "phantom heritability." Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.	0
Abstract2class: The molecular basis of conjugated polyyne biosynthesis in phytopathogenic bacteria Abstract: Polyynes (polyacetylenes), which are produced by a variety of organisms, play important roles in ecology. Whereas alkyne biosynthesis in plants, fungi, and insects has been studied, the biogenetic origin of highly unstable bacterial polyynes has remained a riddle. Transposon mutagenesis and genome sequencing unveiled the caryoynencin (cay) biosynthesis gene cluster in the plant pathogen B. caryophylli, and homologous gene clusters were found in various other bacteria by comparative genomics. Gene inactivation and phylogenetic analyses revealed that novel desaturase/acetylenase genes mediate bacterial polyyne assembly. A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is involved in the formation of the allylic alcohol moiety, as evidenced by analysis of a fragile intermediate, which was stabilized by an in situ click reaction. This work not only grants first insight into bacterial polyyne biosynthesis but also demonstrates that the click reaction can be employed to trap fragile polyynes from crude mixtures.	1
Abstract2class: Extension of the Rhizobium meliloti succinoglycan biosynthesis gene cluster: identification of the exsA gene encoding an ABC transporter protein, and the exsB gene which probably codes for a regulator of succinoglycan biosynthesis Abstract: Two new genes, designated exsA and exsB, were identified adjacent to the 24 kb exo gene cluster of Rhizobium meliloti, which is involved in succinoglycan (EPS I) biosynthesis. The derived amino acid sequence of ExsA displayed significant homologies to ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. R. meliloti strains mutated in exsA were characterized by a decreased ratio of HMW to LMW EPS I, indicating a function for ExsA in EPS I biosynthesis. The R. meliloti NdvA protein, which is involved in the transport of cyclic beta-(1,2)-glucans, was identified as the closest homologue of ExsA. R. meliloti exsB mutants produced a three-fold increased amount of EPS I in comparison to the wild-type strain. In contrast, high copy number of exsB resulted in a decrease in the EPS I level to 20% of wild type, indicating that the exsB gene product can negatively influence EPS I biosynthesis. It was demonstrated that this influence is not due to transcriptional regulation of the exo genes by the exsB gene product. By plasmid integration it was shown that exsA and exsB represent monocistronic transcription units.	1
Abstract2class: In situ transformation of TON silica zeolite into the less dense ITW: structure-direction overcoming framework instability in the synthesis of SiO2 zeolites Abstract: Under specific synthesis conditions the crystallization of a dense silica zeolite (TON) is followed by its in situ transformation into a less dense and, in the absence of occluded species, less stable zeolite (ITW). Periodic ab initio calculations including energy corrections for van der Waals interactions as well as zero-point and thermal effects are used first to assess the relative stability of both SiO(2) (calcined) phases and then to investigate host-guest interactions in the as-made zeolites, as well as their relative stability. The less dense SiO(2)-ITW is less stable than SiO(2)-TON, with an energy difference that is significantly larger than expected from their difference in molar volume. This extra destabilization is ascribed to the strained double 4-ring units of silica tetrahedra (D4R). Regarding the as-made materials, the organic cation fills in more efficiently the zeolitic voids in ITW than in TON, bringing about a larger stabilization in the former owing to the extension of the long-range addition of dispersion force contributions. On the other hand, fluoride induces a polarization of the silica framework that is highly localized in TON (showing pentacoordinated [SiO(4/2)F](-) units) but has a large global character in ITW (where fluoride is encapsulated into D4R units). We argue that the structure-directing role toward D4R materials that has been proposed for fluoride consists fundamentally in the ability to induce a global polarization of the silica framework that allows relaxation of the strain associated with these units. In this sense, fluoride stabilizes the otherwise strained D4R-SiO(2) frameworks making them reachable for crystallization. This work documents a case in which the structure directing agents "choose" a structure not kinetically but through stabilization.	0
Abstract2class: Modulation of the ligand-field anisotropy in a series of ferric low-spin cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 and Nitrosomonas europaea cytochrome c-552: a nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance study Abstract: Cytochromes of the c type with histidine-methionine (His-Met) heme axial ligation play important roles in electron-transfer reactions and in enzymes. In this work, two series of cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa c-551) and from the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea (Ne c-552) were engineered and overexpressed. In these proteins, point mutations were induced in a key residue (Asn64) near the Met axial ligand; these mutations have a considerable impact both on heme ligand-field strength and on the Met orientation and dynamics (fluxionality), as judged by low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Ne c-552 has a ferric low-spin (S = 1/2) EPR signal characterized by large g anisotropy with g(max) resonance at 3.34; a similar large g(max) value EPR signal is found in the mitochondrial complex III cytochrome c1. In Ne c-552, deletion of Asn64 (NeN64Delta) changes the heme ligand field from more axial to rhombic (small g anisotropy and g(max) at 3.13) and furthermore hinders the Met fluxionality present in the wild-type protein. In Pa c-551 (g(max) at 3.20), replacement of Asn64 with valine (PaN64V) induces a decrease in the axial strain (g(max) at 3.05) and changes the Met configuration. Another set of mutants prepared by insertion (ins) and/or deletion (Delta) of a valine residue adjacent to Asn64, resulting in modifications in the length of the axial Met-donating loop (NeV65Delta, NeG50N/V65Delta, PaN50G/V65ins), did not result in appreciable alterations of the originally weak (Ne c-552) or very weak (Pa c-551) axial field but had an impact on Met orientation, fluxionality, and relaxation dynamics. Comparison of the electronic fingerprints in the overexpressed proteins and their mutants reveals a linear relationship between axial strain and average paramagnetic heme methyl shifts, irrespective of Met orientation or dynamics. Thus, for these His-Met axially coordinated Fe(III), the large g(max) value EPR signal does not represent a special case as is observed for bis-His axially coordinated Fe(III) with the two His planes perpendicular to each other.	0
Abstract2class: The neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233: characterisation of an aminotransferase involved in the formation of 2-deoxystreptamine Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin has been cloned for the first time by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233. Sequence analysis has identified 21 putative open reading frames (ORFs) in the neomycin gene cluster (neo) with significant protein sequence similarity to gene products involved in the biosynthesis of other DOS-containing aminoglycosides, namely butirosin (btr), gentamycin (gnt), tobramycin (tbm) and kanamycin (kan). Located at the 5'-end of the neo gene cluster is the previously-characterised neomycin phosphotransferase gene (apH). Three genes unique to the neo and btr clusters have been revealed by comparison of the neo cluster to btr, gnt, tbm and kan clusters. This suggests that these three genes may be involved in the transfer of a ribose moiety to the DOS ring during the antibiotic biosynthesis. The product of the neo-6 gene is characterised here as the L-glutamine : 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose aminotransferase responsible for the first transamination in DOS biosynthesis, which supports the assignment of the gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Structural specificity for biological activity of trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of mammalian cell cycle with potent differentiation-inducing activity in Friend leukemia cells Abstract: Biological activities of four chemically synthesized trichostatin-related compounds, (R)-trichostatin A, (S)-trichostatin A, (R)-trichostatic acid, and (S)-trichostatic acid, were investigated. Assays of differentiation-inducing activity in Friend leukemia cells and G2-arresting activity in the cell cycle of normal rat fibroblast cells were used as monitoring systems for comparing the bioactivities of these compounds. The results clearly showed that both of the enantiomers of trichostatic acid had no activity in both the assay systems. In the case of (S)-trichostatin A, the antipode of naturally occurring trichostatin A, 50% effective concentrations were determined to be 50-70-fold higher than those of (R)-trichostatin A. The relationship between this ratio and the value of enantiomeric excess strongly suggests that (S)-trichostatin A is also biologically inactive. These results indicate that the absolute configuration and the presence of the hydroxamate group of trichostatin A are essential for its biological activity.	0
Abstract2class: Glycerol kinase, the pacemaker for the dissimilation of glycerol in Escherichia coli Abstract: The activity of glycerol kinase is rate-limiting in the metabolism of glycerol by cells of Escherichia coli. A mutant strain producing a glycerol kinase resistant to inhibition by fructose-1,6-diphosphate grows faster than its wild-type parent on glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy. The amount of intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate was determined for wild-type cells growing exponentially on glycerol. The water content of such cells was also determined, allowing calculation of the intracellular concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. This value, 1.7 mm, is adequate to exert substantial inhibition on the wild-type glycerol kinase. The desensitization of glycerol kinase to feedback inhibition also enhances the power of glycerol to exert catabolite repression, both on the enzymes of the glycerol system itself and on those of the lactose system. However, desensitization of glycerol kinase alone does not eliminate the phenomenon of diauxic growth in a glucose-glycerol medium. Biphasic growth in such a medium is abolished if the altered enzyme is produced constitutively. The constitutive production of the mutant kinase at high levels, however, renders the cells vulnerable to glycerol. Thus, when the cells have been grown on a carbon source with a low power for catabolite repression, e.g., succinate, sudden exposure to glycerol leads to overconsumption of the nutrient and cell death.	0
Abstract2class: Evolution of structural diversity of trichothecenes, a family of toxins produced by plant pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi Abstract: Trichothecenes are a family of terpenoid toxins produced by multiple genera of fungi, including plant and insect pathogens. Some trichothecenes produced by the fungus Fusarium are among the mycotoxins of greatest concern to food and feed safety because of their toxicity and frequent occurrence in cereal crops, and trichothecene production contributes to pathogenesis of some Fusarium species on plants. Collectively, fungi produce over 150 trichothecene analogs: i.e., molecules that share the same core structure but differ in patterns of substituents attached to the core structure. Here, we carried out genomic, phylogenetic, gene-function, and analytical chemistry studies of strains from nine fungal genera to identify genetic variation responsible for trichothecene structural diversity and to gain insight into evolutionary processes that have contributed to the variation. The results indicate that structural diversity has resulted from gain, loss, and functional changes of trichothecene biosynthetic (TRI) genes. The results also indicate that the presence of some substituents has arisen independently in different fungi by gain of different genes with the same function. Variation in TRI gene duplication and number of TRI loci was also observed among the fungi examined, but there was no evidence that such genetic differences have contributed to trichothecene structural variation. We also inferred ancestral states of the TRI cluster and trichothecene biosynthetic pathway, and proposed scenarios for changes in trichothecene structures during divergence of TRI cluster homologs. Together, our findings provide insight into evolutionary processes responsible for structural diversification of toxins produced by pathogenic fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of two genes from Streptomyces tendae Tü901 required for the formation of the 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one-containing nucleoside moiety of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin Abstract: The genes nikQ and nikR were identified by sequencing DNA of the nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces tendae Tü901/8c. The nikQ gene encodes a P450 cytochrome, and the predicted NikR gene product shows 48-56% sequence identity with uracil phosphoribosyltransferases from eukaryotic organisms. The nikQ and nikR genes were inactivated separately by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette. Inactivation of the nikQ gene abolished synthesis of nikkomycins containing 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one as the base (nikkomycins X and I), whereas production of nikkomycins containing uracil (nikkomycins Z and J) was not affected. Nikkomycin X and I production could be restored by feeding 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to the nikQ mutants, indicating that NikQ is responsible for its formation from L-histidine. Disruption of the nikR gene resulted in formation of decreased amounts of nikkomycins X and I, whereas nikkomycins Z and J were synthesized at wild-type levels. A fluorouracil-resistant nikR mutant lacking uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) activity did not synthesize nikkomycins X and I and accumulated 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one in its culture filtrate, whereas formation of nikkomycins Z and J was unimpaired. The mutant was complemented to nikkomycin X and I production by nikR expressed from the mel promoter of plasmid pIJ702. The nikR gene expressed in Escherichia coli led to the production of UPRTase activity. Our results indicate that NikR converts 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to yield 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one, the precursor of nikkomycins containing this base.	1
Abstract2class: Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was measured during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus by radioactive thymidine incorporation, autoradiography, and chemical analysis. Microcysts contained an average of 6.6 conserved units of DNA, corresponding to 3 to 4 chromosomes per cell. Correlation of the DNA content and chromosome number of microcysts indicated that the molecular weight of the nonreplicating M. xanthus chromosome is 4.9 x 10(9) daltons. DNA synthesis was initiated 3.5 to 4 hr after induction of germination. From 4 to 6 hr, the rate of synthesis was constant and the accumulation was linear. After a lag period (6 to 6.5 hr), the rate of DNA synthesis increased, reaching a second plateau at 9 hr. From 9 to 11 hr, the rate was again constant and the accumulation was linear. Cellular division during germination showed an unusual kind of synchrony. A model is presented that accounts for chromosomal replication and cell division during microcyst germination.	0
Abstract2class: Nonribosomal peptide synthase gene clusters for lipopeptide biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis 916 and their phenotypic functions Abstract: Bacillus cyclic lipopeptides (LPs) have been well studied for their phytopathogen-antagonistic activities. Recently, research has shown that these LPs also contribute to the phenotypic features of Bacillus strains, such as hemolytic activity, swarming motility, biofilm formation, and colony morphology. Bacillus subtilis 916 not only coproduces the three families of well-known LPs, i.e., surfactins, bacillomycin Ls (iturin family), and fengycins, but also produces a new family of LP called locillomycins. The genome of B. subtilis 916 contains four nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene clusters, srf, bmy, fen, and loc, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of surfactins, bacillomycin Ls, fengycins, and locillomycins, respectively. By studying B. subtilis 916 mutants lacking production of one, two, or three LPs, we attempted to unveil the connections between LPs and phenotypic features. We demonstrated that bacillomycin Ls and fengycins contribute mainly to antifungal activity. Although surfactins have weak antifungal activity in vitro, the strain mutated in srfAA had significantly decreased antifungal activity. This may be due to the impaired productions of fengycins and bacillomycin Ls. We also found that the disruption of any LP gene cluster other than fen resulted in a change in colony morphology. While surfactins and bacillomycin Ls play very important roles in hemolytic activity, swarming motility, and biofilm formation, the fengycins and locillomycins had little influence on these phenotypic features. In conclusion, B. subtilis 916 coproduces four families of LPs which contribute to the phenotypic features of B. subtilis 916 in an intricate way.	1
Abstract2class: Cystobactamids: myxobacterial topoisomerase inhibitors exhibiting potent antibacterial activity Abstract: The development of new antibiotics faces a severe crisis inter alia owing to a lack of innovative chemical scaffolds with activities against Gram-negative and multiresistant pathogens. Herein, we report highly potent novel antibacterial compounds, the myxobacteria-derived cystobactamids 1-3, which were isolated from Cystobacter sp. and show minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low μg mL(-1) range. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of three congeners as well as the identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene cluster. By studying the self-resistance mechanism in the natural producer organism, the molecular targets were identified as bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. As quinolones are largely exhausted as a template for new type II topoisomerase inhibitors, the cystobactamids offer exciting alternatives to generate novel antibiotics using medicinal chemistry and biosynthetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Agrobacterium bioassay strain for ultrasensitive detection of N-acylhomoserine lactone-type quorum-sensing molecules: detection of autoinducers in Mesorhizobium huakuii Abstract: An ultrasensitive bioassay system for the detection of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) was constructed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by using the T7 expression system to overproduce the AHL receptor TraR. This strain detected many diverse AHLs, some at extremely low concentrations. We used this strain to detect for the first time AHLs made by Mesorhizobium huakuii, which symbiotically fixes nitrogen in association with the legume Astragalus sinicus, a source of green manure throughout eastern Asia.	0
Abstract2class: Programming in situ immunofluorescence intensities through interchangeable reactions of dynamic DNA complexes Abstract: The regulation of antibody reporting intensities is critical to various in situ fluorescence-imaging analyses. Although such control is often necessary to visualize sparse molecular targets, the ability to tune marker intensities is also essential for highly multiplexed imaging strategies in which marker reporting levels must be tuned both to optimize dynamic detection ranges and to minimize crosstalk between different signals. Existing chemical amplification approaches generally lack such control. Here, we demonstrate that linear and branched DNA complexes can be designed to function as interchangeable building blocks that can be assembled into organized, fluorescence-reporting complexes. We show that the ability to program DNA-strand-displacement reactions between these complexes offers new opportunities to deterministically tune the number of dyes that are coupled to individual antibodies in order both to increase and controllably balance marker reporting levels within fixed cells.	0
Abstract2class: Transcriptome responses to Ralstonia solanacearum infection in the roots of the wild potato Solanum commersonii Abstract: Background:                       Solanum commersonii is a wild potato species that exhibits high tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses and has been used as a source of genes for introgression into cultivated potato. Among the interesting features of S. commersonii is resistance to the bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, one of the most devastating bacterial diseases of crops.                  Results:                       In this study, we used deep sequencing of S. commersonii RNA (RNA-seq) to analyze the below-ground plant transcriptional responses to R. solanacearum. While a majority of S. commersonii RNA-seq reads could be aligned to the Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja DM reference genome sequence, we identified 2,978 S. commersonii novel transcripts through assembly of unaligned S. commersonii RNA-seq reads. We also used RNA-seq to study gene expression in pathogen-challenged roots of S. commersonii accessions resistant (F118) and susceptible (F97) to the pathogen. Expression profiles obtained from read mapping to the S. tuberosum reference genome and the S. commersonii novel transcripts revealed a differential response to the pathogen in the two accessions, with 221 (F118) and 644 (F97) differentially expressed genes including S. commersonii novel transcripts in the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Interestingly, 22.6% of the F118 and 12.8% of the F97 differentially expressed genes had been previously identified as responsive to biotic stresses and half of those up-regulated in both accessions had been involved in plant pathogen responses. Finally, we compared two different methods to eliminate ribosomal RNA from the plant RNA samples in order to allow dual mapping of RNAseq reads to the host and pathogen genomes and provide insights on the advantages and limitations of each technique.                  Conclusions:                       Our work catalogues the S. commersonii transcriptome and strengthens the notion that this species encodes specific genes that are differentially expressed to respond to bacterial wilt. In addition, a high proportion of S. commersonii-specific transcripts were altered by R. solanacearum only in F118 accession, while phythormone-related genes were highly induced in F97, suggesting a markedly different response to the pathogen in the two plant accessions studied.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the epoxide hydrolase NcsF2 from the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Neocarzinostatin (1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve a vicinal diol intermediate. It is reported that NcsF2, one of two epoxide hydrolases encoded by the NCS gene cluster, catalyzes regiospecific addition of H(2)O to C-2 of both (R)- and (S)-styrene oxides to afford (R)- and (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediols, respectively, supporting its proposed role in 1 biosynthesis. (R)-1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (87% yield and 99% ee) was obtained from (+/-)-styrene oxide hydrolysis by cocatalysis using NcsF2 and SgcF, the complementary epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: The murein hydrolase of the bacteriophage phi3626 dual lysis system is active against all tested Clostridium perfringens strains Abstract: Clostridium perfringens commonly occurs in food and feed, can produce an enterotoxin frequently implicated in food-borne disease, and has a substantial negative impact on the poultry industry. As a step towards new approaches for control of this organism, we investigated the cell wall lysis system of C. perfringens bacteriophage phi3626, whose dual lysis gene cassette consists of a holin gene and an endolysin gene. Hol3626 has two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and is a group II holin. A positively charged beta turn between the two MSDs suggests that both the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of Hol3626 might be located outside the cell membrane, a very unusual holin topology. Holin function was experimentally demonstrated by using the ability of the holin to complement a deletion of the heterologous phage lambda S holin in lambdadeltaSthf. The endolysin gene ply3626 was cloned in Escherichia coli. However, protein synthesis occurred only when bacteria were supplemented with rare tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Ile) genes. Formation of inclusion bodies could be avoided by drastically lowering the expression level. Amino-terminal modification by a six-histidine tag did not affect enzyme activity and enabled purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Ply3626 has an N-terminal amidase domain and a unique C-terminal portion, which might be responsible for the specific lytic range of the enzyme. All 48 tested strains of C. perfringens were sensitive to the murein hydrolase, whereas other clostridia and bacteria belonging to other genera were generally not affected. This highly specific activity towards C. perfringens might be useful for novel biocontrol measures in food, feed, and complex microbial communities.	0
Abstract2class: A Unique Tryptophan C-Prenyltransferase from the Kawaguchipeptin Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Cyanobactins are a rapidly growing family of linear and cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. Kawaguchipeptins A and B, two macrocyclic undecapeptides reported earlier from Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88, are shown to be products of the cyanobactin biosynthetic pathway. The 9 kb kawaguchipeptin (kgp) gene cluster was identified in a 5.26 Mb draft genome of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88. We verified that this gene cluster is responsible for the production of the kawaguchipeptins through heterologous expression of the kgp gene cluster in Escherichia coli. The KgpF prenyltransferase was overexpressed and was shown to prenylate C-3 of Trp residues in both linear and cyclic peptides in vitro. Our findings serve to further enhance the structural diversity of cyanobactins to include tryptophan-prenylated cyclic peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Comparison of tolerance of four bacterial nanocellulose-producing strains to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors Abstract: Background:                       Through pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification lignocellulosic biomass has great potential as a low-cost feedstock for production of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a high value-added microbial product, but inhibitors formed during pretreatment remain challenging. In this study, the tolerance to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors of three new BNC-producing strains were compared to that of Komagataeibacter xylinus ATCC 23770. Inhibitors studied included furan aldehydes (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and phenolic compounds (coniferyl aldehyde and vanillin). The performance of the four strains in the presence and absence of the inhibitors was assessed using static cultures, and their capability to convert inhibitors by oxidation and reduction was analyzed.                  Results:                       Although two of the new strains were more sensitive than ATCC 23770 to furan aldehydes, one of the new strains showed superior resistance to both furan aldehydes and phenols, and also displayed high volumetric BNC yield (up to 14.78 ± 0.43 g/L) and high BNC yield on consumed sugar (0.59 ± 0.02 g/g). The inhibitors were oxidized and/or reduced by the strains to be less toxic. The four strains exhibited strong similarities with regard to predominant bioconversion products from the inhibitors, but displayed different capacity to convert the inhibitors, which may be related to the differences in inhibitor tolerance.                  Conclusions:                       This investigation provides information on different performance of four BNC-producing strains in the presence of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors. The results will be of benefit to the selection of more suitable strains for utilization of lignocellulosics in the process of BNC-production.	0
Abstract2class: Penetration depth tunable BODIPY derivatives for pH triggered enhanced photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy Abstract: Improving the deep-tissue phototherapy (PDT) efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) region has become one of the major challenges in clinics for cancer treatment. Developing intelligent photosensitizers (PSs) responding to tumor-specific signals sensitively to minimize side effects is another major challenge for tumor phototherapy. Herein, three phenyl-based boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) compounds with different numbers of diethylaminophenyl groups introduced onto the BODIPY core have been designed and synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The absorbance of these compounds (BDPmPh, BDPbiPh, and BDPtriPh) can be controlled easily for realizing the tunable penetration depth. Moreover, the diethylamino groups in these designed PSs can serve as proton acceptors triggered by the low pH in lysosomes which can enhance the efficacy of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) of the compounds are prepared through a nanoprecipitation method and in vitro studies demonstrate that the ultra-low drug dosage of BDPtriPh NPs (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 4.16 μM) is much lower than that of BDPmPh NPs (50.09 μM) and BDPbiPh NPs (22.4 μM). In vivo fluorescence imaging shows that these NPs can be passively targeted to tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and BDPtriPh NPs exhibit the fastest accumulation (about 4 hours). In vivo phototherapy indicates that BDPtriPh NPs with the longest NIR absorbance (813 nm) and highest photothermal conversion efficiency (60.5%) can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce side effects to normal tissues. This study provides a strategy to modulate the photoconversion characteristics of PSs for both penetration-depth-tunable and pH-dependent PDT/PTT synergistic cancer therapy in clinics.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of the biosynthesis gene cluster for the novel lantibiotic paenilan from Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 and characterization of its product Abstract: Aims:                       To analyse the function of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 and to characterize its product, paenilan.                  Methods and results:                       Comparative analysis of the lantibiotic gene cluster of E681 revealed that the cluster, consisting of 11 open reading frames, is involved in the biosynthesis of a class I lantibiotic. The pnlA gene encoding the prepeptide PnlA was identified and P. polymyxa strain EPT14 producing only paenilan was constructed by knockout of the other five antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters of E681. Paenilan was purified from EPT14 culture by solvent partitioning, ODS silica gel chromatography and reversed-phase preparative HPLC. The molecular mass (2510·10 Da) and structure of paenilan analysed by Nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS showed that paenilan is a novel class I lantibiotic. Paenilan exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus and Paenibacillus durus. The paenilan gene is well-conserved in different Paenibacillus sp. isolated from globally distant places.                  Conclusions:                       The lantibiotic gene cluster of P. polymyxa E681 was analysed and its product, a novel and useful lantibiotic named paenilan that inhibits the growth of some Gram-positive bacteria, was characterized.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Paenibacillus species are a good source of new lantibiotics, and the conservation of the paenilan gene among Paenibacillus sp. implies paenilan has an important function(s) for their survival.	1
Abstract2class: Genomics-driven discovery of chiral triscatechol siderophores with enantiomeric Fe(iii) coordination Abstract: Ferric complexes of triscatechol siderophores may assume one of two enantiomeric configurations at the iron site. Chirality is known to be important in the iron uptake process, however an understanding of the molecular features directing stereospecific coordination remains ambiguous. Synthesis of the full suite of (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 macrolactone diastereomers, which includes the siderophore cyclic trichrysobactin (CTC), enables the effects that the chirality of Lys and Ser residues exert on the configuration of the Fe(iii) complex to be defined. Computationally optimized geometries indicate that the Λ/Δ configurational preferences are set by steric interactions between the Lys sidechains and the peptide backbone. The ability of each (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 diastereomer to form a stable Fe(iii) complex prompted a genomic search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the synthesis of these diastereomers in microbes. The genome of the plant pathogen Dickeya chrysanthemi EC16 was sequenced and the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of CTC were identified. A related but distinct BGC was identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Yersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641; isolation of the siderophore from Y. frederiksenii ATCC 33641, named frederiksenibactin (FSB), revealed the triscatechol oligoester, linear-(DHBLLysLSer)3. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy establishes that Fe(iii)-CTC and Fe(iii)-FSB are formed in opposite enantiomeric configuration, consistent with the results of the ferric complexes of the cyclic (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 diastereomers.	1
Abstract2class: bryA: an unusual modular polyketide synthase gene from the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina Abstract: "Candidatus Endobugula sertula," the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of Bugula neritina, is the proposed source of the bryostatin family of anticancer compounds. We cloned a large modular polyketide synthase (PKS) gene complex from "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" and characterized one gene, bryA, which we propose is responsible for the initial steps of bryostatin biosynthesis. Typical PKS domains are present. However, acyltransferase domains are lacking in bryA, and beta-ketoacyl synthase domains of bryA cluster with those of PKSs with discrete, rather than integral, acyltransferases. We propose a model for biosynthesis of the bryostatin D-lactate starter unit by the bryA loading module, utilizing atypical domains homologous to FkbH, KR, and DH. The bryA gene product is proposed to synthesize a portion of the pharmacologically active part of bryostatin and may be useful in semisynthesis of clinically useful bryostatin analogs.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous production of fosfomycin and identification of the minimal biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Fosfomycin is a clinically utilized, highly effective antibiotic, which is active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant pathogens. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces fradiae and heterologous production of fosfomycin in S. lividans. Sequence analysis coupled with gene deletion and disruption revealed that the minimal cluster consists of fom1-4, fomA-D. A LuxR-type activator that was apparently required for heterologous fosfomycin production was also discovered approximately 13 kb away from the cluster and was named fomR. The genes fomE and fomF, previously thought to be involved in fosfomycin biosynthesis, were shown not to be essential by gene disruption. This work provides new insights into fosfomycin biosynthesis and opens the door for fosfomycin overproduction and creation of new analogs via biomolecular pathway engineering.	1
Abstract2class: A fungal ketoreductase domain that displays substrate-dependent stereospecificity Abstract: Iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases from filamentous fungi are the most complex and enigmatic type of polyketide synthase discovered to date. Here we uncover an unusual degree of programming by the hypothemycin highly reducing polyketide synthase, in which a single ketoreductase domain shows stereospecificity that is controlled by substrate length. Mapping of the structural domains responsible for this feature allowed for the biosynthesis of an unnatural diastereomer of the natural product dehydrozearalenol.	0
Abstract2class: Rapid Recognition and Targeted Isolation of Anti-HIV Daphnane Diterpenes from Daphne genkwa Guided by UPLC-MSn Abstract: Daphnane diterpenes with a 5/7/6-tricyclic ring system exhibit potent anti-HIV activity but are found in low abundance as plant natural products. In this study, an effective approach based on mass spectrometric fragmentation pathways was conducted to specifically recognize and isolate anti-HIV compounds of this type from Daphne genkwa. Briefly, the fragmentation pathways of reference analogues were elucidated based on characteristic ion fragments of m/z 323 → 295 → 267 or m/z 253 → 238 → 197 by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-IT-MSn) and then applied to the differentiations of substances with or without an oxygenated group at C-12. Twenty-seven daphnane diterpenes were successfully recognized from a petroleum ether extract of D. genkwa, including some potential new compounds and isomers that could not be identified accurately only from the ion fragments. Further separation of these target compounds using high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) and preparative HPLC led to the isolation of three new (11, 25, and 27) and 14 known compounds, whose structures were identified and confirmed based on MS, NMR, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. The isolates exhibited anti-HIV activities at nanomolar concentrations. The results demonstrated that this strategy is feasible and reliable to rapidly recognize and isolate daphnane diterpenes from D. genkwa.	0
Abstract2class: Inhibitory effect of FK-565 alone and in combination with zidovudine on retroviral infection by Friend leukemia virus in mice Abstract: The effects of route and starting time of administration on FK-565 inhibition of splenomegaly by Friend leukemia virus (FLV) were studied in mice, and the concomitant effect of FK-565 in allowing reduction of zidovudine dosage was estimated. FK-565 inhibited splenomegaly in intravenous and oral doses of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg, but time of initial dosing had little effect on this inhibition. When 0.01 or 1 mg/kg of FK-565 was given intravenously with intraperitoneal doses of 0.63, 2.5, 10 and 40m g/kg of zidovudine, the inhibition rate of splenomegaly at all doses was markedly and dose-dependently higher than when either drug was given alone, and the concomitant use of FK-565 with zidovudine enabled a 16-fold reduction of the dose of zidovudine. The survival rate and survival time after infection with massive amounts of FLV were higher when FK-565 1 mg/kg and zidovudine 20 mg/kg were given in combination than when either drug was given alone. Inhibition of FLV splenomegaly was reflected in the prolonged survival time of the infected mice.	0
Abstract2class: Anthracycline metabolites from baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788. II. New anthracycline metabolites produced by a blocked mutant strain RPM-5 Abstract: A daunorubicin-blocked mutant strain RPM-5 derived from a new baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788 accumulated a major precursor metabolite D788-1 (10-carboxyl-13-deoxocarminomycin) and nine minor metabolites in the culture broth.

Abstract2class: Challenges and opportunities for natural product discovery, production, and engineering in native producers versus heterologous hosts Abstract: Recent advances and emerging technologies for metabolic pathway engineering and synthetic biology have transformed the field of natural product discovery, production, and engineering. Despite these advancements, there remain many challenges in understanding how biosynthetic gene clusters are silenced or activated, including changes in the transcription of key biosynthetic and regulatory genes. This knowledge gap is highlighted by the success and failed attempts of manipulating regulatory genes within biosynthetic gene clusters in both native producers and heterologous hosts. These complexities make the choice of native producers versus heterologous hosts, fermentation medium, and supply of precursors crucial factors in achieving the production of the target natural products and engineering designer analogs. Nature continues to serve as inspiration for filling the knowledge gaps and developing new research strategies. By exploiting the evolutionary power of nature, alternative producers, with the desired genetic amenability and higher titers of the target natural products, and new strains, harboring gene clusters that encode evolutionary optimized congeners of the targeted natural product scaffolds, can be discovered. These newly identified strains can serve as an outstanding biotechnology platform for the engineered production of sufficient quantities of the target natural products and their analogs, enabling biosynthetic studies and potential therapeutic applications. These challenges and opportunities are showcased herein using fredericamycin, iso-migrastatin, platencin and platensimycin, the enediynes of C-1027, tiancimycin, and yangpumicin, and the leinamycin family of natural products.	0
Abstract2class: Evidence for production of a new lantibiotic (butyrivibriocin OR79A) by the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OR79: characterization of the structural gene encoding butyrivibriocin OR79A Abstract: The ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OR79 produces a bacteriocin-like activity demonstrating a very broad spectrum of activity. An inhibitor was isolated from spent culture fluid by a combination of ammonium sulfate and acidic precipitations, reverse-phase chromatography, and high-resolution gel filtration. N-terminal analysis of the isolated inhibitor yielded a 15-amino-acid sequence (G-N/Q-G/P-V-I-L-X-I-X-H-E-X-S-M-N). Two different amino acid residues were detected in the second and third positions from the N terminus, indicating the presence of two distinct peptides. A gene with significant homology to one combination of the determined N-terminal sequence was cloned, and expression of the gene was confirmed by Northern blotting. The gene (bvi79A) encoded a prepeptide of 47 amino acids and a mature peptide, butyrivibriocin OR79A, of 25 amino acids. Significant sequence homology was found between this peptide and previously reported lantibiotics containing the double-glycine leader peptidase processing site. Immediately downstream of bvi79A was a second, partial open reading frame encoding a peptide with significant homology to proteins which are believed to be involved in the synthesis of lanthionine residues. These findings indicate that the isolated inhibitory peptides represent new lantibiotics. Results from both total and N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the second peptide was identical to butyrivibriocin OR79A except for amino acid substitutions in positions 2 and 3 of the mature lantibiotic. Only a single coding region was detected when restriction enzyme digests of total DNA were probed either with an oligonucleotide based on the 5' region of bvi79A or with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the predicted sequence of the second peptide.	1
Abstract2class: Twenty-five coregulated transcripts define a sterigmatocystin gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Sterigmatocystin (ST) and the aflatoxins (AFs), related fungal secondary metabolites, are among the most toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic natural products known. The ST biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus nidulans is estimated to involve at least 15 enzymatic activities, while certain Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus nomius strains contain additional activities that convert ST to AF. We have characterized a 60-kb region in the A. nidulans genome and find it contains many, if not all, of the genes needed for ST biosynthesis. This region includes verA, a structural gene previously shown to be required for ST biosynthesis, and 24 additional closely spaced transcripts ranging in size from 0.6 to 7.2 kb that are coordinately induced only under ST-producing conditions. Each end of this gene cluster is demarcated by transcripts that are expressed under both ST-inducing and non-ST-inducing conditions. Deduced polypeptide sequences of regions within this cluster had a high percentage of identity with enzymes that have activities predicted for ST/AF biosynthesis, including a polyketide synthase, a fatty acid synthase (alpha and beta subunits), five monooxygenases, four dehydrogenases, an esterase, an 0-methyltransferase, a reductase, an oxidase, and a zinc cluster DNA binding protein. A revised system for naming the genes of the ST pathway is presented.	1
Abstract2class: Withanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis peruviana and Their Selective Cytotoxicity to Prostate Cancer and Renal Carcinoma Cells Abstract: Investigation of aeroponically grown Physalis peruviana resulted in the isolation of 11 new withanolides, including perulactones I-L (1-4), 17-deoxy-23β-hydroxywithanolide E (5), 23β-hydroxywithanolide E (6), 4-deoxyphyperunolide A (7), 7β-hydroxywithanolide F (8), 7β-hydroxy-17-epi-withanolide K (9), 24,25-dihydro-23β,28-dihydroxywithanolide G (10), and 24,25-dihydrowithanolide E (11), together with 14 known withanolides (12-25). The structures of 1-11 were elucidated by the analysis of their spectroscopic data, and 12-25 were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported. All withanolides were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of tumor cell lines including LNCaP (androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma), 22Rv1 (androgen-resistant human prostate adenocarcinoma), ACHN (human renal adenocarcinoma), M14 (human melanoma), SK-MEL-28 (human melanoma), and normal human foreskin fibroblast cells. Of these, the 17β-hydroxywithanolides (17-BHWs) 6, 8, 9, 11-13, 15, and 19-22 showed selective cytotoxic activity against the two prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1, whereas 13 and 20 exhibited selective toxicity for the ACHN renal carcinoma cell line. These cytotoxicity data provide additional structure-activity relationship information for the 17-BHWs.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of (+/-)-vibralactone Abstract: Reductive alkylation of methyl 2-methoxybenzoate with prenyl bromide and hydrolysis afforded methyl 6-oxo-1-prenyl-2-cyclohexenecarboxylate. Reduction of the ketone, hydrolysis, iodolactonization, ozonolysis, and intramolecular aldol reaction provided a spiro lactone cyclopentenal. Retro-iodolactonization with activated Zn, formation of the beta-lactone, and reduction of the aldehyde completed an efficient first synthesis of (+/-)-vibralactone. No protecting groups were used except for the novel use of an iodolactone to protect both the prenyl double bond and carboxylic acid.	0
Abstract2class: Targeted Rediscovery and Biosynthesis of the Farnesyl-Transferase Inhibitor Pepticinnamin E Abstract: The natural product pepticinnamin E potently inhibits protein farnesyl transferases and has potential applications in treating cancer and malaria. Pepticinnamin E contains a rare N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety as well as several nonproteinogenic amino acids, including the unusual 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine. The biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E has remained uncharacterized because its original producing strain is no longer available. Here we identified a gene cluster (pcm) for this natural product in a new producer, Actinobacteria bacterium OK006, by means of a targeted rediscovery strategy. We demonstrated that the pcm cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, a nonribosomal peptide/polyketide hybrid. We also characterized a key O-methyltransferase that modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. Our work has identified the gene cluster for pepticinnamins for the first time and sets the stage for elucidating the unique chemistry required for biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Unveiling of Swainsonine Biosynthesis via a Multibranched Pathway in Fungi Abstract: The indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine (SW) is a deadly mycotoxin to livestock that can be produced by different plant-associated fungi, including the endophytic entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium species. The SW biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified but the genetic mechanism of SW biosynthesis remains obscure. To unveil the SW biosynthetic pathway, we performed gene deletions in M. robertsii, heterologous expression of a core biosynthetic gene, substrate feedings, mass spectrometry, and bioassay analyses in this study. It was unveiled that SW is produced via a multibranched pathway by the hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) gene cluster in M. robertsii. The precursor pipecolic acid can be converted from lysine by both the SW biosynthetic cluster and the unclustered genes such as lysine cyclodeaminase. The hybrid NRPS-PKS enzyme produces three intermediates with and without domain skipping. Intriguingly, the biosynthetic process is coupled with the cis to trans nonenzymatic epimerization of C1-OH for both hydroxyl- and dihydroxyl-indolizidine intermediates. We also found that SW production was dispensable for fungal colonization of plants and infection of insect hosts. Functional characterization of the SW biosynthetic genes in this study may benefit the safe use of Metarhizium fungi as insect biocontrol agents and the management of livestock pastures from SW contamination by genetic manipulation of the toxin-producing fungi.	1
Abstract2class: Co-expression of 15 contiguous genes delineates a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella moniliformis and are associated with cancer in rodents. In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 75-kb region of G. moniliformis DNA and identified 18 heretofore undescribed genes flanking a cluster of five previously identified fumonisin biosynthetic (FUM) genes. Ten of the newly identified genes downstream of the cluster were coregulated with FUM genes and exhibited patterns of expression that were correlated with fumonisin production. BLASTX analyses indicated that the predicted functions of proteins encoded by the 10 genes were consistent with activities expected for fumonisin biosynthesis or self-protection. These data indicate that the 10 newly identified genes and the previously identified FUM genes constitute a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster. Disruption of two of the new genes, encoding longevity assurance factors, had no apparent effect on fumonisin production, but disruption of a third, encoding an ABC transporter, had a subtle effect on ratios of fumonisins produced.	1
Abstract2class: The contribution of syringopeptin and syringomycin to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain B301D on the basis of sypA and syrB1 biosynthesis mutant analysis Abstract: Sequencing of an approximately 3.9-kb fragment downstream of the syrD gene of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain B301D revealed that this region, designated sypA, codes for a peptide synthetase, a multifunctional enzyme involved in the thiotemplate mechanism of peptide biosynthesis. The translated protein sequence encompasses a complete amino acid activation module containing the conserved domains characteristic of peptide synthetases. Analysis of the substrate specificity region of this module indicates that it incorporates 2,3-dehydroaminobutyric acid into the syringopeptin peptide structure. Bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography data confirmed that disruption of the sypA gene in strain B301D resulted in the loss of syringopeptin production. The contribution of syringopeptin and syringomycin to the virulence of P. syringae pv. syringae strain B301D was examined in immature sweet cherry with sypA and syrB1 synthetase mutants defective in the production of the two toxins, respectively. Syringopeptin (sypA) and syringomycin (syrB1) mutants were reduced in virulence 59 and 26%, respectively, compared with the parental strain in cherry, whereas the syringopeptin-syringomycin double mutant was reduced 76% in virulence. These data demonstrate that syringopeptin and syringomycin are major virulence determinants of P. syringae pv. syringae.	1
Abstract2class: A versatile synthetic route for the preparation of titanium metal-organic frameworks Abstract: Exploitation of new titanium metal-organic frameworks (Ti-MOFs) with high crystallinity has been attracting great attention due to their vast application potential in photocatalysis. Herein a versatile synthetic strategy, namely, High Valence Metathesis and Oxidation (HVMO), is developed to synthesize a series of Ti-MOFs with predesigned topologies and structures. The crystallinity of these Ti-MOFs was well maintained throughout, as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption measurements. Significantly, there were only a few examples of Ti-MOFs, not to mention a general synthetic strategy for various kinds of Ti-MOFs in the literature. This contribution also illustrates the intriguing potential of Ti-MOF platforms in photocatalysis.	0
Abstract2class: Production of proteasome inhibitor syringolin A by the endophyte Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 Abstract: Syringolin A, the product of a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase encoded by the syl gene cluster, is a virulence factor secreted by certain Pseudomonas syringae strains. Together with the glidobactins produced by a number of beta- and gammaproteobacterial human and animal pathogens, it belongs to the syrbactins, a structurally novel class of proteasome inhibitors. In plants, proteasome inhibition by syringolin A-producing P. syringae strains leads to the suppression of host defense pathways requiring proteasome activity, such as the ones mediated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Here we report the discovery of a syl-like gene cluster with some unusual features in the alphaproteobacterial endophyte Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 that encodes a putative syringolin A-like synthetase whose components share 55% to 65% sequence identity (72% to 79% similarity) at the amino acid level. As revealed by average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculations, this strain likely belongs to the same species as biocontrol strain R. rhizogenes K84 (formely known as Agrobacterium radiobacter K84), which, however, carries a nonfunctional deletion remnant of the syl-like gene cluster. Here we present a functional analysis of the syl-like gene cluster of Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 and demonstrate that this endophyte synthesizes syringolin A and some related minor variants, suggesting that proteasome inhibition by syrbactin production can be important not only for pathogens but also for endophytic bacteria in the interaction with their hosts.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on WB-3559 A, B, C and D, new potent fibrinolytic agents. I. Discovery, identification, isolation and characterization Abstract: WB-3559 A, B, C and D were produced by a bacterium which was classified as a member of the genus Flavobacterium. These compounds were purified by solvent extraction followed by chromatography on silica gel and then isolated by HPLC. The chemical structures were determined on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence as in the succeeding papers. WB-3559 A, B, C and D stimulated rabbit plasma euglobulin clot lysis time. A chemically synthesized compound (WB-3559 D-syn) stimulated mouse plasma euglobulin clot lysis time when injected intravenously.	0
Abstract2class: Performance and microbial community variations of anaerobic digesters under increasing tetracycline concentrations Abstract: The impact of different concentrations of tetracycline on the performance of anaerobic treatment was evaluated. Results revealed that for all of the tested tetracycline concentrations, no major sustained impact on methane production was observed. Instead, a significant increase in propionic acid was observed in the reactor subjected to the highest concentration of tetracycline (20 mg/L). Microbial community analyses suggest that an alternative methanogenic pathway, specifically that of methanol-utilizing methanogens, may be important for ensuring the stability of methane production in the presence of high tetracycline concentrations. In addition, the accumulation of propionate was due to an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFA)-producing bacteria coupled with a reduction in propionate utilizers. An increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes associated with ribosomal protection proteins was observed after 30 days of exposure to high concentrations of tetracycline, while other targeted resistance genes showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that anaerobic treatment processes can robustly treat wastewater with varying concentrations of antibiotics while also deriving value-added products and minimizing the dissemination of associated antibiotic resistance genes.	0
Abstract2class: Structural and Biosynthetic Analysis of the Fabrubactins, Unusual Siderophores from Agrobacterium fabrum Strain C58 Abstract: Siderophores are iron-chelating molecules produced by microorganisms and plants to acquire exogenous iron. Siderophore biosynthetic enzymology often produces elaborate and unique molecules through unusual reactions to enable specific recognition by the producing organisms. Herein, we report the structure of two siderophore analogs from Agrobacterium fabrum strain C58, which we named fabrubactin (FBN) A and FBN B. Additionally, we characterized the substrate specificities of the NRPS and PKS components. The structures suggest unique Favorskii-like rearrangements of the molecular backbone that we propose are catalyzed by the flavin-dependent monooxygenase, FbnE. FBN A and B contain a 1,1-dimethyl-3-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-quinolin (Dmaq) moiety previously seen only in the anachelin cyanobacterial siderophores. We provide evidence that Dmaq is derived from l-DOPA and propose a mechanism for the formation of the mature Dmaq moiety. Our bioinformatic analyses suggest that FBN A and B and the anachelins belong to a large and diverse siderophore family widespread throughout the Rhizobium/Agrobacterium group, α-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery and Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin in Distantly Related Bacterial Classes Abstract: Bicyclomycin (BCM) is a clinically promising antibiotic that is biosynthesized by Streptomyces cinnamoneus DSM 41675. BCM is structurally characterized by a core cyclo(l-Ile-l-Leu) 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) that is extensively oxidized. Here, we identify the BCM biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows that the core of BCM is biosynthesized by a cyclodipeptide synthase, and the oxidative modifications are introduced by five 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The discovery of the gene cluster enabled the identification of BCM pathways encoded by the genomes of hundreds of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates distributed globally, and heterologous expression of the pathway from P. aeruginosa SCV20265 demonstrated that the product is chemically identical to BCM produced by S. cinnamoneus Overall, putative BCM gene clusters have been found in at least seven genera spanning Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria). This represents a rare example of horizontal gene transfer of an intact biosynthetic gene cluster across such distantly related bacteria, and we show that these gene clusters are almost always associated with mobile genetic elements.IMPORTANCE Bicyclomycin is the only natural product antibiotic that selectively inhibits the transcription termination factor Rho. This mechanism of action, combined with its proven biological safety and its activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, makes it a very promising antibiotic candidate. Here, we report the identification of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the known bicyclomycin-producing organism Streptomyces cinnamoneus, which will enable the engineered production of new bicyclomycin derivatives. The identification of this gene cluster also led to the discovery of hundreds of bicyclomycin pathways encoded in highly diverse bacteria, including in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa This wide distribution of a complex biosynthetic pathway is very unusual and provides an insight into how a pathway for an antibiotic can be transferred between diverse bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Tannerella forsythia strains display different cell-surface nonulosonic acids: biosynthetic pathway characterization and first insight into biological implications Abstract: Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative periodontal pathogen. A unique O-linked oligosaccharide decorates the bacterium's cell surface proteins and was shown to modulate the host immune response. In our study, we investigated the biosynthesis of the nonulosonic acid (NulO) present at the terminal position of this glycan. A bioinformatic analysis of T. forsythia genomes revealed a gene locus for the synthesis of pseudaminic acid (Pse) in the type strain ATCC 43037 while strains FDC 92A2 and UB4 possess a locus for the synthesis of legionaminic acid (Leg) instead. In contrast to the NulO in ATCC 43037, which has been previously identified as a Pse derivative (5-N-acetimidoyl-7-N-glyceroyl-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-NulO), glycan analysis of strain UB4 performed in this study indicated a 350-Da, possibly N-glycolyl Leg (3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-NulO) derivative with unknown C5,7 N-acyl moieties. We have expressed, purified and characterized enzymes of both NulO pathways to confirm these genes' functions. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), CE-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, our studies revealed that Pse biosynthesis in ATCC 43037 essentially follows the UDP-sugar route described in Helicobacter pylori, while the pathway in strain FDC 92A2 corresponds to Leg biosynthesis in Campylobacter jejuni involving GDP-sugar intermediates. To demonstrate that the NulO biosynthesis enzymes are functional in vivo, we created knockout mutants resulting in glycans lacking the respective NulO. Compared to the wild-type strains, the mutants exhibited significantly reduced biofilm formation on mucin-coated surfaces, suggestive of their involvement in host-pathogen interactions or host survival. This study contributes to understanding possible biological roles of bacterial NulOs.	1
Abstract2class: Transcriptional regulation by small RNAs at sequences downstream from 3' gene termini Abstract: Transcriptome studies reveal many noncoding transcripts overlapping 3' gene termini. The function of these transcripts is unknown. Here we have characterized transcription at the progesterone receptor (PR) locus and identified noncoding transcripts that overlap the 3' end of the gene. Small RNAs complementary to sequences beyond the 3' terminus of PR mRNA modulated expression of PR, recruited argonaute 2 to a 3' noncoding transcript, altered occupancy of RNA polymerase II, induced chromatin changes at the PR promoter and affected responses to physiological stimuli. We found that the promoter and 3' terminal regions of the PR locus are in close proximity, providing a potential mechanism for RNA-mediated control of transcription over long genomic distances. These results extend the potential for small RNAs to regulate transcription to target sequences beyond the 3' termini of mRNA.	0
Abstract2class: Kaempulchraols A-H, Diterpenoids from the Rhizomes of Kaempferia pulchra Collected in Myanmar Abstract: Eight new diterpenoids, kaempulchraols A-H (1-8), along with five known analogues were isolated from the CHCl3-soluble extract of rhizomes of Kaempferia pulchra of Myanmar. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction analysis. All the isolates were tested for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (A549, human lung cancer; HeLa, human cervix cancer; PANC-1 and PSN-1, human pancreatic cancer; MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer) and TIG-3, normal human primary fibroblast cells. Kaempulchraol F (6) exhibited weak activity against the human pancreatic PSN-1 cell line with an IC50 value of 12.3 μM.	0
Abstract2class: In vitro characterization of echinomycin biosynthesis: formation and hydroxylation of L-tryptophanyl-S-enzyme and oxidation of (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan Abstract: Quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) feature in quinomycin family and confer anticancer activity. In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on β-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts Abstract: Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate-bearing natural product from beetle-associated bacteria (Burkholderia gladioli) that might protect beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable-isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis, we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer into isonitrile precursors.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on condensed-heterocyclic azolium cephalosporins. V. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-(condensed-triazolo-pyridinium, -pyrimidinium, and -pyridazinium)-methyl cephalosporins Abstract: As a part of our studies on cephalosporins bearing condensed-heterocyclic azolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus, we describe here the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido] cephalosporins (1-16, 7 beta-[2-(2-amino-5-chlorothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)- methoxyiminoacetamido] cephalosporins (17,18) and 7 beta-[2-(5-amino- 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido) cephalosporins (19-23) containing a variety of condensed-heterocyclic triazolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus. These cephalosporins exhibited potent antibacterial activity, and it appears that condensed-heterocyclic triazolium as well as condensed-heterocyclic imidazolium rings are effective moieties for improving antibacterial activity and the spectrum of activity. Among the cephalosporins tested, 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(5- methyl[1,2,3]triazolo-[1,5-alpha]pyridinium-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (9) and 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(6- methoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-alpha]pyridinium-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (11) showed good antibacterial activity.	0
Abstract2class: Iodine-Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol Abstract: Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco-social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2-mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuI I2 ]- species, which undergoes subsequent ligand-exchange reactions and forms a stable bis-ligand AuI complex. H2 O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.	0
Abstract2class: Effects of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene knockouts on erythromycin production in carbohydrate-based and oil-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: In carbohydrate-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, a polar knockout of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) gene, mutB, improved erythromycin production an average of 126% (within the range of 102-153% for a 0.95 confidence interval). In oil-based fermentations, where erythromycin production by the wild-type strain averages 184% higher (141-236%, 0.95 CI) than in carbohydrate-based fermentations, the same polar knockout in mutB surprisingly reduced erythromycin production by 66% (53-76%, 0.95 CI). A metabolic model is proposed where in carbohydrate-based fermentations MCM acts as a drain on the methylmalonyl-CoA metabolite pool, and in oil-based fermentations, MCM acts in the reverse direction to fill the methylmalonyl-CoA pool. Therefore, the model explains, in part, how the well-known oil-based process improvement for erythromycin production operates at the biochemical level; furthermore, it illustrates how the mutB erythromycin strain improvement mutation operates at the genetic level in carbohydrate-based fermentations.	1
Abstract2class: Transcriptome Analysis of Aspergillus flavus Reveals veA-Dependent Regulation of Secondary Metabolite Gene Clusters, Including the Novel Aflavarin Cluster Abstract: The global regulatory veA gene governs development and secondary metabolism in numerous fungal species, including Aspergillus flavus. This is especially relevant since A. flavus infects crops of agricultural importance worldwide, contaminating them with potent mycotoxins. The most well-known are aflatoxins, which are cytotoxic and carcinogenic polyketide compounds. The production of aflatoxins and the expression of genes implicated in the production of these mycotoxins are veA dependent. The genes responsible for the synthesis of aflatoxins are clustered, a signature common for genes involved in fungal secondary metabolism. Studies of the A. flavus genome revealed many gene clusters possibly connected to the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Many of these metabolites are still unknown, or the association between a known metabolite and a particular gene cluster has not yet been established. In the present transcriptome study, we show that veA is necessary for the expression of a large number of genes. Twenty-eight out of the predicted 56 secondary metabolite gene clusters include at least one gene that is differentially expressed depending on presence or absence of veA. One of the clusters under the influence of veA is cluster 39. The absence of veA results in a downregulation of the five genes found within this cluster. Interestingly, our results indicate that the cluster is expressed mainly in sclerotia. Chemical analysis of sclerotial extracts revealed that cluster 39 is responsible for the production of aflavarin.	1
Abstract2class: Anthranilate-activating modules from fungal nonribosomal peptide assembly lines Abstract: Fungal natural products containing benzodiazepinone- and quinazolinone-fused ring systems can be assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) using the conformationally restricted beta-amino acid anthranilate as one of the key building blocks. We validated that the first module of the acetylaszonalenin synthetase of Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181 activates anthranilate to anthranilyl-AMP. With this as a starting point, we then used bioinformatic predictions about fungal adenylation domain selectivities to identify and confirm an anthranilate-activating module in the fumiquinazoline A producer Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 as well as a second anthranilate-activating NRPS in N. fischeri. This establishes an anthranilate adenylation domain code for fungal NRPS and should facilitate detection and cloning of gene clusters for benzodiazepine- and quinazoline-containing polycyclic alkaloids with a wide range of biological activities.	1
Abstract2class: Antimicrobial activity of clioquinol and nitroxoline: a scoping review Abstract: Clioquinol and nitroxoline, two drugs with numerous pharmacological properties fallen into disuse for many decades. The first was considered dangerous due to contraindications and the second mainly because was taken as ineffective, despite its known antibacterial activity. In the last decades, the advances in pharmaceutical chemistry, molecular biology, toxicology and genetics allowed to better understand the cellular action of these compounds, some toxicological issues and/or activity scopes. Thus, a new opportunity for these drugs to be considered as potential antimicrobial agents has arisen. This review contemplates the trajectory of clioquinol and nitroxoline from their emergence to the present day, emphasizing the new studies that indicate the possibility of reintroduction for specific cases.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous Expression of Fluostatin Gene Cluster Leads to a Bioactive Heterodimer Abstract: The biosynthesis gene cluster (fls) for atypical angucycline fluostatins was identified from the marine derived Micromonospora rosaria SCSIO N160 and was confirmed by gene knockouts and the biochemical characterization of a bifunctional oxygenase FlsO2. The absolute configuration of the key biosynthetic intermediate prejadomycin was determined for the first time by Cu Kα X-ray analysis. Heterologous expression of the intact fls-gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor YF11 in the presence of 3% sea salts led to the isolation of two new compounds: fluostatin L (1) and difluostatin A (2). Difluostatin A (2), an unusual heterodimer, exhibited antibacterial activities.	1
Abstract2class: A stand-alone adenylation domain forms amide bonds in streptothricin biosynthesis Abstract: The streptothricin (ST) antibiotics, produced by Streptomyces bacteria, contain L-β-lysine ((3S)-3,6-diaminohexanoic acid) oligopeptides as pendant chains. Here we describe three unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) involved in ST biosynthesis: ORF 5 (a stand-alone adenylation (A) domain), ORF 18 (containing thiolation (T) and condensation (C) domains) and ORF 19 (a stand-alone A domain). We demonstrate that ST biosynthesis begins with adenylation of L-β-lysine by ORF 5, followed by transfer to the T domain of ORF 18. In contrast, L-β-lysine molecules adenylated by ORF 19 are used to elongate an L-β-lysine peptide chain on ORF 18, a reaction unexpectedly catalyzed by ORF 19 itself. Finally, the C domain of ORF 18 catalyzes the condensation of L-β-lysine oligopeptides covalently bound to ORF 18 with a freely diffusible intermediate to release the ST products. These results highlight an unusual activity for an A domain and unique mechanisms of crosstalk within NRPS machinery.	1
Abstract2class: Mass spectrometry and the emerging field of glycomics Abstract: The biological significance of protein and lipid glycosylation is well established. For example, cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering glycan structures on their surfaces, and cancer cells evade normal growth regulation in part by remodeling their surface glycans. In general, glycan chemical properties differ significantly from those of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecule metabolites. Thus, advances in glycomics, a comprehensive study to identify all glycans in an organism, rely on the development of specialized analytical methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as an enabling technology in the field of glycomics. This review summarizes recent developments in mass spectrometric analysis methods for protein-based glycomics and glycoproteomics workflows.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic gene cluster of the non-ribosomally synthesized cyclodepsipeptide skyllamycin: deciphering unprecedented ways of unusual hydroxylation reactions Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptide skyllamycin A is a potent inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway by inhibiting binding of homodimeric PDGF BB to the PDGF β-receptor. Its structure contains a cinnamoyl side chain and shows a high amount of β-hydroxylated amino acids as well as an unusual α-hydroxyglycine moiety as a rare structural modification. The skyllamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces sp. Acta 2897. Its analysis revealed the presence of open reading frames encoding proteins for fatty acid precursor biosynthesis, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, regulators, and transporters along with other modifying enzymes. Specific in-frame mutagenesis of these tailoring enzymes resulted in the production of novel skyllamycin derivatives revealing that β-hydroxy groups in skyllamycin A are introduced by a promiscuous cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, whereas a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase is involved in α-hydroxylation.	1
Abstract2class: Synergistic antibacterial and antibiotic effects of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids on clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Abstract: The antibacterial activity of two bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, tetrandrine (Tet) and demethyltetrandrine (d-Tet), alone and in combination with the antibiotics ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), cefazolin (CFZ) and levofloxacin (LEV) against 10 clinical isolates of staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) III type methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was studied. Susceptibility to each agent alone was tested using a broth microdilution method. The chequerboard and time-kill tests were used for the combined evaluations. The minimal inhibitory concentrations/minimal bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs, μg/mL) ranges alone were 64-128/256-1,024 for both Tet and d-Tet. Significant synergies against 90% of the isolates were observed for the Tet/CFZ combination, with their MICs being reduced by 75-94% [fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) ranged from 0.188 to 0.625], respectively. An additive bactericidal result was also observed for the Tet (d-Tet)/CFZ combination in the time-kill experiments. These results demonstrated that Tet and d-Tet enhanced the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of CFZ. Their potential for combinatory therapy of patients infected with MRSA warrants further pharmacological investigation.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of a widely distributed toxin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Bacteriocins represent a large family of ribosomally produced peptide antibiotics. Here we describe the discovery of a widely conserved biosynthetic gene cluster for the synthesis of thiazole and oxazole heterocycles on ribosomally produced peptides. These clusters encode a toxin precursor and all necessary proteins for toxin maturation and export. Using the toxin precursor peptide and heterocycle-forming synthetase proteins from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, we demonstrate the in vitro reconstitution of streptolysin S activity. We provide evidence that the synthetase enzymes, as predicted from our bioinformatics analysis, introduce heterocycles onto precursor peptides, thereby providing molecular insight into the chemical structure of streptolysin S. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the synthetase exhibits relaxed substrate specificity and modifies toxin precursors from both related and distant species. Given our findings, it is likely that the discovery of similar peptidic toxins will rapidly expand to existing and emerging genomes.	1
Abstract2class: Iteration as programmed event during polyketide assembly; molecular analysis of the aureothin biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Analysis of the type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the rare nitroaryl polyketide metabolite aureothin (aur) from Streptomyces thioluteus HKI-227 has revealed only four modules to catalyze the five polyketide chain extensions required. By heterologous expression of the aur PKS cluster, direct evidence was obtained that these modules were sufficient to support aureothin biosynthesis. It appears that one module catalyzes two successive cycles of chain extension, one of the first examples of a PKS in which such iteration or "stuttering" is required to produce the normal polyketide product. In addition, lack of a specified loading domain implicates a novel PKS priming mechanism involving the unique p-nitrobenzoate starter unit. The 27 kb aur gene cluster also encodes a novel N-oxidase, which may represent the first member of a new family of such enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of the eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. BR-2 Abstract: Forty-four eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-producing microbial strains were isolated from the intestines of marine fishes. Among them, one strain showing a maximum level of EPA (4.78%of total fatty acids) was identified as Shewanella sp. BR-2 on the basis of its 16S rRNA sequence. The EPA content reached a maximum level during the mid-exponential phase of cell growth, and gradually decreased with further growth of the cells. A cosmid DNA including the EPA biosynthesis gene cluster consisting of pfaA-E was isolated from a cosmid library of genomic DNA of Shewanella sp. BR-2, named pCosEPA-BR2. An E. coli clone harboring pCosEPA-BR2 produced EPA at a maximum level of 7.5%of total fatty acids, confirming the EPA biosynthesis activity of the cloned gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Organohalogens Naturally Biosynthesized in Marine Environments and Produced as Disinfection Byproducts Alter Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Dynamics Abstract: Contemporary sources of organohalogens produced as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are receiving considerable attention as emerging pollutants because of their abundance, persistence, and potential to structurally mimic natural organohalogens produced by bacteria that serve signaling or toxicological functions in marine environments. Here, we tested 34 organohalogens from anthropogenic and marine sources to identify compounds active toward ryanodine receptor (RyR1), known toxicological targets of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). [3H]Ryanodine ([3H]Ry) binding screening (≤2 μM) identified 10 highly active organohalogens. Further analysis indicated that 2,3-dibromoindole (14), tetrabromopyrrole (31), and 2,3,5-tribromopyrrole (34) at 10 μM were the most efficacious at enhancing [3H]Ry binding. Interestingly, these congeners also inhibited microsomal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1a). Dual SERCA1a inhibition and RyR1 activation triggered Ca2+ efflux from microsomal vesicles with initial rates rank ordered 31 > 34 > 14. Hexabromobipyrroles (25) enhanced [3H]Ry binding moderately with strong SERCA1a inhibition, whereas pyrrole (24), 2,3,4-tribromopyrrole (26), and ethyl-4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate (27) were inactive. Of three PBDE derivatives of marine origin active in the [3H]Ry assay, 4'-hydroxy-2,3',4,5',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether (18) was also a highly potent SERCA1a inhibitor. Molecular targets of marine organohalogens that are also DBPs of emerging environmental concern are likely to contribute to their toxicity.	1
Abstract2class: Genome mining expands the chemical diversity of the cyanobactin family to include highly modified linear peptides Abstract: Ribosomal peptides are produced through the posttranslational modification of short precursor peptides. Cyanobactins are a growing family of cyclic ribosomal peptides produced by cyanobacteria. However, a broad systematic survey of the genetic capacity to produce cyanobactins is lacking. Here we report the identification of 31 cyanobactin gene clusters from 126 genomes of cyanobacteria. Genome mining suggested a complex evolutionary history defined by horizontal gene transfer and rapid diversification of precursor genes. Extensive chemical analyses demonstrated that some cyanobacteria produce short linear cyanobactins with a chain length ranging from three to five amino acids. The linear peptides were N-prenylated and O-methylated on the N and C termini, respectively, and named aeruginosamide and viridisamide. These findings broaden the structural diversity of the cyanobactin family to include highly modified linear peptides with rare posttranslational modifications.	1
Abstract2class: Role of hydrophilic residues in proton transfer during catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase II Abstract: Catalysis by the zinc metalloenzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) is limited in maximal velocity by proton transfer between His64 and the zinc-bound solvent molecule. Asn62 extends into the active site cavity of HCA II adjacent to His64 and has been shown to be one of several hydrophilic residues participating in a hydrogen-bonded solvent network within the active site. We compared several site-specific mutants of HCA II with replacements at position 62 (Ala, Val, Leu, Thr, and Asp). The efficiency of catalysis in the hydration of CO 2 for the resulting mutants has been characterized by (18)O exchange, and the structures of the mutants have been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.5-1.7 A resolution. Each of these mutants maintained the ordered water structure observed by X-ray crystallography in the active site cavity of wild-type HCA II; hence, this water structure was not a variable in comparing with wild type the activities of mutants at residue 62. Crystal structures of wild-type and N62T HCA II showed both an inward and outward orientation of the side chain of His64; however, other mutants in this study showed predominantly inward (N62A, N62V, N62L) or predominantly outward (N62D) orientations of His64. A significant role of Asn62 in HCA II is to permit two conformations of the side chain of His64, the inward and outward, that contributes to maximal efficiency of proton transfer between the active site and solution. The site-specific mutant N62D had a mainly outward orientation of His64, yet the difference in p K a between the proton donor His64 and zinc-bound hydroxide was near zero, as in wild-type HCA II. The rate of proton transfer in catalysis by N62D HCA II was 5% that of wild type, showing that His64 mainly in the outward orientation is associated with inefficient proton transfer compared with His64 in wild type which shows both inward and outward orientations. These results emphasize the roles of the residues of the hydrophilic side of the active site cavity in maintaining efficient catalysis by carbonic anhydrase.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of t-Butyl in Apratoxin A: Functional Analysis and Architecture of a PKS Loading Module Abstract: The unusual feature of a t-butyl group is found in several marine-derived natural products including apratoxin A, a Sec61 inhibitor produced by the cyanobacterium Moorea bouillonii PNG 5-198. Here, we determine that the apratoxin A t-butyl group is formed as a pivaloyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) by AprA, the polyketide synthase (PKS) loading module of the apratoxin A biosynthetic pathway. AprA contains an inactive "pseudo" GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain (ΨGNAT) flanked by two methyltransferase domains (MT1 and MT2) that differ distinctly in sequence. Structural, biochemical, and precursor incorporation studies reveal that MT2 catalyzes unusually coupled decarboxylation and methylation reactions to transform dimethylmalonyl-ACP, the product of MT1, to pivaloyl-ACP. Further, pivaloyl-ACP synthesis is primed by the fatty acid synthase malonyl acyltransferase (FabD), which compensates for the ΨGNAT and provides the initial acyl-transfer step to form AprA malonyl-ACP. Additionally, images of AprA from negative stain electron microscopy reveal multiple conformations that may facilitate the individual catalytic steps of the multienzyme module.	1
Abstract2class: The gastric caeca of pentatomids as a house for actinomycetes Abstract: Background:                       Microbes are extensively associated with insects, playing key roles in insect defense, nutrition and reproduction. Most of the associations reported involve Proteobacteria. Despite the fact that Actinobacteria associated with insects were shown to produce antibiotic barriers against pathogens to the hosts or to their food and nutrients, there are few studies focusing on their association with insects. Thus, we surveyed the Actinobacteria diversity on a specific region of the midgut of seven species of stinkbugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) known to carry a diversity of symbiotically-associated Proteobacteria.                  Results:                       A total of 34 phylotypes were placed in 11 different Actinobacteria families. Dichelops melacanthus held the highest diversity with six actinobacteria families represented by nine phylotypes. Thyanta perditor (n = 7), Edessa meditabunda (n = 5), Loxa deducta (n = 4) and Pellaea stictica (n = 3) were all associated with three families. Piezodorus guildini (n = 3) and Nezara viridula (n = 3) had the lowest diversity, being associated with two (Propionibacteriaceae and Mycobacteriaceae) and one (Streptomyceataceae) families, respectively. Corynebacteriaceae and Mycobacteriaceae were the most common families with phylotypes from three different insect species each one.                  Conclusions:                       Many phylotypes shared a low 16S rRNA gene similarity with their closest type strains and formed new phyletic lines on the periphery of several genera. This is a strong indicative that stinkbug caeca can harbor new species of actinobacteria, which might be derived from specific associations with the species of stinkbugs studied. Although the well-known role of actinobacteria as a source of biomolecules, the ecological features of these symbionts on the stinkbugs biology remain unknown.	0
Abstract2class: Exploring the mechanism of lipid transfer during biosynthesis of the acidic lipopeptide antibiotic CDA Abstract: The non-ribosomally synthesized lipodepsipeptide CDA belongs to the group of acidic lipopeptide antibiotics, whose members feature a fatty acid side chain that strongly affects their antimicrobial activity. This study elucidates the N-acylation of the N-terminal serine in the CDA peptide chain. This reaction is referred to as lipoinitiation and is shown to be catalyzed by the dissected starter C domain found at the N-terminus of Cda-PSI. The recombinantly produced C domain specifically interacts with 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl-S-ACP and catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acid moiety onto the amino group of PCP-bound serine with high selectivity for both carrier protein bound substrates at the donor and acceptor site.	1
Abstract2class: Crochelins: Siderophores with an Unprecedented Iron-Chelating Moiety from the Nitrogen-Fixing Bacterium Azotobacter chroococcum Abstract: Microbes use siderophores to access essential iron resources in the environment. Over 500 siderophores are known, but they utilize a small set of common moieties to bind iron. Azotobacter chroococcum expresses iron-rich nitrogenases, with which it reduces N2 . Though an important agricultural inoculant, the structures of its iron-binding molecules remain unknown. Here, the "chelome" of A. chroococcum is examined using small molecule discovery and bioinformatics. The bacterium produces vibrioferrin and amphibactins as well as a novel family of siderophores, the crochelins. Detailed characterization shows that the most abundant member, crochelin A, binds iron in a hexadentate fashion using a new iron-chelating γ-amino acid. Insights into the biosynthesis of crochelins and the mechanism by which iron may be removed upon import of the holo-siderophore are presented. This work expands the repertoire of iron-chelating moieties in microbial siderophores.	1
Abstract2class: Manipulation of regulatory genes reveals complexity and fidelity in hormaomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Hormaomycin (HRM) is a structurally remarkable peptide produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384 that acts as a Streptomyces signaling metabolite and exhibits potent antibiotic activity against coryneform actinomycetes. HRM biosynthetic studies have been hampered by inconsistent and low production. To enhance fermentation titers, the role of its cluster-encoded regulatory genes was investigated. Extra copies of the putative regulators hrmA and hrmB were introduced into the wild-type strain, resulting in an increase of HRM production and its analogs up to 135-fold. For the HrmB overproducer, six bioactive analogs were isolated and characterized. This study demonstrates that HrmA and HrmB are positive regulators in HRM biosynthesis. A third gene, hrmH, was identified as encoding a protein capable of shifting the metabolic profile of HRM and its derivatives. Its manipulation resulted in the generation of an additional HRM analog.	1
Abstract2class: Mutational analyses of HAMP helices suggest a dynamic bundle model of input-output signalling in chemoreceptors Abstract: To test the gearbox model of HAMP signalling in the Escherichia coli serine receptor, Tsr, we generated a series of amino acid replacements at each residue of the AS1 and AS2 helices. The residues most critical for Tsr function defined hydrophobic packing faces consistent with a four-helix bundle. Suppression patterns of helix lesions conformed to the predicted packing layers in the bundle. Although the properties and patterns of most AS1 and AS2 lesions were consistent with both proposed gearbox structures, some mutational features specifically indicate the functional importance of an x-da bundle over an alternative a-d bundle. These genetic data suggest that HAMP signalling could simply involve changes in the stability of its x-da bundle. We propose that Tsr HAMP controls output signals by modulating destabilizing phase clashes between the AS2 helices and the adjoining kinase control helices. Our model further proposes that chemoeffectors regulate HAMP bundle stability through a control cable connection between the transmembrane segments and AS1 helices. Attractant stimuli, which cause inward piston displacements in chemoreceptors, should reduce cable tension, thereby stabilizing the HAMP bundle. This study shows how transmembrane signalling and HAMP input-output control could occur without the helix rotations central to the gearbox model.	0
Abstract2class: Pore-forming activity is not sufficient for Legionella pneumophila phagosome trafficking and intracellular growth Abstract: Bacterial pathogens often subvert eukaryotic cellular processes in order to establish a replicative niche and evade host immunity. Inhibition of phagosome lysosome fusion is a strategy used by several intracellular bacteria that grow within mammalian cells. It was shown recently that Legionella pneumophila possesses a cytolytic activity that results from the insertion of pores in the macrophage membrane upon contact, and that this activity requires the dot/icm gene products, which are necessary for intracellular growth and phagosome trafficking. Other bacteria that inhibit phagosome lysosome fusion, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, demonstrate similar cytolytic activities, which suggests that formation of pores in the phagosome membrane may account for the defects observed in phagosome trafficking. In this study, we identify a new class of L. pneumophila mutant that retains the pore-forming activity found in virulent bacteria, but is defective in phagosome lysosome fusion inhibition and intracellular growth. These data indicate that cytolytic activity is not sufficient for L. pneumophila-induced alterations in phagosome trafficking. Rather, the pore may be a vehicle that facilitates delivery of bacterial-derived effector molecules to the host cell cytoplasm.	0
Abstract2class: Rubesanolides A and B: diterpenoids from Isodon rubescens Abstract: From the medicinal plant Isodon rubescens, we isolated two novel diterpenes, rubesanolides A (1) and B (2). The compounds contain a unique β-lactone subgroup. This is the first discovery for a natural diterpene having rings A, B, and C in chair, boat, and twist-chair conformations, respectively. The structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was determined by X-ray diffraction.	0
Abstract2class: A novel method to produce armored double-stranded DNA by encapsulation of MS2 viral capsids Abstract: With the rapid development of molecular diagnostic techniques, there is a growing need for quality controls and standards with favorable properties to monitor the entire detection process. In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the tunicamycin antibiotics proceeds via unique exo-glycal intermediates Abstract: The tunicamycins are archetypal nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis and eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Understanding the biosynthesis of their unusual carbon framework may lead to variants with improved selectivity. Here, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of key sugar-manipulating enzymes from this pathway. TunA is found to exhibit unusual regioselectivity in the reduction of a key α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product of this reaction is shown to be the preferred substrate for TunF--an epimerase that converts the glucose derivative to a galactose. In Streptomyces strains in which another gene (tunB) is deleted, the biosynthesis is shown to stall at this exo-glycal product. These investigations confirm the combined TunA/F activity and delineate the ordering of events in the metabolic pathway. This is the first time these surprising exo-glycal intermediates have been seen in biology. They suggest that construction of the aminodialdose core of tunicamycin exploits their enol ether motif in a mode of C-C bond formation not previously observed in nature, to create an 11-carbon chain.	1
Abstract2class: Penicillium roqueforti PR toxin gene cluster characterization Abstract: PR toxin is a well-known isoprenoid mycotoxin almost solely produced by Penicillium roqueforti after growth on food or animal feed. This mycotoxin has been described as the most toxic produced by this species. In this study, an in silico analysis allowed identifying for the first time a 22.4-kb biosynthetic gene cluster involved in PR toxin biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. The pathway contains 11 open reading frames encoding for ten putative proteins including the major fungal terpene cyclase, aristolochene synthase, involved in the first farnesyl-diphosphate cyclization step as well as an oxidoreductase, an oxidase, two P450 monooxygenases, a transferase, and two dehydrogenase enzymes. Gene silencing was used to study three genes (ORF5, ORF6, and ORF8 encoding for an acetyltransferase and two P450 monooxygenases, respectively) and resulted in 20 to 40% PR toxin production reductions in all transformants proving the involvement of these genes and the corresponding enzyme activities in PR toxin biosynthesis. According to the considered silenced gene target, eremofortin A and B productions were also affected suggesting their involvement as biosynthetic intermediates in this pathway. A PR toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on the most recent and available data.	1
Abstract2class: Bifunctional Small-Molecule Ligands of K-Ras Induce Its Association with Immunophilin Proteins Abstract: Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of bifunctional chemical ligands that induce the association of Ras with ubiquitously expressed immunophilin proteins such as FKBP12 and cyclophilin A. We show this approach is applicable to two distinct Ras ligand scaffolds, and that both the identity of the immunophilin ligand and the linker chemistry affect compound efficacy in biochemical and cellular contexts. These ligands bind to Ras in an immunophilin-dependent fashion and mediate the formation of tripartite complexes of Ras, immunophilin, and the ligand. The recruitment of cyclophilin A to GTP-bound Ras blocks its interaction with B-Raf in biochemical assays. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of ligand-induced association of Ras with intracellular proteins and suggests it as a promising therapeutic strategy for Ras-driven cancers.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the pyridomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces pyridomyceticus NRRL B-2517 Abstract: Pyridomycin is a structurally unique antimycobacterial cyclodepsipeptide containing rare 3-(3-pyridyl)-l-alanine and 2-hydroxy-3-methylpent-2-enoic acid moieties. The biosynthetic gene cluster for pyridomycin has been cloned and identified from Streptomyces pyridomyceticus NRRL B-2517. Sequence analysis of a 42.5-kb DNA region revealed 26 putative open reading frames, including two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and a polyketide synthase gene. A special feature is the presence of a polyketide synthase-type ketoreductase domain embedded in an NRPS. Furthermore, we showed that PyrA functioned as an NRPS adenylation domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and transfers it to a discrete peptidyl carrier protein, PyrU, which functions as a loading module that initiates pyridomycin biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro. PyrA could also activate other aromatic acids, generating three pyridomycin analogues in vivo.	1
Abstract2class: Histone tails: ideal motifs for probing epigenetics through chemical biology approaches Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone proteins have emerged as a central theme in the regulation of gene expression and other chromatin-associated processes. The discovery that certain protein domains can recognize acetylated and methylated lysine residues of histones has spurred efforts to uncover and characterize histone PTM-binding proteins. In this task, chromatin biology has strongly benefited from synthetic approaches stemming from chemical biology. Peptide-based techniques have been instrumental in identifying histone mark-binding proteins and analyzing their binding specificities. To explore how histone PTMs carry out their function in the context of chromatin, reconstituted systems based on recombinant histones carrying defined modifications are increasingly being used. They constitute promising tools to analyze mechanistic aspects of histone PTMs, including their role in transcription and their transmission in replication. In this review, we present strategies that have been used successfully to investigate the role of histone modifications, concepts that have emerged from their application, and their potential to contribute to current developments in the field.	0
Abstract2class: Specific modulation of protein activity by using a bioorthogonal reaction Abstract: Unnatural amino acids with bioorthogonal reactive groups have the potential to provide a rapid and specific mechanism for covalently inhibiting a protein of interest. Here, we use mutagenesis to insert an unnatural amino acid containing an azide group (Z) into the target protein at positions such that a "click" reaction with an alkyne modulator (X) will alter the function of the protein. This bioorthogonally reactive pair can engender specificity of X for the Z-containing protein, even if the target is otherwise identical to another protein, allowing for rapid target validation in living cells. We demonstrate our method using inhibition of the Escherichia coli enzyme aminoacyl transferase by both active-site occlusion and allosteric mechanisms. We have termed this a "clickable magic bullet" strategy, and it should be generally applicable to studying the effects of protein inhibition, within the limits of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery, Biosynthesis, and Heterologous Production of Loonamycin, a Potent Anticancer Indolocarbazole Alkaloid Abstract: Genome mining of an indolocarbazole-type gene cluster from a marine-derived Nocardiopsis flavescens NA01583 strain led to the discovery of three new indolocarbazole alkaloids (1-3). Heterologous expression of the intact loo gene cluster in a surrogate host Streptomyces lividans K4-114 led to the successful production of 3. Notably, compound 1 showed potent cytotoxic activities toward eight cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 41 to 283 nM.	1
Abstract2class: Deletions in Klebsiella pneumoniae R plasmids induced by growth in the presence of acridine orange at high temperature Abstract: The generation in vivo of plasmids deleted at specific sites in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae containing R plasmids, by treatment with high concentrations of acridine orange (1.2 mg/ml) at 42 degrees C are reported. These deletions seem to be site specific because loss of specific restriction fragments after digestion with restriction enzymes was demonstrated.	0
Abstract2class: Structural and functional analysis of the gene cluster encoding the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of Lactobacillus sake Abstract: Lactobacillus sake can use arginine via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. We designed degenerate primers based on an alignment of known sequences of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)-encoding genes in order to amplify the L. sake counterpart sequences by PCR. Screening a genomic library of L. sake in lambdaEMBL3 allowed us to isolate a clone containing a 10-kb L. sake genomic DNA insert. Sequence analysis revealed that the genes involved in arginine catabolism were clustered and encoded ADI (arcA), OTC (arcB), carbamate kinase (arcC), and a putative carrier with high similarity to the arginine/ornithine antiporter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (arcD). Additionally, a putative transaminase-encoding gene (arcT) was located in this region. The genes followed the order arcA arcB arcC arcT arcD, which differs from that found in other microorganisms. arcA, arcB, arcC, and arcD mutants were constructed, and the ADI pathway was impaired in all of them. Transcriptional studies indicated that arcA gene is subject to catabolite repression, and under the conditions used, several transcripts could be detected, suggesting the existence of different initiation sites or processing of a larger mRNA.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic and functional characterization of the gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of putisolvin I and II in Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 secretes two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess a surface-tension-reducing ability, and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down biofilms of Pseudomonas species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The putisolvin synthetase gene cluster (pso) and its surrounding region were isolated, sequenced and characterized. Three genes, termed psoA, psoB and psoC, were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin biosynthesis. The gene products encode the 12 modules responsible for the binding of the 12 amino acids of the putisolvin peptide moiety. Sequence data indicate that the adenylation domain of the 11th module prioritizes the recognition of Val instead of Leu or Ile and consequently favours putisolvin I production over putisolvin II. Detailed analysis of the thiolation domains suggests that the first nine modules recognize the d form of the amino acid residues while the two following modules recognize the l form and the last module the l or d form, indifferently. The psoR gene, which is located upstream of psoA, shows high similarity to luxR-type regulatory genes and is required for the expression of the pso cluster. In addition, two genes, macA and macB, located downstream of psoC were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin production or export.	1
Abstract2class: Direct and simultaneous observation of ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium Abstract: Understanding excited carrier dynamics in semiconductors is crucial for the development of photovoltaics and efficient photonic devices. However, overlapping spectral features in optical pump-probe spectroscopy often render assignments of separate electron and hole carrier dynamics ambiguous. Here, ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium nanocrystalline thin films are directly and simultaneously observed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet at the germanium M4,5 edge. We decompose the spectra into contributions of electronic state blocking and photo-induced band shifts at a carrier density of 8 × 1020 cm-3. Separate electron and hole relaxation times are observed as a function of hot carrier energies. A first-order electron and hole decay of ∼1 ps suggests a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination mechanism. The simultaneous observation of electrons and holes with extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy paves the way for investigating few- to sub-femtosecond dynamics of both holes and electrons in complex semiconductor materials and across junctions.	0
Abstract2class: Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family Abstract: The Mas-related genes (Mrgs) comprise a family of >50 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), many of which are expressed in specific subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons in mice. In contrast, humans contain a related but nonorthologous family of genes, called MrgXs or sensory neuron-specific receptors, of which many fewer appear to be expressed in sensory neurons. To determine whether the diversity of murine Mrgs is generic to rodents or is an atypical feature of mice, we characterized MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD subfamilies in rat and gerbil. Surprisingly, although mice have approximately 22 MrgA and approximately 14 MrgC genes, rats and gerbils have just a single MrgA and MrgC gene. This murine-specific expansion likely reflects recent retrotransposon-mediated unequal crossover events. The expression of Mrgs in rat sensory ganglia suggests that the extensive cellular diversity in mice can be simplified to a core subset of approximately four different genes (MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD), defining a similar number of neuronal subpopulations. Our results suggest more generally that mouse-human genomic comparisons may sometimes reveal differences atypical of rodents.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of fragin is controlled by a novel quorum sensing signal Abstract: Members of the diazeniumdiolate class of natural compounds show potential for drug development because of their antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activities. Yet, their biosynthesis has remained elusive to date. Here, we identify a gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of the diazeniumdiolate compound fragin in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111. We provide evidence that fragin is a metallophore and that metal chelation is the molecular basis of its antifungal activity. A subset of the fragin biosynthetic genes is involved in the synthesis of a previously undescribed cell-to-cell signal molecule, valdiazen. RNA-Seq analyses reveal that valdiazen controls fragin biosynthesis and affects the expression of more than 100 genes. Homologs of the valdiazen biosynthesis genes are found in various bacteria, suggesting that valdiazen-like compounds may constitute a new class of signal molecules. We use structural information, in silico prediction of enzymatic functions and biochemical data to propose a biosynthesis route for fragin and valdiazen.	1
Abstract2class: Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: friends or foes? Abstract: Chemical and physiological functions of molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and existing equilibrium between pools of pro-oxidants and anti-oxidants providing steady state ROS level vital for normal mitochondrial and cell functioning are reviewed. The presence of intracellular oxygen and ROS sensors is postulated and few candidates for this role are suggested. Possible involvement of ROS in the process of fragmentation of mitochondrial reticulum made of long mitochondrial filaments serving in the cell as "electric cables", as well as the role of ROS in apoptosis and programmed mitochondrial destruction (mitoptosis) are reviewed. The critical role of ROS in destructive processes under ischemia/reoxygenation and ischemic preconditioning is discussed. Mitochondrial permeability transition gets special consideration as a possible component of the apoptotic cascade, resulting in excessive "ROS-induced ROS release".	0
Abstract2class: Glutamic acid promotes monacolin K production and monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster expression in Monascus Abstract: This study investigated the effects of glutamic acid on production of monacolin K and expression of the monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster. When Monascus M1 was grown in glutamic medium instead of in the original medium, monacolin K production increased from 48.4 to 215.4 mg l-1, monacolin K production increased by 3.5 times. Glutamic acid enhanced monacolin K production by upregulating the expression of mokB-mokI; on day 8, the expression level of mokA tended to decrease by Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction. Our findings demonstrated that mokA was not a key gene responsible for the quantity of monacolin K production in the presence of glutamic acid. Observation of Monascus mycelium morphology using Scanning Electron Microscope showed glutamic acid significantly increased the content of Monascus mycelium, altered the permeability of Monascus mycelium, enhanced secretion of monacolin K from the cell, and reduced the monacolin K content in Monascus mycelium, thereby enhancing monacolin K production.	1

SE 50/110 is a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate 2-epimerase Abstract: The C7-cyclitol 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is the first precursor of the cyclitol moiety of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose in Actinoplanes sp. SE50. The 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone becomes phosphorylated at C7 by the ATP dependent kinase AcbM prior to the next modifications. Preliminary data gave evidences that the AcbO protein could catalyse the first modification step of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. Therefore, the AcbO protein, the encoding gene of which is also part of the acbKMLNOC operon, was overproduced and purified. Indeed the purified protein catalysed the 2-epimerisation of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. The chemical structure of the purified reaction product was proven by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be 5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate.	1
Abstract2class: Draft genome sequence of Brevibacillus brevis strain X23, a biocontrol agent against bacterial wilt Abstract: Brevibacillus brevis X23 is an appropriate biocontrol agent against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. We report herein the draft genome sequence (6,566,879 bp) and a circular plasmid (6,600 bp) of B. brevis X23, data which may be helpful for mining the antagonistic activity against R. solanacearum.	1
Abstract2class: 4-Hydroxy Pyridones from Heterologous Expression and Cultivation of the Native Host Abstract: 4-Hydroxy pyridones are a class of fungi-derived polyketide-nonribosomal peptide products featuring a core of 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone which have a wide range of biological activities. Genome mining of in-house strains using polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase as a query identified an endophyte Tolypocladium sp. 49Y, which possesses a potential 4-hydroxy pyridone biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1 revealed that this gene cluster is functional and able to produce a rare type of 4-hydroxy pyridones called tolypyridones (compounds 3 and 4). Tolypocladium sp. 49Y was grown in a variety of media which led to the isolation of six 4-hydroxy pyridones (5-10) and one pyrrolidone (11) from a rice culture, and compounds 3 and 9 showed antifungal activity. These latter compounds are different from those obtained by heterologous expression. This study shows that both heterologous expression and cultivation of the native host are complementary approaches to discover new natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Oryzines A & B, Maleidride Congeners from Aspergillus oryzae and Their Putative Biosynthesis Abstract: Aspergillus oryzae is traditionally used in East Asia for the production of food and brewing. In addition, it has been developed into a suitable host for the heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic genes and gene clusters, enabling the functional analysis of the encoded enzymes. A. oryzae shares a 99.5% genome homology with Aspergillus flavus, but their secondary metabolomes differ significantly and various compounds unique to A. oryzae have been reported. While using A. oryzae as a host for heterologous expression experiments we discovered two new metabolites in extracts of A. oryzae M-2-3 with an unusual maleidride backbone, which were named oryzine A and B. Their structures were elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Their structural relationships with known maleidrides implied involvement of a citrate synthase (CS) and a polyketide (PKS) or fatty acid synthase (FAS) in their biosynthesis. Analysis of the A. oryzae genome revealed a single putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) consistent with the hypothetical biosynthesis of the oryzines. These findings increase knowledge of the chemical potential of A. oryzae and are the first attempt to link a novel product of this fungus with genomic data.	1
Abstract2class: Insights from the first putative biosynthetic gene cluster for a lichen depside and depsidone Abstract: The genes for polyketide synthases (PKSs), enzymes that assemble the carbon backbones of many secondary metabolites, often cluster with other secondary pathway genes. We describe here the first lichen PKS cluster likely to be implicated in the biosynthesis of a depside and a depsidone, compounds in a class almost exclusively produced by lichen fungi (mycobionts). With degenerate PCR with primers biased toward presumed PKS genes for depsides and depsidones we identified among the many PKS genes in Cladonia grayi four (CgrPKS13-16) potentially responsible for grayanic acid (GRA), the orcinol depsidone characteristic of this lichen. To single out a likely GRA PKS we compared mRNA and GRA induction in mycobiont cultures using the four candidate PKS genes plus three controls; only CgrPKS16 expression closely matched GRA induction. CgrPKS16 protein domains were compatible with orcinol depside biosynthesis. Phylogenetically CgrPKS16 fell in a new subclade of fungal PKSs uniquely producing orcinol compounds. In the C. grayi genome CgrPKS16 clustered with a CytP450 and an o-methyltransferase gene, appropriately matching the three compounds in the GRA pathway. Induction, domain organization, phylogeny and cluster pathway correspondence independently indicated that the CgrPKS16 cluster is most likely responsible for GRA biosynthesis. Specifically we propose that (i) a single PKS synthesizes two aromatic rings and links them into a depside, (ii) the depside to depsidone transition requires only a cytochrome P450 and (iii) lichen compounds evolved early in the radiation of filamentous fungi.	1
Abstract2class: The length of the bound fatty acid influences the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein and the stability of the thioester bond Abstract: Acyl carrier proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis have been shown to exhibit a high degree of conformational flexibility, in that they are able to sequester fatty acid intermediates between 4 and 18 carbons in length. This flexibility has been observed in X-ray and NMR structures of acyl carrier proteins attached to different fatty acids. NMR studies comparing decanoyl-ACP and stearoyl-ACP indicated that ACP exhibits more dynamic motions when bound to longer fatty acids. We have used complementary chemical and NMR methods as an approach to improving our understanding of the effect of fatty acid length on the dynamics of acyl carrier protein. A chemical assay of the accessibility of the acyl thioester to solvent revealed a positive correlation between chain length and rate of hydrolysis. Surprisingly, this linear correlation was biphasic, with accelerated hydrolysis observed for fatty acids longer than 15 carbons. To further understand the motions associated with this acceleration, we collected (15)N relaxation dispersion data for 14:0-, 15:0-, and 16:0-ACP. The greatest dispersions were exhibited by residues that form the entrance to the fatty acid binding pocket. In addition, these dispersions were observed to increase with the length of the fatty acid. Because the exchange rates derived from fitting the data to a two-state model varied from residue to residue, a more complex motional model appears to be required to adequately explain the dynamics. Thus, acyl-ACP offers an interesting system for future investigations of complex protein motions on the micro- and millisecond time scales.	0
Abstract2class: Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins Abstract: In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.	0
Abstract2class: Synchronous intramolecular cycloadditions of the polyene macrolactam polyketide heronamide C Abstract: A growing number of natural products appear to arise from biosynthetic pathways that involve pericyclic reactions. We show here that for the heronamides this can occur via two spontaneous pathways involving alternative thermal or photochemical intramolecular cycloadditions.	1
Abstract2class: New technology and resources for cryptococcal research Abstract: Rapid advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have enabled the generation of new technology and resources for cryptococcal research. RNAi-mediated specific gene knock down has become routine and more efficient by utilizing modified shRNA plasmids and convergent promoter RNAi constructs. This system was recently applied in a high-throughput screen to identify genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Gene deletion efficiencies have also been improved by increasing rates of homologous recombination through a number of approaches, including a combination of double-joint PCR with split-marker transformation, the use of dominant selectable markers and the introduction of Cre-Loxp systems into Cryptococcus. Moreover, visualization of cryptococcal proteins has become more facile using fusions with codon-optimized fluorescent tags, such as green or red fluorescent proteins or, mCherry. Using recent genome-wide analytical tools, new transcriptional factors and regulatory proteins have been identified in novel virulence-related signaling pathways by employing microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis.	0
Abstract2class: Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of genes flanking the polyketide synthase Abstract: Analysis of the gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus that governs the biosynthesis of the polyketide immuno-suppressant rapamycin (Rp) has revealed that it contains three exceptionally large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the modular polyketide synthase (PKS). Between two of these lies a fourth gene (rapP) encoding a pipecolate-incorporating enzyme that probably also catalyzes closure of the macrolide ring. On either side of these very large genes are ranged a total of 22 further ORFs before the limits of the cluster are reached, as judged by the identification of genes clearly encoding unrelated activities. Several of these ORFs appear to encode enzymes that would be required for Rp biosynthesis. These include two cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P450s), designated RapJ and RapN, an associated ferredoxin (Fd) RapO, and three potential SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases (MTases), RapI, RapM and RapQ. All of these are likely to be involved in 'late' modification of the macrocycle. The cluster also contains a novel gene (rapL) whose product is proposed to catalyze the formation of the Rp precursor, L-pipecolate, through the cyclodeamination of L-lysine. Adjacent genes have putative roles in Rp regulation and export. The codon usage of the PKS biosynthetic genes is markedly different from that of the flanking genes of the cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Dictyostelium transposable element DIRS-1 has 350-base-pair inverted terminal repeats that contain a heat shock promoter Abstract: DIRS-1 is a 4.7-kilobase-pair repetitive and apparently transposable Dictyostelium genetic element that is transcribed during differentiation or after heat shock. The terminal regions of DIRS-1 are inverted repeats of 330 base pairs. The repeats are highly conserved both within a given element as well as between different members of the family (less than 10% divergence). At the distal end of all left repeats is a 32-nucleotide sequence composed almost entirely of A and T residues. In addition to this 32-base A + T sequence, the distal region of all right repeats is extended by a 28-base-pair A + T-rich sequence that is identical in all copies. The sequences flanking each DIRS-1 sequence are completely dissimilar, and there appears to be no duplication of the genomic DNA sequence at the presumed point of DIRS-1 insertion. The terminal repeats can also be found interspersed in the genome independently of the complete element. In addition, the terminal repeats carry a 15-nucleotide sequence that greatly resembles the Drosophila consensus heat shock promoter and may be involved in the transcriptional induction of the DIRS-1 sequences.	0
Abstract2class: Dss1 regulates interaction of Brh2 with DNA Abstract: Brh2, the BRCA2 homologue in Ustilago maydis, plays a crucial role in homologous recombination by controlling Rad51. In turn, Brh2 is governed by Dss1, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms a tight complex with the C-terminal region of Brh2. This region of the protein associating with Dss1 is highly conserved in sequence and by comparison with mammalian BRCA2 corresponds to a part of the DNA binding domain with characteristic OB folds. The N-terminal region of Brh2 harbors a less-defined but powerful DNA binding site, the activity of which is revealed upon deletion of the C-terminal region. Full-length Brh2 complexed with Dss1 binds DNA slowly, while the N-terminal fragment binds quickly. The DNA binding activity of full-length Brh2 appears to correlate with dissociation of Dss1. Addition of Dss1 to the heterotypic Brh2-Dss1 complex attenuates DNA binding activity, but not by direct competition for the N-terminal DNA binding site. Conversely, the Brh2-Dss1 complex dissociates more quickly when DNA is present. These findings suggest a model in which binding of Brh2 to DNA is subject to allosteric regulation by Dss1.	0
Abstract2class: Plasmid- and chromosome-mediated dissimilation of naphthalene and salicylate in Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 dissimilates naphthalene (Nah), salicylate (Sal), and benzoate (Ben) via catechol which is metabolized through the meta (or alpha-keto acid) pathway. The ability to utilize salicylate but not naphthalene was transferred from P. putida PMD-1 to several Pseudomonas species. Agarose gel electrophoresis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from PMD-1 and Sal+ exconjugants indicated that a plasmid (pMWD-1) of 110 megadaltons is correlated with the Sal+ phenotype; restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from Sal+ exconjugants indicated that plasmid pMWD-1 was transmitted intact. Enzyme analysis of Sal+ exconjugants demonstrated that the enzymes required to oxidize naphthalene to salicylate are absent, but salicylate hydroxylase and enzymes of the meta pathway are present. Thus, naphthalene conversion to salicylate requires chromosomal genes, whereas salicylate degradation is plasmid encoded. Comparison of restriction digests of plasmid pMWD-1 indicated that it differs considerably from the naphthalene and salicylate degradative plasmids previously described in P. putida.	0

Abstract2class: Dominant oceanic bacteria secure phosphate using a large extracellular buffer Abstract: The ubiquitous SAR11 and Prochlorococcus bacteria manage to maintain a sufficient supply of phosphate in phosphate-poor surface waters of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Furthermore, it seems that their phosphate uptake may counter-intuitively be lower in more productive tropical waters, as if their cellular demand for phosphate decreases there. By flow sorting (33)P-phosphate-pulsed (32)P-phosphate-chased cells, we demonstrate that both Prochlorococcus and SAR11 cells exploit an extracellular buffer of labile phosphate up to 5-40 times larger than the amount of phosphate required to replicate their chromosomes. Mathematical modelling is shown to support this conclusion. The fuller the buffer the slower the cellular uptake of phosphate, to the point that in phosphate-replete tropical waters, cells can saturate their buffer and their phosphate uptake becomes marginal. Hence, buffer stocking is a generic, growth-securing adaptation for SAR11 and Prochlorococcus bacteria, which lack internal reserves to reduce their dependency on bioavailable ambient phosphate.	0
Abstract2class: Reductive ligation mediated one-step disulfide formation of S-nitrosothiols Abstract: A one-step reductive ligation mediated disulfide formation of S-nitrosothiols was developed. This reaction involves the reaction of the S-nitroso group with phosphine-thioesters to form sulfenamide and thiolate intermediates, which then undergo a fast intermolecular disulfide formation to form stable conjugates. This reaction can be used to design new biosensors of S-nitrosated proteins.	0
Abstract2class: Base modification strategies to modulate immune stimulation by an siRNA Abstract: Immune stimulation triggered by siRNAs is one of the major challenges in the development of safe RNAi-based therapeutics. Within an immunostimulatory siRNA sequence, this hurdle is commonly addressed by using ribose modifications (e.g., 2'-OMe or 2'-F), which results in decreased cytokine production. However, as immune stimulation by siRNAs is a sequence-dependent phenomenon, recognition of the nucleobases by the trigger receptor(s) is also likely. Here, we use the recently published crystal structures of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) bound to small-molecule agonists to generate computational models for ribonucleotide binding by this immune receptor. Our modeling suggested that modification of either the Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen face of adenosine would disrupt nucleotide/TLR8 interactions. We employed chemical synthesis to alter either the Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen face of adenosine and evaluated the effect of these modifications in an siRNA guide strand by measuring the immunostimulatory and RNA interference properties. For the siRNA guide strand tested, we found that modifying the Watson-Crick face is generally more effective at blocking TNFα production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than modification at the Hoogsteen edge. We also observed that modifications near the 5'-end were more effective at blocking cytokine production than those placed at the 3'-end. This work advances our understanding of how chemical modifications can be used to optimize siRNA performance.	0
Abstract2class: Environmental influences on competitive hydrogen peroxide production in Streptococcus gordonii Abstract: Streptococcus gordonii is an important member of the oral biofilm. One of its phenotypic traits is the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is an antimicrobial component produced by S. gordonii that is able to antagonize the growth of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Strategies that modulate H2O2 production in the oral cavity may be useful as a simple therapeutic mechanism to improve oral health, but little is known about the regulation of H2O2 production. The enzyme responsible for H2O2 production is pyruvate oxidase, encoded by spxB. The functional studies of spxB expression and SpxB abundance presented in this report demonstrate a strong dependence on environmental oxygen tension and carbohydrate availability. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) modulates spxB expression carbohydrate dependently. Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) represses spxB expression by direct binding to the spxB promoter, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Promoter mutation studies revealed the requirement of two catabolite-responsive elements (CRE) for CcpA-dependent spxB regulation, as evaluated by spxB expression and phenotypic H2O2 production assays. Thus, molecular mechanisms for the control of S. gordonii spxB expression are presented for the first time, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating H2O2 production for increased competitive fitness.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of pyruvate kinase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a novel antimicrobial drug target Abstract: Novel classes of antimicrobials are needed to address the challenge of multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using the architecture of the MRSA interactome, we identified pyruvate kinase (PK) as a potential novel drug target based upon it being a highly connected, essential hub in the MRSA interactome. Structural modeling, including X-ray crystallography, revealed discrete features of PK in MRSA, which appeared suitable for the selective targeting of the bacterial enzyme. In silico library screening combined with functional enzymatic assays identified an acyl hydrazone-based compound (IS-130) as a potent MRSA PK inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 0.1 μM) with >1,000-fold selectivity over human PK isoforms. Medicinal chemistry around the IS-130 scaffold identified analogs that more potently and selectively inhibited MRSA PK enzymatic activity and S. aureus growth in vitro (MIC of 1 to 5 μg/ml). These novel anti-PK compounds were found to possess antistaphylococcal activity, including both MRSA and multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) strains. These compounds also exhibited exceptional antibacterial activities against other Gram-positive genera, including enterococci and streptococci. PK lead compounds were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors and were bactericidal. In addition, mutants with significant increases in MICs were not isolated after 25 bacterial passages in culture, indicating that resistance may be slow to emerge. These findings validate the principles of network science as a powerful approach to identify novel antibacterial drug targets. They also provide a proof of principle, based upon PK in MRSA, for a research platform aimed at discovering and optimizing selective inhibitors of novel bacterial targets where human orthologs exist, as leads for anti-infective drug development.	0
Abstract2class: Mechanistic insights into a Ca2+-dependent family of alpha-mannosidases in a human gut symbiont Abstract: Colonic bacteria, exemplified by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, play a key role in maintaining human health by harnessing large families of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) to exploit dietary polysaccharides and host glycans as nutrients. Such GH family expansion is exemplified by the 23 family GH92 glycosidases encoded by the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. Here we show that these are alpha-mannosidases that act via a single displacement mechanism to utilize host N-glycans. The three-dimensional structure of two GH92 mannosidases defines a family of two-domain proteins in which the catalytic center is located at the domain interface, providing acid (glutamate) and base (aspartate) assistance to hydrolysis in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The three-dimensional structures of the GH92s in complex with inhibitors provide insight into the specificity, mechanism and conformational itinerary of catalysis. Ca(2+) plays a key catalytic role in helping distort the mannoside away from its ground-state (4)C(1) chair conformation toward the transition state.	0
Abstract2class: Profilin's Affinity for Formin Regulates the Availability of Filament Ends for Actin Monomer Binding Abstract: Nucleation-promoting proteins tightly regulate actin polymerization in cells. Whereas many of these proteins bind actin monomers directly, formins use the actin-binding protein profilin to dynamically load actin monomers onto their flexible Formin Homology 1 (FH1) domains. Following binding, FH1 domains deliver profilin-actin complexes to filament ends. To investigate profilin's role as an adaptor protein in formin-mediated elongation, we engineered a chimeric formin that binds actin monomers directly via covalent attachment of profilin to its binding site in the formin. This formin mediates slow filament elongation owing to a high probability of profilin binding at filament ends. Varying the position at which profilin is tethered to the formin alters the elongation rate by modulating profilin occupancy at the filament end. By regulating the availability of the barbed end, we propose that profilin binding establishes a secondary point of control over the rate of filament elongation mediated by formins. Profilin's differential affinities for actin monomers, barbed ends and polyproline are thus tuned to adaptively bridge actin and formins and optimize the rate of actin polymerization.	0
Abstract2class: A polyketide synthase is required for fungal virulence and production of the polyketide T-toxin Abstract: Race T of the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus is highly virulent toward Texas male sterile (T) maize and differs from its relative, race O, at a locus (Tox1) that is responsible for the production of T-toxin, a family of linear long-chain (C35 to E41) polyketides. In a previous study, the restriction enzyme-mediated integration procedure was used to mutagenize and tag Tox1. Here, we report that the DNA recovered from the insertion site of one mutant encodes a 7.6-kb open reading frame (2530 amino acids) that identifies a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS)-encoding gene (PKS1) with six catalytic domains arranged in the following order, starting at the N terminus: beta-ketoacyl synthase, acyltransferase, dehydratase, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, and acyl carrier protein. PKS1 is interrupted by four apparent introns (74, 57, 49, and 41 bp) and exists in the genome as a single copy surrounded by highly repetitive, A + T-rich DNA. When PKS1 in race T was inactivated by targeted gene disruption, T-toxin production and high virulence were eliminated, indicating that this PKS is required for fungal virulence. Race O strains, which do not produce T-toxin, lack a detectable homolog of PKS1, suggesting that race T may have acquired PKS1 by horizontal transfer of DNA rather than by vertical inheritance from an ancestral strain.	1
Abstract2class: The response regulator PhoP negatively regulates Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis biofilms Abstract: A few Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains form biofilms on the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but numerous others do not. We show that a widely used Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, YPIII, is biofilm positive because of a mutation in phoP, which encodes the response regulator of a two-component system. For two wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis that do not make biofilms on C. elegans, deletion of phoP was sufficient to produce robust biofilms. In Yersinia pestis, a phoP mutant made more extensive biofilms in vitro than did the wild type. Expression of HmsT, a diguanylate cyclase that positively regulates biofilms, is diminished in Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with functional PhoP.	0
Abstract2class: Biochemical and structural insights of the early glycosylation steps in calicheamicin biosynthesis Abstract: The enediyne antibiotic calicheamicin (CLM) gamma(1)(I) is a prominent antitumor agent that is targeted to DNA by a novel aryltetrasaccharide comprised of an aromatic unit and four unusual carbohydrates. Herein we report the heterologous expression and the biochemical characterization of the two "internal" glycosyltransferases CalG3 and CalG2 and the structural elucidation of an enediyne glycosyltransferase (CalG3). In conjunction with the previous characterization of the "external" CLM GTs CalG1 and CalG4, this study completes the functional assignment of all four CLM GTs, extends the utility of enediyne GT-catalyzed reaction reversibility, and presents conclusive evidence of a sequential glycosylation pathway in CLM biosynthesis. This work also reveals the common GT-B structural fold can now be extended to include enediyne GTs.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2-(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase Abstract: The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in Fusarium and Talaromyces spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that the early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involve the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (S)-epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non-heme iron/2-(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (S)-1-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.	1
Abstract2class: Mechanistic understanding of Pyrococcus horikoshii Dph2, a [4Fe-4S] enzyme required for diphthamide biosynthesis Abstract: Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin, is a unique posttranslational modification on eukaryotic and archaeal translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). The proposed biosynthesis of diphthamide involves three steps and we have recently found that in Pyrococcus horikoshii (P. horikoshii), the first step uses an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent [4Fe-4S] enzyme, PhDph2, to catalyze the formation of a C-C bond. Crystal structure shows that PhDph2 is a homodimer and each monomer contains three conserved cysteine residues that can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the reduced state, the [4Fe-4S] cluster can provide one electron to reductively cleave the bound SAM molecule. However, different from classical radical SAM family of enzymes, biochemical evidence suggest that a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is generated in PhDph2. Here we present evidence supporting that the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical does not undergo hydrogen abstraction reaction, which is observed for the deoxyadenosyl radical in classical radical SAM enzymes. Instead, the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is added to the imidazole ring in the pathway towards the formation of the product. Furthermore, our data suggest that the chemistry requires only one [4Fe-4S] cluster to be present in the PhDph2 dimer.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic and biosynthetic studies of the fungal prenylated xanthone shamixanthone and related metabolites in Aspergillus spp. revisited Abstract: Biosynthetic genes for the prenylated xanthone shamixanthone have been identified in the Aspergillus nidulans genome; based on assignment of putative functions from sequence analyses and selected gene deletions, a pathway was proposed leading from the anthraquinone emodin via the benzophenone carboxylic acid monodictyphenone and the xanthone emericellin to shamixanthone. Several aspects of this proposed pathway are inconsistent with previously identified biosynthetic intermediates: the anthraquinone chrysophanol and the benzophenone aldehyde derivatives arugosins F and A/B, isotopic labelling studies and chemical precedents. A new pathway is presented that provides a full rationale for the results of the gene deletion studies and reconciles them with previous biosynthetic results, and is in accord with established chemical and biosynthetic mechanisms. The importance of interpreting genetic information in terms of established biosynthetic events is discussed.	1
Abstract2class: Unexpected consequences of administering bacteriocinogenic probiotic strains for Salmonella populations, revealed by an in vitro colonic model of the child gut Abstract: New biological strategies for the treatment of Salmonella infection are needed in response to the increase in antibiotic-resistant strains. Escherichia coli L1000 and Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 were previously shown to produce antimicrobial proteinaceous compounds (microcin B17 and thermophilicin B67, respectively) active in vitro against a panel of Salmonella strains recently isolated from clinical cases in Switzerland. In this study, two three-stage intestinal continuous fermentation models of Salmonella colonization inoculated with immobilized faeces of a two-year-old child were implemented to study the effects of the two bacteriocinogenic strains compared with a bacteriocin-negative mutant of strain L1000 on Salmonella growth, as well as gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Immobilized E. coli L1000 added to the proximal colon reactor showed a low colonization, and developed preferentially in the distal colon reactor independent of the presence of genetic determinants for microcin B17 production. Surprisingly, E. coli L1000 addition strongly stimulated Salmonella growth in all three reactors. In contrast, B. thermophilum RBL67 added in a second phase stabilized at high levels in all reactors, but could not inhibit Salmonella already present at a high level (>10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1)) when the probiotic was added. Inulin added at the end of fermentation induced a strong bifidogenic effect in all three colon reactors and a significant increase of Salmonella counts in the distal colon reactor. Our data show that under the simulated child colonic conditions, the microcin B17 production phenotype does not correlate with inhibition of Salmonella but leads to a better colonization of E. coli L1000 in the distal colon reactor. We conclude that in vitro models with complex and complete gut microbiota are required to accurately assess the potential and efficacy of probiotics with respect to Salmonella colonization in the gut.	0
Abstract2class: Covalent Targeting of Ras G12C by Rationally Designed Peptidomimetics Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in fundamental biological processes. Competitive inhibition of these interfaces requires compounds that can access discontinuous binding epitopes along a large, shallow binding surface area. Conformationally defined protein surface mimics present a viable route to target these interactions. However, the development of minimal protein mimics that engage intracellular targets with high affinity remains a major challenge because mimicry of a portion of the binding interface is often associated with the loss of critical binding interactions. Covalent targeting provides an attractive approach to overcome the loss of noncovalent contacts but have the inherent risk of dominating noncovalent contacts and increasing the likelihood of nonselective binding. Here, we report the iterative design of a proteolytically stable α3β chimeric helix mimic that covalently targets oncogenic Ras G12C as a model system. We explored several electrophiles to optimize preferential alkylation with the desired C12 on Ras. The designed lead peptide modulates nucleotide exchange, inhibits activation of the Ras-mediated signaling cascade, and is selectively toxic toward mutant Ras G12C cancer cells. The relatively high frequency of acquired cysteines as missense mutations in cancer and other diseases suggests that covalent peptides may offer an untapped therapeutic approach for targeting aberrant protein interactions.	0

Abstract2class: Directed Evolution and Structural Analysis of Alkaline Pectate Lyase from the Alkaliphilic Bacterium Bacillus sp. Strain N16-5 To Improve Its Thermostability for Efficient Ramie Degumming Abstract: Thermostable alkaline pectate lyases have potential applications in the textile industry as an alternative to chemical-based ramie degumming processes. In particular, the alkaline pectate lyase from Bacillus sp. strain N16-5 (BspPelA) has potential for enzymatic ramie degumming because of its high specific activity under extremely alkaline conditions without the requirement for additional Ca(2+). However, BspPelA displays poor thermostability and is inactive after incubation at 50°C for only 30 min. Here, directed evolution was used to improve the thermostability of BspPelA for efficient and stable degumming. After two rounds of error-prone PCR and screening of >12,000 mutants, 10 mutants with improved thermostability were obtained. Sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that single E124I, T178A, and S271G substitutions were responsible for improving thermostability. Structural and molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated that the formation of a hydrophobic cluster and new H-bond networks was the key factor contributing to the improvement in thermostability with these three substitutions. The most thermostable combined mutant, EAET, exhibited a 140-fold increase in the t50 (time at which the enzyme loses 50% of its initial activity) value at 50°C, accompanied by an 84.3% decrease in activity compared with that of wild-type BspPelA, while the most advantageous combined mutant, EA, exhibited a 24-fold increase in the t50 value at 50°C, with a 23.3% increase in activity. Ramie degumming with the EA mutant was more efficient than that with wild-type BspPelA. Collectively, our results suggest that the EA mutant, exhibiting remarkable improvements in thermostability and activity, has the potential for applications in ramie degumming in the textile industry.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic basis for mycophenolic acid production and strain-dependent production variability in Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Penicillium species including Penicillium roqueforti. The MPA biosynthetic pathway was recently described in Penicillium brevicompactum. In this study, an in silico analysis of the P. roqueforti FM164 genome sequence localized a 23.5-kb putative MPA gene cluster. The cluster contains seven genes putatively coding seven proteins (MpaA, MpaB, MpaC, MpaDE, MpaF, MpaG, MpaH) and is highly similar (i.e. gene synteny, sequence homology) to the P. brevicompactum cluster. To confirm the involvement of this gene cluster in MPA biosynthesis, gene silencing using RNA interference targeting mpaC, encoding a putative polyketide synthase, was performed in a high MPA-producing P. roqueforti strain (F43-1). In the obtained transformants, decreased MPA production (measured by LC-Q-TOF/MS) was correlated to reduced mpaC gene expression by Q-RT-PCR. In parallel, mycotoxin quantification on multiple P. roqueforti strains suggested strain-dependent MPA-production. Thus, the entire MPA cluster was sequenced for P. roqueforti strains with contrasted MPA production and a 174bp deletion in mpaC was observed in low MPA-producers. PCRs directed towards the deleted region among 55 strains showed an excellent correlation with MPA quantification. Our results indicated the clear involvement of mpaC gene as well as surrounding cluster in P. roqueforti MPA biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Disodium Salts of Pseudoephedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Stereoselectivity and Mechanism of Alkylation Abstract: Pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates were generated using sodium diisopropylamide (NaDA) in THF solution. The reactivities and selectivities of the disodium salts largely mirror those of the dilithium salts but without the requisite large excesses of inorganic salts (LiCl) or mandated dilute solutions. The disodium salts require careful control of temperature to preclude deleterious aggregate aging effects traced to changes in the aggregate structure and intervening O-alkylations. Structural studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations show a dominant highly symmetric polyhedron quite different from the lithium analogue. No enolate-NaDA mixed aggregates are observed with excess NaDA. Rate studies show an alkylation mechanism involving an intervening tetramer-monomer pre-equilibrium followed by rate-limiting alkylation of tetrasolvated monomers. DFT computations were conducted to explore the possible influences on stereochemistry. A crystal deriving from samples aged at ambient temperature contains six dianionic subunits and two monoanionic (alkoxide-only) subunits. A new preparation of concentrated solutions of NaDA in THF solution is described.	0
Abstract2class: Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination Abstract: The neural pathways by which information about the acoustic world reaches the auditory cortex are well characterized, but how auditory representations are transformed into motor commands is not known. Here we use a perceptual decision-making task in rats to study this transformation. We demonstrate the role of corticostriatal projection neurons in auditory decisions by manipulating the activity of these neurons in rats performing an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Targeted channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated stimulation of corticostriatal neurons during the task biased decisions in the direction predicted by the frequency tuning of the stimulated neurons, whereas archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-mediated inactivation biased decisions in the opposite direction. Striatal projections are widespread in cortex and may provide a general mechanism for the control of motor decisions by sensory cortex.	0
Abstract2class: Mechanism and regulation of the Two-component FMN-dependent monooxygenase ActVA-ActVB from Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The ActVA-ActVB system from Streptomyces coelicolor is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase involved in the antibiotic actinorhodin biosynthesis. ActVB is a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that provides a reduced FMN to ActVA, the monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin, the precursor of actinorhodin. In this work, using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we investigated the mechanism of hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin catalyzed by ActVA and that of the reduced FMN transfer from ActVB to ActVA. Our results show that the hydroxylation mechanism proceeds with the participation of two different reaction intermediates in ActVA active site. First, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroperoxide species is formed after binding of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase and reaction with O(2). This intermediate hydroxylates the substrate and is transformed to a second reaction intermediate, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroxy species. In addition, we demonstrate that reduced FMN can be transferred efficiently from the reductase to the monooxygenase without involving any protein.protein complexes. The rate of transfer of reduced FMN from ActVB to ActVA was found to be controlled by the release of NAD(+) from ActVB and was strongly affected by NAD(+) concentration, with an IC(50) of 40 microm. This control of reduced FMN transfer by NAD(+) was associated with the formation of a strong charge.transfer complex between NAD(+) and reduced FMN in the active site of ActVB. These results suggest that, in Streptomyces coelicolor, the reductase component ActVB can act as a regulatory component of the monooxygenase activity by controlling the transfer of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase.	1
Abstract2class: Pentamycin Biosynthesis in Philippine Streptomyces sp. S816: Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Installation of the C-14 Hydroxyl Group Abstract: Pentamycin is a polyene antibiotic, registered in Switzerland for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and mixed infections. Chemical instability has hindered its widespread application and development as a drug. Here, we report the identification of Streptomyces sp. S816, isolated from Philippine mangrove soil, as a pentamycin producer. Genome sequence analysis identified the putative pentamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows a high degree of similarity to the gene cluster responsible for filipin III biosynthesis. The ptnJ gene, which is absent from the filipin III biosynthetic gene cluster, was shown to encode a cytochrome P450 capable of converting filipin III to pentamycin. This confirms that the cluster directs pentamycin biosynthesis, paving the way for biosynthetic engineering approaches to the production of pentamycin analogues. Several other Streptomyces genomes were found to contain ptnJ orthologues clustered with genes encoding polyketide synthases that appear to have similar architectures to those responsible for the assembly of filipin III and pentamycin, suggesting pentamycin production may be common in Streptomyces species.	1
Abstract2class: Rapid Construction of Tetralin, Chromane, and Indane Motifs via Cyclative C-H/C-H Coupling: Four-Step Total Synthesis of (±)-Russujaponol F Abstract: The development of practical C-H/C-H coupling reactions remains a challenging yet appealing synthetic venture because it circumvents the need to prefunctionalize both coupling partners for the generation of C-C bonds. Herein we report a cyclative C(sp3)-H/C(sp2)-H coupling reaction of free aliphatic acids enabled by a cyclopentane-based mono-N-protected β-amino acid ligand. This reaction uses inexpensive sodium percarbonate (Na2CO3·1.5H2O2) as the sole oxidant and generates water as the only byproduct. A range of biologically important scaffolds, including tetralins, chromanes, and indanes, can be easily prepared by this protocol. Finally, the synthetic application of this methodology is demonstrated by the concise total synthesis of (±)-russujaponol F in a four-step sequence starting from readily available phenylacetic acid and pivalic acid through sequential functionalizations of four C-H bonds.	0
Abstract2class: Unlocking the Spatial Control of Secondary Metabolism Uncovers Hidden Natural Product Diversity in Nostoc punctiforme Abstract: Filamentous cyanobacteria belong to the most prolific producers of structurally unique and biologically active natural products, yet the majority of biosynthetic gene clusters predicted for these multicellular collectives are currently orphan. Here, we present a systems analysis of secondary metabolite gene expression in the model strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 using RNA-seq and fluorescence reporter analysis. Our data demonstrate that the majority of the cryptic gene clusters are not silent but are expressed with regular or sporadic pattern. Cultivation of N. punctiforme using high-density fermentation overrules the spatial control and leads to a pronounced upregulation of more than 50% of biosynthetic gene clusters. Our data suggest that a combination of autocrine factors, a high CO2 level, and high light account for the upregulation of individual pathways. Our overarching study not only sheds light on the strategies of filamentous cyanobacteria to share the enormous metabolic burden connected with the production of specialized molecules but provides an avenue for the genome-based discovery of natural products in multicellular cyanobacteria as exemplified by the discovery of highly unusual variants of the tricyclic peptide microviridin.	1
Abstract2class: Single-bacterial genomics validates rich and varied specialized metabolism of uncultivated Entotheonella sponge symbionts Abstract: Marine sponges are prolific sources of unique bioactive natural products. The sponge Theonella swinhoei is represented by several distinct variants with largely nonoverlapping chemistry. For the Japanese chemotype Y harboring diverse complex polyketides and peptides, we previously provided genomic and functional evidence that a single symbiont, the filamentous, multicellular organism "Candidatus Entotheonella factor," produces almost all of these compounds. To obtain further insights into the chemistry of "Entotheonella," we investigated another phylotype, "Candidatus Entotheonella serta," present in the T. swinhoei WA sponge chemotype, a source of theonellamide- and misakinolide-type compounds. Unexpectedly, considering the lower chemical diversity, sequencing of individual bacterial filaments revealed an even larger number of biosynthetic gene regions than for Ca E. factor, with virtually no overlap. These included genes for misakinolide and theonellamide biosynthesis, the latter assigned by comparative genomic and metabolic analysis of a T. swinhoei chemotype from Israel, and by biochemical studies. The data suggest that both compound families, which were among the earliest model substances to study bacterial producers in sponges, originate from the same bacterium in T. swinhoei WA. They also add evidence that metabolic richness and variability could be a more general feature of Entotheonella symbionts.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic analysis of a unique bacteriocin, Smb, produced by Streptococcus mutans GS5 Abstract: A dipeptide lantibiotic, named Smb, in Streptococcus mutans GS5 was characterized by molecular genetic approaches. The Smb biosynthesis gene locus is encoded by a 9.5-kb region of chromosomal DNA and consists of seven genes in the order smbM1, -T, -F, -M2, -G, -A, -B. This operon is not present in some other strains of S. mutans, including strain UA159. The genes encoding Smb were identified as smbA and smbB. Inactivation of smbM1, smbA, or smbB attenuated the inhibition of the growth of the indicator strain RP66, confirming an essential role for these genes in Smb expression. Mature Smb likely consists of the 30-amino-acid SmbA together with the 32-amino-acid SmbB. SmbA exhibited similarity with the mature lantibiotic lacticinA2 from Lactococcus lactis, while SmbB was similar to the mersacidin-like peptides from Bacillus halodurans and L. lactis. We also demonstrated that Smb expression is induced by the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and that a com box-like sequence is located in the smb promoter region. These results suggest that Smb belongs to the class I bacteriocin family, and its expression is dependent on CSP-induced quorum sensing.	1
Abstract2class: Highly Versatile β-C(sp3)-H Iodination of Ketones Using a Practical Auxiliary Abstract: The first example of palladium(II)-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-H iodination of a wide range of ketones using a commercially available aminooxyacetic acid auxiliary has been achieved. This L, X-type directing group overcomes the limitations of the transient directing group approach for C(sp3)-H functionalization of ketones. Practical advantages of this method include simple installation of the auxiliary without chromatography, exceptional tolerance of α-functional groups, as well as alkenes and alkynes, and rapid access to diverse sterically hindered quaternary centers.	0
Abstract2class: Leader peptide and a membrane protein scaffold guide the biosynthesis of the tricyclic peptide microviridin Abstract: Microviridins are unique protease inhibitors from bloom-forming cyanobacteria that have both ecological and pharmacological relevance. Their peptide backbones are produced ribosomally, and ATP grasp ligases introduce ω-ester and ω-amide bonds to yield rare cage-like structures. Bioinformatic analysis of the microviridin biosynthesis gene cluster suggests a novel type of processing machinery, which could rationalize the challenging in vivo/in vitro reconstitution of the pathway. In this work, we report the establishment of a minimal expression system for microviridins. Through bioinformatics and mutational analysis of the MdnA leader peptide we identified and characterized a strictly conserved binding motif that is specific for microviridin ligases. Furthermore, we showed that the ABC transporter MdnE is crucial for cyclization and processing of microviridins and demonstrated that MdnE is essential for stability of the microviridin biosynthesis complex.	1
Abstract2class: Three previously unrecognised classes of biosynthetic enzymes revealed during the production of xenovulene A Abstract: Xenovulene A is a complex fungal meroterpenoid, produced by the organism hitherto known as Acremonium strictum IMI 501407, for which limited biosynthetic evidence exists. Here, we generate a draft genome and show that the producing organism is previously unknown and should be renamed as Sarocladium schorii. A biosynthetic gene cluster is discovered which bears resemblance to those involved in the biosynthesis of fungal tropolones, with additional genes of unknown function. Heterologous reconstruction of the entire pathway in Aspergillus oryzae allows the chemical steps of biosynthesis to be dissected. The pathway shows very limited similarity to the biosynthesis of other fungal meroterpenoids. The pathway features: the initial formation of tropolone intermediates; the likely involvement of a hetero Diels-Alder enzyme; a terpene cyclase with no significant sequence homology to any known terpene cyclase and two enzymes catalysing oxidative-ring contractions.	1

Abstract2class: Biosynthetic study of conidiation-inducing factor conidiogenone: heterologous production and cyclization mechanism of a key bifunctional diterpene synthase Abstract: Conidiogenone, a diterpene with a unique structure, is known to induce the conidiation of Penicillium cyclopium. The biosynthetic pathway of (-)-conidiogenone has been fully elucidated by the heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus oryzae and by in vitro enzyme assay with 13C-labeled substrates. After construction of deoxyconidiogenol by the action of bifunctional terpene synthase, one cytochrome P450 catalyzes two rounds of oxidation to furnish conidiogenone. Notably, similar biosynthetic genes are conserved among more than 10 Penicillium sp., suggesting that conidiogenone is a common conidiation inducer in this genus. The cyclization mechanism catalyzed by terpene synthase, which involves successive 1,2-alkyl shifts, was fully elucidated using 13C-labeled geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) as substrate. During the structural analysis of deoxyconidiogenol, we observed broadening of some of the 13C signals measured at room temperature, which has not been observed with other structurally related compounds. Careful examination using techniques including 13C NMR studies at -80 °C, conformational analysis and prediction of the 13C chemical shifts using density functional theory gave insights into this intriguing phenomenon.	1
Abstract2class: Nematode Signaling Molecules Are Extensively Metabolized by Animals, Plants, and Microorganisms Abstract: Many bacterivorous and parasitic nematodes secrete signaling molecules called ascarosides that play a central role regulating their behavior and development. Combining stable-isotope labeling and mass spectrometry-based comparative metabolomics, here we show that ascarosides are taken up from the environment and metabolized by a wide range of phyla, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and mammals, as well as nematodes. In most tested eukaryotes and some bacteria, ascarosides are metabolized into derivatives with shortened fatty acid side chains, analogous to ascaroside biosynthesis in nematodes. In plants and C. elegans, labeled ascarosides were additionally integrated into larger, modular metabolites, and use of different ascaroside stereoisomers revealed the stereospecificity of their biosynthesis. The finding that nematodes extensively metabolize ascarosides taken up from the environment suggests that pheromone editing may play a role in conspecific and interspecific interactions. Moreover, our results indicate that plants, animals, and microorganisms may interact with associated nematodes via manipulation of ascaroside signaling.	0
Abstract2class: The cell end marker Tea4 regulates morphogenesis and pathogenicity in the basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis Abstract: Positional cues localized to distinct cell domains are critical for the generation of cell polarity and cell morphogenesis. These cues lead to assembly of protein complexes that organize the cytoskeleton resulting in delivery of vesicles to sites of polarized growth. Tea4, an SH3 domain protein, was first identified in fission yeast, and is a critical determinant of the axis of polarized growth, a role conserved among ascomycete fungi. Ustilago maydis is a badiomycete fungus that exhibits a yeast-like form that is nonpathogenic and a filamentous form that is pathogenic on maize and teozintle. We are interested in understanding how positional cues contribute to generation and maintenance of these two forms, and their role in pathogenicity. We identified a homologue of fission yeast tea4 in a genetic screen for mutants with altered colony and cell morphology and present here analysis of Tea4 for the first time in a basidiomycete fungus. We demonstrate that Tea4 is an important positional marker for polarized growth and septum location in both forms. We uncover roles for Tea4 in maintenance of cell and neck width, cell separation, and cell wall deposition in the yeast-like form, and in growth rate, formation of retraction septa, growth reversal, and inhibition of budding in the filamentous form. We show that Tea4::GFP localizes to sites of polarized or potential polarized growth in both forms, as observed in ascomycete fungi. We demonstrate an essential role of Tea4 in pathogencity in the absence of cell fusion. Basidiomycete and ascomycete Tea4 homologues share SH3 and Glc7 domains. Tea4 in basidiomycetes has additional domains, which has led us to hypothesize that Tea4 has novel functions in this group of fungi.	0
Abstract2class: Modulating Enzyme Catalysis through Mutations Designed to Alter Rapid Protein Dynamics Abstract: The relevance of sub-picosecond protein motions to the catalytic event remains a topic of debate. Heavy enzymes (isotopically substituted) provide an experimental tool for bond-vibrational links to enzyme catalysis. A recent transition path sampling study with heavy purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) characterized the experimentally observed mass-dependent slowing of barrier crossing (Antoniou, D.; Ge, X.; Schramm, V. L.; Schwartz, S. D. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 3538). Here we computationally identify second-sphere amino acid residues predicted to influence the freedom of the catalytic site vibrational modes linked to heavy enzyme effects in PNP. We mutated heavy and light PNPs to increase the catalytic site vibrational freedom. Enzymatic barrier-crossing rates were converted from mass-dependent to mass-independent as a result of the mutations. The mutagenic uncoupling of femtosecond motions between catalytic site groups and reactants decreased transition state barrier crossing by 2 orders of magnitude, an indication of the femtosecond dynamic contributions to catalysis.	0
Abstract2class: Comparison of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis gene clusters in Claviceps species indicates loss of late pathway steps in evolution of C. fusiformis Abstract: The grass parasites Claviceps purpurea and Claviceps fusiformis produce ergot alkaloids (EA) in planta and in submerged culture. Whereas EA synthesis (EAS) in C. purpurea proceeds via clavine intermediates to lysergic acid and the complex ergopeptines, C. fusiformis produces only agroclavine and elymoclavine. In C. purpurea the EAS gene (EAS) cluster includes dmaW (encoding the first pathway step), cloA (elymoclavine oxidation to lysergic acid), and the lpsA/lpsB genes (ergopeptine formation). We analyzed the corresponding C. fusiformis EAS cluster to investigate the evolutionary basis for chemotypic differences between the Claviceps species. Other than three peptide synthetase genes (lpsC and the tandem paralogues lpsA1 and lpsA2), homologues of all C. purpurea EAS genes were identified in C. fusiformis, including homologues of lpsB and cloA, which in C. purpurea encode enzymes for steps after clavine synthesis. Rearrangement of the cluster was evident around lpsB, which is truncated in C. fusiformis. This and several frameshift mutations render CflpsB a pseudogene (CflpsB(Psi)). No obvious inactivating mutation was identified in CfcloA. All C. fusiformis EAS genes, including CflpsB(Psi) and CfcloA, were expressed in culture. Cross-complementation analyses demonstrated that CfcloA and CflpsB(Psi) were expressed in C. purpurea but did not encode functional enzymes. In contrast, CpcloA catalyzed lysergic acid biosynthesis in C. fusiformis, indicating that C. fusiformis terminates its EAS pathway at elymoclavine because the cloA gene product is inactive. We propose that the C. fusiformis EAS cluster evolved from a more complete cluster by loss of some lps genes and by rearrangements and mutations inactivating lpsB and cloA.	1
Abstract2class: Facile photocyclization chemistry of 5-phenylthio-2'-deoxyuridine in duplex DNA Abstract: We report here the synthesis of 5-phenylthio-2'-deoxyuridine (d(PhS)U), its incorporation into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), and its photocyclization chemistry. Irradiation of dinucleoside monophosphate d((PhS)UG) and d(PhS)U-bearing duplex ODNs with 254 nm light results in the facile formation of a cyclic product where the C6 of uracil is covalently bonded to the C2 of the phenyl ring. The chemistry reported here may serve as the basis for the efficient preparation of a new class of duplex DNA with an extended pi system. [reaction: see text]	0
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the countries of the Gulf cooperation council: dominance of OXA-48 and NDM producers Abstract: The molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were determined in hospitals in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), namely, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Isolates were subjected to PCR-based detection of antibiotic-resistant genes and repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) assessments of clonality. Sixty-two isolates which screened positive for potential carbapenemase production were assessed, and 45 were found to produce carbapenemase. The most common carbapenemases were of the OXA-48 (35 isolates) and NDM (16 isolates) types; 6 isolates were found to coproduce the OXA-48 and NDM types. No KPC-type, VIM-type, or IMP-type producers were detected. Multiple clones were detected with seven clusters of clonally related Klebsiella pneumoniae. Awareness of CRE in GCC countries has important implications for controlling the spread of CRE in the Middle East and in hospitals accommodating patients transferred from the region.	0
Abstract2class: Fluoroarene Separations in Metal-Organic Frameworks with Two Proximal Mg2+ Coordination Sites Abstract: Fluoroarenes are widely used in medicinal, agricultural, and materials chemistry, and yet their production remains a critical challenge in organic synthesis. Indeed, the nearly identical physical properties of these vital building blocks hinders their purification by traditional methods, such as flash chromatography or distillation. As a result, the Balz-Schiemann reaction is currently employed to prepare fluoroarenes instead of more atom-economical C-H fluorination reactions, which produce inseparable mixtures of regioisomers. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to this problem: the purification of mixtures of fluoroarenes using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we demonstrate that controlling the interaction of fluoroarenes with adjacent coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ centers within a MOF enables the separation of fluoroarene mixtures with unparalleled selectivities. Liquid-phase multicomponent equilibrium adsorption data and breakthrough measurements coupled with van der Waals-corrected density functional theory calculations reveal that the materials Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) and Mg2(m-dobdc) (m-dobdc4- = 2,4-dioxidobenzene-1,5-dicarboxylate) are capable of separating the difluorobenzene isomers from one another. Additionally, these frameworks facilitate the separations of fluoroanisoles, fluorotoluenes, and fluorochlorobenzenes. In addition to enabling currently unfeasible separations for the production of fluoroarenes, our results suggest that carefully controlling the interaction of isomers with not one but two strong binding sites within a MOF provides a general strategy for achieving challenging liquid-phase separations.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of an iterative type I polyketide synthase gene cluster for biosynthesis of the antitumor chlorinated polyenone neocarzilin in "Streptomyces carzinostaticus" Abstract: Neocarzilins (NCZs) are antitumor chlorinated polyenones produced by "Streptomyces carzinostaticus" var. F-41. The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of NCZs was cloned and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of a 33-kb region revealed a cluster of 14 open reading frames (ORFs), three of which (ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6) encode type I polyketide synthase (PKS), which consists of four modules. Unusual features of the modular organization is the lack of an obvious acyltransferase domain on modules 2 and 4 and the presence of longer interdomain regions more than 200 amino acids in length on each module. Involvement of the PKS genes in NCZ biosynthesis was demonstrated by heterologous expression of the cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999, which produced the apparent NCZ biosynthetic intermediates dechloroneocarzillin A and dechloroneocarzilin B. Disruption of ORF5 resulted in a failure of NCZ production, providing further evidence that the cluster is essential for NCZ biosynthesis. Mechanistic consideration of NCZ formation indicates the iterative use of at least one module of the PKS, which subsequently releases its product by decarboxylation to generate an NCZ skeleton, possibly catalyzed by a type II thioesterase encoded by ORF7. This is a novel type I PKS system of bacterial origin for the biosynthesis of a reduced polyketide chain. Additionally, the protein encoded by ORF3, located upstream of the PKS genes, closely resembles the FADH(2)-dependent halogenases involved in the formation of halometabolites. The ORF3 protein could be responsible for the halogenation of NCZs, presenting a unique example of a halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of an aliphatic halometabolite.	1
Abstract2class: Negative capacitance in multidomain ferroelectric superlattices Abstract: The stability of spontaneous electrical polarization in ferroelectrics is fundamental to many of their current applications, which range from the simple electric cigarette lighter to non-volatile random access memories. Research on nanoscale ferroelectrics reveals that their behaviour is profoundly different from that in bulk ferroelectrics, which could lead to new phenomena with potential for future devices. As ferroelectrics become thinner, maintaining a stable polarization becomes increasingly challenging. On the other hand, intentionally destabilizing this polarization can cause the effective electric permittivity of a ferroelectric to become negative, enabling it to behave as a negative capacitance when integrated in a heterostructure. Negative capacitance has been proposed as a way of overcoming fundamental limitations on the power consumption of field-effect transistors. However, experimental demonstrations of this phenomenon remain contentious. The prevalent interpretations based on homogeneous polarization models are difficult to reconcile with the expected strong tendency for domain formation, but the effect of domains on negative capacitance has received little attention. Here we report negative capacitance in a model system of multidomain ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices across a wide range of temperatures, in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Using a phenomenological model, we show that domain-wall motion not only gives rise to negative permittivity, but can also enhance, rather than limit, its temperature range. Our first-principles-based atomistic simulations provide detailed microscopic insight into the origin of this phenomenon, identifying the dominant contribution of near-interface layers and paving the way for its future exploitation.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering the rhizosphere microbiome for disease-suppressive bacteria Abstract: Disease-suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil-borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms. For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the γ-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Our data indicate that upon attack by a fungal root pathogen, plants can exploit microbial consortia from soil for protection against infections.	1
Abstract2class: Stabilizing the Oxygen Lattice and Reversible Oxygen Redox Chemistry through Structural Dimensionality in Lithium-Rich Cathode Oxides Abstract: Lattice-oxygen redox (l-OR) has become an essential companion to the traditional transition-metal (TM) redox charge compensation to achieve high capacity in Li-rich cathode oxides. However, the understanding of l-OR chemistry remains elusive, and a critical question is the structural effect on the stability of l-OR reactions. Herein, the coupling between l-OR and structure dimensionality is studied. We reveal that the evolution of the oxygen-lattice structure upon l-OR in Li-rich TM oxides which have a three-dimensional (3D)-disordered cation framework is relatively stable, which is in direct contrast to the clearly distorted oxygen-lattice framework in Li-rich oxides which have a two-dimensional (2D)/3D-ordered cation structure. Our results highlight the role of structure dimensionality in stabilizing the oxygen lattice in reversible l-OR, which broadens the horizon for designing high-energy-density Li-rich cathode oxides with stable l-OR chemistry.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of sultam scaffolds via intramolecular oxa-Michael and diastereoselective Baylis-Hillman reactions Abstract: A divergent synthetic approach to new sultams utilizing intramolecular oxa-Michael and Baylis-Hillman reactions of readily prepared vinyl sulfonamides and suitably protected amino alcohols, is reported. A variety of seven- and eight-membered ring sultam scaffolds were synthesized using oxa-Michael pathways, whereas both five- and six-membered rings were synthesized using Baylis-Hillman methods. Baylis-Hillman reactions proceed with good to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity, and oxa-Michael reactions leading to eight-membered ring sultams provide empirical evidence validating 8- endo-trig cyclization pathways.	0
Abstract2class: Heterologous characterization of mechercharmycin A biosynthesis reveals alternative insights into post-translational modifications for RiPPs Abstract: Mechercharmycin A (MCM-A) is a marine natural product belonging to a family of polyazole cyclopeptides with remarkable bioactivities and unique structures. Identification, heterologous expression, and genetic characterizations of the MCM biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis revealed that it is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) possessing complex with distinctive modifications. Based on this heterologous expression system, two MCM analogs with comparable antitumor activity are generated by engineering the biosynthetic pathway. Combinatorial co-production of a precursor peptide with different modifying enzymes in Escherichia coli identifies a different timing of modifications, showing that a tRNAGlu-dependent highly regioselective dehydration is the first modification step, followed by polyazole formation through heterocyclization and dehydrogenation in an N- to C-terminal direction. Therefore, a rational biosynthetic pathway of MCMs is proposed, which unveils a subfamily of azol(in)e-containing RiPPs and sets the stage for further investigations of the enzymatic mechanism and synthetic biology.	1
Abstract2class: Total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B and analogues thereof: strategy evolution, structural revision, and biological evaluation Abstract: The details of the total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B (1) are described. Initial synthetic strategies toward this intriguing tetracycline antibiotic resulted in the development of key alkylation and Lewis acid-mediated spirocyclization reactions to form the hindered EF spirojunction, as well as Michael-Dieckmann reactions to set the A and C rings. The use of an aromatic A-ring substrate, however, was found to be unsuitable for the introduction of the requisite hydroxyl groups at carbons 4a and 12a. Applying these previous tactics, we developed stepwise approaches to oxidize carbons 12a and 4a based on enol- and enolate-based oxidations, respectively, the latter of which was accomplished after systematic investigations that revealed critical reactivity patterns. The herein described synthetic strategy resulted in the total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B (1), which, in turn, formed the basis for the revision of its originally assigned structure. The developed chemistry facilitated the synthesis of a series of viridicatumtoxin analogues, which were evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, including drug-resistant pathogens, revealing the first structure-activity relationships within this structural type.	1
Abstract2class: Role refinement of melanin synthesis genes by gene knockout reveals their functional diversity in Pyricularia oryzae strains Abstract: Pyricularia oryzae is a plant pathogenic fungus that severely affects rice production. Past studies, primarily using mutants generated by spontaneous mutations or artificial physical and chemical mutagenesis, have determined that melanin is required for appressorium turgor, penetration, and virulence of P. oryzae. However, these roles need to be verified by gene knockout and/or overexpression in different strains considering the potential differences in the level of virulence. Here, we confirmed the indispensable roles of melanin in the development and virulence of P. oryzae by knocking out and over-expressing three melanin synthesis genes (ALB1, RSY1, and BUF1) in two wild-type strains (Guy11 and 70-15). Deletion of ALB1, RSY1, or BUF1 led to loss of melanin and virulence in both strains. ALB1, RSY1 and BUF1 in Guy11, and BUF1 in 70-15 were required for conidiation, respectively. ALB1, RSY1, and BUF1 were required for conidial resistance to environmental stresses (UV exposure, oxidization, and freezing damage) in both strains. Guy11 cells had greater amounts of melanin and more transcripts of melanin synthesis genes than 70-15 cells. Paired culture experiments between the deletion or over-expression mutants of melanin synthesis genes suggested that the reaction catalyzed by Buf1, but not Alb1 and Rsy1, was likely a rate-limiting step in melanin biosynthesis in 70-15. These results expand our understanding on melanin and its synthesis genes in P. oryzae as well as its responses to biotic and abiotic environments.	1
Abstract2class: Convergent evolution of adenosine aptamers spanning bacterial, human, and random sequences revealed by structure-based bioinformatics and genomic SELEX Abstract: Aptamers are structured macromolecules in vitro evolved to bind molecular targets, whereas in nature they form the ligand-binding domains of riboswitches. Adenosine aptamers of a single structural family were isolated several times from random pools, but they have not been identified in genomic sequences. We used two unbiased methods, structure-based bioinformatics and human genome-based in vitro selection, to identify aptamers that form the same adenosine-binding structure in a bacterium, and several vertebrates, including humans. Two of the human aptamers map to introns of RAB3C and FGD3 genes. The RAB3C aptamer binds ATP with dissociation constants about 10 times lower than physiological ATP concentration, while the minimal FGD3 aptamer binds ATP only cotranscriptionally.	0
Abstract2class: A de novo peptide hexamer with a mutable channel Abstract: The design of new proteins that expand the repertoire of natural protein structures represents a formidable challenge. Success in this area would increase understanding of protein structure and present new scaffolds that could be exploited in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here we describe the design, characterization and X-ray crystal structure of a new coiled-coil protein. The de novo sequence forms a stand-alone, parallel, six-helix bundle with a channel running through it. Although lined exclusively by hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine side chains, the 6-Å channel is permeable to water. One layer of leucine residues within the channel is mutable, accepting polar aspartic acid and histidine side chains, which leads to subdivision and organization of solvent within the lumen. Moreover, these mutants can be combined to form a stable and unique (Asp-His)(3) heterohexamer. These new structures provide a basis for engineering de novo proteins with new functions.	0
Abstract2class: Rapid Capture and Release of Nucleic Acids through a Reversible Photo-Cycloaddition Reaction in a Psoralen-Functionalized Hydrogel Abstract: Reversible immobilization of DNA and RNA is of great interest to researchers who seek to manipulate DNA or RNA in applications such as microarrays, DNA hydrogels, and gene therapeutics. However, there is no existing system that can rapidly capture and release intact nucleic acids. To meet this unmet need, we developed a functional hydrogel for rapid DNA/RNA capture and release based on the reversible photo-cycloaddition of psoralen and pyrimidines. The functional hydrogel can be easily fabricated through copolymerization of acrylamide with the synthesized allylated psoralen. The psoralen-functionalized hydrogel exhibits effective capture and release of nucleic acids spanning a wide range of lengths in a rapid fashion; over 90 % of the capture process is completed within 1 min, and circa 100 % of the release process is completed within 2 min. We observe no deleterious effects on the hybridization to the captured targets.	0
Abstract2class: Predictive model for epoxide hydrolase-generated stereochemistry in the biosynthesis of nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics Abstract: Nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics C-1027, neocarzinostatin (NCS), and kedarcidin (KED) possess enediyne cores to which activity-modulating peripheral moieties are attached via (R)- or (S)-vicinal diols. We have previously shown that this stereochemical difference arises from hydrolysis of epoxide precursors by epoxide hydrolases (EHs) with different regioselectivities. The inverting EHs, such as SgcF, hydrolyze an (S)-epoxide substrate to yield an (R)-diol in C-1027 biosynthesis, whereas the retaining EHs, such as NcsF2 and KedF, hydrolyze an (S)-epoxide substrate to yield an (S)-diol in NCS and KED biosynthesis. We now report the characterization of a series of EH mutants and provide a predictive model for EH regioselectivity in the biosynthesis of the nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics. A W236Y mutation in SgcF increased the retaining activity toward (S)-styrene oxide by 3-fold, and a W236Y/Q237M double mutation in SgcF, mimicking NcsF2 and KedF, resulted in a 20-fold increase in the retaining activity. To test the predictive utility of these mutations, two putative enediyne biosynthesis-associated EHs were identified by genome mining and confirmed as inverting enzymes, SpoF from Salinospora tropica CNB-440 and SgrF (SGR_625) from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of EHs revealed a familial classification according to inverting versus retaining activity. Taken together, these results provide a predictive model for vicinal diol stereochemistry in enediyne biosynthesis and set the stage for further elucidating the origins of EH regioselectivity.	1
Abstract2class: Arginyltransferase ATE1 catalyzes midchain arginylation of proteins at side chain carboxylates in vivo Abstract: Arginylation is an emerging posttranslational modification mediated by Arg-tRNA-protein-transferase (ATE1). It is believed that ATE1 links Arg solely to the N terminus of proteins, requiring prior proteolysis or action by Met-aminopeptidases to expose the arginylated site. Here, we tested the possibility of Arg linkage to midchain sites within intact protein targets and found that many proteins in vivo are modified on the side chains of Asp and Glu by unconventional chemistry that targets the carboxy rather than the amino groups at the target sites. Such arginylation appears to be functionally regulated, and it can be directly mediated by ATE1, in addition to the more conventional ATE1-mediated linkage of Arg to the N-terminal alpha amino group. This midchain arginylation implies an unconventional mechanism of ATE1 action that likely facilitates its major biological role.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and mechanism of the magnesium-independent aromatic prenyltransferase CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: CloQ is an aromatic prenyltransferase from the clorobiocin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans. It is involved in the synthesis of the prenylated hydroxybenzoate moiety of the antibiotic, specifically catalyzing the attachment of a dimethylallyl moiety to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Herein, we report the crystal structure of CloQ and use it as a framework for interpreting biochemical data from both wild-type and variant proteins. CloQ belongs to the aromatic prenyltransferase family, which is characterized by an unusual core fold comprising five consecutive ααββ elements that form a central 10-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel. The latter delineates a solvent-accessible cavity where substrates bind and catalysis takes place. This cavity has well-defined polar and nonpolar regions, which have distinct roles in substrate binding and facilitate a Friedel-Crafts-type mechanism. We propose that the juxtaposition of five positively charged residues in the polar region circumvents the necessity for a Mg(2+), which, by contrast, is a strict requirement for the majority of prenyltransferases characterized to date. Our structure of CloQ complexed with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate reveals the formation of a covalent link between the substrate and Cys215 to yield a thiohemiketal species. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we show that this link is not essential for enzyme activity in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CloQ will accept alternative substrates and, therefore, has the capacity to generate a range of prenylated compounds. Since prenylation is thought to enhance the bioactivity of many natural products, CloQ offers considerable promise as a biocatalyst for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of novel compounds with therapeutic potential.	1
Abstract2class: The DESIGNER Approach Helps Decipher the Hypoglycemic Bioactive Principles of Artemisia dracunculus (Russian Tarragon) Abstract: Complementing classical drug discovery, phytochemicals act on multiple pharmacological targets, especially in botanical extracts, where they form complex bioactive mixtures. The reductionist approach used in bioactivity-guided fractionation to identify single bioactive phytochemicals is inadequate for capturing the full therapeutic potential of the (bio)chemical interactions present in such complex mixtures. This study used a DESIGNER (Deplete and Enrich Select Ingredients to Generate Normalized Extract Resources) approach to selectively remove the known bioactives, 4'-O-methyldavidigenin (1; 4,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone, syn. DMC-1) and its isomer 4-O-methyldavidigenin (2; syn. DMC-2), from the mixture of phytochemicals in an ethanol extract from Artemisia dracunculus to determine to what degree the more abundant 2 accounts for the established antidiabetic effect of the A. dracunculus extract. Using an otherwise chemically intact "knock-out extract" depleted in 2 and its regioisomer, 1, in vitro and in vivo outcomes confirmed that 2 (and likely 1) acts as major bioactive(s) that enhance(s) insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, but also revealed that 2 does not account for the breadth of detectable biological activity of the extract. This is the first report of generating, at a sufficiently large preparative scale, a "knock-out extract" used as a pharmacological tool for in vitro and in vivo studies to dissect the biological impact of a designated bioactive in a complex phytochemical mixture.	0
Abstract2class: Isolation and analysis of genes specifically expressed during fruiting body development in the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes by fluorescence differential display Abstract: Using fluorescence differential display, cDNAs specifically expressed at the primordial stage of fruiting body development were isolated from the basidiomycete, Flammulina velutipes. Seventy-five cDNAs were sequenced and compared with the amino-acid sequences of proteins in the database by BLASTX search. Significant similarity was found for 29 cDNAs coding for proteins with known function, GTP-binding protein, growth factor, ubiquitin-proteasome, cytochrome P450 and hydrophobin, all of which would be associated with fruiting body development. Seventeen cDNAs were not similar to proteins in the database and may represent unique genes that play specific roles in the process of fruiting in F. velutipes.	0
Abstract2class: Curcuminoids block TGF-β signaling in human breast cancer cells and limit osteolysis in a murine model of breast cancer bone metastasis Abstract: Effects of curcuminoids on breast cancer cell secretion of the bone-resorptive peptide parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and on lytic breast cancer bone metastasis were evaluated. In vitro, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion was inhibited by curcuminoids (IC50 = 24 μM) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells independent of effects on cell growth inhibition. Effects on TGF-β signaling revealed decreases in phospho-Smad2/3 and Ets-1 protein levels with no effect on p-38 MAPK-mediated TGF-β signaling. In vivo, mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells into the left cardiac ventricle and treated ip every other day with curcuminoids (25 or 50 mg/kg) for 21 days. Osteolytic bone lesion area was reduced up to 51% (p < 0.01). Consistent with specific effects on bone osteolysis, osteoclast number at the bone-tumor interface was reduced up to 53% (p < 0.05), while tumor area within bone was unaltered. In a separate study, tumor mass in orthotopic mammary xenografts was also unaltered by treatment. These data suggest that curcuminoids prevent TGF-β induction of PTHrP and reduce osteolytic bone destruction by blockade of Smad signaling in breast cancer cells.	0
Abstract2class: Selection of Non- Saccharomyces Wine Yeasts for the Production of Leavened Doughs Abstract: Background:                       Non-conventional yeasts (NCY) (i.e., non-Saccharomyces) may be used as alternative starters to promote biodiversity and quality of fermented foods and beverages (e.g., wine, beer, bakery products).                  Methods:                       A total of 32 wine-associated yeasts (Campania region, Italy) were genetically identified and screened for decarboxylase activity and leavening ability. The best selected strains were used to study the leavening kinetics in model doughs (MDs). A commercial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as the control. The volatile organic profiles of the inoculated MDs were analyzed by solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS).                  Results:                       Most of strains belonged to the NCY species Hanseniaspora uvarum, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia kudriavzevii, Torulaspora delbruekii, and Zygotorulaspora florentina, while a few strains were S. cerevisiae. Most strains of H. uvarum lacked decarboxylase activity and showed a high leaving activity after 24 h of incubation that was comparable to the S. cerevisiae strains. The selected H. uvarum strains generated a different flavor profile of the doughs compared to the S. cerevisiae strains. In particular, NCY reduced the fraction of aldehydes that were potentially involved in oxidative phenomena.                  Conclusions:                       The use of NCY could be advantageous in the bakery industry, as they can provide greater diversity than S. cerevisiae-based products, and may be useful in reducing and avoiding yeast intolerance.	0
Abstract2class: Sequence analysis and functional characterization of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Violacein is a purple-colored, broad-spectrum antibacterial pigment that has a dimeric structure composed of 5-hydroxyindole, oxindole and 2-pyyrolidone subunits formed by the condensation of two modified tryptophan molecules. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster from Chromobacterium violaceum was characterized by DNA sequencing, transposon mutagenesis, and chemical analysis of the pathway intermediates produced heterologously in Escherichia. coli. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster spans eight kilobases and is comprised of the four genes, vioABCD, that are necessary for violacein production. Sequence analysis suggests that the products of vioA, vioC and vioD are nucleotide-dependent monooxygenases. Disruption of vioA or vioB completely abrogates the biosynthesis of violacein intermediates, while disruption of the vioC or vioD genes results in the production of violacein precursors.	1
Abstract2class: Single-cell FRET imaging of transferrin receptor trafficking dynamics by Sfp-catalyzed, site-specific protein labeling Abstract: Fluorescence imaging of living cells depends on an efficient and specific method for labeling the target cellular protein with fluorophores. Here we show that Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling is suitable for fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins that spend at least part of their membrane trafficking cycle at the cell surface. In this study, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was fused to peptide carrier protein (PCP), and the TfR1-PCP fusion protein was specifically labeled with fluorophore Alexa 488 by Sfp. The trafficking of transferrin-TfR1-PCP complex during the process of transferrin-mediated iron uptake was imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescently labeled transferrin ligand and TfR1 receptor. We thus demonstrated that Sfp-catalyzed small molecule labeling of the PCP tag represents a practical and efficient tool for molecular imaging studies in living cells.	0
Abstract2class: Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac-mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl-tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site-specific incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA-bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site-directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC-derived cell types and complex tissue models.	0
Abstract2class: Resistance imparted by traditional Chinese medicines to the acute change of glutamic pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase activities in rat blood caused by noise Abstract: The activities of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and creatine kinase (CK) in rats injected or not with the Chinese medicines, Astragali, Rhodiolae and Ligusticum, were determined after noise exposure. Noise at 95 and 105 dB significantly increased the activities of GPT, ALP and CK, and showed a dependence on the exposure time. The injection of each medicine significantly suppressed the increased enzyme activities by 95 and 105 dB noise.	0
Abstract2class: Structural characterization of the surface-associated heteropolysaccharide of Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1.1478 and genetic analysis of its putative biosynthesis cluster Abstract: Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPS) like xanthan are widely exploited as natural biopolymers in diverse industrial sectors. In foods, in-situ EPS formation by starter cultures allows the manufacturing of "clean labeled" products with improved textural and nutritional properties. We performed structural analyses of the cell surface-associated EPS produced by Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1.1478, which is a promising starter culture for fermented foods. Chromatographic analyses and NMR experiments suggested an acetylated heptameric repeating unit comprised of glucose, rhamnose and galactose as major components, whereas analysis of the macromolecular HePS structure suggested an apparent molecular mass of Mr ∼2 × 106 and a root mean square (RMS) radius of ca. 60 nm. Genetic analyses enabled the identification of the respective EPS biosynthesis cluster, and its modular organization supports the chemically identified, novel EPS structure. The obtained results broaden the understanding of complex EPS formation from activated sugar nucleotides by Lactobacillus plantarum.	1
Abstract2class: A Consensus Ochratoxin A Biosynthetic Pathway: Insights from the Genome Sequence of Aspergillus ochraceus and a Comparative Genomic Analysis Abstract: Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species that widely contaminates food and feed. We sequenced and assembled the complete ∼37-Mb genome of Aspergillusochraceus fc-1, a well-known producer of OTA. Key genes of the OTA biosynthetic pathway were identified by comparative genomic analyses with five other sequenced OTA-producing fungi: A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. steynii, A. westerdijkiae, and Penicillium nordicum OTA production was completely inhibited in the deletion mutants (ΔotaA, ΔotaB, ΔotaC, ΔotaD, and ΔotaR1), and OTA biosynthesis was restored by feeding a postblock substrate to the corresponding mutant. The OTA biosynthetic pathway was unblocked in the ΔotaD mutant by the addition of heterologously expressed halogenase. OTA biosynthesis begins with a polyketide synthase (PKS), OtaA, utilizing acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and malonyl-CoA to synthesize 7-methylmellein, which is oxidized to OTβ by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (OtaC). OTβ and l-β-phenylalanine are combined by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), OtaB, to form an amide bond to synthesize OTB. Finally, OTB is chlorinated by a halogenase (OtaD) to OTA. The otaABCD genes were expressed at low levels in the ΔotaR1 mutant. A second regulator, otaR2, which is adjacent to the biosynthetic gene, could modulate only the expression of otaA, otaB, and otaD Thus, we have identified a consensus OTA biosynthetic pathway that can be used to prevent and control OTA synthesis and will help us understand the variation and production of the intermediate components in the biosynthetic pathway.IMPORTANCE Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a significant mycotoxin that contaminates cereal products, coffee, grapes, wine, cheese, and meat. OTA is nephrotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and immunotoxic. OTA contamination is a serious threat to food safety, endangers human health, and can cause huge economic losses. At present, >20 species of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium are known to produce OTA. Here we demonstrate that a consensus OTA biosynthetic pathway exists in all OTA-producing fungi and is encoded by a gene cluster containing four highly conserved biosynthetic genes and a bZIP transcription factor.	1
Abstract2class: Heterologous expression of novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: A method was developed for the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters in different Streptomyces strains and for the modification of these clusters by single or multiple gene replacements or gene deletions with unprecedented speed and versatility. Lambda-Red-mediated homologous recombination was used for genetic modification of the gene clusters, and the attachment site and integrase of phage phiC31 were employed for the integration of these clusters into the heterologous hosts. This method was used to express the gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and clorobiocin in the well-studied strains Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans, which, in contrast to the natural producers, can be easily genetically manipulated. S. coelicolor M512 derivatives produced the respective antibiotic in yields comparable to those of natural producer strains, whereas S. lividans TK24 derivatives were at least five times less productive. This method could also be used to carry out functional investigations. Shortening of the cosmids' inserts showed which genes are essential for antibiotic production.	1
Abstract2class: Transcription of the sex-determining region genes Sry and Zfy in the mouse preimplantation embryo Abstract: We have confirmed the faster growth of male preimplantation mouse embryos. We have also studied the transcription of Y chromosomal genes postulated to have a role in sex determination, using the highly sensitive technique of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction at these early stages. We find that two sex-determining region genes, Sry and Zfy, are transcribed during mouse preimplantation development, while the Zfy homologs Zfx and Zfa and a sex-determining region gene originally called A1s9 (now called Ube1y-1) are not. We also show that the anti-Müllerian hormone gene, which contains a Sry consensus binding element in its 5' promoter region, is not transcribed at this time. Developmental curves show that Sry and Zfy are expressed commencing at the two-cell stage. These results suggest that mammalian sex determination starts prior to gonad differentiation.	0
Abstract2class: Partial DNA-guided Cas9 enables genome editing with reduced off-target activity Abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile RNA-guided genome editing tool. Here we demonstrate that partial replacement of RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides in CRISPR RNA (crRNA) enables efficient gene editing in human cells. This strategy of partial DNA replacement retains on-target activity when used with both crRNA and sgRNA, as well as with multiple guide sequences. Partial DNA replacement also works for crRNA of Cpf1, another CRISPR system. We find that partial DNA replacement in the guide sequence significantly reduces off-target genome editing through focused analysis of off-target cleavage, measurement of mismatch tolerance and genome-wide profiling of off-target sites. Using the structure of the Cas9-sgRNA complex as a guide, the majority of the 3' end of crRNA can be replaced with DNA nucleotide, and the 5 - and 3'-DNA-replaced crRNA enables efficient genome editing. Cas9 guided by a DNA-RNA chimera may provide a generalized strategy to reduce both the cost and the off-target genome editing in human cells.	0
Abstract2class: Serine proteases from two cell types target different components of a complex that governs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of pro-sigmaK during Bacillus subtilis development Abstract: Upon starvation Bacillus subtilis undergoes a developmental process involving creation of two cell types, the mother cell and forespore. A signal in the form of a serine protease, SpoIVB, is secreted from the forespore and leads to regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of pro-sigmaK, releasing active sigmaK into the mother cell. RIP of pro-sigmaK is carried out by a membrane-embedded metalloprotease, SpoIVFB, which is inactive when bound by BofA and SpoIVFA. We have investigated the mechanism by which this complex is activated. By expressing components of the signalling pathway in Escherichia coli, we reconstructed complete inhibition of pro-sigmaK RIP by BofA and SpoIVFA, and found that SpoIVB serine protease activity could partially restore RIP, apparently by targeting SpoIVFA. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that SpoIVFA synthesized early during B. subtilis sporulation is lost in a SpoIVB-dependent fashion, coincident with the onset of pro-sigmaK RIP, supporting the idea that SpoIVB targets SpoIVFA to trigger RIP of pro-sigmaK. Loss of BofA depended not only on SpoIVB, but also on CtpB, a serine protease secreted from the mother cell. CtpB appeared to cleave BofA near its C-terminus upon coexpression in E. coli, and purified CtpB degraded BofA. We propose that RIP of pro-sigmaK involves a three-step proteolytic cascade in which SpoIVB first cleaves SpoIVFA, CtpB then cleaves BofA and finally SpoIVFB cleaves pro-sigmaK.	0
Abstract2class: Epigenetics of Epileptogenesis-Evoked Upregulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 in Hippocampus Abstract: Enhanced levels of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in humans and rodents. Lack of Mmp-9 impoverishes, whereas excess of Mmp-9 facilitates epileptogenesis. Epigenetic mechanisms driving the epileptogenesis-related upregulation of MMP-9 expression are virtually unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal these mechanisms. We analyzed hippocampi extracted from adult and pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy as well as from partially and fully pentylenetetrazole kindled rats. We used a unique approach to the analysis of the kindling model results (inclusion in the analysis of rats being during kindling, and not only a group of fully kindled animals), which allowed us to separate the molecular effects exerted by the epileptogenesis from those related to epilepsy and epileptic activity. Consequently, it allowed for a disclosure of molecular mechanisms underlying causes, and not consequences, of epilepsy. Our data show that the epileptogenesis-evoked upregulation of Mmp-9 expression is regulated by removal from Mmp-9 gene proximal promoter of the two, interweaved potent silencing mechanisms-DNA methylation and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-related repression. Demethylation depends on a gradual dissociation of the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, and on progressive association of the DNA demethylation promoting protein Gadd45β to Mmp-9 proximal gene promoter in vivo. The PRC2-related mechanism relies on dissociation of the repressive transcription factor YY1 and the dissipation of the PRC2-evoked trimethylation on Lys27 of the histone H3 from the proximal Mmp-9 promoter chromatin in vivo. Moreover, we show that the DNA hydroxymethylation, a new epigenetic DNA modification, which is localized predominantly in the gene promoters and is particularly abundant in the brain, is not involved in a regulation of MMP-9 expression during the epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus as well as in the hippocampi of pediatric and adult epileptic patients. Additionally, we have also found that despite of its transient nature, the histone modification H3S10ph is strongly and gradually accumulated during epileptogenesis in the cell nuclei and in the proximal Mmp-9 gene promoter in the hippocampus, which suggests that H3S10ph can be involved in DNA demethylation in mammals, and not only in Neurospora. The study identifies MMP-9 as the first protein coding gene which expression is regulated by DNA methylation in human epilepsy. We present a detailed epigenetic model of the epileptogenesis-evoked upregulation of MMP-9 expression in the hippocampus. To our knowledge, it is the most complex and most detailed mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression ever revealed for a particular gene in epileptogenesis. Our results also suggest for the first time that dysregulation of DNA methylation found in epilepsy is a cause rather than a consequence of this condition.	0
Abstract2class: Purification and characterization of phosphonoglycans from Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338 Abstract: Two related actinomycetes, Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338, were identified as potential phosphonic acid producers by screening for the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) mutase, which is required for the biosynthesis of most phosphonates. Using a variety of analytical techniques, both strains were subsequently shown to produce phosphonate-containing exopolysaccharides (EPS), also known as phosphonoglycans. The phosphonoglycans were purified by sequential organic solvent extractions, methanol precipitation, and ultrafiltration. The EPS from the Glycomyces strain has a mass of 40 to 50 kDa and is composed of galactose, xylose, and five distinct partially O-methylated galactose residues. Per-deutero-methylation analysis indicated that galactosyl residues in the polysaccharide backbone are 3,4-linked Gal, 2,4-linked 3-MeGal, 2,3-linked Gal, 3,6-linked 2-MeGal, and 4,6-linked 2,3-diMeGal. The EPS from the Stackebrandtia strain is comprised of glucose, galactose, xylose, and four partially O-methylated galactose residues. Isotopic labeling indicated that the O-methyl groups in the Stackebrandtia phosphonoglycan arise from S-adenosylmethionine. The phosphonate moiety in both phosphonoglycans was shown to be 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (2-HEP) by (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry following strong acid hydrolysis of the purified molecules. Partial acid hydrolysis of the purified EPS from Glycomyces yielded 2-HEP in ester linkage to the O-5 or O-6 position of a hexose and a 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Partial acid hydrolysis of Stackebrandtia EPS also revealed the presence of 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Examination of the genome sequences of the two strains revealed similar pepM-containing gene clusters that are likely to be required for phosphonoglycan synthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of Tailoring Methyltransferases Involved in K-41A Biosynthesis: Modulating Methylation to Improve K-41A Anti-infective Activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for polyether antibiotic K-41A was identified from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01680 and subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic study. Bioinformatics analyses, gene disruption, and metabolomics analyses afforded eight new derivatives and one known polyether, showcasing five region-specific methyltransferases Pak13, Pak15, Pak20, Pak31, and Pak38 and their respective modification loci. Moreover, bioassays revealed that two disaccharide-bearing polyethers, K-41B and K-41Bm, display enhanced anti-HIV and potent antibacterial activities.	1
Abstract2class: Functional genomics-guided discovery of a light-activated phytotoxin in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum via pathway activation Abstract: Parastagonospora nodorum is an important pathogen of wheat. The contribution of secondary metabolites to this pathosystem is poorly understood. A biosynthetic gene cluster (SNOG_08608-08616) has been shown to be upregulated during the late stage of P. nodorum wheat leaf infection. The gene cluster shares several homologues with the Cercospora nicotianae CTB gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of cercosporin. Activation of the gene cluster by overexpression (OE) of the transcription factor gene (SNOG_08609) in P. nodorum resulted in the production of elsinochrome C, a perelyenequinone phytotoxin structurally similar to cercosporin. Heterologous expression of the polyketide synthase gene elcA from the gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of the polyketide precursor nortoralactone common to the cercosporin pathway. Elsinochrome C could be detected on wheat leaves infected with P. nodorum, but not in the elcA disruption mutant. The compound was shown to exhibit necrotic activity on wheat leaves in a light-dependent manner. Wheat seedling infection assays showed that ΔelcA exhibited reduced virulence compared with wild type, while infection by an OE strain overproducing elsinochrome C resulted in larger lesions on leaves. These data provided evidence that elsinochrome C contributes to the virulence of P. nodorum against wheat.	1
Abstract2class: Engineering Thermotoga maritima β-glucosidase for improved alkyl glycosides synthesis by site-directed mutagenesis Abstract: Alkyl glycosides are well-characterized nonionic surfactants, and can be prepared by transglycosylation reactions with retaining GH1 glycosidases being normally used for this purpose. The produced alkyl glycosides can also be hydrolyzed by the glycosidase, and hence, the yields of alkyl glycosides can be too low for industrial use. To improve the transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio for a β-glucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (TmBglA) for the synthesis of alkyl glycoside, six mutants (N222F, N223C, N223Q, G224A, Y295F, and F414S) were produced. N222F, N223C, N223Q, G224A improved catalytic activity, F295Y and F414S are hydrolytically crippled with p-nitrophenol-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as substrate with an 85 and 70-fold decrease in apparent kcat, respectively; N222F shows the highest kcat/km value for pNPG. The substrate selectivity altered from pNPG to pNP-β-d-fucoside for N222F, F295Y, and F414S and from cellubiose to gentiobiose for N222F and F414S. Using pNPG (34 mM) and hexanol 80% (vol/vol), N222F, Y295F, and F414S synthesized hexyl-β-glycoside (HG) yields of 84.7%, 50.9%, and 54.1%, respectively, HG increased from 14.49 (TmBglA) to 22.8 mM (N222F) at 2 hr by 57.42%. However, this higher transglycosylation effect depended on that three mutants creates an environment more suited for hexanol in the active site pocket, and consequently suppressed its HG hydrolysis.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and heterologous expression of the thioviridamide biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces olivoviridis Abstract: Thioviridamide is a unique peptide antibiotic containing five thioamide bonds from Streptomyces olivoviridis. Draft genome sequencing revealed a gene (the tvaA gene) encoding the thioviridamide precursor peptide. The thioviridamide biosynthesis gene cluster was identified by heterologous production of thioviridamide in Streptomyces lividans.	1
Abstract2class: A Maldiisotopic Approach to Discover Natural Products: Cryptomaldamide, a Hybrid Tripeptide from the Marine Cyanobacterium Moorea producens Abstract: Genome sequencing of microorganisms has revealed a greatly increased capacity for natural products biosynthesis than was previously recognized from compound isolation efforts alone. Hence, new methods are needed for the discovery and description of this hidden secondary metabolite potential. Here we show that provision of heavy nitrogen 15N-nitrate to marine cyanobacterial cultures followed by single-filament MALDI analysis over a period of days was highly effective in identifying a new natural product with an exceptionally high nitrogen content. The compound, named cryptomaldamide, was subsequently isolated using MS to guide the purification process, and its structure determined by 2D NMR and other spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. Bioinformatic analysis of the draft genome sequence identified a 28.7 kB gene cluster that putatively encodes for cryptomaldamide biosynthesis. Notably, an amidinotransferase is proposed to initiate the biosynthetic process by transferring an amidino group from arginine to serine to produce the first residue to be incorporated by the hybrid NRPS-PKS pathway. The maldiisotopic approach presented here is thus demonstrated to provide an orthogonal method by which to discover novel chemical diversity from Nature.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation, structure elucidation, and synergistic antibacterial activity of a novel two-component lantibiotic lichenicidin from Bacillus licheniformis VK21 Abstract: A novel synergetic lantibiotic pair, Lchalpha (3249.51 Da) and Lchbeta (3019.36 Da), termed lichenicidin VK21, was isolated from the producer strain Bacillus licheniformis VK21. Chemical and spatial structures of Lchalpha and Lchbeta were determined. Each peptide contains 31 amino acid residues linked by 4 intramolecular thioether bridges and the N-terminal 2-oxobutyryl group. Spatial structures of Lchalpha and Lchbeta were studied by NMR spectroscopy in methanol solution. The Lchalpha peptide displays structural homology with mersacidin-like lantibiotics and involves relatively well-structured N- and C-terminal domains connected by a flexible loop stabilized by a thioether bridge Ala11-S-Ala21. In contrast, the Lchbeta peptide represents a prolonged hydrophobic alpha-helix flanked with more flexible N- and C-terminal domains. A lantibiotic cluster of the Bacillus licheniformis VK21 genome which comprises the structural genes, lchA1 and lchA2, encoding the lantibiotics precursors, as well as the gene of a modifying enzyme lchM1, was amplified and sequenced. The mature peptides, Lchalpha and Lchbeta, interact synergistically to possess antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria within a nanomolar concentration range, though the individual peptides were shown to be active at micromolar concentrations. Our results afford molecular insight into the mechanism of lichenicidin VK21 action.	1
Abstract2class: Genetics of zwittermicin a production by Bacillus cereus Abstract: Zwittermicin A represents a new chemical class of antibiotic and has diverse biological activities, including suppression of oomycete diseases of plants and potentiation of the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. To identify genes involved in zwittermicin A production, we generated 4,800 transposon mutants of B. cereus UW101C and screened them for zwittermicin A accumulation. Nine mutants did not produce detectable zwittermicin A, and one mutant produced eightfold more than the parent strain. The DNA flanking the transposon insertions in six of the nine nonproducing mutants contains significant sequence similarity to genes involved in peptide and polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis. The mutant that overproduced zwittermicin A contained a transposon insertion immediately upstream from a gene that encodes a deduced protein that is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Three genes identified by the mutant analysis mapped to a region that was previously shown to carry the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, and a biosynthetic gene (E. A. Stohl, J. L. Milner, and J. Handelsman, Gene 237:403-411, 1999). Further sequencing of this region revealed genes proposed to encode zwittermicin A precursor biosynthetic enzymes, in particular, those involved in the formation of the aminomalonyl- and hydroxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein intermediates. Additionally, nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) homologs are present, suggesting that zwittermicin A is synthesized by a mixed NRPS/PKS pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into the Unique Phosphorylation of the Lasso Peptide Paeninodin Abstract: Lasso peptides are a new class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides and thus far are only isolated from proteo- and actinobacterial sources. Typically, lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters encode enzymes for biosynthesis and export but not for tailoring. Here, we describe the isolation of the novel lasso peptide paeninodin from the firmicute Paenibacillus dendritiformis C454 and reveal within its biosynthetic cluster a gene encoding a kinase, which we have characterized as a member of a new class of lasso peptide-tailoring kinases. By employing a wide variety of peptide substrates, it was shown that this novel type of kinase specifically phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residue while ignoring those located elsewhere. These experiments also reveal that no other recognition motif is needed for efficient enzymatic phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine. Furthermore, through comparison with homologous HPr kinases and subsequent mutational analysis, we confirmed the essential catalytic residues. Our study reveals how lasso peptides are chemically diversified and sets the foundation for rational engineering of these intriguing natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Structural characterization of lacticin 3147, a two-peptide lantibiotic with synergistic activity Abstract: Lantibiotics are antibacterial peptides isolated from bacterial sources that exhibit activity toward Gram-positive organisms and are usually several orders of magnitude more potent than traditional antibiotics such as penicillin. They contain a number of unique structural features including dehydro amino acid and lanthionine (thioether) residues. Introduced following ribosomal translation of the parent peptide, these moieties render conventional methods of peptide analysis ineffective. We report herein a new method using nickel boride (Ni(2)B), in the presence of deuterium gas, to reduce dehydro side chains and reductively desulfurize lanthionine bridges found in lantibiotics. Using this approach, it is possible to identify and distinguish the original locations of dehydro side chains and lanthionine bridges by traditional peptide sequencing (Edman degradation) followed by mass spectrometry. The strategy was initially verified using nisin A, a structurally well characterized lantibiotic, and subsequently extended to the novel two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis DPC3147. The primary structures of both lacticin 3147 peptides were then fully assigned by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, showing that lacticin 3147 A1 has a specific lanthionine bridging pattern which resembles the globular type-B lantibiotic mersacidin, whereas the A2 peptide is a member of the elongated type-A lantibiotic class. Also obtained by NMR were solution conformations of both lacticin 3147 peptides, indicating that A1 may adopt a conformation similar to that of mersacidin and that the A2 peptide adopts alpha-helical structure. These results are the first of their kind for a synergistic lantibiotic pair (only four such pairs have been reported to date).	1
Abstract2class: Synthesis and succinylation of subtilin-like lantibiotics are strongly influenced by glucose and transition state regulator AbrB Abstract: Subtilin and the closely related entianin are class I lantibiotics produced by different subspecies of Bacillus subtilis. Both molecules are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics with unusual ring structures. Subtilin-like lantibiotics develop strong antibiotic activities against various Gram-positive organisms with an efficiency similar to that of nisin from Lactococcus lactis. In contrast to nisin, subtilin-like lantibiotics partially undergo an additional posttranslational modification, where the N-terminal tryptophan residue becomes succinylated, resulting in drastically reduced antibiotic activities. A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based quantification method enabled us to determine entianin and succinylated entianin (S-entianin) concentrations in the supernatant during growth. We show that entianin synthesis and the degree of succinylation drastically change with culture conditions. In particular, increasing glucose concentrations resulted in higher entianin amounts and lower proportions of S-entianin in Landy-based media. In contrast, no succinylation was observed in medium A with 10% glucose. Interestingly, glucose retarded the expression of entianin biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, deletion of the transition state regulator AbrB resulted in a 6-fold increased entianin production in medium A with 10% glucose. This shows that entianin biosynthesis in B. subtilis is strongly influenced by glucose, in addition to its regulation by the transition state regulator AbrB. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying the succinylation of subtilin-like lantibiotics is enzymatically catalyzed and occurs in the extracellular space or at the cellular membrane.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and Biological Activity of NFAT-133 Congeners from Streptomyces pactum Abstract: The soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456 produces a number of polyketide natural products. Among them is NFAT-133, an inhibitor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) that suppresses interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression and T cell proliferation. Biosynthetic gene inactivation in the ATCC 27456 strain revealed the ability of this strain to produce other polyketide compounds including analogues of NFAT-133. Consequently, seven new derivatives of NFAT-133, TM-129-TM-135, together with a known compound, panowamycin A, were isolated from the culture broth of S. pactum ATCC 27456 ΔptmTDQ. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of their HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and ECD calculation and spectral data. NFAT-133, TM-132, TM-135, and panowamycin A showed no antibacterial activity or cytotoxicity, but weakly reduced the production of LPS-induced nitric oxide in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A revised chemical structure of panowamycin A and proposed modes of formation of the new NFAT-133 analogues are also presented.	0
Abstract2class: EcdGHK are three tailoring iron oxygenases for amino acid building blocks of the echinocandin scaffold Abstract: The echinocandins are a small group of fungal N-acylated cyclic hexapeptides that are fungicidal for candida strains and fungistatic for aspergilli by targeting cell wall 1,3-β-glucan synthases. The side chains of all six amino acid building blocks have hydroxyl groups, including the nonproteinogenic 4R,5R-dihydroxy-Orn1, 4R-OH-Pro3, 3S,4S-dihydroxy-homoTyr4, and 3S-OH-4S-Me-Pro6. The echinocandin (ecd) gene cluster contains two predicted nonheme mononuclear iron oxygenase genes (ecdG,K) and one encoding a P450 type heme protein (ecdH). Deletion of the ecdH gene in the producing strain Emericella rugulosa generates an echinocandin scaffold (echinocandin D) lacking both hydroxyl groups on Orn1. Correspondingly, the ΔecdG strain failed to hydroxylate C3 of the homoTyr residue, and purified EcdG hydroxylated free L-homoTyr at C3. The ΔecdK strain failed to generate mature echinocandin unless supplemented with either 4R-Me-Pro or 3S-OH-4S-Me-Pro, indicating blockage of a step upstream of Me-Pro formation. Purified EcdK is a Leu 5-hydroxylase, acting iteratively at C5 to yield γ-Me-Glu-γ-semialdehyde in equilibrium with the cyclic imine product. Evaluation of deshydroxyechinocandin scaffolds in the in vitro anticandidal assays revealed up to a 3-fold loss of potency for the ΔecdG scaffolds, but a 3-fold gain of potency for the ΔecdH scaffold, in line with prior results on deoxyechinocandin homologues.	1
Abstract2class: The genetic organisation of the capsule biosynthesis region of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1, 6, 7, and 12 Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the organisation of the genes (cps) involved in biosynthesis the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes 6, 7, and 12 and to compare these to the corresponding genes previously described in other A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes. In serotypes 6 and 7 the sequenced DNA regions comprised five and four open reading frames, respectively, designated cps6ABCDE and cps7ABCD, whereas the sequenced DNA region in serotype 12 comprised only two open reading frames designated cps12AB. At the amino acid level, CpsA, CpsB, and CpsC of A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 contained a high degree of homology. At the amino acid level Cps6D revealed a high degree of homology to Cps8D, whereas Cps7D contained a high degree of homology to the Cps2D. The deduced gene product of the partially sequenced cps6E gene showed no homology to any deduced gene products of any cps genes of A. pleuropneumoniae investigated so far. None of the deduced gene products of the cps genes involved in encapsulation of A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 revealed homology to the deduced gene products of the cps genes of serotypes 1, 5A, and 12. For some genes, a local homology was found to genes probably involved in teichoic acid synthesis in other bacteria. The results obtained revealed a high degree of homology among the genes involved in CPS biosynthesis for serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 and a different group of homologous cps genes for serotypes 1 and 12. In some serotype 7 strains, including the serotype 7 reference strain, WF83, the cps genes were not located adjacent to the genes responsible for CPS export (cpx), probably due to genetic rearrangements.	1
Abstract2class: Formation of the aureothin tetrahydrofuran ring by a bifunctional cytochrome p450 monooxygenase Abstract: The polyketide antibiotic aureothin, produced by Streptomyces thioluteus, is equipped with a rare exomethylene-tetrahydrofuran moiety. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that AurH, a bifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is required and sufficient for the stereoselective synthesis of the furan ring, involving the subsequent formation of two new C-O bonds.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of a poly-cyclopropylglycine-containing peptide via bioinformatic mapping of radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes Abstract: Peptide-derived natural products are a large class of bioactive molecules that often contain chemically challenging modifications. In the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), radical-SAM (rSAM) enzymes have been shown to catalyze the formation of ether, thioether, and carbon-carbon bonds on the precursor peptide. The installation of these bonds typically establishes the skeleton of the mature RiPP. To facilitate the search for unexplored rSAM-dependent RiPPs for the community, we employed a bioinformatic strategy to screen a subfamily of peptide-modifying rSAM enzymes which are known to bind up to three [4Fe-4S] clusters. A sequence similarity network was used to partition related families of rSAM enzymes into >250 clusters. Using representative sequences, genome neighborhood diagrams were generated using the Genome Neighborhood Tool. Manual inspection of bacterial genomes yielded numerous putative rSAM-dependent RiPP pathways with unique features. From this analysis, we identified and experimentally characterized the rSAM enzyme, TvgB, from the tvg gene cluster from Halomonas anticariensis. In the tvg gene cluster, the precursor peptide, TvgA, is comprised of a repeating TVGG motif. Structural characterization of the TvgB product revealed the repeated formation of cyclopropylglycine, where a new bond is formed between the γ-carbons on the precursor valine. This novel RiPP modification broadens the functional potential of rSAM enzymes and validates the proposed bioinformatic approach as a practical broad search tool for the discovery of new RiPP topologies.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of genes involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin Abstract: Lantibiotics are peptide-derived antibiotics with high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. They are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Götz, H. Zähner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). The most important lantibiotics are subtilin and the food preservative nisin, which both have a very similar structure. By using a hybridization probe specific for the structural gene of subtilin, spaS, the DNA region adjacent to spaS was isolated from Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analysis of a 4.9-kb fragment revealed several open reading frames with the same orientation as spaS. Downstream of spaS, no reading frames were present on the isolated XbaI fragment. Upstream of spaS, three reading frames, spaB, spaC, and spaT, were identified which showed strong homology to genes identified near the structural gene of the lantibiotic epidermin. The SpaT protein derived from the spaT sequence was homologous to hemolysin B of Escherichia coli, which indicated its possible function in subtilin transport. Gene deletions within spaB and spaC revealed subtilin-negative mutants, whereas spaT gene disruption mutants still produced subtilin. Remarkably, the spaT mutant colonies revealed a clumpy surface morphology on solid media. After growth on liquid media, spaT mutant cells agglutinated in the mid-logarithmic growth phase, forming longitudinal 3- to 10-fold-enlarged cells which aggregated. Aggregate formation preceded subtilin production and cells lost their viability, possibly as a result of intracellular subtilin accumulation. Our results clearly proved that reading frames spaB and spaC are essential for subtilin biosynthesis whereas spaT mutants are probably deficient in subtilin transport.	1
Abstract2class: Facile synthesis of native and protease-resistant ubiquitylated peptides Abstract: The reversible post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins by ubiquitin regulates key cellular processes including protein degradation and gene transcription. Studies of the mechanistic roles for protein ubiquitylation require quantities of homogenously modified substrates that are typically inaccessible from natural sources or by enzymatic ubiquitylation in vitro. Therefore, we developed a facile and scalable methodology for site-specific chemical ubiquitylation. Our semisynthetic strategy utilized a temporary ligation auxiliary, 2-(aminooxy)ethanethiol, to direct ubiquitylation to specific lysine residues in peptide substrates. Mild reductive removal of the auxiliary after ligation yielded ubiquitylated peptides with the native isopeptide linkage. Alternatively, retention of the ligation auxiliary yielded protease-resistant analogues of ubiquitylated peptides. Importantly, our strategy was fully compatible with the presence of protein thiol groups, as demonstrated by the synthesis of peptides modified by the human small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 protein.	0
Abstract2class: Enantioselective reduction of sulfur-containing cyclic imines through biocatalysis Abstract: The 3-thiazolidine ring represents an important structural motif in life sciences molecules. However, up to now reduction of 3-thiazolines as an attractive approach failed by means of nearly all chemical reduction technologies for imines. Thus, the development of an efficient general and enantioselective synthetic technology giving access to a range of such heterocycles remained a challenge. Here we present a method enabling the reduction of 3-thiazolines with high conversion and high to excellent enantioselectivity (at least 96% and up to 99% enantiomeric excess). This technology is based on the use of imine reductases as catalysts, has a broad substrate range, and is also applied successfully to other sulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Moreover the effiency of this biocatalytic technology platform is demonstrated in an initial process development leading to 99% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess at a substrate loading of 18 g/L in the presence of designer cells.	0
Abstract2class: CRISPR-Mediated Activation of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters for Bioactive Molecule Discovery in Filamentous Fungi Abstract: Accessing the full biosynthetic potential encoded in the genomes of fungi is limited by the low expression of most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) under common laboratory culture conditions. CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) of fungal BGCs could accelerate genomics-driven bioactive secondary metabolite discovery. In this work, we established the first CRISPRa system for filamentous fungi. First, we constructed a CRISPR/dLbCas12a-VPR-based system and demonstrated the activation of a fluorescent reporter in Aspergillus nidulans. Then, we targeted the native nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene micA in both chromosomal and episomal contexts, achieving increased production of the compound microperfuranone. Finally, multigene CRISPRa led to the discovery of the mic cluster product as dehydromicroperfuranone. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of the variant dLbCas12aD156R-VPR for CRISPRa at room temperature culture conditions. Different aspects that influence the efficiency of CRISPRa in fungi were investigated, providing a framework for the further development of fungal artificial transcription factors based on CRISPR/Cas.	1
Abstract2class: Tandem prenyltransferases catalyze isoprenoid elongation and complexity generation in biosynthesis of quinolone alkaloids Abstract: Modification of natural products with prenyl groups and the ensuing oxidative transformations are important for introducing structural complexity and biological activities. Penigequinolones (1) are potent insecticidal alkaloids that contain a highly modified 10-carbon prenyl group. Here we reveal an iterative prenylation mechanism for installing the 10-carbon unit using two aromatic prenyltransferases (PenI and PenG) present in the gene cluster of 1 from Penicillium thymicola. The initial Friedel-Crafts alkylation is catalyzed by PenI to yield dimethylallyl quinolone 6. The five-carbon side chain is then dehydrogenated by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase to give aryl diene 9, which serves as the electron-rich substrate for a second alkylation with dimethylallyl diphosphate to yield stryrenyl product 10. The completed, oxidized 10-carbon prenyl group then undergoes further structural morphing to yield yaequinolone C (12), the immediate precursor of 1. Our studies have therefore uncovered an unprecedented prenyl chain extension mechanism in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Genomic Insights into Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Producing Shewanella sp. N2AIL from Fish Gut Abstract: The genus Shewanella is widely distributed in niches ranging from an aquatic environment to spoiled fish and is loaded with various ecologically and commercially important metabolites. Bacterial species under this genus find application in bioelectricity generation and bioremediation due to their capability to use pollutants as the terminal electron acceptor and could produce health-beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Here, the genome sequence of an EPA-producing bacterium, Shewanella sp. N2AIL, isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of Tilapia fish, is reported. The genome size of the strain was 4.8 Mb with a GC content of 46.3% containing 4385 protein-coding genes. Taxonogenomic analysis assigned this strain to the genus Shewanella on the basis of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), phylogenetically most closely related with S. baltica NCTC 10735T. The comparative genome analysis with the type strain of S. baltica revealed 693 unique genes in the strain N2AIL, highlighting the variation at the strain level. The genes associated with stress adaptation, secondary metabolite production, antibiotic resistance, and metal reduction were identified in the genome suggesting the potential of the bacterium to be explored as an industrially important strain. PUFA synthase gene cluster of size ~20.5 kb comprising all the essential domains for EPA biosynthesis arranged in five ORFs was also identified in the strain N2AIL. The study provides genomic insights into the diverse genes of Shewanella sp. N2AIL, which is particularly involved in adaptation strategies and prospecting secondary metabolite potential, specifically the biosynthesis of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	1
Abstract2class: Inorganic phosphate self-sufficient whole-cell biocatalysts containing two co-expressed phosphorylases facilitate cellobiose production Abstract: Cellobiose, a natural disaccharide, attracts extensive attention as a potential functional food/feed additive. In this study, we present an inorganic phosphate (Pi) self-sufficient biotransformation system to produce cellobiose by co-expressing sucrose phosphorylase (SP) and cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP). The Bifidobacterium adolescentis SP (BASP) and Cellvibrio gilvus CBP (CGCBP) were co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli cells containing BASP and CGCBP were used as whole-cell catalysts to convert sucrose and glucose to cellobiose. The effects of reaction pH, temperature, Pi concentration, and substrate concentration were investigated. In the optimum biotransformation conditions, 800 mM cellobiose was produced from 1.0 M sucrose, 1.0 M glucose, and 50 mM Pi, within 12 hr. The by-product fructose and residual substrate (sucrose and glucose) were efficiently removed by treatment with yeast, to help purify the product cellobiose. The wider applicability of this Pi self-sufficiency strategy was demonstrated in the production of laminaribiose by co-expressing SP and laminaribiose phosphorylase. This study suggests that the Pi self-sufficiency strategy through co-expressing two phosphorylases has the advantage of great flexibility for enhanced production of cellobiose (or laminaribiose).	0
Abstract2class: Metamorphic enzyme assembly in polyketide diversification Abstract: Natural product chemical diversity is fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary metabolism. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula form a beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1)s), decarboxylases (ECH(2)s) and enoyl reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(ii), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme. In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta,gamma enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C = C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and enoyl reductase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Okaramines That Target Insect Glutamate-Gated Chloride Channels Abstract: Prenylated indole alkaloid okaramines selectively target insect glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls). Because of their highly complex structures, including azocine and azetidine rings, total synthesis of okaramine A or B has not been achieved, preventing evaluation of the biological activities of okaramines. Biosynthetic approaches provide alternatives to accessing structurally diverse derivatives and enabling the elucidation of structure-activity relationships. To explore the biosynthetic potential of okaramines, gene knockout experiments of an okaramine-producer fungus were performed. The deletion mutants of the oxygenase genes okaB, okaD, okaE, and okaG provided analogues that were unlikely to be accumulated in the normal biosynthetic process of the wild-type strain. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships of okaramines collected from the fungal cultures revealed that 1,4-dihydroazocine and N-aliphatic group attached to the indole were crucial for GluCl-activating activity. This provided insights into further derivatization of the complex structure of okaramines in order to facilitate the development of new insecticides.	1
Abstract2class: ValC, a new type of C7-Cyclitol kinase involved in the biosynthesis of the antifungal agent validamycin A Abstract: The gene valC, which encodes an enzyme homologous to the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone kinase (AcbM) of the acarbose biosynthetic pathway, was identified in the validamycin A biosynthetic gene cluster. Inactivation of valC resulted in mutants that lack the ability to produce validamycin A. Complementation experiments with a replicating plasmid harboring full-length valC restored the production of validamycin A, thus suggesting a critical function of valC in validamycin biosynthesis. In vitro characterization of ValC revealed a new type of C7-cyclitol kinase, which phosphorylates valienone and validone--but not 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, 5-epi-valiolone, or glucose--to afford their 7-phosphate derivatives. The results provide new insights into the activity of this enzyme and also confirm the existence of two different pathways leading to the same end-product: the valienamine moiety common to acarbose and validamycin A.	1
Abstract2class: The binding pattern of two carbohydrate-binding modules of laminarinase Lam16A from Thermotoga neapolitana: differences in beta-glucan binding within family CBM4 Abstract: Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are often part of the complex hydrolytic extracellular enzymes from bacteria and may modulate their catalytic activity. The thermostable catalytic domain of laminarinase Lam16A from Thermotoga neapolitana (glycosyl hydrolase family 16) is flanked by two CBMs, 148 and 161 aa long. They share a sequence identity of 30%, are homologous to family CBM4 and are thus called CBM4-1 and CBM4-2 respectively. Recombinant Lam16A proteins deleted for one or both binding modules and the isolated module CBM4-1 were characterized. Proteins containing the N-terminal module CBM4-1 bound to the soluble polysaccharides laminarin (1,3-beta-glucan) and barley 1,3/1,4-beta-glucan, and proteins containing the C-terminal module CBM4-2 bound additionally to curdlan (1,3-beta-glucan) and pustulan (1,6-beta-glucan), and to insoluble yeast cell wall beta-glucan. The activity of the catalytic domain on soluble 1,3-beta-glucans was stimulated by the presence of CBM4-1, whereas the presence of CBM4-2 enhanced the Lam16A activity towards gelatinized and insoluble or mixed-linkage 1,3-beta-glucan. Thermostability of the catalytic domain was not affected by the truncations. Members of family CBM4 can be divided into four subfamilies, members of which show different polysaccharide-binding specificities corresponding to the catalytic specificities of the associated hydrolytic domains.	0
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of Crp/Fnr-type global transcriptional regulators in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough Abstract: Crp/Fnr-type global transcriptional regulators regulate various metabolic pathways in bacteria and typically function in response to environmental changes. However, little is known about the function of four annotated Crp/Fnr homologs (DVU0379, DVU2097, DVU2547, and DVU3111) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. A systematic study using bioinformatic, transcriptomic, genetic, and physiological approaches was conducted to characterize their roles in stress responses. Similar growth phenotypes were observed for the crp/fnr deletion mutants under multiple stress conditions. Nevertheless, the idea of distinct functions of Crp/Fnr-type regulators in stress responses was supported by phylogeny, gene transcription changes, fitness changes, and physiological differences. The four D. vulgaris Crp/Fnr homologs are localized in three subfamilies (HcpR, CooA, and cc). The crp/fnr knockout mutants were well separated by transcriptional profiling using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and more genes significantly changed in expression in a ΔDVU3111 mutant (JW9013) than in the other three paralogs. In fitness studies, strain JW9013 showed the lowest fitness under standard growth conditions (i.e., sulfate reduction) and the highest fitness under NaCl or chromate stress conditions; better fitness was observed for a ΔDVU2547 mutant (JW9011) under nitrite stress conditions and a ΔDVU2097 mutant (JW9009) under air stress conditions. A higher Cr(VI) reduction rate was observed for strain JW9013 in experiments with washed cells. These results suggested that the four Crp/Fnr-type global regulators play distinct roles in stress responses of D. vulgaris. DVU3111 is implicated in responses to NaCl and chromate stresses, DVU2547 in nitrite stress responses, and DVU2097 in air stress responses.	0
Abstract2class: Dark Hydrazone Fluorescence Labeling Agents Enable Imaging of Cellular Aldehydic Load Abstract: Aldehydes are key intermediates in many cellular processes, from endogenous metabolic pathways like glycolysis to undesired exogenously induced processes such as lipid peroxidation and DNA interstrand cross-linking. Alkyl aldehydes are well documented to be cytotoxic, affecting the functions of DNA and protein, and their levels are tightly regulated by the oxidative enzyme ALDH2. Mutations in this enzyme are associated with cardiac damage, diseases such as Fanconi anemia (FA), and cancer. Many attempts have been made to identify and quantify the overall level of these alkyl aldehydes inside cells, yet there are few practical methods available to detect and monitor these volatile aldehydes in real time. Here, we describe a multicolor fluorogenic hydrazone transfer ("DarkZone") system to label alkyl aldehydes, yielding up to 30-fold light-up response in vitro. A cell-permeant DarkZone dye design was applied to detect small-molecule aldehydes in the cellular environment. The new dye design also enabled the monitoring of cellular acetaldehyde production from ethanol over time by flow cytometry, demonstrating the utility of the DarkZone dyes for measuring and imaging the aldehydic load related to human disease.	0
Abstract2class: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPR184w gene encodes the glycogen debranching enzyme Abstract: The YPR184w gene encodes a 1536-amino acid protein that is 34-39% identical to the mammal, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans glycogen debranching enzyme. The N-terminal part of the protein possesses the four conserved sequences of the alpha-amylase superfamily, while the C-terminal part displays 50% similarity with the C-terminal of other eukaryotic glycogen debranching enzymes. Reliable measurement of alpha-1,4-glucanotransferase and alpha-1, 6-glucosidase activity of the yeast debranching enzyme was determined in strains overexpressing YPR184w. The alpha-1, 4-glucanotransferase activity of a partially purified preparation of debranching enzyme preferentially transferred maltosyl units than maltotriosyl. Deletion of YPR184w prevents glycogen degradation, whereas overexpression had no effect on the rate of glycogen breakdown. In response to stress and growth conditions, the transcriptional control of YPR184w gene, renamed GDB1 (for Glycogen DeBranching gene), is strictly identical to that of other genes involved in glycogen metabolism.	0
Abstract2class: A Bifunctional Leader Peptidase/ABC Transporter Protein Is Involved in the Maturation of the Lasso Peptide Cochonodin I from Streptococcus suis Abstract: Lasso peptides are members of the natural product superfamily of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we describe the first lasso peptide originating from a biosynthetic gene cluster belonging to a unique lasso peptide subclade defined by the presence of a bifunctional protein harboring both a leader peptidase (B2) and an ABC transporter (D) domain. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these clusters also encode homologues of the NisR/NisK regulatory system and the NisF/NisE/NisG immunity factors, which are usually associated with the clusters of antimicrobial class I lanthipeptides, such as nisin, another distinct RiPP subfamily. The cluster enabling the heterologous production of the lasso peptide cochonodin I in E. coli originated from Streptococcus suis LSS65, and the threaded structure of cochonodin I was evidenced through extensive MS/MS analysis and stability assays. It was shown that the ABC transporter domain from SsuB2/D is not essential for lasso peptide maturation. By extensive genome mining dedicated exclusively to other lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters featuring bifunctional B2/D proteins, it was furthermore revealed that many bacteria associated with human or animal microbiota hold the biosynthetic potential to produce cochonodin-like lasso peptides, implying that these natural products might play roles in human and animal health.	1
Abstract2class: Nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes pesL and pes1 are essential for Fumigaclavine C production in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The identity of metabolites encoded by the majority of nonribosomal peptide synthetases in the opportunistic pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, remains outstanding. We found that the nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthetases PesL and Pes1 were essential for fumigaclavine C biosynthesis, the end product of the complex ergot alkaloid (EA) pathway in A. fumigatus. Deletion of either pesL (ΔpesL) or pes1 (Δpes1) resulted in complete loss of fumigaclavine C biosynthesis, relatively increased production of fumitremorgins such as TR-2, fumitremorgin C and verruculogen, increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2), and increased sensitivity to the antifungals, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Deletion of pesL resulted in severely reduced virulence in an invertebrate infection model (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that NRP synthesis plays an essential role in mediating the final prenylation step of the EA pathway, despite the apparent absence of NRP synthetases in the proposed EA biosynthetic cluster for A. fumigatus. Liquid chromatography/diode array detection/mass spectrometry analysis also revealed the presence of fumiquinazolines A to F in both A. fumigatus wild-type and ΔpesL strains. This observation suggests that alternative NRP synthetases can also function in fumiquinazoline biosynthesis, since PesL has been shown to mediate fumiquinazoline biosynthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we provide here the first direct link between EA biosynthesis and virulence, in agreement with the observed toxicity associated with EA exposure. Finally, we demonstrate a possible cluster cross-talk phenomenon, a theme which is beginning to emerge in the literature.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Tasikamides via Pathway Coupling and Diazonium-Mediated Hydrazone Formation Abstract: Naturally occurring hydrazones are rare despite the ubiquitous usage of synthetic hydrazones in the preparation of organic compounds and functional materials. In this study, we discovered a family of novel microbial metabolites (tasikamides) that share a unique cyclic pentapeptide scaffold. Surprisingly, tasikamides A-C (1-3) contain a hydrazone group (C═N─N) that joins the cyclic peptide scaffold to an alkyl 5-hydroxylanthranilate (AHA) moiety. We discovered that the biosynthesis of 1-3 requires two discrete gene clusters, with one encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for assembling the cyclic peptide scaffold and another encoding the AHA-synthesizing pathway. The AHA gene cluster encodes three ancillary enzymes that catalyze the diazotization of AHA to yield an aryl diazonium species (diazo-AHA). The electrophilic diazo-AHA undergoes nonenzymatic Japp-Klingemann coupling with a β-keto aldehyde-containing cyclic peptide precursor to furnish the hydrazone group and yield 1-3. The studies together unraveled a novel mechanism whereby specialized metabolites are formed by the coupling of two biosynthetic pathways via an unprecedented in vivo Japp-Klingemann reaction. The findings raise the prospect of exploiting the arylamine-diazotizing enzymes (AAD) for the in vivo synthesis of aryl compounds and modification of biological macromolecules.	1
Abstract2class: Catalyst-free and site-specific one-pot dual-labeling of a protein directed by two genetically incorporated noncanonical amino acids Abstract: The genetic incorporation of one azide-containing and one keto-containing noncanonical amino acids into a protein at one amber and one ochre mutation sites respectively followed by their orthogonal reactions with one hydroxylamine-containing and one cyclooctyne-containing dyes allows highly efficient one-pot site-specific dual labeling of the protein in a catalyst-free fashion.	0
Abstract2class: Significance of oxygen transport through aquaporins Abstract: Aquaporins are membrane integral proteins responsible for the transmembrane transport of water and other small neutral molecules. Despite their well-acknowledged importance in water transport, their significance in gas transport processes remains unclear. Growing evidence points to the involvement of plant aquaporins in CO2 delivery for photosynthesis. The role of these channel proteins in the transport of O2 and other gases may also be more important than previously envisioned. In this study, we examined O2 permeability of various human, plant, and fungal aquaporins by co-expressing heterologous aquaporin and myoglobin in yeast. Two of the most promising O2-transporters (Homo sapiens AQP1 and Nicotiana tabacum PIP1;3) were confirmed to facilitate O2 transport in the spectrophotometric assay using yeast protoplasts. The over-expression of NtPIP1;3 in yeasts significantly increased their O2 uptake rates in suspension culture. In N. tabacum roots subjected to hypoxic hydroponic conditions, the transcript levels of the O2-transporting aquaporin NtPIP1;3 significantly increased after the seven-day hypoxia treatment, which was accompanied by the increase of ATP levels in the apical root segments. Our results suggest that the functional significance of aquaporin-mediated O2 transport and the possibility of controlling the rate of transmembrane O2 transport should be further explored.	0
Abstract2class: Refactoring the Concise Biosynthetic Pathway of Cyanogramide Unveils Spirooxindole Formation Catalyzed by a P450 Enzyme Abstract: Cyanogramide (1) from the marine actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6 features a unique spirooxindole skeleton and exhibits significant bioactivity to efficiently reverse drug resistance in tumor cells. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 in A. cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6 was identified and refactored by promoter engineering for heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor YF11, thereby enabling the production of 1 and five new derivatives. Interesting, four of them, including 1, were identified as enantiomeric mixtures in different ratios. The functions of tailoring enzymes, including two methyltransferases (CyaEF), and three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CyaGHI) were confirmed by gene inactivation and feeding experiments, leading to the elucidation of a concise biosynthetic pathway for 1. Notably, CyaH was biochemically verified to catalyze the formation of the spirooxindole skeleton in 1 through an unusual carbocation-mediated semipinacol-type rearrangement reaction.	1
Abstract2class: Genome- and MS-based mining of antibacterial chlorinated chromones and xanthones from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana strain 11134 Abstract: Halogen substituents are important for biological activity in many compounds. Genome-based mining of halogenase along with its biosynthetic gene cluster provided an efficient approach for the discovery of naturally occurring organohalogen compounds. Analysis of the genome sequence of a phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana 11134 revealed a polyketide gene cluster adjacent to a flavin-dependent halogenase capable of encoding halogenated polyketides, which are rarely reported in phytopathogenic fungi. Furthermore, MS- and UV-guided isolation and purification led to the identification of five chlorine-containing natural products together with seven other chromones and xanthones. Two of the chlorinated compounds and four chromones are new compounds. Their structures were elucidated by NMR spectroscopic analysis and HRESIMS data. The biosynthetic gene clusters of isolated compounds and their putative biosynthetic pathway are also proposed. One new chlorinated compound showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and three clinical-resistant S. aureus strains with a shared minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.5 μg/mL. Genome-based mining of halogenases combined with high-resolution MS- and UV-guided identification provides an efficient approach to discover new halogenated natural products from microorganisms.	1
Abstract2class: Orthogonal ubiquitin transfer through engineered E1-E2 cascades for protein ubiquitination Abstract: Protein modification by ubiquitin (UB) controls diverse cellular processes. UB is conjugated to cellular proteins by sequential transfer through an E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade. The cross-activities of 2 E1s, 50 E2s and thousands of E3s encoded by the human genome make it difficult to identify the substrate proteins of a specific E3 enzyme in the cell. One way to solve this problem is to engineer an orthogonal UB transfer (OUT) cascade in which the engineered UB (xUB) is relayed by engineered E1, E2 and E3 enzymes (xE1, xE2, xE3) to modify the substrate proteins of a specific E3. Here, we use phage display and mutagenesis to construct xUB-xE1 and xE1-xE2 pairs that are orthogonal to the native E1 and E2 enzymes. Our work on engineering the UB transfer cascades will enable us to use OUT to map the signal transduction networks mediated by protein ubiquitination.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a promising antiviral therapeutic target Abstract: The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has emerged as a pandemic of global concern. Considering its rapid transmission, WHO has declared public health emergency on 11th March 2020 worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically diverse positive sense RNA virus that typically exhibit high rates of mutation than DNA viruses. Higher rates of mutation bring higher genomic variability which may lead to viral evolution and enabling viruses to evade the pre-existing immunity of host and quickly acquire drug resistance properties. The objective of our study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates with those of Wuhan type virus. A total of 384 point mutations were detected from 488 sequence of the RdRp protein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome, out of which seven were used for subsequent study. Furthermore, prediction of secondary structure, protein modeling and its dynamics were performed which revealed that seven mutations (R118C, T148I, Y149C, E802A, Q822H, V880I and D893Y) significantly altered the stability and flexibility of RdRp protein. Present study was therefore, undertaken to analyze the variations occurring in RdRp due to multiple mutations leading to the alterations in the structure and function of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is essential for the replication /transcription of this virus and hence can be utilized as a promising therapeutic target to curb SARS-CoV-2 infections.	0
Abstract2class: Engineering anthracycline biosynthesis toward angucyclines Abstract: The biosynthesis pathways of two anthracyclines, nogalamycin and aclacinomycin, were directed toward angucyclines by using an angucycline-specific cyclase, pgaF, isolated from a silent antibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster. Addition of pgaF to a gene cassette that harbored the early biosynthesis genes of nogalamycin resulted in the production of two known angucyclinone metabolites, rabelomycin and its precursor, UWM6. Substrate flexibility of pgaF was demonstrated by replacement of the nogalamycin minimal polyketide synthase genes in the gene cassette with the equivalent aclacinomycin genes together with aknE2 and aknF, which specify the unusual propionate starter unit in aclacinomycin biosynthesis. This modification led to the production of a novel angucyclinone, MM2002, in which the expected ethyl side chain was incorporated into the fourth ring.	1
Abstract2class: Englerins: A Comprehensive Review Abstract: In the decade since the discovery of englerin A (1) and its potent activity in cancer models, this natural product and its analogues have been the subject of numerous chemical, biological, and preclinical studies by many research groups.

Abstract2class: ALDH2 mediates 5-nitrofuran activity in multiple species Abstract: Understanding how drugs work in vivo is critical for drug design and for maximizing the potential of currently available drugs. 5-nitrofurans are a class of prodrugs widely used to treat bacterial and trypanosome infections, but despite relative specificity, 5-nitrofurans often cause serious toxic side effects in people. Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment.	0
Abstract2class: In vivo biosynthesis of terpene nucleosides provides unique chemical markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Abstract: Although small molecules shed from pathogens are widely used to diagnose infection, such tests have not been widely implemented for tuberculosis. Here we show that the recently identified compound, 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), accumulates to comprise >1% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid. In vitro and in vivo, two isomers of TbAd were detected that might serve as infection markers. Using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we established the structure of the previously unknown molecule, N(6)-tuberculosinyladenosine (N(6)-TbAd). Its biosynthesis involves enzymatic production of 1-TbAd by Rv3378c followed by conversion to N(6)-TbAd via the Dimroth rearrangement. Intact biosynthetic genes are observed only within M. tuberculosis complex bacteria, and TbAd was not detected among other medically important pathogens, environmental bacteria, and vaccine strains. With no substantially similar known molecules in nature, the discovery and in vivo detection of two abundant terpene nucleosides support their development as specific diagnostic markers of tuberculosis.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Fluorinated Natural Product Nucleocidin in Streptomyces calvus Is Dependent on the bldA-Specified Leu-tRNA(UUA) Molecule Abstract: Nucleocidin is one of the very few natural products known to contain fluorine. Mysteriously, the nucleocidin producer Streptomyces calvus ATCC 13382 has not been observed to synthesize the compound since its discovery in 1956. Here, we report that complementation of S. calvus ATCC 13382 with a functional bldA-encoded Leu-tRNA(UUA) molecule restores the production of nucleocidin. Nucleocidin was detected in culture extracts by (19) F NMR spectroscopy, HPLC-ESI-MS, and HPLC-continuum source molecular absorption spectroscopy for fluorine-specific detection. The molecule was purified from a large-scale culture and definitively characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution MS. The nucleocidin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by the presence of genes encoding the 5'-O-sulfamate moiety and confirmed by gene disruption. Two of the genes within the nucleocidin biosynthetic gene cluster contain TTA codons, thus explaining the dependence on bldA and resolving a 60-year-old mystery.	1
Abstract2class: A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase is integrated in DIMBOA-biosynthesis Abstract: Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites of grasses that function as natural pesticides. While many steps of DIMBOA biosynthesis have been elucidated, the mechanism of the introduction of OCH(3)-group at the C-7 position was unknown. Inhibitor experiments in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays suggest that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalyses the hydroxylation reaction at C-7. Cloning and reverse genetics analysis have identified the Bx6 gene that encodes this enzyme. Bx6 is located in the Bx-gene cluster of maize.	1
Abstract2class: Effect of calcium, magnesium, and zinc on ticarcillin and tobramycin alone and in combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Correlation between in vitro and in vivo test results for synergy between carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is poor. Although the divalent cation content of culture media is known to affect aminoglycoside susceptibility testing for P. aeruginosa, this effect of divalent cations has not been examined for synergy testing of carboxypenicillin-aminoglycoside interaction against P. aeruginosa. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tobramycin and ticarcillin and the interaction of these drugs in combination were studied by a microtitration method for 36 strains of P. aeruginosa in Mueller-Hinton broth with varying supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. The supplementation of Mueller-Hinton broth to 50 or 100 mg of calcium per liter had a significant effect in increasing the tobramycin MIC (P less than 0.01), as well as decreasing the degree of synergy between ticarcillin and tobramycin (P less than 0.01). Supplementation to 20 mg of magnesium per liter, 1.0 mg of zinc per liter, or both did not significantly affect tobramycin MIC or the interaction of tobramycin and ticarcillin. Supplementation to 50 or 100 mg of calcium per liter rendered any additional effect of magnesium and zinc on aminoglycoside MIC and aminoglycoside-carboxypenicillin interaction negligible. If these results for ticarcillin and tobramycin are confirmed for other carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides, then the Mueller-Hinton broth used for P. aeruginosa aminoglycoside susceptibility and synergy testing may need to be supplemented only with calcium at a concentration of 50 mg/liter.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and characterization of the ergochrome gene cluster in the plant pathogenic fungus Claviceps purpurea Abstract: Background:          Claviceps purpurea is a phytopathogenic fungus infecting a broad range of grasses including economically important cereal crop plants. The infection cycle ends with the formation of the typical purple-black pigmented sclerotia containing the toxic ergot alkaloids. Besides these ergot alkaloids little is known about the secondary metabolism of the fungus. Red anthraquinone derivatives and yellow xanthone dimers (ergochromes) have been isolated from sclerotia and described as ergot pigments, but the corresponding gene cluster has remained unknown. Fungal pigments gain increasing interest for example as environmentally friendly alternatives to existing dyes. Furthermore, several pigments show biological activities and may have some pharmaceutical value.                  Results:                       This study identified the gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of the ergot pigments. Overexpression of the cluster-specific transcription factor led to activation of the gene cluster and to the production of several known ergot pigments. Knock out of the cluster key enzyme, a nonreducing polyketide synthase, clearly showed that this cluster is responsible for the production of red anthraquinones as well as yellow ergochromes. Furthermore, a tentative biosynthetic pathway for the ergot pigments is proposed. By changing the culture conditions, pigment production was activated in axenic culture so that high concentration of phosphate and low concentration of sucrose induced pigment syntheses.                  Conclusions:                       This is the first functional analysis of a secondary metabolite gene cluster in the ergot fungus besides that for the classical ergot alkaloids. We demonstrated that this gene cluster is responsible for the typical purple-black color of the ergot sclerotia and showed that the red and yellow ergot pigments are products of the same biosynthetic pathway. Activation of the gene cluster in axenic culture opened up new possibilities for biotechnological applications like the dye production or the development of new pharmaceuticals.	1
Abstract2class: Enrichment of dibenzofuran utilizing bacteria with high co-metabolic potential towards dibenzodioxin and other anellated aromatics Abstract: Dibenzofuran degrading bacteria were enriched from various environmental sources. A mutualistic mixed culture of strain DPO 220 and strain DPO 230 was characterized. Strain DPO 220 alone showed limited growth with dibenzofuran as sole source of carbon and energy (td greater than or equal to 4.5 h). A labile degradation product, C12H10O5, and salicylate were isolated from the culture fluid. Salicylate was found to be a central intermediate of DBF-degradation. Strain DPO 220 co-metabolized a wide range of anellated aromatics as well as heteroaromatics. High rates of co-oxidation of dibenzodioxin demonstrate analogue-enrichment to be a powerful technique for selecting enzymatic activities for otherwise non-degradable substrates.	0
Abstract2class: Microbe Profile: Euglena gracilis: photogenic, flexible and hardy Abstract: Euglena gracilis is a unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotic flagellate of the Discoba supergroup, which also encompasses Kinetoplastida and Diplonema. Plastids have green algal origin and are secondarily acquired. The nuclear genome is extremely large and many genes suggest multiple endosymbiotic/gene transfer events, i.e. derivation from prokaryotes of various lineages. E. gracilis is remarkably robust and can proliferate in environments contaminated with heavy metals and acids. Extraordinary metabolic plasticity and a mixotrophic lifestyle confers an ability to thrive in a broad range of environments, as well as facilitating production of many novel metabolites, making Euglena of considerable biotechnological importance.	0
Abstract2class: Biological activity of cadeguomycin. Inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, immunostimulation, and potentiation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine Abstract: Cadeguomycin retarded growth of sc solid IMC carcinoma in CDF1 mice, and pulmonary metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BL/6 mice. The antibiotic enhanced phagocytic activity of murine peritoneal macrophages and IL-1 production by P388D1 cells. Delayed type hypersensitivity was stimulated and interferon was induced by the drug. The results suggest that cadeguomycin inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in association with modification of the immune system. The cytotoxicity of arabinosylcytosine to K562 and YAC-1 cells was markedly enhanced by cadeguomycin in culture. The combined administration of arabinosylcytosine and cadeguomycin displayed potentiation in the inhibition of growth of ip-implanted P388 leukemia and metastasis of sc-implanted P388 leukemia to the regional lymph nodes. Cadeguomycin showed low toxicity for mice.	0
Abstract2class: Ustilago maydis produces itaconic acid via the unusual intermediate trans-aconitate Abstract: Itaconic acid is an important biomass-derived chemical building block but has also recently been identified as a metabolite produced in mammals, which has antimicrobial activity. The biosynthetic pathway of itaconic acid has been elucidated in the ascomycetous fungus Aspergillus terreus and in human macrophages. In both organisms itaconic acid is generated by decarboxylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. Here, we show that the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis uses an alternative pathway and produces itaconic acid via trans-aconitate, the thermodynamically favoured isomer of cis-aconitate. We have identified a gene cluster that contains all genes involved in itaconic acid formation. Trans-aconitate is generated from cis-aconitate by a cytosolic aconitate-Δ-isomerase (Adi1) that belongs to the PrpF family of proteins involved in bacterial propionate degradation. Decarboxylation of trans-aconitate is catalyzed by a novel enzyme, trans-aconitate decarboxylase (Tad1). Tad1 displays significant sequence similarity with bacterial 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes (CMLE). This suggests that U. maydis has evolved an alternative biosynthetic pathway for itaconate production using the toxic intermediate trans-aconitate. Overexpression of a pathway-specific transcription factor (Ria1) or a mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid transporter (Mtt1) resulted in a twofold increase in itaconate yield. Therefore, our findings offer new strategies for biotechnological production of this valuable biomass-derived chemical.	1
Abstract2class: Metabolic diversity in myxobacteria: identification of the myxalamid and the stigmatellin biosynthetic gene cluster of Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 and a combined polyketide-(poly)peptide gene cluster from the epothilone producing strain Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 Abstract: Myxobacterial strains producing polyketides (PKs) assumed to be biosynthesized by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) were analysed. Myxobacteria also produce a variety of polypeptides (PP) and PKs with incorporated amino acids ('mixed PK-PP'). In order to be able to identify the biosynthetic gene clusters for these metabolites a PCR based approach has been developed to clone ketosynthase (KS) domains of PKS genes from these organisms. Conserved regions of peptide synthetases of the non-ribosomal type (NRPS) were also amplified via PCR. KS fragments from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 were used for chromosomal gene inactivation experiments resulting in a series of mutants including such that were unable to produce stigmatellins and myxalamids. A NRPS fragment and PKS fragments from Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 were used to identify cosmids hybridizing with both types of probes from a genomic library. Both a NRPS and a PKS fragment were cloned and sequenced from a relatively short restriction fragment of one of these cosmids. The method described here should be very useful to clone and identify PKS, NRPS and mixed PKS-NRPS from myxobacteria in general and thereby open opportunities to use the biochemical diversity of these bacteria for genetic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Conformational switching in the fungal light sensor Vivid Abstract: The Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid tunes blue-light responses and modulates gating of the circadian clock. Crystal structures of dark-state and light-state Vivid reveal a light, oxygen, or voltage Per-Arnt-Sim domain with an unusual N-terminal cap region and a loop insertion that accommodates the flavin cofactor. Photoinduced formation of a cystein-flavin adduct drives flavin protonation to induce an N-terminal conformational change. A cysteine-to-serine substitution remote from the flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site decouples conformational switching from the flavin photocycle and prevents Vivid from sending signals in Neurospora. Key elements of this activation mechanism are conserved by other photosensors such as White Collar-1, ZEITLUPE, ENVOY, and flavin-binding, kelch repeat, F-BOX 1 (FKF1).	0
Abstract2class: Uncovering the unusual D-ring construction in terretonin biosynthesis by collaboration of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 and a unique isomerase Abstract: Terretonin (1) is a fungal meroterpenoid isolated from Aspergillus terreus, and possesses a highly oxygenated and unique tetracyclic structure. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1 has been identified and the biosynthesis has recently been studied by heterologous reconstitution and targeted-gene deletion experiments, the last few steps of the terretonin pathway after terrenoid (6) have yet to be elucidated. Notably, the mechanism for the D-ring expansion to afford the terretonin scaffold has been a long-standing mystery to solve. Here we report the characterization of three enzymes that convert 6 into 1, as well as the complete biosynthetic pathway of 1. In the proposed terretonin pathway, the cytochrome P450 Trt6 catalyzes three successive oxidations to transform 6 into an unstable intermediate, which then undergoes the D-ring expansion and unusual rearrangement of the methoxy group to afford the core skeleton of 1. This unprecedented rearrangement is catalyzed by a novel isomerase Trt14. Finally, the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase Trt7 accomplishes the last two oxidation reactions steps to complete the biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Total Synthesis of (+)-Arborisidine Abstract: The first total synthesis of arborisidine, a unique Kopsia indole alkaloid possessing a fully substituted cyclohexanone ring system with two quaternary carbons, has been achieved in seven steps in racemic format from tryptamine and in nine steps in asymmetric format from d-tryptophan methyl ester. Key elements of the design include a carefully orchestrated decyanation protocol to finalize the asymmetric formation of an aza-quaternary center that is challenging to access in optically active format via direct Pictet-Spengler cyclizations with tryptamine, a metal-promoted 6- endo-dig cyclization of an enyne to establish the second core quaternary center, and regiospecific functionalizations of the resultant complex diene to finalize the target structure. The distinct and efficient nature of the developed solution is highlighted by several unsuccessful approaches and unexpected rearrangements.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6-5-3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl-CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl-CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme-encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.	1
Abstract2class: Chemoproteomic Strategy to Quantitatively Monitor Transnitrosation Uncovers Functionally Relevant S-Nitrosation Sites on Cathepsin D and HADH2 Abstract: S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous transnitrosation donor involved in S-nitrosation of a variety of cellular proteins, thereby regulating diverse protein functions. Quantitative proteomic methods are necessary to establish which cysteine residues are most sensitive to GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Here, a competitive cysteine-reactivity profiling strategy was implemented to quantitatively measure the sensitivity of >600 cysteine residues to transnitrosation by GSNO. This platform identified a subset of cysteine residues with a high propensity for GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Functional characterization of previously unannotated S-nitrosation sites revealed that S-nitrosation of a cysteine residue distal to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2) active site impaired catalytic activity. Similarly, S-nitrosation of a non-catalytic cysteine residue in the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin D (CTSD) inhibited proteolytic activation. Together, these studies revealed two previously uncharacterized cysteine residues that regulate protein function, and established a chemical-proteomic platform with capabilities to determine substrate specificity of other cellular transnitrosation agents.	0
Abstract2class: Rapid evaluation of the substrate specificity of 3-nitrobenzoic acid dioxygenase MnbAB via colorimetric detection using Saltzman reagent Abstract: Nitroaromatic compounds are essential materials for chemical industry, but they are also potentially toxic environmental pollutants. Therefore, their sensitive detection and degradation are important concerns. The microbial degradation pathways of nitroaromatic compounds have been studied in detail, but their usefulness needs to be evaluated to understand their potential applications in bioremediation. Here, we developed a rapid and relatively sensitive assay system to evaluate the activities and substrate specificities of nitroaromatic dioxygenases involved in the oxidative biodegradation of nitroaromatic compounds. In this system, nitrous acid, which was released from the nitroaromatic compounds by the dioxygenases, was detected and quantified using the Saltzman reagent. Escherichia coli producing the 3-nitrobenzoic acid dioxygenase complex MnbAB from Comamonas sp. JS46 clearly showed the apparent substrate specificity of MnbAB as follows. MnbAB accepted not only 3-nitrobenzoic acid but also several other p- and m-nitrobenzoic acid derivatives as substrates, although it much preferred 3-nitrobenzoic acid to others. Furthermore, the presence of a hydroxy or an amino group at the ortho position of the nitro group decreased the activity of MnbAB. In addition, MnbAB accepted 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetic acid as a substrate, which has one additional methylene group between the aromatic ring and the carboxy group of 3-nitrobenzoic acid. This is the first report about the detailed substrate specificity of MnbAB. Our system can be used for other nitroaromatic dioxygenases and contribute to their characterization.	0
Abstract2class: Genetic, molecular, and biochemical basis of fungal tropolone biosynthesis Abstract: A gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the fungal tropolone stipitatic acid was discovered in Talaromyces stipitatus (Penicillium stipitatum) and investigated by targeted gene knockout. A minimum of three genes are required to form the tropolone nucleus: tropA encodes a nonreducing polyketide synthase which releases 3-methylorcinaldehyde; tropB encodes a FAD-dependent monooxygenase which dearomatizes 3-methylorcinaldehyde via hydroxylation at C-3; and tropC encodes a non-heme Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase which catalyzes the oxidative ring expansion to the tropolone nucleus via hydroxylation of the 3-methyl group. The tropA gene was characterized by heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae, whereas tropB and tropC were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified TropB and TropC proteins converted 3-methylorcinaldehyde to a tropolone in vitro. Finally, knockout of the tropD gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, indicated its place as the next gene in the pathway, probably responsible for hydroxylation of the 6-methyl group. Comparison of the T. stipitatus tropolone biosynthetic cluster with other known gene clusters allows clarification of important steps during the biosynthesis of other fungal compounds including the xenovulenes, citrinin, sepedonin, sclerotiorin, and asperfuranone.	1
Abstract2class: An endopolygalacturonase from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum induces calcium-mediated signaling and programmed cell death in soybean cells Abstract: A basic endopolygalacturonase (PG) isoform, produced early by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum when infecting soybean seedlings, was used to examine the signaling role of the enzyme in aequorin-expressing soybean cells. A cytosolic Ca2+ elevation was induced, with a rapid increase (phase 1) and a very slow decrease (phase 2) of Ca2+ concentration, indicating the involvement of Ca2+ ions in PG signaling. Within 1 h of PG-cell contact a remarkable level of cell death was recorded, significantly higher than the control cell culture turnover. The observed morphological and biochemical changes were indicative of the activation of programmed cell death; in particular, cytochrome c release in the cytoplasm and activation of both caspase 9-like and caspase 3-like proteases were found. When a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) and the PG were simultaneously applied to cells, both the Ca2+ increase and cell death were annulled. The possible roles of prolonged sustained cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in inducing cell death and of the PG-PGIP interaction in preventing PG signaling are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Zwittermicin A biosynthetic cluster Abstract: The goal of this study was to identify the biosynthetic cluster for zwittermicin A, a novel, broad spectrum, aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus. The nucleotide sequence of 2.7kb of DNA flanking the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, from B. cereus UW85 revealed three open reading frames (ORFs). Of these ORFs, two had sequence similarity to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and polyketide synthases, respectively. Insertional inactivation demonstrated that orf2 is necessary for zwittermicin A production and that zmaR is necessary for high-level resistance to zwittermicin A but is not required for zwittermicin A production. Expression of ZmaR was temporally associated with zwittermicin A production. The results suggest that zmaR is part of a cluster of genes that is involved in zwittermicin A biosynthesis, representing the first biosynthetic pathway for an aminopolyol antibiotic.	1
Abstract2class: Prediction of RNA binding proteins comes of age from low resolution to high resolution Abstract: Networks of protein-RNA interactions is likely to be larger than protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction networks because RNA transcripts are encoded tens of times more than proteins (e.g. only 3% of human genome coded for proteins), have diverse function and localization, and are controlled by proteins from birth (transcription) to death (degradation). This massive network is evidenced by several recent experimental discoveries of large numbers of previously unknown RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Meanwhile, more than 400 non-redundant protein-RNA complex structures (at 25% sequence identity or less) have been deposited into the protein databank. These sequences and structural resources for RBPs provide ample data for the development of computational techniques dedicated to RBP prediction, as experimentally determining RNA-binding functions is time-consuming and expensive. This review compares traditional machine-learning based approaches with emerging template-based methods at several levels of prediction resolution ranging from two-state binding/non-binding prediction, to binding residue prediction and protein-RNA complex structure prediction. The analysis indicates that the two approaches are complementary and their combinations may lead to further improvements.	0
Abstract2class: FUM9 is required for C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and complements the meitotically defined Fum3 locus in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Deletion of the Gibberella moniliformis FUM9 gene resulted in mutants that produce only fumonisins that lack a C-5 hydroxyl group. This phenotype is identical to that of previously described mutants with defective alleles at the meiotically defined Fum3 locus. Transformation with a wild-type FUM9 gene into a Fum3-defective mutant restored wild-type fumonisin production. These results indicate that the FUM9 protein catalyzes the C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and that FUM9 and the Fum3 locus are the same gene.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. 307-9 Abstract: The structurally intriguing bicyclic ketal moiety of tirandamycin is common to several acyl-tetramic acid antibiotics, and is a key determinant of biological activity. We have identified the tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from the environmental marine isolate Streptomyces sp. 307-9, thus providing the first genetic insight into the biosynthesis of this natural product scaffold. Sequence analysis revealed a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster with a colinear domain organization, which is entirely consistent with the core structure of the tirandamycins. We also identified genes within the cluster that encode candidate tailoring enzymes for elaboration and modification of the bicyclic ketal system. Disruption of tamI, which encodes a presumed cytochrome P450, led to a mutant strain deficient in production of late stage tirandamycins that instead accumulated tirandamycin C, an intermediate devoid of any post assembly-line oxidative modifications.	1
Abstract2class: Bioorthogonal dissection of the replicase assembly of hepatitis C virus Abstract: Positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), flaviviruses, and coronaviruses are medically important. Assembly of replicase on host membranes is a conserved replication strategy and an attractive antiviral target. The mechanisms of replicase assembly are largely unknown, due to the technical difficulties in purifying the replicase and carrying out structural studies. Here, with an HCV replicase assembly surrogate system, we employed a bioorthogonal system to introduce the photolabile unnatural amino into each residue in the cytosolic regions of NS4B and the amphipathic helix (AH) of NS5A. Photocrosslinking enabled visualization of NS4B oligomerization and NS5A dimerization at pinpointed interacting residues and identifying contacting sites among the replicase components. Characterization of the interacting sites revealed hub elements in replicase assembly by docking replicase components to prompt protein-protein interactions. The results provide information about the molecular architecture of the replicase, advancing understanding of the mechanism of replicase assembly.	0
Abstract2class: Thioesterase-mediated side chain transesterification generates potent Gq signaling inhibitor FR900359 Abstract: The potent and selective Gq protein inhibitor depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), originally discovered as the product of an uncultivable plant endosymbiont, is synthesized by a complex biosynthetic system comprising two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we characterize a cultivable bacterial FR producer, enabling detailed investigations into biosynthesis and attachment of the functionally important FR side chain. We reconstitute side chain assembly by the monomodular NRPS FrsA and the non-heme monooxygenase FrsH, and characterize intermolecular side chain transesterification to the final macrocyclic intermediate FR-Core, mediated by the FrsA thioesterase domain. We harness FrsA substrate promiscuity to generate FR analogs with altered side chains and demonstrate indispensability of the FR side chain for efficient Gq inhibition by comparative bioactivity, toxicity and docking studies. Finally, evolution of FR and side chain biosynthesis is discussed based on bioinformatics analyses. Side chain transesterification boosts potency and target affinity of selective Gq inhibitor natural products.	1
Abstract2class: The determinants of activity and specificity in actinorhodin type II polyketide ketoreductase Abstract: In the actinorhodin type II polyketide synthase, the first polyketide modification is a regiospecific C9-carbonyl reduction, catalyzed by the ketoreductase (actKR). Our previous studies identified the actKR 94-PGG-96 motif as a determinant of stereospecificity. The molecular basis for reduction regiospecificity is, however, not well understood. In this study, we examined the activities of 20 actKR mutants through a combination of kinetic studies, PKS reconstitution, and structural analyses. Residues have been identified that are necessary for substrate interaction, and these observations have suggested a structural model for this reaction. Polyketides dock at the KR surface and are steered into the enzyme pocket where C7-C12 cyclization is mediated by the KR before C9-ketoreduction can occur. These molecular features can potentially serve as engineering targets for the biosynthesis of novel, reduced polyketides.	1
Abstract2class: Cardiac glycosides are potent inhibitors of interferon-β gene expression Abstract: Here we report that bufalin and other cardiac glycoside inhibitors of the sodium-potassium ATPase (sodium pump) potently inhibit the induction of the interferon-β (IFNβ) gene by virus, double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA. Cardiac glycosides increase the intracellular sodium concentration, which appears to inhibit the ATPase activity of the RNA sensor RIG-I, an essential and early component in the IFNβ activation pathway. This, in turn, prevents the activation of the critical transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB. Bufalin inhibition can be overcome by expressing a drug-resistant variant of the sodium pump and knocking down the pump by short hairpin RNA inhibits IFNβ expression. Thus, bufalin acts exclusively through the sodium pump. We also show that bufalin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, at least in part by interfering with the nuclear translocation of NFκB. These findings suggest that bufalin could be used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in which IFN or TNF are hyperactivated.	0
Abstract2class: Sequencing and analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of a vancomycin group antibiotic Abstract: Background:                       The emergence of resistance to vancomycin, the drug of choice against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in enterococci has increased the need for new antibiotics. As chemical modification of the antibiotic structure is not trivial, we have initiated studies towards enzymatic modification by sequencing the DNA coding for the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin (also known as A82846B and LY264826).                  Results:                       Analysis of 72 kilobases of genomic DNA from Amycolatopsis orientalis, the organism that produces chloroeremomycin, revealed the presence of 39 putative genes, including those coding for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. Translation and subsequent comparison with known proteins in public databases identified enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the heptapeptide backbone and 4-epi-vancosamine, as well as those for chlorination and oxidation reactions involved in the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin.                  Conclusions:                       The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin have been identified, and selective expression of these genes could lead to the synthesis of new potent glycopeptide antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Functional characterization of ttmM unveils new tautomycin analogs and insight into tautomycin biosynthesis and activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycin (TTM), a potent protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor has recently been characterized. Inactivation of ttmM, which encodes a putative C3' hydroxylase, afforded mutant SB6005 which accumulated three new 3'-deshydroxy TTM analogs, supporting the function of TtmM and the previously proposed linear pathway for TTM biosynthesis. Bioassays reveal the importance of the C3' OH moiety in PP inhibition and that PP inhibition is not the exclusive mechanism driving TTM-induced cell death.	1
Abstract2class: Stelleralides D-J and Anti-HIV Daphnane Diterpenes from Stellera chamaejasme Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of a petroleum ether extract of the roots of Stellera chamaejasme led to the isolation of seven new (stelleralides D-J, 1-7) and 12 known (8-19) daphnane diterpenoids. The structures and relative configurations of 1-7 were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including HRESIMS and comprehensive NMR techniques. All isolates were evaluated for anti-HIV activity in MT4 cells. All compounds tested, except 2, showed anti-HIV activity, and, especially, five 1α-alkyldaphnane diterpenoids (3, 4, 5, 10, and 11) exhibited extremely potent anti-HIV activity, with EC50 values of 0.06-1.1 nM and selectivity index values of more than 10,000.	0
Abstract2class: Production of hybrid anthracycline antibiotics by heterologous expression of Streptomyces nogalater nogalamycin biosynthesis genes Abstract: A cluster of anthracycline biosynthetic genes isolated from Streptomyces nogalater was expressed in Streptomyces lividans and in Streptomyces galilaeus. A 12 kb DNA fragment cloned from this cluster in pIJ486 caused the production of a novel compound when introduced into S. lividans. The compound is derived from nogalonic acid methyl ester, an early intermediate in nogalamycin biosynthesis. Complementation with the cloned 12 kb fragment of S. galilaeus mutants blocked in aclacinomycin biosynthesis caused the production of hybrid anthracyclines. Cloning of the nogalamycin gene cluster should make possible a detailed study of the biosynthesis of this interesting antibiotic, as well as the production of novel anthracyclines of potential value as cytostatic drugs.	1
Abstract2class: Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: In deoxyribonucleic acid of Rhizobium trifolii centrifuged in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium was found a sattelite peak containing covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid.

Abstract2class: Multidomain structure and cellulosomal localization of the Clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase CbhA Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum F7 cbhA gene, coding for the cellobiohydrolase CbhA, has been determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 1,230 amino acids was identified. Removal of a putative signal peptide yields a mature protein of 1,203 amino acids with a molecular weight of 135,139. Sequence analysis of CbhA reveals a multidomain structure of unusual complexity consisting of an N-terminal cellulose binding domain (CBD) homologous to CBD family IV, an immunoglobulin-like beta-barrel domain, a catalytic domain homologous to cellulase family E1, a duplicated domain similar to fibronectin type III (Fn3) modules, a CBD homologous to family III, a highly acidic linker region, and a C-terminal dockerin domain. The cellulosomal localization of CbhA was confirmed by Western blot analysis employing polyclonal antibodies raised against a truncated enzymatically active version of CbhA. CbhA was identified as cellulosomal subunit S3 by partial amino acid sequence analysis. Comparison of the multidomain structures indicates striking similarities between CbhA and a group of cellulases from actinomycetes. Average linkage cluster analysis suggests a coevolution of the N-terminal CBD and the catalytic domain and its spread by horizontal gene transfer among gram-positive cellulolytic bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Methyltransferase genes in Streptomyces rishiriensis: new coumermycin derivatives from gene-inactivation experiments Abstract: The coumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) contains at least eight methyl groups, presumably derived from S-adenosylmethionine. Two putative methyltransferase genes, couO and couP, of the coumermycin A(1) biosynthetic gene cluster were inactivated by in-frame deletion. In the resulting mutants, coumermycin A(1) production was abolished. New coumermycin derivatives were accumulated instead, and were identified by HPLC-MS using selected reaction monitoring via electrospray ionization. couO mutants accumulated a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at C-8 of the characteristic aminocoumarin rings, whereas in the couP mutant a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at the 4-hydroxyl groups of the two deoxysugar moieties was identified. These results provided evidence that couO encodes a C-methyltransferase responsible for the transfer of a methyl group to C-8 of the aminocoumarin ring, and couP an O-methyltransferase for methylation of 4-OH of the sugar in the biosynthesis of coumermycin A(1), respectively. C-methylation of the aminocoumarin ring is considered as an early step of coumermycin biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the intermediates with the non-methylated aminocoumarin ring were accepted by the enzymes catalysing the subsequent steps of the pathway. The new, demethylated secondary metabolites were produced in an amount at least as high as that of coumermycin A(1) in the wild-type.	1
Abstract2class: A pathway-specific transcriptional activator regulates late steps of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A Streptomyces clavuligerus gene (designated claR) located downstream from the gene encoding clavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster is involved in regulation of the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Nucleotide sequence analysis and database searching of ClaR identified a significant similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif (HTH) region of LysR transcriptional regulators. A gene replacement mutant disrupted in claR was unable to produce clavulanic acid, suggesting that claR is essential for clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the accumulation of clavaminic acid in the claR mutant suggested that ClaR regulates the late steps in the clavulanic acid pathway, i.e. those involved in the conversion of clavaminic acid to clavulanic acid. Transcriptional analysis using RNA isolated from the wild type and the claR mutant showed that the expression of the putative late genes, but not the early genes, was regulated by ClaR. High-resolution S1 nuclease analysis of claR suggested that it is expressed as a monocistronic transcript and also as a bicistronic transcript along with the late gene orf-9. The transcription start site of the monocistronic claR transcript was identified as a C residue 155 nucleotides upstream from the claR start codon.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of a new source of rifamycin antibiotics in marine sponge actinobacteria by phylogenetic prediction Abstract: Phylogenetic analysis of the ketosynthase (KS) gene sequences of marine sponge-derived Salinispora strains of actinobacteria indicated that the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene sequence most closely related to that of Salinispora was the rifamycin B synthase of Amycolatopsis mediterranei. This result was not expected from taxonomic species tree phylogenetics using 16S rRNA sequences. From the PKS sequence data generated from our sponge-derived Salinispora strains, we predicted that such strains might synthesize rifamycin-like compounds. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis was applied to one sponge-derived Salinispora strain to test the hypothesis of rifamycin synthesis. The analysis reported here demonstrates that this Salinispora isolate does produce compounds of the rifamycin class, including rifamycin B and rifamycin SV. A rifamycin-specific KS primer set was designed, and that primer set increased the number of rifamycin-positive strains detected by PCR screening relative to the number detectable using a conserved KS-specific set. Thus, the Salinispora group of actinobacteria represents a potential new source of rifamycins outside the genus Amycolatopsis and the first recorded source of rifamycins from marine bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery and in vitro biosynthesis of haloduracin, a two-component lantibiotic Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptides that undergo posttranslational modifications to their mature, antimicrobial form. They are characterized by the unique amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, introduced by means of dehydration of Ser/Thr residues followed by reaction of the resulting dehydro amino acids with cysteines to form thioether linkages. Two-component lantibiotics use two peptides that are each posttranslationally modified to yield two functionally distinct products that act in synergy to provide bactericidal activity. By using genetic data instead of isolation, a two-component lantibiotic, haloduracin, was identified in the genome of the Gram-positive alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans C-125. We show that heterologously expressed and purified precursor peptides HalA1 and HalA2 are processed by the purified modification enzymes HalM1 and HalM2 in an in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of a two-component lantibiotic. The activity of each HalM enzyme is substrate-specific, and the assay products exhibit antimicrobial activity after removal of their leader sequences at an engineered Factor Xa cleavage site, indicating that correct thioether formation has occurred. Haloduracin's biological activity depends on the presence of both modified peptides. The structures of the two mature haloduracin peptides Halalpha and Halbeta were investigated, indicating that they have similarities as well as some distinct differences compared with other two-component lantibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: Primary and secondary metabolism, and post-translational protein modifications, as portrayed by proteomic analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The newly sequenced genome of Streptomyces coelicolor is estimated to encode 7825 theoretical proteins. We have mapped approximately 10% of the theoretical proteome experimentally using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Products from 770 different genes were identified, and the types of proteins represented are discussed in terms of their annotated functional classes. An average of 1.2 proteins per gene was observed, indicating extensive post-translational regulation. Examples of modification by N-acetylation, adenylylation and proteolytic processing were characterized using mass spectrometry. Proteins from both primary and certain secondary metabolic pathways are strongly represented on the map, and a number of these enzymes were identified at more than one two-dimensional gel location. Post-translational modification mechanisms may therefore play a significant role in the regulation of these pathways. Unexpectedly, one of the enzymes for synthesis of the actinorhodin polyketide antibiotic appears to be located outside the cytoplasmic compartment, within the cell wall matrix. Of 20 gene clusters encoding enzymes characteristic of secondary metabolism, eight are represented on the proteome map, including three that specify the production of novel metabolites. This information will be valuable in the characterization of the new metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of functionally clustered nystatin-like biosynthetic genes in a rare actinomycetes, Pseudonocardia autotrophica Abstract: The polyene antibiotics, including nystatin, pimaricin, amphotericin, and candicidin, comprise a family of very valuable antifungal polyketide compounds, and they are typically produced by soil actinomycetes. Previously, using a polyene cytochrome P450 hydroxylase-specific genome screening strategy, Pseudonocardia autotrophica KCTC9441 was determined to contain genes potentially encoding polyene biosynthesis. Here, sequence information of an approximately 125.7-kb contiguous DNA region in five overlapping cosmids isolated from the P. autotrophica KCTC9441 genomic library revealed a total of 23 open reading frames, which are presumably involved in the biosynthesis of a nystatin-like compound tentatively named NPP. The deduced roles for six multi-modular polyketide synthase (PKS) catalytic domains were found to be highly homologous to those of previously identified nystatin biosynthetic genes. Low NPP productivity suggests that the functionally clustered NPP biosynthetic pathway genes are tightly regulated in P. autotrophica. Disruption of a NPP PKS gene completely abolished both NPP biosynthesis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, suggesting that polyene-specific genome screening may constitute an efficient method for isolation of potentially valuable previously identified polyene genes and compounds from various rare actinomycetes widespread in nature.	1
Abstract2class: Bioinformatic Mapping of Radical S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-Translationally Modified Peptides Identifies New Cα, Cβ, and Cγ-Linked Thioether-Containing Peptides Abstract: Recently developed bioinformatic tools have bolstered the discovery of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Using an improved version of Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online (RODEO 2.0), a biosynthetic gene cluster mining algorithm, we bioinformatically mapped the sactipeptide RiPP class via the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that form the characteristic sactionine (sulfur-to-α carbon) cross-links between cysteine and acceptor residues. Hundreds of new sactipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters were uncovered, and a novel sactipeptide "huazacin" with growth-suppressive activity against Listeria monocytogenes was characterized. Bioinformatic analysis further suggested that a group of sactipeptide-like peptides heretofore referred to as six cysteines in forty-five residues (SCIFFs) might not be sactipeptides as previously thought. Indeed, the bioinformatically identified SCIFF peptide "freyrasin" was demonstrated to contain six thioethers linking the β carbons of six aspartate residues. Another SCIFF, thermocellin, was shown to contain a thioether cross-linked to the γ carbon of threonine. SCIFFs feature a different paradigm of non-α carbon thioether linkages, and they are exclusively formed by radical SAM enzymes, as opposed to the polar chemistry employed during lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Therefore, we propose the renaming of the SCIFF family as radical non-α thioether peptides (ranthipeptides) to better distinguish them from the sactipeptide and lanthipeptide RiPP classes.	1
Abstract2class: Structural and functional insight into an unexpectedly selective N-methyltransferase involved in plantazolicin biosynthesis Abstract: Plantazolicin (PZN), a polyheterocyclic, N(α),N(α)-dimethylarginine-containing antibiotic, harbors remarkably specific bactericidal activity toward strains of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase from the PZN biosynthetic gene cluster results in the formation of desmethylPZN, which is devoid of antibiotic activity. Here we describe the in vitro reconstitution, mutational analysis, and X-ray crystallographic structure of the PZN methyltransferase. Unlike all other known small molecule methyltransferases, which act upon diverse substrates in vitro, the PZN methyltransferase is uncharacteristically limited in substrate scope and functions only on desmethylPZN and close derivatives. The crystal structures of two related PZN methyltransferases, solved to 1.75 Å (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and 2.0 Å (Bacillus pumilus), reveal a deep, narrow cavity, putatively functioning as the binding site for desmethylPZN. The narrowness of this cavity provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of the extreme substrate selectivity. Analysis of a panel of point mutations to the methyltransferase from B. amyloliquefaciens allowed the identification of residues of structural and catalytic importance. These findings further our understanding of one set of orthologous enzymes involved in thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin biosynthesis, a rapidly growing sector of natural products research.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation and characterization of the naphthocyclinone gene cluster from Streptomyces arenae DSM 40737 and heterologous expression of the polyketide synthase genes Abstract: Streptomyces arenae produces the aromatic polyketide naphthocyclinone, which exhibits activity against Gram-positive bacteria. A cosmid clone containing the putative naphthocyclinone gene cluster was isolated from a genomic library of S. arenae by hybridization with a conserved region from the actinorhodin PKS of S. coelicolor. Sequence analysis of a 5.5-kb DNA fragment, which hybridizes with the actI probe, revealed three open reading frames coding for the minimal polyketide synthase. A strong sequence similarity was found to several previously described ketosynthases, chain length factors and acyl carrier proteins from other polyketide gene clusters. An additional open reading frame downstream of the PKS genes of S. arenae showed 53% identity to act VII probably encoding an aromatase. Another open reading frame was identified in a region of 1.436 bp upstream of the PKS genes, which, however, had no similarity to known genes in the database. Approximately 8 kb upstream of the PKS genes, a DNA fragment was identified that hybridizes to an actVII--actIV specific probe coding for a cyclase and a putative regulatory protein, respectively. Disruption of the proposed naphthocyclinone gene cluster by insertion of a thiostrepton resistance gene completely abolished production of naphthocyclinones in the mutant strain, showing that indeed the naphthocyclinone gene cluster had been isolated. Heterologous expression of the minimal PKS genes in S. coelicolor CH999 in the presence of the act ketoreductase led to the production of mutactin and dehydromutactin, indicating that the S. arenae polyketide synthase forms a C-16 backbone that is subsequently dimerized to build naphthocyclinone. The functions of the proposed cyclase and aromatase were examined by coexpression with genes from different polyketide core producers.	1
Abstract2class: The pcsA gene from Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108 encodes a polyene carboxamide synthase with broad substrate specificity for polyene amides biosynthesis Abstract: Two structurally related polyene macrolides are produced by Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108: rimocidin (3a) and CE-108 (2a). Both bioactive metabolites are biosynthesized from the same pathway through type I polyketide synthases by choosing a starter unit either acetate or butyrate, resulting in 2a or 3a formation, respectively. Two additional polyene amides, CE-108B (2b) and rimocidin B (3b), are also produced "in vivo" when this strain was genetically modified by transformation with engineered SCP2*-derived vectors carrying the ermE gene. The two polyene amides, 2b and 3b, showed improved pharmacological properties, and are generated by a tailoring activity involved in the conversion of the exocyclic carboxylic group of 2a and 3a into their amide derivatives. The improvement on some biological properties of the resulting polyenes, compared with that of the parental compounds, encourages our interest for isolating the tailoring gene responsible for the polyene carboxamide biosynthesis, aimed to use it as tool for generating new bioactive compounds. In this work, we describe the isolation from S. diastaticus var. 108 the corresponding gene, pcsA, encoding a polyene carboxamide synthase, belonging to the Class II glutamine amidotransferases and responsible for "in vivo" and "in vitro" formation of CE-108B (2b) and rimocidin B (3b). The fermentation broth from S. diastaticus var. 108 engineered with the appropriate pcsA gene construction, showed the polyene amides to be the major bioactive compounds.	1
Abstract2class: Diisonitrile Natural Product SF2768 Functions As a Chalkophore That Mediates Copper Acquisition in Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster (sfa) was identified in Streptomyces thioluteus to direct the biosynthesis of the diisonitrile antibiotic SF2768. Its biosynthetic pathway was reasonably proposed based on bioinformatics analysis, metabolic profiles of mutants, and the elucidation of the intermediate and shunt product structures. Bioinformatics-based alignment found a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter related to iron import within the biosynthetic gene cluster, which implied that the product might be a siderophore. However, characterization of the metal-binding properties by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), metal-ligand titration, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and chrome azurol S (CAS) assays revealed that the final product SF2768 and its diisonitrile derivatives specifically bind copper, rather than iron, to form stable complexes. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that the intracellular cupric content of S. thioluteus significantly increased upon incubation with the copper-SF2768 complex, direct evidence for the copper acquisition function of SF2768. Further in vivo functional characterization of the transport elements for the copper-SF2768 complexes not only confirmed the chalkophore identity of the compound but also gave initial clues into the copper uptake mechanism of this nonmethanotrophic microorganism.	1
Abstract2class: Novel compounds produced by Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433 engineered mutants altered in the biosynthesis of streptolydigin Abstract: Streptolydigin is a tetramic acid antibiotic produced by Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433 and involving a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system in its biosynthesis. The streptolydigin amino-acid precursor, 3-methylaspartate, has been proposed to be condensed to the polyketide portion of the molecule by a NRPS composed by three enzymes (SlgN1, SlgN2 and SlgL). On the other hand, biosynthesis of the polyketide moiety involves the participation of cytochrome P450 SlgO2 for the correct cyclization of the characteristic bicyclic ketal. Independent disruption of slgN1, slgN2, slgL or slgO2 resulted in S. lydicus mutants unable to produce the antibiotic thus confirming the involvement of these genes in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. These mutants did not accumulate any streptolydigin biosynthesis intermediate or shunt product derived from early polyketides released from the PKS. However, they produced three novel compounds identified as 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-3-chloro-benzoic acid, 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-3-hydroxy-benzoic acid and 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-benzoic acid, which were designated as christolane A, christolane B and christolane C, respectively. These compounds have been shown to exert some antibiotic activity.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for cryptic phthoxazolin A in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Phthoxazolin A, an oxazole-containing polyketide, has a broad spectrum of anti-oomycete activity and herbicidal activity. We recently identified phthoxazolin A as a cryptic metabolite of Streptomyces avermitilis that produces the important anthelmintic agent avermectin. Even though genome data of S. avermitilis is publicly available, no plausible biosynthetic gene cluster for phthoxazolin A is apparent in the sequence data. Here, we identified and characterized the phthoxazolin A (ptx) biosynthetic gene cluster through genome sequencing, comparative genomic analysis, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis uncovered that the putative ptx biosynthetic genes are laid on an extra genomic region that is not found in the public database, and 8 open reading frames in the extra genomic region could be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of the oxazole ring, triene polyketide and carbamoyl moieties. Disruption of the ptxA gene encoding a discrete acyltransferase resulted in a complete loss of phthoxazolin A production, confirming that the trans-AT type I PKS system is responsible for the phthoxazolin A biosynthesis. Based on the predicted functional domains in the ptx assembly line, we propose the biosynthetic pathway of phthoxazolin A.	1
Abstract2class: Aspergillin PZ, a novel isoindole-alkaloid from Aspergillus awamori Abstract: Aspergillin PZ was obtained from the fermentation of Aspergillus awamori (Nakazawa) by activity-guided fractionation and purification. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data, especially by 2D NMR, and finally confirmed by an X-ray analysis. It could induce conidia of P. oryzae to deform moderately.	0
Abstract2class: The Taxus genome provides insights into paclitaxel biosynthesis Abstract: The ancient gymnosperm genus Taxus is the exclusive source of the anticancer drug paclitaxel, yet no reference genome sequences are available for comprehensively elucidating the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway. We have completed a chromosome-level genome of Taxus chinensis var. mairei with a total length of 10.23 gigabases. Taxus shared an ancestral whole-genome duplication with the coniferophyte lineage and underwent distinct transposon evolution. We discovered a unique physical and functional grouping of CYP725As (cytochrome P450) in the Taxus genome for paclitaxel biosynthesis. We also identified a gene cluster for taxadiene biosynthesis, which was formed mainly by gene duplications. This study will facilitate the elucidation of paclitaxel biosynthesis and unleash the biotechnological potential of Taxus.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Guanitoxin Enables Global Environmental Detection in Freshwater Cyanobacteria Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cyanoHABs) cause recurrent toxic events in global watersheds. Although public health agencies monitor the causal toxins of most cyanoHABs and scientists in the field continue developing precise detection and prediction tools, the potent anticholinesterase neurotoxin, guanitoxin, is not presently environmentally monitored. This is largely due to its incompatibility with widely employed analytical methods and instability in the environment, despite guanitoxin being among the most lethal cyanotoxins. Here, we describe the guanitoxin biosynthesis gene cluster and its rigorously characterized nine-step metabolic pathway from l-arginine in the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024. Through environmental sequencing data sets, guanitoxin (gnt) biosynthetic genes are repeatedly detected and expressed in municipal freshwater bodies that have undergone past toxic events. Knowledge of the genetic basis of guanitoxin biosynthesis now allows for environmental, biosynthetic gene monitoring to establish the global scope of this neurotoxic organophosphate.	1
Abstract2class: Isolation of the lysolipin gene cluster of Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 Abstract: Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 produces the aromatic polyketide antibiotic lysolipin. Lysolipin has strong antibacterial activity against a variety of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The complete lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and fully sequenced. Within a 42-kb genomic region, 42 genes were identified that code for a type II polyketide synthase (llpF, E, and D), cyclases (llpCI-CIII), methyltransferases (llpMI-MVI), a halogenase (llpH), an amidotransferase (llpA), a ferredoxin (llpK), a transporter (llpN) and regulatory proteins (llpRI-RV). In addition, 15 genes encoding enzymes involved in redox modifications of the polyketide precursor molecule (llpOI-OVIII, ZI-ZIV, U, L, and S) were present in the lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster. With this high number of oxidoreductases, lysolipin is among the most highly modified aromatic polyketides known to date. The heterologous expression of the cluster in Streptomyces albus led to lysolipin production with a yield comparable to that of wild-type, indicating that all biosynthetic genes were successfully cloned.	1
Abstract2class: Genes specific for the biosynthesis of clavam metabolites antipodal to clavulanic acid are clustered with the gene for clavaminate synthase 1 in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Portions of the Streptomyces clavuligerus chromosome flanking cas1, which encodes the clavaminate synthase 1 isoenzyme (CAS1), have been cloned and sequenced. Mutants of S. clavuligerus disrupted in cvm1, the open reading frame located immediately upstream of cas1, were constructed by a gene replacement procedure. Similar techniques were used to generate S. clavuligerus mutants carrying a deletion that encompassed portions of the two open reading frames, cvm4 and cvm5, located directly downstream of cas1. Both classes of mutants still produced clavulanic acid and cephamycin C but lost the ability to synthesize the antipodal clavam metabolites clavam-2-carboxylate, 2-hydroxymethyl-clavam, and 2-alanylclavam. These results suggested that cas1 is clustered with genes essential and specific for clavam metabolite biosynthesis. When a cas1 mutant of S. clavuligerus was constructed by gene replacement, it produced lower levels of both clavulanic acid and most of the antipodal clavams except for 2-alanylclavam. However, a double mutant of S. clavuligerus disrupted in both cas1 and cas2 produced neither clavulanic acid nor any of the antipodal clavams, including 2-alanylclavam. This outcome was consistent with the contribution of both CAS1 and CAS2 to a common pool of clavaminic acid that is shunted toward clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of self-generated variants in Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica biofilm with increased antifouling activities Abstract: Pseudoalteromonas is widespread in various marine environments, and most strains can affect invertebrate larval settlement and metamorphosis by forming biofilms. However, the impact and the molecular basis of population diversification occurring in Pseudoalteromonas biofilms are poorly understood. Here, we show that morphological diversification is prevalent in Pseudoalteromonas species during biofilm formation. Two types of genetic variants, wrinkled (frequency of 12±5%) and translucent (frequency of 5±3%), were found in Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica biofilms. The inducing activities of biofilms formed by the two variants on larval settlement and metamorphosis of the mussel Mytilus coruscus were significantly decreased, suggesting strong antifouling activities. Using whole-genome re-sequencing combined with genetic manipulation, two genes were identified to be responsible for the morphology alternations. A nonsense mutation in AT00_08765 led to a wrinkled morphology due to the overproduction of cellulose, whereas a point mutation in AT00_17125 led to a translucent morphology via a reduction in capsular polysaccharide production. Taken together, the results suggest that the microbial behavior on larval settlement and metamorphosis in marine environment could be affected by the self-generated variants generated during the formation of marine biofilms, thereby rendering potential application in biocontrol of marine biofouling.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a fluorometabolite from Streptomyces sp. MA37: (2 R 3 S 4 S)-5-fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid Abstract: (2R3S4S)-5-Fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid (5-FHPA) has been discovered as a new fluorometabolite in the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. MA37. Exogenous addition of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose (5-FDR) into the cell free extract of MA37 demonstrated that 5-FDR was an intermediate to a range of unidentified fluorometabolites, distinct from fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Bioinformatics analysis allowed identification of a gene cluster (fdr), encoding a pathway to the biosynthesis of 5-FHPA. Over-expression and in vitro assay of FdrC indicated that FdrC is a NAD+ dependent dehydrogenase responsible for oxidation of 5-FDR into 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-lactone, followed by hydrolysis to 5-FHPA. The identity of 5-FHPA in the fermentation broth was confirmed by synthesis of a reference compound and then co-correlation by 19F-NMR and GC-MS analysis. The occurrence of 5-FHPA proves the existence of a new fluorometabolite pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Poly(hydroxyalkanoic acid) Biosynthesis in Ectothiorhodospirashaposhnikovii: Characterization and Reactivity of a Type III PHA Synthase Abstract: Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii is able to accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) photoautotrophically during nitrogen-limited growth. The activity of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase in the cells correlates with PHB accumulation. PHA synthase samples collected during the light period do not show a lag phase during in vitro polymerization. Synthase samples collected in the dark period displays a significant lag phase during in vitro polymerization. The lag phase can be eliminated by reacting the PHA synthase with the monomer, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HBCoA). The PHA synthase genes (phaC and phaE) were cloned by screening a genomic library for PHA accumulation in E. coli cells. The PHA synthase expressed in the recombinant E. coli cells was purified to homogeneity. Both sequence analysis and biochemical studies indicated that this PHA synthase consists of two subunits, PhaE and PhaC and, therefore, belongs to the type III PHA synthases. Two major complexes were identified in preparations of purified PHA synthase. The large complex appears to be composed of 12 PhaC subunits and 12 PhaE subunits (dodecamer), whereas the small complex appears to be composed of 6 PhaC and 6 PhaE subunits (hexamer). In dilute aqueous solution, the synthase is predominantly composed of hexamer and has low activity accompanied with a significant lag period at the initial stage of reaction. The percentage of dodecameric complex increases with increasing salt concentration. The dodecameric complex has a greatly increased specific activity for the polymerization of 3HBCoA and a negligible lag period. The results from in vitro polymerizations of 3HBCoA suggest that the PHA synthase from E. shaposhnikovii may catalyze a living polymerization and demonstrate that two PhaC and two PhaE subunits comprise a single catalytic site in the synthase complex.	1
Abstract2class: Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels Abstract: Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg-1 (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with energy metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.	0
Abstract2class: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor rebeccamycin: characterization and generation of indolocarbazole derivatives Abstract: Rebeccamycin, a halogenated natural product of the indolocarbazole family, is produced by Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes ATCC39243. Several rebeccamycin analogues, which target DNA topoisomerase I or II, have already entered clinical trials as anticancer drugs. Using as a probe an internal fragment of ngt, a Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes gene encoding an indolocarbazole N-glycosyltransferase, we isolated a DNA region that directed the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin when introduced into Streptomyces albus. Sequence analysis of 25.6 kb revealed genes for indolocarbazole core formation, halogenation, glycosylation, and sugar methylation, as well as a regulatory gene and two resistance/secretion genes. Heterologous expression of subsets of these genes resulted in production of deschloro-rebeccamycin, 4'-demethyldeschloro-rebeccamycin, and deschloro-rebeccamycin aglycone. The cloned genes should help to elucidate the molecular basis for indolocarbazole biosynthesis and set the stage for the generation of novel indolocarbazole analogues by genetic engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Synthetic Polymer Hybridization with DNA and RNA Directs Nanoparticle Loading, Silencing Delivery, and Aptamer Function Abstract: We report herein discrete triplex hybridization of DNA and RNA with polyacrylates. Length-monodisperse triazine-derivatized polymers were prepared on gram-scale by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization. Despite stereoregio backbone heterogeneity, the triazine polymers bind T/U-rich DNA or RNA with nanomolar affinity upon mixing in a 1:1 ratio, as judged by thermal melts, circular dichroism, gel-shift assays, and fluorescence quenching. We call these polyacrylates "bifacial polymer nucleic acids" (bPoNAs). Nucleic acid hybridization with bPoNA enables DNA loading onto polymer nanoparticles, siRNA silencing delivery, and can further serve as an allosteric trigger of RNA aptamer function. Thus, bPoNAs can serve as tools for both non-covalent bioconjugation and structure-function nucleation. It is anticipated that bPoNAs will have utility in both bio- and nanotechnology.	0
Abstract2class: NMR studies of chromomycins, olivomycins, and their derivatives Abstract: Detailed studies on the 13C and 1H NMR spectra of chromomycins A2 and A3, olivomycins A and B, and their derivatives clarified the assignment of many signals which had been unassigned or erroneously reported in the literatures. The revised assignments for chromomycin A3 and olivomycin A include the assignment of a key 13C signal used to discuss the saccharide linkage in question. Structure analyses based on the revised assignments support the alpha,1----3-bond between components of the disaccharide moiety in the molecules. Some general information useful for structure analysis of saccharides is also reported.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of a complex context containing mecA but lacking genes encoding cassette chromosome recombinases in Staphylococcus haemolyticus Abstract: Background:                       Methicillin resistance determinant mecA is generally transferred by SCCmec elements. However, the mecA gene might not be carried by a SCCmec in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical isolate, WCH1, as no cassette chromosome recombinase genes were detected. Therefore, the genetic context of mecA in WCH1 was investigated.                  Results:                       A 40-kb region containing mecA was obtained from WCH1, bounded by orfX at one end and several orfs of S. haemolyticus core chromosome at the other. This 40-kb region was very complex in structure with multiple genetic components that appeared to have different origins. For instance, the 3.7-kb structure adjacent to orfX was almost identical to that on the chromosome of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62a but was absent from S. haemolyticus JCSC1435. Terminal inverted repeats of SCC were found but no ccr genes could be detected. mecA was bracketed by two copies of IS431, which was flanked by 8-bp direct target repeat sequence (DR).                  Conclusions:                       The presence of 8-bp DR suggests that the two copies of IS431 might have formed a composite transposon for mobilizing mecA. This finding is of significance as multiple copies of IS431 are commonly present in the contexts of mecA, which might have the potential to form various composite transposons that could mediate the mobilization of mecA. This study also provides an explanation for the absence of ccr in some staphylococci isolates carrying mecA.	0
Abstract2class: Genome-based deletion analysis reveals the prenyl xanthone biosynthesis pathway in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Xanthones are a class of molecules that bind to a number of drug targets and possess a myriad of biological properties. An understanding of xanthone biosynthesis at the genetic level should facilitate engineering of second-generation molecules and increasing production of first-generation compounds. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been found to produce two prenylated xanthones, shamixanthone and emericellin, and we report the discovery of two more, variecoxanthone A and epishamixanthone. Using targeted deletions that we created, we determined that a cluster of 10 genes including a polyketide synthase gene, mdpG, is required for prenyl xanthone biosynthesis. mdpG was shown to be required for the synthesis of the anthraquinone emodin, monodictyphenone, and related compounds, and our data indicate that emodin and monodictyphenone are precursors of prenyl xanthones. Isolation of intermediate compounds from the deletion strains provided valuable clues as to the biosynthetic pathway, but no genes accounting for the prenylations were located within the cluster. To find the genes responsible for prenylation, we identified and deleted seven putative prenyltransferases in the A. nidulans genome. We found that two prenyltransferase genes, distant from the cluster, were necessary for prenyl xanthone synthesis. These genes belong to the fungal indole prenyltransferase family that had previously been shown to be responsible for the prenylation of amino acid derivatives. In addition, another prenyl xanthone biosynthesis gene is proximal to one of the prenyltransferase genes. Our data, in aggregate, allow us to propose a complete biosynthetic pathway for the A. nidulans xanthones.	1
Abstract2class: Elucidating the biosynthetic pathway for the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide collismycin A: mechanism for formation of the 2,2'-bipyridyl ring Abstract: The gene cluster for the bipyridyl compound collismycin was characterized from Streptomyces sp. CS40. Sequence analysis of a 46.7 kb DNA region revealed 27 open reading frames, 23 of which are involved in collismycin biosynthesis. Eight insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to prove its involvement in collismycin biosynthesis, define the boundaries of the cluster, functionally characterize some genes, and isolate two biosynthetic intermediates. A model for collismycin biosynthesis--which includes the conversion of lysine into picolinic acid, participation of a polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase system, and some further modifications--is proposed. The biosynthetic pathway would include an unusual NRPS-mediated incorporation of a cysteine residue, possibly through a Michael addition and followed by the extension of the peptide chain by leucine incorporation and later removal by amidohydrolase.	1
Abstract2class: Esterase SeE of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi is a novel nonspecific carboxylic ester hydrolase Abstract: Extracellular carboxylic ester hydrolases are produced by many bacterial pathogens and have been shown recently to be important for virulence of some pathogens. However, these hydrolases are poorly characterized in enzymatic activity. This study prepared and characterized the secreted ester hydrolase of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi (designated SeE for S. equi esterase). SeE hydrolyzes ethyl acetate, acetylsalicylic acid, and tributyrin but not ethyl butyrate. This substrate specificity pattern does not match those of the three conventional types of nonspecific carboxylic ester hydrolases (carboxylesterases, arylesterases, and acetylesterases). To determine whether SeE has lipase activity, a number of triglycerides and vinyl esters were tested in SeE-catalyzed hydrolysis. SeE does not hydrolyze triglycerides and vinyl esters of long-chain carboxylic acids nor display interfacial activation, indicating that SeE is not a lipase. Like the conventional carboxylesterases, SeE is inhibited by di-isopropylfluorophosphate. These findings indicate that SeE is a novel carboxylesterase with optimal activity for acetyl esters.	0
Abstract2class: Synthesis of (+/-)-bistellettadine A Abstract: Esterification of the trienoic acid with o-xylylene dibromide gave the bis ester that underwent a templated Diels-Alder reaction to afford the macrodiolide stereospecifically in a single step.

Abstract2class: Autophosphorylation activity of a soluble hexameric histidine kinase correlates with the shift in protein conformational equilibrium Abstract: In a commonly accepted model, in response to stimuli, bacterial histidine kinases undergo a conformational transition between an active and inactive form. Structural information on histidine kinases is limited. By using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we demonstrate an exchange between two conformational populations of histidine kinase ExsG that are linked to different levels of kinase activity. ExsG is an atypical signaling protein that incorporates an uncommon histidine kinase catalytic core at the C terminus preceded by an N-terminal "receiver domain" that is normally associated with the response regulator proteins in two-component signal transduction systems. IM-MS analysis and enzymatic assays indicate that phosphorylation of the ExsG receiver domain stabilizes the "compact" form of the protein and inhibits kinase core activity; in contrast, nucleotide binding required for kinase activity is associated with the more open conformation of ExsG.	0
Abstract2class: Therapeutic effect of SF-2103A, a novel carbapenem antibiotic, in combination with cefotaxime, cefoperazone and other cephalosporins Abstract: Combinations of SF-2103A with cefotaxime, cefoperazone or cefazolin showed synergistic efficacy at a wide range of combination ratios against experimental infection in mice due to Proteus vulgaris GN76/C-1, producing type Ic cephalosporinase, Escherichia coli No. 29/36 RGN823, producing type IIIa (TEM-2) penicillinase and E. coli GN206, producing type Ib cephalosporinase. These effects by SF-2103A were greater than those seen with sulbactam. The in vitro and in vivo synergistic activities were roughly correlated. Potent in vivo activity of SF-2103A was related to good pharmacokinetic properties, with blood half-life of 30 minutes and urinary recovery of 55.2% after parenteral administration to rats. Furthermore, SF-2103A was stable to rat kidney homogenate. The high stability of SF-2103A in aqueous and biological media was correlated with the sulfonate group at C-3.	0
Abstract2class: Exopolysaccharides promote Myxococcus xanthus social motility by inhibiting cellular reversals Abstract: The biofilm-forming bacterium Myxococcus xanthus moves on surfaces as structured swarms utilizing type IV pili-dependent social (S) motility. In contrast to isolated cells that reverse their moving direction frequently, individual cells within swarms rarely reverse. The regulatory mechanisms that inhibit cellular reversal and promote the formation of swarms are not well understood. Here we show that exopolysaccharides (EPS), the major extracellular components of M. xanthus swarms, inhibit cellular reversal in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, individual wild-type cells reverse less frequently in swarms due to high local EPS concentrations. In contrast, cells defective in EPS production hyper-reverse their moving direction and show severe defects in S-motility. Surprisingly, S-motility and wild-type reversal frequency are restored in double mutants that are defective in both EPS production and the Frz chemosensory system, indicating that EPS regulates cellular reversal in parallel to the Frz pathway. Here we clarify that besides functioning as the structural scaffold in biofilms, EPS is a self-produced signal that coordinates the group motion of the social bacterium M. xanthus.	0
Abstract2class: Complete genome sequence of Burkholderia rhizoxinica, an Endosymbiont of Rhizopus microsporus Abstract: Burkholderia rhizoxinica is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizopus microsporus. The vertically transmitted endosymbiont not only delivers the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin to its host but is also essential for vegetative spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism, we sequenced the whole genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454, thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a fungal species. The 3.75-Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain-specific plasmids. The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of fungal metabolites. Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. Furthermore, the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence-related factors, which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.	1
Abstract2class: Azotobacter vinelandii gene clusters for two types of peptidic and catechol siderophores produced in response to molybdenum Abstract: Aim:                       To characterize the complementary production of two types of siderophores in Azotobacter vinelandii.                  Methods and results:                       In an iron-insufficient environment, nitrogen-fixing A. vinelandii produces peptidic (azotobactin) and catechol siderophores for iron uptake to be used as a nitrogenase cofactor. Molybdenum, another nitrogenase cofactor, was also found to affect the production level of siderophores. Wild-type cells excreted azotobactin into molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient medium, although catechol siderophores predominate in molybdenum-free environments. Two gene clusters were identified to be involved in the production of azotobactin and catechol siderophores through gene annotation and disruption. Azotobactin-deficient mutant cells produced catechol siderophores under the molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient conditions, whereas catechol siderophore-deficient mutant cells extracellularly secreted excess azotobactin under iron-deficient condition independent of the concentration of molybdenum. This evidence suggests that a complementary siderophore production system exists in A. vinelandii.                  Conclusions:                       Molybdenum was found to regulate the production level of two types of siderophores. Azotobacter vinelandii cells are equipped with a complementary production system for nitrogen fixation in response to a limited quantity of metals.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       This is the first study identifying A. vinelandii gene clusters for the biosynthesis of two types of siderophores and clarifying the relationship between them.	1
Abstract2class: Involvement of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain in allosteric regulation of membrane association of proline utilization A Abstract: Proline utilization A (PutA) from Escherichia coli is a membrane-associated trifunctional flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate and moonlights as a transcriptional regulator. As a regulatory protein, PutA represses transcription of the put regulon, which contains the genes encoding PutA and the proline transporter PutP. The binding of proline to the proline dehydrogenase active site and the subsequent reduction of the flavin induce high affinity membrane association of PutA and relieve repression of the put regulon, thereby causing PutA to switch from its regulatory to its enzymatic role. Here, we present evidence suggesting that residues of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain (βα)8 barrel are involved in proline-mediated allosteric regulation of PutA-membrane binding. Mutation of the conserved residues Asp370 and Glu372 in the β3-α3 loop abrogates the ability of proline to induce functional membrane association. Both in vitro lipid/membrane binding assays and in vivo cell-based assays demonstrate that mutagenesis of Asp370 (D370N/A) or Glu372 (E372A) dramatically impedes PutA functional switching. The crystal structures of the proline dehydrogenase domain mutants PutA86-630D370N and PutA86-630D370A complexed with the proline analogue l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid show that the mutations cause only minor perturbations to the active site but no major structural changes, suggesting that the lack of proline response is not due to a failure of the mutated active sites to correctly bind the substrate. Rather, these results suggest that the β3-α3 loop may be involved in transmitting the status of the proline dehydrogenase active site and flavin redox state to the distal membrane association domain.	0
Abstract2class: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-acylamino-2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids Abstract: The synthesis and in vitro antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitory activity of the 2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids having a substituent at C-4 position of the beta-lactam ring are described. The influence of C-4 substituents on the antibacterial activity was examined for the compounds having alpha-ureidoacetyl or alpha-oxyiminoacetyl group as acyl side chain at C-3 position. The antibacterial activity is correlated with the C-4 substituents and acyl side chain. Especially, 4(R)-methyl substituted derivatives exhibited excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and 4-dimethyl substituted derivatives exhibited strong activity against resistant Gram-negative bacteria except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 39 and 40 showed strong inhibitory activity against cephalosporinase of Enterobacter cloacae H-27.	0
Abstract2class: Modification of the second translation initiation site restricts the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus in PK-15 cells Abstract: The translation initiation of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) occurs at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). Usually, the Lb AUG is more favorably used to initiate protein synthesis than the Lab AUG. To explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, this initiation codon was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA). Fortunately, the modifications did not prevent viral viability but influenced replication characteristics of some FMDV mutants in a cell-specific manner, as was shown by the similar replication in BHK-21 cells and delayed growth kinetics in PK-15 cells. This attenuated phenotype of FMDV mutants in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with reduced abilities to cleave eIF4GI and suppress interference (IFN) expression. As leader (L) protein was reported to be responsible for eIF4GI cleavage and inhibition of IFN expression, the in vivo L protein synthesis was examined during the infection of FMDV mutants. Our results showed that not only the total yield of L proteins was severely influenced but also the individual yield of L protein was seen to be affected, which implied that both the relative usage of the two initiation sites and overall translation efficiency were changed by Lb AUG modifications. In addition, the in vitro translation activity was also negatively regulated by Lb AUG mutations. Collectively, these findings suggested that the restricted replications of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs were related to the delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression but were mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation. FMDVs precisely with modifications of Lb AUG initiation codon may represent safer seed viruses for vaccine production. KEY POINTS: • The polyprotein translation of FMDV initiates at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). In order to explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, the Lb initiation AUG was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA), and four FMDV mutants with Lb AUG modification were generated. • We found that partial FMDV mutants grew almost as well as WT virus in BHK-21 cells, a typical cell line used for FMD vaccine production, but displayed impaired replication in IFN-competent PK-15 cells. • The attenuation of mutant FMDVs in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression. • We proved that the attenuated phenotype of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs was mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation, as demonstrated by the decrease of total yield of L proteins and individual production of L protein. • We successfully generated genetically engineered FMDV with attenuated phenotype. The approach of precise engineering of FMDV with the modification of initiation codon provides a safe platform to produce inactivated antigen vaccines.	0
Abstract2class: Nonribosomal peptides, key biocontrol components for Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, isolated from a Greenlandic suppressive soil Abstract: Potatoes are cultivated in southwest Greenland without the use of pesticides and with limited crop rotation. Despite the fact that plant-pathogenic fungi are present, no severe-disease outbreaks have yet been observed. In this report, we document that a potato soil at Inneruulalik in southern Greenland is suppressive against Rhizoctonia solani Ag3 and uncover the suppressive antifungal mechanism of a highly potent biocontrol bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, isolated from the suppressive potato soil. A combination of molecular genetics, genomics, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) revealed an antifungal genomic island in P. fluorescens In5 encoding two nonribosomal peptides, nunamycin and nunapeptin, which are key components for the biocontrol activity by strain In5 in vitro and in soil microcosm experiments. Furthermore, complex microbial behaviors were highlighted. Whereas nunamycin was demonstrated to inhibit the mycelial growth of R. solani Ag3, but not that of Pythium aphanidermatum, nunapeptin instead inhibited P. aphanidermatum but not R. solani Ag3. Moreover, the synthesis of nunamycin by P. fluorescens In5 was inhibited in the presence of P. aphanidermatum. Further characterization of the two peptides revealed nunamycin to be a monochlorinated 9-amino-acid cyclic lipopeptide with similarity to members of the syringomycin group, whereas nunapeptin was a 22-amino-acid cyclic lipopeptide with similarity to corpeptin and syringopeptin.                  Importance:                       Crop rotation and systematic pest management are used to only a limited extent in Greenlandic potato farming. Nonetheless, although plant-pathogenic fungi are present in the soil, the farmers do not experience major plant disease outbreaks. Here, we show that a Greenlandic potato soil is suppressive against Rhizoctonia solani, and we unravel the key biocontrol components for Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, one of the potent biocontrol bacteria isolated from this Greenlandic suppressive soil. Using a combination of molecular genetics, genomics, and microbial imaging mass spectrometry, we show that two cyclic lipopeptides, nunamycin and nunapeptin, are important for the biocontrol activity of P. fluorescens In5 both in vitro and in microcosm assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthesis of nunamycin is repressed by the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum. Overall, our report provides important insight into interkingdom interference between bacteria and fungi/oomycetes.	1
Abstract2class: Pentaketide Ansamycin Microansamycins A-I from Micromonospora sp. Reveal Diverse Post-PKS Modifications Abstract: Overexpression of the pathway-specific positive regulator gene mas13 activated the cryptic gene cluster mas, resulting in the isolation of nine novel pentaketide ansamycins, namely, microansamycins A-I (1-9). These results not only revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster of pentaketide ansamycins for the first time but also presented an unprecedented scenario of diverse post-PKS modifications in ansamycin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Different biosynthetic pathways to fosfomycin in Pseudomonas syringae and Streptomyces species Abstract: Fosfomycin is a wide-spectrum antibiotic that is used clinically to treat acute cystitis in the United States. The compound is produced by several strains of streptomycetes and pseudomonads. We sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for fosfomycin production in Pseudomonas syringae PB-5123. Surprisingly, the biosynthetic pathway in this organism is very different from that in Streptomyces fradiae and Streptomyces wedmorensis. The pathways share the first and last steps, involving conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) and 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-HPP) to fosfomycin, respectively, but the enzymes converting PnPy to 2-HPP are different. The genome of P. syringae PB-5123 lacks a gene encoding the PnPy decarboxylase found in the Streptomyces strains. Instead, it contains a gene coding for a citrate synthase-like enzyme, Psf2, homologous to the proteins that add an acetyl group to PnPy in the biosynthesis of FR-900098 and phosphinothricin. Heterologous expression and purification of Psf2 followed by activity assays confirmed the proposed activity of Psf2. Furthermore, heterologous production of fosfomycin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a fosmid encoding the fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from P. syringae PB-5123 confirmed that the gene cluster is functional. Therefore, two different pathways have evolved to produce this highly potent antimicrobial agent.	1
Abstract2class: A transglutaminase homologue as a condensation catalyst in antibiotic assembly lines Abstract: The unrelenting emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens demands the investigation of antibiotics with new modes of action. The pseudopeptide antibiotic andrimid is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase that catalyses the first committed step in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis. Recently, the andrimid (adm) biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. This establishes a heterologous biological host in which to rapidly probe features of andrimid formation and to use biosynthetic engineering to make unnatural variants of this important and promising new class of antibiotics. Bioinformatic analysis of the adm cluster revealed a dissociated biosynthetic assembly system lacking canonical amide synthases between the first three carrier protein domains. Here we report that AdmF, a transglutaminase (TGase) homologue, catalyses the formation of the first amide bond, an N-acyl-beta-peptide link, in andrimid biosynthesis. Hence, AdmF is a newly discovered biosynthetic enzyme that acts as a stand-alone amide synthase between protein-bound, thiotemplated substrates in an antibiotic enzymatic assembly line. TGases (enzyme class (EC) 2.3.2.13) normally catalyse the cross-linking of (poly)peptides by creating isopeptidic bonds between the gamma-carboxamide group of a glutamine side chain of one protein and various amine donors, including lysine side chains. To the best of our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first report of a TGase-like enzyme recruited for the assembly of an antibiotic. Moreover, genome mining using the AdmF sequence yielded additional TGases in unassigned natural product biosynthetic pathways. With many more microbial genomes being sequenced, such a strategy could potentially unearth biosynthetic pathways producing new classes of antibiotics.	1
Abstract2class: The ABC transporter gene in the sirodesmin biosynthetic gene cluster of Leptosphaeria maculans is not essential for sirodesmin production but facilitates self-protection Abstract: Epipolythiodioxopiperazine toxins are secreted by a range of fungi, including Leptosphaeria maculans, which produces sirodesmin, and Aspergillus fumigatus, which produces gliotoxin. The L. maculans biosynthetic gene cluster for sirodesmin includes an ABC transporter gene, sirA. Disruption of this gene led to increased secretion of sirodesmin into the medium and an altered ratio of sirodesmin to its immediate precursor. The transcription pattern of a peptide synthetase that catalyses an early step in sirodesmin biosynthesis was elevated in the sirA mutant by 47% over a 7-day period. This was consistent with the finding that the transporter mutant had elevated sirodesmin levels. Despite increased production of sirodesmin, the sirA mutant was more sensitive to both sirodesmin and gliotoxin. The putative gliotoxin transporter gene, gliA, (a major facilitator superfamily transporter) from A. fumigatus complemented the tolerance of the L. maculans sirA mutant to gliotoxin, but not to sirodesmin. The results indicate that SirA contributes to self-protection against sirodesmin in L. maculans and suggest a transporter other than SirA is primarily responsible for efflux of endogenously produced sirodesmin.	1
Abstract2class: Effects of DNA adduct structure and sequence context on strand opening of repair intermediates and incision by UvrABC nuclease Abstract: DNA damage recognition of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in Escherichia coli is achieved by at least two steps. In the first step, a helical distortion is recognized, which leads to a strand opening at the lesion site. The second step involves the recognition of the type of chemical modification in the single-stranded region of DNA during the processing of the lesions by UvrABC. In the current work, by comparing the efficiencies of UvrABC incision of several types of different DNA adducts, we show that the size and position of the strand opening are dependent on the type of DNA adducts. Optimal incision efficiency for the C8-guanine adducts of 2-aminofluorene (AF) and N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) was observed in a bubble of three mismatched nucleotides, whereas the same for C8-guanine adduct of 1-nitropyrene and N(2)-guanine adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) was noted in a bubble of six mismatched nucleotides. This suggests that the size of the aromatic ring system of the adduct might influence the extent and number of bases associated with the opened strand region catalyzed by UvrABC. We also showed that the incision efficiency of the AF or AAF adduct was affected by the neighboring DNA sequence context, which, in turn, was the result of differential binding of UvrA to the substrates. The sequence context effect on both incision and binding disappeared when a bubble structure of three bases was introduced at the adduct site. We therefore propose that these effects relate to the initial step of damage recognition of DNA structural distortion. The structure-function relationships in the recognition of the DNA lesions, based on our results, have been discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Various mutations compensate for a deleterious lacZα insert in the replication enhancer of M13 bacteriophage Abstract: M13 and other members of the Ff class of filamentous bacteriophages have been extensively employed in myriad applications. The Ph.D. series of phage-displayed peptide libraries were constructed from the M13-based vector M13KE. As a direct descendent of M13mp19, M13KE contains the lacZα insert in the intergenic region between genes IV and II, where it interrupts the replication enhancer of the (+) strand origin. Phage carrying this 816-nucleotide insert are viable, but propagate in E. coli at a reduced rate compared to wild-type M13 phage, presumably due to a replication defect caused by the insert. We have previously reported thirteen compensatory mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of gene II, which encodes the replication initiator protein gIIp. Here we report several additional mutations in M13KE that restore a wild-type propagation rate. Several clones from constrained-loop variable peptide libraries were found to have ejected the majority of lacZα gene in order to reconstruct the replication enhancer, albeit with a small scar. In addition, new point mutations in the gene II 5'-untranslated region or the gene IV coding sequence have been spontaneously observed or synthetically engineered. Through phage propagation assays, we demonstrate that all these genetic modifications compensate for the replication defect in M13KE and restore the wild-type propagation rate. We discuss the mechanisms by which the insertion and ejection of the lacZα gene, as well as the mutations in the regulatory region of gene II, influence the efficiency of replication initiation at the (+) strand origin. We also examine the presence and relevance of fast-propagating mutants in phage-displayed peptide libraries.	0
Abstract2class: Type III secretion system 1 genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus are positively regulated by ExsA and negatively regulated by ExsD Abstract: Vibrio parahaemolyticus harbours two distinct type III secretion systems (T3SS1 and T3SS2). A subset of 10 T3SS1 genes are transcribed when V. parahaemolyticus is grown in tissue culture medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)], while transcription of these genes (except exsD) is minimal upon growth in Luria-Bertani-Salt (LB-S). Transcription of T3SS1 genes and cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells was prevented by deletion of exsA while complementation with exsA restored these traits. Overexpression of ExsA in the wild-type strain, NY-4, activated the transcription of T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in LB-S. Thus, ExsA is necessary and sufficient to induce the transcription of T3SS1 genes. Deletion of the exsD permitted the transcription of T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in the LB-S medium and complementation with the wild-type exsD gene-blocked transcription of T3SS1 genes. Overexpression of ExsD in NY-4 prevented the transcription of T3SS1 gene when bacteria were grown in DMEM. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that purified ExsA protein binds a novel motif in the upstream region of vp1668 and vp1687, indicating that ExsA interacts directly with the promoter sequences of T3SS1 genes. ExsA positively regulates the expression and secretion of Vp1656 while ExsD negatively regulates the expression and secretion of Vp1656.	0
Abstract2class: Inhibitors of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases: synthesis, molecular docking, and implications Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases (PhaCs) catalyze the formation of biodegradable PHAs that are considered to be ideal alternatives to non-biodegradable synthetic plastics. However, study of PhaCs has been challenging because the rate of PHA chain elongation is much faster than that of initiation. This difficulty, along with lack of a crystal structure, has become the main hurdle to understanding and engineering PhaCs for economical PHA production. Here we report the synthesis of two carbadethia CoA analogues--sT-CH2-CoA (26 a) and sTet-CH2-CoA (26 b)--as well as sT-aldehyde (saturated trimer aldehyde, 29), as new PhaC inhibitors. Study of these analogues with PhaECAv revealed that 26 a/b and 29 are competitive and mixed inhibitors, respectively. Both the CoA moiety and extension of PHA chain will increase binding affinity; this is consistent with our docking study. Estimation of the Kic values of 26 a and 26 b predicts that a CoA analogue incorporating an octameric hydroxybutanoate (HB) chain might facilitate the formation of a kinetically well-behaved synthase.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the ansamycin antibiotic rifamycin: deductions from the molecular analysis of the rif biosynthetic gene cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699 Abstract: Background:                       The ansamycin class of antibiotics are produced by various Actinomycetes. Their carbon framework arises from the polyketide pathway via a polyketide synthase (PKS) that uses an unusual starter unit. Rifamycin (rif), produced by Amycolatopsis mediterranei, is the archetype ansamycin and it is medically important. Although its basic precursors (3-amino-5-hydroxy benzoic acid AHBA, and acetic and propionic acids) had been established, and several biosynthetic intermediates had been identified, very little was known about the origin of AHBA nor had the PKS and the various genes and enzymes that modify the initial intermediate been characterized.                  Results:                       A set of 34 genes clustered around the rifK gene encoding AHBA synthase were defined by sequencing all but 5 kilobases (kb) of a 95 kb contiguous region of DNA from A. mediterranei. The involvement of some of the genes in the biosynthesis of rifamycin B was examined. At least five genes were shown to be essential for the synthesis of AHBA, five genes were determined to encode the modular type I PKS that uses AHBA as the starter unit, and 20 or more genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework, and rifamycin resistance and export. Putative regulatory genes were also identified. Disruption of the PKS genes at the end of rifA abolished rifamycin B production and resulted in the formation of P8/1-OG, a known shunt product of rifamycin biosynthesis, whereas disruption of the orf6 and orf9 genes, which may encode deoxysugar biosynthesis enzymes, had no apparent effect.                  Conclusions:                       Rifamycin production in A. mediterranei is governed by a single gene cluster consisting of structural, resistance and export, and regulatory genes. The genes characterized here could be modified to produce novel forms of the rifamycins that may be effective against rifamycin-resistant microorganisms.	1
Abstract2class: Molecular characterization of the enniatin synthetase gene encoding a multifunctional enzyme catalysing N-methyldepsipeptide formation in Fusarium scirpi Abstract: The gene encoding the multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase from Fusarium scirpi (esyn1) was isolated and characterized by transcriptional mapping and expression studies in Escherichia coli. This is the first example of a gene encoding an N-methyl peptide synthetase. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 9393 bp encoding a protein of 3131 amino acids (M(r) 346,900). Two domains designated EA and EB within the protein were identified which share similarity to each other and to microbial peptide synthetase domains. In contrast to the N-terminal domain EA, the carboxyl terminal domain EB is interrupted by a 434-amino-acid portion which shows local similarity to a motif apparently conserved within adenine and cytosine RNA and DNA methyltransferases and therefore seems to harbour the N-methyl-transferase function of the multienzyme.	1
Abstract2class: N-methylation of the amide bond by methyltransferase asm10 in ansamitocin biosynthesis Abstract: Ansamitocins are potent antitumor agents produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum. As deduced from their structures, an N-methylation on the amide bond is required among the various modifications. The protein encoded by asm10 belongs to the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family. Through gene inactivation and complementation, asm10 was proved to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 is a 33.0 kDa monomer, as determined by gel filtration. By using N-desmethyl-ansamitocin P-3 as substrate, the optimal temperature and pH for Asm10 catalysis were determined to be 32 °C and 10.0, respectively. Asm10 also showed broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl-ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. Through site-directed mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were confirmed to be essential for its catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM. The characterization of this unique N-methyltransferase has enriched the toolbox for engineering N-methylated derivatives from both natural and synthetic compounds; this will allow known potential drugs to be modified.	0
Abstract2class: Repetitive DNA sequences cotranscribed with developmentally regulated Dictyostelium discoideum mRNAs Abstract: We have isolated a clone of Dictyostelium discoideum genomic DNA, pB41-6, that contains sequences that are reiterated and interspersed in the genome. The expression of these reiterated sequences is developmentally regulated, and they appear to be linked only to developmentally regulated mRNAs. We have used clone pB41-6 to isolate a set of complementary cDNA clones. Analysis of two selected clones indicates that they encode developmentally regulated mRNA species and, by means of the repetitive elements they contain, hybridize to many developmentally regulated mRNAs. In addition, we have defined two families of mRNA species carrying these repetitive sequences: one is induced at 5.5 hr of development and the other is induced between 5.5 and 15 hr of development. Since most of the mRNA species that have sequences complementary to clone pB41-6 accumulate in a coordinated fashion during development, these sequences may play an important regulatory role in the developmental program of Dictyostelium.	0
Abstract2class: Investigation of the Streptomyces clavuligerus cephamycin C gene cluster and its regulation by the CcaR protein Abstract: As part of a search for transcriptional regulatory genes, sequence analysis of several previously unsequenced gaps in the cephamycin biosynthetic cluster has revealed the presence in Streptomyces clavuligerus of seven genes not previously described. These include genes encoding an apparent penicillin binding protein and a transport or efflux protein, as well as the CmcI and CmcJ proteins, which catalyze late reactions in the cephamycin biosynthetic pathway. In addition, we discovered a gene, designated pcd, which displays significant homology to genes encoding semialdehyde dehydrogenases and may represent the gene encoding the long-sought-after dehydrogenase involved in the conversion of lysine to alpha-aminoadipate. Finally, two genes, sclU and rhsA, with no obvious function in cephamycin biosynthesis may define the end of the cluster. The previously described CcaR protein displays homology to a number of Streptomyces pathway-specific transcriptional activators. The ccaR gene was shown to be essential for the biosynthesis of cephamycin, clavulanic acid, and non-clavulanic acid clavams. Complementation of a deletion mutant lacking ccaR and the adjacent orf11 and blp genes showed that only ccaR was essential for the biosynthesis of cephamycin, clavulanic acid, and clavams and that mutations in orf11 or blp had no discernible effects. The lack of cephamycin production in ccaR mutants was directly attributable to the absence of biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the early and middle steps of the cephamycin biosynthetic pathway. Complementation of the ccaR deletion mutant resulted in the return of these biosynthetic enzymes and the restoration of cephamycin production.	1
Abstract2class: Determining α-helical and β-sheet secondary structures via pulsed electron spin resonance spectroscopy Abstract: A new method has been developed to determine α-helical and β-sheet secondary structural components of aqueous and membrane-bound proteins using pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The three-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) technique was used to detect weakly coupled (2)H-labeled nuclei on side chains in the proximity of a strategically placed nitroxide spin-label up to 8 Å away. Changes in the ESEEM spectra for different samples correlate directly to periodic structural differences between α-helical and β-sheet motifs. These distinct trends were demonstrated with α-helical (M2δ subunit of the acetylcholine receptor) and β-sheet (ubiquitin) peptides in biologically relevant sample environments.	0
Abstract2class: Identification, cloning and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin Abstract: From our in-house microbial genome database of secondary metabolite producers, we identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin from Streptomyces nobilis JCM4274. We report herein the cloning of the 127-kb entire gene cluster for desertomycin biosynthesis using bacterial artificial chromosome vector. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin was introduced in the heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans TK23, with an average yield of more than 130 mg l-1.	1
Abstract2class: Genome-scale analysis of the genes that contribute to Burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm formation identifies a crucial exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is an important public health threat due to limited therapeutic options for treatment. Efforts to improve therapeutics for B. pseudomallei infections are dependent on the need to understand the role of B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and its contribution to antibiotic tolerance and persistence as these are bacterial traits that prevent effective therapy. In order to reveal the genes that regulate and/or contribute to B. pseudomallei 1026b biofilm formation, we screened a sequence defined two-allele transposon library and identified 118 transposon insertion mutants that were deficient in biofilm formation. These mutants include transposon insertions in genes predicted to encode flagella, fimbriae, transcriptional regulators, polysaccharides, and hypothetical proteins. Polysaccharides are key constituents of biofilms and B. pseudomallei has the capacity to produce a diversity of polysaccharides, thus there is a critical need to link these biosynthetic genes with the polysaccharides they produce to better understand their biological role during infection. An allelic exchange deletion mutant of the entire B. pseudomallei biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic cluster was decreased in biofilm formation and produced a smooth colony morphology suggestive of the loss of exopolysaccharide production. Conversely, deletion of the previously defined capsule I polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster increased biofilm formation. Bioinformatics analyses combined with immunoblot analysis and glycosyl composition studies of the partially purified exopolysaccharide indicate that the biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide is neither cepacian nor the previously described acidic exopolysaccharide. The biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide described here is also specific to the B. pseudomallei complex of bacteria. Since this novel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster is retained in B. mallei, it is predicted to have a role in colonization and infection of the host. These findings will facilitate further advances in understanding the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and improve diagnostics and therapeutic treatment strategies.	1
Abstract2class: GacS sensor domains pertinent to the regulation of exoproduct formation and to the biocontrol potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 Abstract: In the root-colonizing biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens, cell density-dependent synthesis of extracellular, plant-beneficial secondary metabolites and enzymes is positively regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Mutational analysis of the GacS sensor kinase using improved single-copy vectors showed that inactivation of each of the three conserved phosphate acceptor sites caused an exoproduct null phenotype (GacS-), whereas deletion of the periplasmic loop domain had no significant effect on the expression of exoproduct genes. Strain CHA0 is known to synthesize a solvent-extractable extracellular signal that advances and enhances the expression of exoproduct genes during the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase when maximal exoproduct formation occurs. Mutational inactivation of either GacS or its cognate response regulator GacA abolished the strain's response to added signal. Deletion of the linker domain of the GacS sensor kinase caused signal-independent, strongly elevated expression of exoproduct genes at low cell densities. In contrast to the wild-type strain CHA0, the gacS linker mutant and a gacS null mutant were unable to protect tomato plants from crown and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici in a soil-less microcosm, indicating that, at least in this plant-pathogen system, there is no advantage in using a signal-independent biocontrol strain.	0
Abstract2class: Organization of the Escherichia coli K-12 gene cluster responsible for production of the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid Abstract: Colanic acid (CA) is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by most Escherichia coli strains as well as by other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We have determined the sequence of a 23-kb segment of the E. coli K-12 chromosome which includes the cluster of genes necessary for production of CA. The CA cluster comprises 19 genes. Two other sequenced genes (orf1.3 and galF), which are situated between the CA cluster and the O-antigen cluster, were shown to be unnecessary for CA production. The CA cluster includes genes for synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, one of the precursors of CA, and the gene for one of the enzymes in this pathway (GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase) was identified by biochemical assay. Six of the inferred proteins show sequence similarity to glycosyl transferases, and two others have sequence similarity to acetyl transferases. Another gene (wzx) is predicted to encode a protein with multiple transmembrane segments and may function in export of the CA repeat unit from the cytoplasm into the periplasm in a process analogous to O-unit export. The first three genes of the cluster are predicted to encode an outer membrane lipoprotein, a phosphatase, and an inner membrane protein with an ATP-binding domain. Since homologs of these genes are found in other extracellular polysaccharide gene clusters, they may have a common function, such as export of polysaccharide from the cell.	1
Abstract2class: Biotransformation of 2-benzoxazolinone and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one by endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona Abstract: The biotransformation of the phytoanticipins 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA) by four endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona was studied. Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, several new products of acylation, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and nitration were identified. Fusarium sambucinum detoxified BOA and HBOA to N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)malonamic acid. Plectosporium tabacinum, Gliocladium cibotii, and Chaetosphaeria sp. transformed HBOA to 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetamide, 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, 2-acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, and 2-(N-hydroxy)acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one. BOA was not degraded by these three fungal isolates. Using 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)[(13)C(2)]acetamide, it was shown that the metabolic pathway for HBOA and BOA degradation leads to o-aminophenol as a key intermediate.	0
Abstract2class: Iteratively improving natamycin production in Streptomyces gilvosporeus by a large operon-reporter based strategy Abstract: Many high-value secondary metabolites are assembled by very large multifunctional polyketide synthases or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encoded by giant genes, for instance, natamycin production in an industrial strain of Streptomyces gilvosporeus. In this study, a large operon reporter-based selection system has been developed using the selectable marker gene neo to report the expression both of the large polyketide synthase genes and of the entire gene cluster, thereby facilitating the selection of natamycin-overproducing mutants by iterative random mutagenesis breeding. In three successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection, the natamycin titer was increased by 110%, 230%, and 340%, respectively, and the expression of the whole biosynthetic gene cluster was correspondingly increased. An additional copy of the natamycin gene cluster was found in one overproducer. These findings support the large operon reporter-based selection system as a useful tool for the improvement of industrial strains utilized in the production of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides.	1
Abstract2class: The Intersection of Structural and Chemical Biology - An Essential Synergy Abstract: The continual improvement in our ability to generate high resolution structural models of biological molecules has stimulated and supported innovative chemical biology projects that target increasingly challenging ligand interaction sites.

Abstract2class: Turncoat Polypeptides: We Adapt to Our Environment Abstract: A common interpretation of Anfinsen's hypothesis states that one amino acid sequence should fold into a single, native, ordered state, or a highly similar set thereof, coinciding with the global minimum in the folding-energy landscape, which, in turn, is responsible for the function of the protein. However, this classical view is challenged by many proteins and peptide sequences, which can adopt exchangeable, significantly dissimilar conformations that even fulfill different biological roles. The similarities and differences of concepts related to these proteins, mainly chameleon sequences, metamorphic proteins, and switch peptides, which are all denoted herein "turncoat" polypeptides, are reviewed. As well as adding a twist to the conventional view of protein folding, the lack of structural definition adds clear versatility to the activity of proteins and can be used as a tool for protein design and further application in biotechnology and biomedicine.	0
Abstract2class: Natural Product Discovery through Improved Functional Metagenomics in Streptomyces Abstract: Because the majority of environmental bacteria are not easily culturable, access to many bacterially encoded secondary metabolites will be dependent on the development of improved functional metagenomic screening methods. In this study, we examined a collection of diverse Streptomyces species for the best innate ability to heterologously express biosynthetic gene clusters. We then optimized methods for constructing high quality metagenomic cosmid libraries in the best Streptomyces host. An initial screen of a 1.5 million-membered metagenomic library constructed in Streptomyces albus, the species that exhibited the highest propensity for heterologous expression of gene clusters, led to the identification of the novel natural product metatricycloene (1). Metatricycloene is a tricyclic polyene encoded by a reductive, iterative polyketide-like gene cluster. Related gene clusters found in sequenced genomes appear to encode a largely unexplored collection of structurally diverse, polyene-based metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Properties and gene structure of a bifunctional cellulolytic enzyme (CelA) from the extreme thermophile 'Anaerocellum thermophilum' with separate glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and 48 catalytic domains Abstract: A large cellulolytic enzyme (CelA) with the ability to hydrolyse microcrystalline cellulose was isolated from the extremely thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium 'Anaerocellum thermophilum'. Full-length CelA and a truncated enzyme species designated CelA' were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants. CelA has an apparent molecular mass of 230 kDa. The enzyme exhibited significant activity towards Avicel and was most active towards soluble substrates such as CM-cellulose (CMC) and beta-glucan. Maximal activity was observed between pH values of 5 and 6 and temperatures of 95 degrees C (CM-cellulase) and 85 degrees C (Avicelase). Cellobiose, glucose and minor amounts of cellotriose were observed as end-products of Avicel degradation. The CelA-encoding gene was isolated from genomic DNA of 'A. thermophilum' by PCR and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The celA gene encodes a protein of 1711 amino acids (190 kDa) starting with the sequence found at the N-terminus of CelA purified from 'A. thermophilum'. Sequence analysis revealed a multidomain structure consisting of two distinct catalytic domains homologous to glycosyl hydrolase families 9 and 48 and three domains homologous to family III cellulose-binding domain linked by Pro-Thr-Ser-rich regions. The enzyme is most closely related to CelA of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (sequence identities of 96 and 97% were found for the N- and C-terminal catalytic domains, respectively). Endoglucanase CelZ of Clostridium stercorarium shows 70.4% sequence identity to the N-terminal family 9 domain and exoglucanase CelY from the same organism has 69.2% amino acid identity with the C-terminal family 48 domain. Consistent with this similarity on the primary structure level, the 90 kDa truncated derivative CelA' containing the N-terminal half of CelA exhibited endoglucanase activity and bound to microcrystalline cellulose. Due to the significantly enhanced Avicelase activity of full-length CelA, exoglucanase activity may be ascribed to the C-terminal family 48 catalytic domain.	0
Abstract2class: Physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T chromosome Abstract: A combined physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T genome was constructed by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and DNA blot hybridizations. The S. hyodysenteriae genome is a single circular chromosome about 3.2 Mb in size. The physical map of the chromosome was constructed with the restriction enzymes BssHII, EclXI, NotI, SalI, and SmaI. The physical map was used to constructed a linkage map for genes encoding rRNA, flagellum subunit proteins, DNA gyrase, NADH oxidase, and three distinct hemolysins. Several flaB2-related loci, encoding core flagellum subunit proteins, were detected and are dispersed around the chromosome. The rRNA gene organization in S. hyodysenteriae is unusual. S. hyodysenteriae has one gene each for 5S (rrf), 16S (rrs), and 23S (rrl) rRNAs. The rrf and rrl genes are closely linked (within 5 kb), while the rrs gene is about 860 kb from the other two rRNA genes. Using a probe for the S. hyodysenteriae gyrA gene, we identified a possible location for the chromosomal replication origin. The size and genetic organization of the S. hyodysenteriae chromosome are different from those of previously characterized spirochetes.	0
Abstract2class: Secoiridoids and Iridoids from Morinda asteroscepa Abstract: The new 2,3-secoiridoids morisecoiridoic acids A (1) and B (2), the new iridoid 8-acetoxyepishanzilactone (3), and four additional known iridoids (4-7) were isolated from the leaf and stem bark methanol extracts of Morinda asteroscepa using chromatographic methods. The structure of shanzilactone (4) was revised. The purified metabolites were identified using NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques, with the absolute configuration of 1 having been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crude leaf extract (10 μg/mL) and compounds 1-3 and 5 (10 μM) showed mild antiplasmodial activities against the chloroquine-sensitive malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (3D7).	0
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of the validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster and engineered production of validoxylamine A Abstract: A 45 kb DNA sequencing analysis from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 involved in validamycin A (VAL-A) biosynthesis revealed 16 structural genes, 2 regulatory genes, 5 genes related transport, transposition/integration or tellurium resistance; another 4 genes had no obvious identity. The VAL-A biosynthetic pathway was proposed, with assignment of the required genetic functions confined to the sequenced region. A cluster of eight reassembled genes was found to support VAL-A synthesis in a heterologous host, S. lividans 1326. In vivo inactivation of the putative glycosyltransferase gene (valG) abolished the final attachment of glucose for VAL production and resulted in accumulation of the VAL-A precursor, validoxylamine, while the normal production of VAL-A could be restored by complementation with valG. The role of valG in the glycosylation of validoxylamine to VAL-A was demonstrated in vitro by enzymatic assay.	1
Abstract2class: Conformational flexibility and peptide interaction of the translocation ATPase SecA Abstract: The SecA ATPase forms a functional complex with the protein-conducting SecY channel to translocate polypeptides across the bacterial cell membrane. SecA recognizes the translocation substrate and catalyzes its unidirectional movement through the SecY channel. The recent crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima SecA-SecYEG complex shows the ATPase in a conformation where the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) have closed around a bound ADP-BeFx complex and SecA's polypeptide-binding clamp is shut. Here, we present the crystal structure of T. maritima SecA in isolation, determined in its ADP-bound form at 3.1 A resolution. SecA alone has a drastically different conformation in which the nucleotide-binding pocket between NBD1 and NBD2 is open and the preprotein cross-linking domain has rotated away from both NBDs, thereby opening the polypeptide-binding clamp. To investigate how this clamp binds polypeptide substrates, we also determined a structure of Bacillus subtilis SecA in complex with a peptide at 2.5 A resolution. This structure shows that the peptide augments the highly conserved beta-sheet at the back of the clamp. Taken together, these structures suggest a mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis can lead to polypeptide translocation.	0
Abstract2class: Somatic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumour suppressor disruption enables versatile brain tumour modelling Abstract: In vivo functional investigation of oncogenes using somatic gene transfer has been successfully exploited to validate their role in tumorigenesis. For tumour suppressor genes this has proven more challenging due to technical aspects. To provide a flexible and effective method for investigating somatic loss-of-function alterations and their influence on tumorigenesis, we have established CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic gene disruption, allowing for in vivo targeting of TSGs. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by deleting single (Ptch1) or multiple genes (Trp53, Pten, Nf1) in the mouse brain, resulting in the development of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, respectively. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) we characterized the medulloblastoma-driving Ptch1 deletions in detail and show that no off-targets were detected in these tumours. This method provides a fast and convenient system for validating the emerging wealth of novel candidate tumour suppressor genes and the generation of faithful animal models of human cancer.	0
Abstract2class: Palladium(II)-catalyzed ortho alkylation of benzoic acids with alkyl halides Abstract: The first Pd(II)-catalyzed alkylation of aryl C–H bonds is achieved without using a co-oxidant.

Abstract2class: Four-electron oxidation of p-hydroxylaminobenzoate to p-nitrobenzoate by a peroxodiferric complex in AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: The nonheme di-iron oxygenase, AurF, converts p-aminobenzoate (Ar-NH(2), where Ar = 4-carboxyphenyl) to p-nitrobenzoate (Ar-NO(2)) in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic, aureothin, by Streptomyces thioluteus. It has been reported that this net six-electron oxidation proceeds in three consecutive, two-electron steps, through p-hydroxylaminobenzoate (Ar-NHOH) and p-nitrosobenzoate (Ar-NO) intermediates, with each step requiring one equivalent of O(2) and two exogenous reducing equivalents. We recently demonstrated that a peroxodiiron(III/III) complex (peroxo- -AurF) formed by addition of O(2) to the diiron(II/II) enzyme ( -AurF) effects the initial oxidation of Ar-NH(2), generating a mu-(oxo)diiron(III/III) form of the enzyme (mu-oxo- -AurF) and (presumably) Ar-NHOH. Here we show that peroxo- -AurF also oxidizes Ar-NHOH. Unexpectedly, this reaction proceeds through to the Ar-NO(2) final product, a four-electron oxidation, and produces -AurF, with which O(2) can combine to regenerate peroxo- -AurF. Thus, conversion of Ar-NHOH to Ar-NO(2) requires only a single equivalent of O(2) and (starting from -AurF or peroxo- -AurF) is fully catalytic in the absence of exogenous reducing equivalents, by contrast to the published stoichiometry. This novel type of four-electron N-oxidation is likely also to occur in the reaction sequences of nitro-installing di-iron amine oxygenases in the biosyntheses of other natural products.	1
Abstract2class: The alkene monooxygenase from Xanthobacter strain Py2 is closely related to aromatic monooxygenases and catalyzes aromatic monohydroxylation of benzene, toluene, and phenol Abstract: The genes encoding the six polypeptide components of the alkene monooxygenase from Xanthobacter strain Py2 (Xamo) have been located on a 4.9-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA previously cloned in cosmid pNY2. Sequencing and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences indicate that the components of Xamo are homologous to those of the aromatic monooxygenases, toluene 2-, 3-, and 4-monooxygenase and benzene monooxygenase, and that the gene order is identical. The genes and predicted polypeptides are aamA, encoding the 497-residue oxygenase alpha-subunit (XamoA); aamB, encoding the 88-residue oxygenase gamma-subunit (XamoB); aamC, encoding the 122-residue ferredoxin (XamoC); aamD, encoding the 101-residue coupling or effector protein (XamoD); aamE, encoding the 341-residue oxygenase beta-subunit (XamoE); and aamF, encoding the 327-residue reductase (XamoF). A sequence with >60% concurrence with the consensus sequence of sigma54 (RpoN)-dependent promoters was identified upstream of the aamA gene. Detailed comparison of XamoA with the oxygenase alpha-subunits from aromatic monooxygenases, phenol hydroxylases, methane monooxygenase, and the alkene monooxygenase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous B276 showed that, despite the overall similarity to the aromatic monooxygenases, XamoA has some distinctive characteristics of the oxygenases which oxidize aliphatic, and particularly alkene, substrates. On the basis of the similarity between Xamo and the aromatic monooxygenases, Xanthobacter strain Py2 was tested and shown to oxidize benzene, toluene, and phenol, while the alkene monooxygenase-negative mutants NZ1 and NZ2 did not. Benzene was oxidized to phenol, which accumulated transiently before being further oxidized. Toluene was oxidized to a mixture of o-, m-, and p-cresols (39.8, 18, and 41.7%, respectively) and a small amount (0.5%) of benzyl alcohol, none of which were further oxidized. In growth studies Xanthobacter strain Py2 was found to grow on phenol and catechol but not on benzene or toluene; growth on phenol required a functional alkene monooxygenase. However, there is no evidence of genes encoding steps in the metabolism of catechol in the vicinity of the aam gene cluster. This suggests that the inducer specificity of the alkene monooxygenase may have evolved to benefit from the naturally broad substrate specificity of this class of monooxygenase and the ability of the host strain to grow on catechol.	0
Abstract2class: The complete gene cluster of the antitumor agent gilvocarcin V and its implication for the biosynthesis of the gilvocarcins Abstract: Gilvocarcin V, an antitumor agent produced by the bacterium Streptomyces griseoflavus Gö 3592, is the most studied representative of the distinct family of benzo[d]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-one aryl C-glycoside antibiotics, which show excellent antitumor activity and a remarkably low toxicity. Its biosynthesis contains many intriguing steps, including an oxidative rearrangement, the C-glycosylation, and the generation of a vinyl side chain. These steps all contribute to structural elements of the drug, which are essential for its biological activity, but only poorly understood. Herein we report the cloning and characterization of the gilvocarcin (gil) gene cluster from S. griseoflavus Gö 3592, and its heterologous expression in a foreign host (S. lividans). This is the first reported gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of a benzo[d]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-one aryl C-glycoside antibiotic, which not only provides insights regarding the biosynthesis of gilvocarcin V but also lays the foundation for the detailed studies of its intriguing biosynthetic steps and possibly for the generation of gilvocarcin analogues with improved biological activities through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Hydrogen-Bond Symmetrization Breakdown and Dehydrogenation Mechanism of FeO2H at High Pressure Abstract: The cycling of hydrogen plays an important role in the geochemical evolution of our planet. Under high-pressure conditions, asymmetric hydroxyl bonds tend to form a symmetric O-H-O configuration in which H is positioned at the center of two O atoms. The symmetrization of O-H bonds improves their thermal stability and as such, water-bearing minerals can be present deeper in the Earth's lower mantle. However, how exactly H is recycled from the deep mantle remains unclear. Here, we employ first-principles free-energy landscape sampling methods together with high pressure-high temperature experiments to reveal the dehydrogenation mechanism of a water-bearing mineral, FeO2H, at deep mantle conditions. Experimentally, we show that ∼50% H is released from symmetrically hydrogen-bonded ε-FeO2H upon transforming to a pyrite-type phase (Py-phase). By resolving the lowest-energy transition pathway from ε-FeO2H to the Py-phase, we demonstrate that half of the O-H bonds in the mineral rupture during the structural transition, leading toward the breakdown of symmetrized hydrogen bonds and eventual dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the stability of symmetric hydrogen bonds during structural transitions and provides a dehydrogenation mechanism for hydrous minerals existing in the deep mantle.	0
Abstract2class: Unravelling the biosynthesis of pyriculol in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: Pyriculol was isolated from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and found to induce lesion formation on rice leaves. These findings suggest that it could be involved in virulence. The gene MoPKS19 was identified to encode a polyketide synthase essential for the production of the polyketide pyriculol in the rice blast fungus M. oryzae. The transcript abundance of MoPKS19 correlates with the biosynthesis rate of pyriculol in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, gene inactivation of MoPKS19 resulted in a mutant unable to produce pyriculol, pyriculariol and their dihydro derivatives. Inactivation of a putative oxidase-encoding gene MoC19OXR1, which was found to be located in the genome close to MoPKS19, resulted in a mutant exclusively producing dihydropyriculol and dihydropyriculariol. By contrast, overexpression of MoC19OXR1 resulted in a mutant strain only producing pyriculol. The MoPKS19 cluster, furthermore, comprises two transcription factors MoC19TRF1 and MoC19TRF2, which were both found individually to act as negative regulators repressing gene expression of MoPKS19. Additionally, extracts of ΔMopks19 and ΔMoC19oxr1 made from axenic cultures failed to induce lesions on rice leaves compared to extracts of the wild-type strain. Consequently, pyriculol and its isomer pyriculariol appear to be the only lesion-inducing secondary metabolites produced by M. oryzae wild-type (MoWT) under these culture conditions. Interestingly, the mutants unable to produce pyriculol and pyriculariol were as pathogenic as MoWT, demonstrating that pyriculol is not required for infection.	1
Abstract2class: Effects of Swine manure on macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antimicrobial resistance in soils Abstract: Current agricultural practices involve inclusion of antimicrobials in animal feed and result in manure containing antimicrobials and antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. This work evaluated the effects of land application of swine manure on the levels of tetracycline, macrolide, and lincosamide antimicrobials and on macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance in field soil samples and laboratory soil batch tests. MLS(B) and tetracycline antimicrobials were quantified after solid-phase extraction using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The prevalence of the ribosomal modification responsible for MLS(B) resistance in the same samples was quantified using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Macrolide antimicrobials were not detected in soil samples, while tetracyclines were detected, suggesting that the latter compounds persist in soil. No significant differences in ribosomal methylation or presumed MLS(B) resistance were observed when amended and unamended field soils were compared, although a transient (<20-day) increase was observed in most batch tests. Clostridium cluster XIVa accounted for the largest fraction of resistant bacteria identified in amended soils. Overall, this study did not detect a persistent increase in the prevalence of MLS(B) resistance due to land application of treated swine manure.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster from Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus, and it has the same structure as lovastatin, which is mainly produced by Aspergillus terreus. In the present study, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, mps01, was screened from the BAC library constructed from Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 genomic DNA. The putative monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster was found within a 42 kb region in the mps01 clone. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the nine genes designated as mokA- mokI, which share over 54% similarity with the lovastatin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. terreus, were assumed to be involved in monacolin K biosynthesis. A gene disruption construct designed to replace the central part of mokA, a polyketide synthase gene, in wild-type M. pilosus BCRC38072 with a hygromycin B resistance gene through homologous recombination, resulted in a mokA-disrupted strain. The disruptant did not produce monacolin K, indicating that mokA encoded the PKS responsible for monacolin K biosynthesis in M. pilosus BCRC38072.	1
Abstract2class: Scaleable catalytic asymmetric Strecker syntheses of unnatural alpha-amino acids Abstract: Alpha-amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as components of medicinally active molecules and chiral catalysts. Efficient chemo-enzymatic methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched alpha-amino acids have been developed, but it is still a challenge to obtain non-natural amino acids. Alkene hydrogenation is broadly useful for the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of many classes of amino acids, but it is not possible to obtain alpha-amino acids bearing aryl or quaternary alkyl alpha-substituents using this method. The Strecker synthesis-the reaction of an imine or imine equivalent with hydrogen cyanide, followed by nitrile hydrolysis-is an especially versatile chemical method for the synthesis of racemic alpha-amino acids. Asymmetric Strecker syntheses using stoichiometric amounts of a chiral reagent have been applied successfully on gram-to-kilogram scales, yielding enantiomerically enriched alpha-amino acids. In principle, Strecker syntheses employing sub-stoichiometric quantities of a chiral reagent could provide a practical alternative to these approaches, but the reported catalytic asymmetric methods have seen limited use on preparative scales (more than a gram). The limited utility of existing catalytic methods may be due to several important factors, including the relatively complex and precious nature of the catalysts and the requisite use of hazardous cyanide sources. Here we report a new catalytic asymmetric method for the syntheses of highly enantiomerically enriched non-natural amino acids using a simple chiral amido-thiourea catalyst to control the key hydrocyanation step. This catalyst is robust, without sensitive functional groups, so it is compatible with aqueous cyanide salts, which are safer and easier to handle than other cyanide sources; this makes the method adaptable to large-scale synthesis. We have used this new method to obtain enantiopure amino acids that are not readily prepared by enzymatic methods or by chemical hydrogenation.	0
Abstract2class: Induction of Nectriapyrone Biosynthesis in the Rice Blast Fungus Pyricularia oryzae by Disturbance of the Two-Component Signal Transduction System Abstract: Most fungal secondary metabolism genes are poorly expressed under laboratory conditions. Nectriapyrones are known as secondary metabolites produced mainly by symbiotic fungi, including endophytes and plant pathogens. Herein, we show the induction of nectriapyrone production in the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. The two-component signal transduction system was disturbed by disrupting OSM1 and PoYPD1, which encoded a HOG MAP kinase and a His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) protein, respectively. This induced the production of two polyketide compounds: nectriapyrone and its hydroxylated analogue. The nectriapyrone biosynthetic gene cluster consists of a polyketide synthase gene (NEC1) and an O-methyltransferase gene (NEC2). Overexpression of the two genes induced overproduction of nectriapyrone and five nectriapyrone analogues, including a new derivative. Nectriapyrone production was not required for the infection of rice. The structure of nectriapyrone is similar to that of the germicidins produced by Streptomyces spp., and nectriapyrone inhibited the growth of Streptomyces griseus.	1
Abstract2class: Nucleoid condensation and cell division in Escherichia coli MX74T2 ts52 after inhibition of protein synthesis Abstract: The reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid of an Escherichia coli mutant, MX74T2 ts52, was studied by electron microscopy after protein synthesis inhibition by using whole mounts of cell ghosts, ultrathin-sectioning, and freeze-etching. The bacterial nucleoid showed two morphological changes after chloramphenicol addition: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) localization and DNA condensation. DNA localization was observed 10 min after chloramphenicol addition; the DNA appeared as a compact, solid mass. DNA condensation was observed at 25 min; the nucleoid appeared as a cytoplasm-filled sphere, often opened at one end. Ribosomes were observed in the center. Giant nucleoids present in some mutant filaments showed fused, spherical nucleoids arranged linearly, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the nucleoid reflects the number of replicated genomes. Inhibitors which directly or indirectly blocked protein synthesis and caused DNA condensation were chloramphenicol, puromycin, amino acid starvation, rifampicin, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. All inhibitors that caused cell division in the mutant also caused condensation, although some inhibitors caused condensation without cell division. Nucleoid condensation appears to be related to chromosome structure rather than to DNA segregation upon cell division.	0
Abstract2class: Kinetic mechanism of human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 Abstract: Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) is a member of a ubiquitous and ancient branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily. hHint1 is a homodimeric protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of model substrates, phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate, with a high efficiency. Recently, catalytically inactive hHint1 has been identified as the cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy [Zimon, M., et al. (2012) Nat. Genet. 44, 1080-1083]. We have conducted the first detailed kinetic mechanistic studies of hHint1 and have found that the reaction mechanism is consistent with a double-displacement mechanism, in which the active site nucleophile His112 is first adenylylated by the substrate, followed by hydrolysis of the AMP-enzyme intermediate. A transient burst phase followed by a linear phase from the stopped-flow fluorescence assay indicated that enzyme adenylylation was faster than the subsequent intermediate hydrolysis and product release. Solvent viscosity experiments suggested that both chemical transformation and diffusion-sensitive events (product release or protein conformational change) limit the overall turnover. The catalytic trapping experiments and data simulation indicated that the true koff rate of the final product AMP is unlikely to control the overall kcat. Therefore, a protein conformational change associated with product release is likely rate-limiting. In addition, the rate of Hint1 adenylylation was found to be dependent on two residues with pKa values of 6.5 and 8, with the former pKa agreeing well with the nuclear magnetic resonance titration results for the pKa of the active site nucleophile His112. In comparison to the uncatalyzed rates, hHint1 was shown to enhance acyl-AMP and AMP phosphoramidate hydrolysis by 10(6)-10(8)-fold. Taken together, our analysis indicates that hHint1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate with high efficiency, through a mechanism that relies on rapid adenylylation of the active residue, His112, while being partially rate-limited by intermediate hydrolysis and product release associated with a conformational change. Given the high degree of sequence homology of Hint proteins across all kingdoms of life, it is likely that their kinetic and catalytic mechanisms will be similar to those elucidated for hHint1.	0
Abstract2class: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase is required for development and muscle function in Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (SERCA) loads intracellular releasable Ca(2+) stores by transporting cytosolic Ca(2+) into the endoplasmic (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We characterized the only SERCA homologue of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is encoded by the sca-1 gene. The sca-1 transcript is alternatively spliced in a similar mode as the vertebrate SERCA2 transcript, giving rise to two protein variants: CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb. These proteins showed structural and functional conservation to the vertebrate SERCA2a/b proteins. The CeSERCAs were primarily expressed in contractile tissues. Loss of CeSERCA through gene ablation or RNA interference resulted in contractile dysfunctioning and in early larval or embryonic lethality, respectively. Similar defects could be induced pharmacologically using the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, which bound CeSERCA at a conserved site. The conservation of SERCA2 homologues in C. elegans will allow genetic and chemical suppressor analyses to identify promising drug targets and lead molecules for treatment of SERCA-related diseases such as heart disease.	0
Abstract2class: Multiple site-selective insertions of noncanonical amino acids into sequence-repetitive polypeptides Abstract: A simple and efficient method is described for the introduction of noncanonical amino acids at multiple, defined sites within recombinant polypeptide sequences. Escherichia coli MRA30, a bacterial host strain with attenuated activity of release factor 1 (RF1), was assessed for its ability to support incorporation of a diverse range of noncanonical amino acids in response to multiple encoded amber (TAG) codons within genes derived from superfolder GFP and an elastin-mimetic protein polymer. Suppression efficiency and protein yield depended on the identity of the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair and the noncanonical amino acid. Elastin-mimetic protein polymers were prepared in which noncanonical amino acid derivatives were incorporated at up to 22 specific sites within the polypeptide sequence with high substitution efficiency. The identities and positions of the variant residues were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the full-length polypeptides and proteolytic cleavage fragments from thermolysin digestion. The data suggest that this multisite suppression approach permits the preparation of protein-based materials in which novel chemical functionalities can be introduced at precisely defined positions within the polypeptide sequence.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of a macrocyclic peptide containing an unprecedented lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink Abstract: Streptococcal bacteria use peptide signals as a means of intraspecies communication. These peptides can contain unusual post-translational modifications, providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of nature's chemical and biosynthetic repertoires. Here, we have combined tools from natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology to elucidate the structure and biosynthesis of streptide, a streptococcal macrocyclic peptide. We show that streptide bears an unprecedented post-translational modification involving a covalent linkage between two unactivated carbons within the side chains of lysine and tryptophan. The biosynthesis of streptide was addressed by genetic and biochemical studies. The former implicated a new SPASM-domain-containing radical SAM enzyme StrB, while the latter revealed that StrB contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters and installs the unusual lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink in a single step. By intramolecularly stitching together the side chains of lysine and tryptophan, StrB provides a new route for biosynthesizing macrocyclic peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Protein-associated intercalator-induced DNA scission is enhanced by estrogen stimulation in human breast cancer cells Abstract: Estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) displayed a higher frequency of intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA scission after treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) than did cells that had not received estrogen treatment. This effect was dependent on estrogen concentration (maximum enhancement at approximately equal to 1 nM E2) and time (maximum effect seen approximately equal to 24 hr after E2 addition). Human breast cancer cells lacking estrogen receptors did not display the enhanced response. Antiestrogens produced a slight decrease in intercalator-induced DNA scission, whereas insulin produced an enhanced effect. The DNA breaks produced by the intercalators 5-iminodaunorubicin and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) in these cells were undetectable without enzymatic deproteinization of cell lysates prior to quantification by alkaline elution. Intercalator-induced DNA-protein crosslinking also was enhanced in E2-treated MCF-7 cells. Studies with m-[14C]AMSA revealed no estrogen-associated increases in drug uptake. The data suggest that E2 treatment, either by specifically and directly increasing active transcription in chromatin or through secondary effects on DNA that accompany alterations in cell growth or cell cycle distribution, alters the susceptibility of DNA to intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA scission. If this enhanced protein-associated scission is selectively localized to transcriptionally active chromatin, the adsorption of the DNA-bound proteins to membrane filters (DNA-protein crosslinking) may allow identification and isolation of estrogen-regulated gene sequences.	0
Abstract2class: Pan-genome analysis identifies intersecting roles for Pseudomonas specialized metabolites in potato pathogen inhibition Abstract: Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. Pseudomonas spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the Pseudomonas fluorescens population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens Streptomyces scabies and Phytophthora infestans. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with S. scabies inhibition, which was supported by in planta biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of Pseudomonas bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.	1
Abstract2class: Tailoring of glycopeptide scaffolds by the acyltransferases from the teicoplanin and A-40,926 biosynthetic operons Abstract: The teicoplanin acyltransferase (Atf) responsible for N-acylation of the glucosamine moiety to create the teicoplanin lipoglycopeptide scaffold has recently been identified. Here we use that enzyme (tAtf) and the cognate acyltransferase from the related A-40,926 biosynthetic cluster (aAtf) to evaluate specificity for glycopeptide scaffolds and for the acyl-CoA donor. In addition to acylation of 2-aminoglucosyl glycopeptide scaffolds with k(cat) values of 400-2000 min(-1), both Atfs transfer acyl groups to regioisomeric 6-aminoglucosyl scaffolds and to glucosyl scaffolds at rates of 0.2-0.5 min(-1) to create variant lipoglycopeptides. Using the teicoplanin glycosyltransferase tGtfA, tAtf, and GtfD, a glycosyltransferase from the vancomycin producer, it is possible to assemble a novel lipoglycopeptide with GlcNAc at beta-OH-Tyr(6) and an N(6)-acyl-glucosaminyl-vancosamine at Phegly(4). This study illustrates the utility of chemo- and regioselective acyltransferases and glycosyltransferases to create novel lipoglycopeptides.	1
Abstract2class: Direct measurement of free radical generation following reperfusion of ischemic myocardium Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to directly measure free radical generation in perfused rabbit hearts. Hearts were freeze-clamped at 77 degrees K during control perfusion, after 10 min of normothermic global ischemia (no coronary flow), or following post-ischemic reperfusion with oxygenated perfusate. The spectra of these hearts exhibited three different signals with different power saturation and temperature stability: signal A was isotropic with g = 2.004; signal B was anisotropic with axial symmetry with g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005; signal C was an isotropic triplet with g = 2.000 and hyperfine splitting an = 24 G (1 G = 0.1 mT). The g values, linewidth, power saturation, and temperature stability of signal A are identical to those of a carbon-centered semiquinone, whereas those of signal B are similar to alkyl peroxyl or superoxide oxygen-centered free radicals; signal C is most likely a nitrogen-centered free radical. In the control heart samples signal A predominated, whereas in ischemic hearts signal A decreased in intensity, and signals B and C became more intense; with reperfusion all three signals markedly increased. Free radical concentrations derived from the intensities of the B and C signals peaked 10 sec after initiation of reflow. At this time the oxygen-centered free radical concentration derived from the intensity of signal B was increased over six times the concentration measured in control hearts and over two times the concentration measured in ischemic hearts. Hypoxic reperfusion did not increase any of the free radical signals over the levels observed during ischemia. These experiments directly demonstrate that reactive oxygen-centered free radicals are generated in hearts during ischemia and that a burst of oxygen radical generation occurs within moments of reperfusion.	0
Abstract2class: An in planta-expressed polyketide synthase produces (R)-mellein in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: Parastagonospora nodorum is a pathogen of wheat that affects yields globally. Previous transcriptional analysis identified a partially reducing polyketide synthase (PR-PKS) gene, SNOG_00477 (SN477), in P. nodorum that is highly upregulated during infection of wheat leaves. Disruption of the corresponding SN477 gene resulted in the loss of production of two compounds, which we identified as (R)-mellein and (R)-O-methylmellein. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast heterologous expression system, we successfully demonstrated that SN477 is the only enzyme required for the production of (R)-mellein. This is the first identification of a fungal PKS that is responsible for the synthesis of (R)-mellein. The P. nodorum ΔSN477 mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type strain in its virulence against wheat. However, (R)-mellein at 200 μg/ml inhibited the germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seeds. Comparative sequence analysis identified the presence of mellein synthase (MLNS) homologues in several Dothideomycetes and two sodariomycete genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the MLNSs in fungi and bacteria evolved convergently from fungal and bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthases.	1
Abstract2class: An interactive regulatory network controls stress response in Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 Abstract: Members of the genus Bifidobacterium are gram-positive bacteria that commonly are found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of mammals, including humans. Because of their perceived probiotic properties, they frequently are incorporated as functional ingredients in food products. From probiotic production to storage and GIT delivery, bifidobacteria encounter a plethora of stresses. To cope with these environmental challenges, they need to protect themselves through stress-induced adaptive responses. We have determined the response of B. breve UCC2003 to various stresses (heat, osmotic, and solvent) using transcriptome analysis, DNA-protein interactions, and GusA reporter fusions, and we combined these with results from an in silico analysis. The integration of these results allowed the formulation of a model for an interacting regulatory network for stress response in B. breve UCC2003 where HspR controls the SOS response and the ClgR regulon, which in turn regulates and is regulated by HrcA. This model of an interacting regulatory network is believed to represent the paradigm for stress adaptation in bifidobacteria.	0
Abstract2class: A signal for endoplasmic reticulum retention located at the carboxyl terminus of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 4CI Abstract: The plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 4b (PMCA4CI) with truncations in the cytoplasmically exposed COOH-terminal tail was expressed in COS and HeLa cells and in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. The truncated protein terminating with the acidic sequence Glu1067-Arg1087 was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas mutants lacking this sequence or having it at a distance from the COOH terminus were delivered to the plasma membrane. Although the truncated protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum was still able to form a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoenzyme, it underwent partial degradation. Substitution of glutamic and aspartic residue(s) in the acidic region promoted rescue of the protein to the plasma membrane. The results suggest that the sequence Glu1067-Arg1087 encodes a masked signal for ER retention and for the degradation of the protein. However, its presence at the COOH terminus was not sufficient to induce ER-retention and degradation; when the sequence was attached to the full-length PMCA protein, normal plasma delivery was observed. Evidently, ER retention and degradation required the presence of the sequence in its specific location within the PMCA structure. The degradation of the protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum occurred through the proteolytic attack at cytoplasmically exposed residues (amino acid sequence 720-750) by a cytoplasmic PEST sequence-related protease different from calpain.	0
Abstract2class: 7-Step Flow Synthesis of the HIV Integrase Inhibitor Dolutegravir Abstract: Dolutegravir (DTG), an important active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV, has been synthesized in continuous flow. By adapting the reported GlaxoSmithKline process chemistry batch route for Cabotegravir, DTG was produced in 4.5 h in sequential flow operations from commercially available materials. Key features of the synthesis include rapid manufacturing time for pyridone formation, one-step direct amidation of a functionalized pyridone, and telescoping of multiple steps to avoid isolation of intermediates and enable for greater throughput.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Nematophin and Its Elongated Derivatives in Entomopathogenic Bacteria Abstract: Nematophin, a known antibiotic natural product against Staphylococcus aureus for almost 20 years, is produced by all strains of Xenorhabdus nematophila. Despite its simple structure, its biosynthesis was unknown. Its biosynthetic pathway is reported using heterologous production in Escherichia coli. Additionally, the identification, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of six extended nematophin derivatives from Xenorhabdus PB62.4 carrying an additional valine are reported. Preliminary bioactivity studies suggest a biological role of these compounds in the bacteria-nematode-insect symbiosis.	1
Abstract2class: A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of moenomycin family antibiotics in the genome of teicoplanin producer Actinoplanes teichomyceticus Abstract: Moenomycins are phosphoglycolipid antibiotics notable for their extreme potency, unique mode of action, and proven record of use in animal nutrition without selection for resistant microflora. There is a keen interest in manipulation of structures of moenomycins in order to better understand their structure-activity relationships and to generate improved analogs. Only two almost identical moenomycin biosynthetic gene clusters are known, limiting our knowledge of the evolution of moenomycin pathways and our ability to genetically diversify them. Here, we report a novel gene cluster (tchm) that directs production of the phosphoglycolipid teichomycin in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Its overall genetic architecture is significantly different from that of the moenomycin biosynthesis (moe) gene clusters of Streptomyces ghanaensis and Streptomyces clavuligerus, featuring multiple gene rearrangements and two novel structural genes. Involvement of the tchm cluster in teichomycin biosynthesis was confirmed via heterologous co-expression of amidotransferase tchmH5 and moe genes. Our work sets the background for further engineering of moenomycins and for deeper inquiries into the evolution of this fascinating biosynthetic pathway.	1

Abstract2class: Fluorescent Probes with Unnatural Amino Acids to Monitor Proteasome Activity in Real-Time Abstract: The proteasome is an essential protein complex that, when dysregulated, can result in various diseases in eukaryotic cells. As such, understanding the enzymatic activity of the proteasome and what can alter it is crucial to elucidating its roles in these diseases. This can be done effectively by using activity-based fluorescent substrate probes, of which there are many commercially available that target the individual protease-like subunits in the 20S CP of the proteasome. Unfortunately, these probes have not displayed appropriate characteristics for their use in live cell-based assays. In the work presented here, we have developed a set of probes which have shown improved fluorescence properties and selectivity toward the proteasome compared to other cellular proteases. By including unnatural amino acids, we have found probes which can be utilized in various applications, including monitoring the effects of small molecule stimulators of the proteasome in live cells and comparing the relative proteasome activity across different cancer cell types. In future studies, we expect the fluorescent probes presented here will serve as tools to support the discovery and characterization of small molecule modulators of proteasome activity.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular genetic characterization of a cluster in A. terreus for biosynthesis of the meroterpenoid terretonin Abstract: Meroterpenoids are natural products produced from polyketide and terpenoid precursors. A gene targeting system for A. terreus NIH2624 was developed, and a gene cluster for terretonin biosynthesis was characterized. The intermediates and shunt products were isolated from the mutant strains, and a pathway for terretonin biosynthesis is proposed. Analysis of two meroterpenoid pathways corresponding to terretonin in A. terreus and austinol in A. nidulans reveals that they are closely related evolutionarily.	1
Abstract2class: Selective inhibition by 2-bromoethanesulfonate of methanogenesis from acetate in a thermophilic anaerobic digestor Abstract: The effects of 2-bromoethanesulfonate, an inhibitor of methanogenesis, on metabolism in sludge from a thermophilic (58 degrees C) anaerobic digestor were studied. It was found from short-term experiments that 1 mumol of 2-bromoethanesulfonate per ml completely inhibited methanogenesis from CH(3)COO, whereas 50 mumol/ml was required for complete inhibition of CO(2) reduction. When 1 mumol of 2-bromoethanesulfonate per ml was added to actively metabolizing sludge which was then incubated for 24 h. it caused a 60% reduction in methanogenesis and a corresponding increase in acetate accumulation; at 50 mumol/ml it caused complete inhibition of methanogenesis and accumulation of acetate.

Abstract2class: Fosfomycin suppresses RS-virus-induced Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells via the platelet-activating factor receptor Abstract: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sometimes causes acute and severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. The platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, is upregulated by RSV infection in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Fosfomycin, an antimicrobial agent, significantly suppressed PAF receptor induction by RSV infection at the mRNA and cell surface expression levels. Fosfomycin also suppressed RSV-induced adhesion of fluorescence-labeled S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae cells, as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The RSV-induced bacterial adhesion was suggested to be host-PAF-receptor and bacterial-phosphocholine mediated. Fosfomycin, which has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found here to suppress adhesion by disease-causing bacteria. Thus, fosfomycin might prevent secondary bacterial infection during RSV infection.	0
Abstract2class: Fluostatins produced by the heterologous expression of a TAR reassembled environmental DNA derived type II PKS gene cluster Abstract: Culture independent approaches for accessing small molecules produced by uncultured bacteria are often hampered by the inability to easily clone environmental DNA (eDNA) fragments large enough to capture intact biosynthetic gene clusters that can be used in heterologous expression studies. Here we show that homology screening of eDNA megalibraries for clones containing natural product biosynthetic genes, coupled with transformation-assisted recombination (TAR) in yeast, can be used to access large, functionally intact, natural product gene clusters from the environment. The eDNA derived gene cluster reported here was functionally reconstructed from two overlapping cosmid clones using TAR. The isolation and structure elucidation of three new fluostatins (F, G, and H) produced by this TAR reconstructed gene cluster is described.	1
Abstract2class: Autoproteolytic fragments are intermediates in the oligomerization/aggregation of the Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein as revealed by ion mobility mass spectrometry Abstract: Gas-phase protein separation by ion mobility: With its ability to separate the Parkinson's disease protein α-synuclein and its autoproteolytic products-despite the small concentrations of the latter-ion-mobility MS has enabled the characterization of intermediate fragments in in vitro oligomerization-aggregation. In particular, a possible key fragment, the highly aggregating C-terminal fragment, αSyn(72-140), has been revealed.	0
Abstract2class: Epoxyquinone formation catalyzed by a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase involved in biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aromatic polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin (ACT) in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) carries a pair of genes, actVA-ORF5 and actVB, that encode a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO). Our previous studies have demonstrated that the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system functions as a quinone-forming C-6 oxygenase in ACT biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that this enzyme system exhibits an additional oxygenation activity with dihydrokalafungin (DHK), a proposed intermediate in the ACT biosynthetic pathway, and generates two reaction products. These compounds were revealed to be monooxygenated derivatives of kalafungin, which is spontaneously formed through oxidative lactonization of DHK. Their absolute structures were elucidated from their NMR spectroscopic data and by computer modeling and X-ray crystallography as (5S,14R)-epoxykalafungin and (5R,14S)-epoxykalafungin, demonstrating an additional epoxyquinone-forming activity of the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system in vitro.	1
Abstract2class: Periplasmic Cytophaga hutchinsonii Endoglucanases Are Required for Use of Crystalline Cellulose as the Sole Source of Carbon and Energy Abstract: The soil bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii actively digests crystalline cellulose by a poorly understood mechanism. Genome analyses identified nine genes predicted to encode endoglucanases with roles in this process. No predicted cellobiohydrolases, which are usually involved in the utilization of crystalline cellulose, were identified. Chromosomal deletions were performed in eight of the endoglucanase-encoding genes: cel5A, cel5B, cel5C, cel9A, cel9B, cel9C, cel9E, and cel9F Each mutant retained the ability to digest crystalline cellulose, although the deletion of cel9C caused a modest decrease in cellulose utilization. Strains with multiple deletions were constructed to identify the critical cellulases. Cells of a mutant lacking both cel5B and cel9C were completely deficient in growth on cellulose. Cell fractionation and biochemical analyses indicate that Cel5B and Cel9C are periplasmic nonprocessive endoglucanases. The requirement of periplasmic endoglucanases for cellulose utilization suggests that cellodextrins are transported across the outer membrane during this process. Bioinformatic analyses predict that Cel5A, Cel9A, Cel9B, Cel9D, and Cel9E are secreted across the outer membrane by the type IX secretion system, which has been linked to cellulose utilization. These secreted endoglucanases may perform the initial digestion within amorphous regions on the cellulose fibers, releasing oligomers that are transported into the periplasm for further digestion by Cel5B and Cel9C. The results suggest that both cell surface and periplasmic endoglucanases are required for the growth of C. hutchinsonii on cellulose and that novel cell surface proteins may solubilize and transport cellodextrins across the outer membrane.                  Importance:                       The bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii digests crystalline cellulose by an unknown mechanism. It lacks processive cellobiohydrolases that are often involved in cellulose digestion. Critical cellulolytic enzymes were identified by genetic analyses. Intracellular (periplasmic) nonprocessive endoglucanases performed an important role in cellulose utilization. The results suggest a model involving partial digestion at the cell surface, solubilization and uptake of cellodextrins across the outer membrane by an unknown mechanism, and further digestion within the periplasm. The ability to sequester cellodextrins and digest them intracellularly may limit losses of soluble cellobiose to other organisms. C. hutchinsonii uses an unusual approach to digest cellulose and is a potential source of novel proteins to increase the efficiency of conversion of cellulose into soluble sugars and biofuels.	0
Abstract2class: De novo biosynthesis of terminal alkyne-labeled natural products Abstract: The terminal alkyne is a functionality widely used in organic synthesis, pharmaceutical science, material science and bioorthogonal chemistry. This functionality is also found in acetylenic natural products, but the underlying biosynthetic pathways for its formation are not well understood. Here we report the characterization of what is to our knowledge the first carrier protein-dependent terminal alkyne biosynthetic machinery in microbes. We further demonstrate that this enzymatic machinery can be exploited for the in situ generation and incorporation of terminal alkynes into two natural product scaffolds in Escherichia coli. These results highlight the prospect for tagging major classes of natural products, including polyketides and polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrids, using biosynthetic pathway engineering.	0
Abstract2class: A squalene epoxidase is involved in biosynthesis of both the antitumor compound clavaric acid and sterols in the basidiomycete H. sublateritium Abstract: The basidiomycete Hypholoma sublateritium produces the triterpenoid antitumor clavaric acid, an inhibitor of the human Ras-farnesyl transferase. The H. sublateritium squalene epoxidase gene (erg1) has been cloned and shown to encode a flavoprotein monooxygenase that requires FAD, NADPH, and P450 cofactors. Silencing of the erg1 gene in H. sublateritium using constructions expressed from the gdh promoter of Agaricus bisporus showed that the squalene epoxidase is involved in clavaric acid formation and in ergosterol biosynthesis; silenced expression of erg1 resulted in an ergosterol-dependent phenotype for full growth. Overexpression of erg1 gene resulted in up to 32% to 97% increment of clavaric acid production confirming its involvement in the biosynthesis of this antitumor product. Oxidosqualene (or dioxidosqualene) appears to be the branching point for primary metabolism (sterols) and secondary metabolites in basidiomycetes.	1
Abstract2class: Analysis of a Coxiella burnetti gene product that activates capsule synthesis in Escherichia coli: requirement for the heat shock chaperone DnaK and the two-component regulator RcsC Abstract: A 1.2-kb EcoRI genomic DNA fragment of Coxiella burnetti, when cloned onto a multicopy plasmid, was found to induce capsule synthesis (mucoidy) in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 270 amino acids. Insertion of a tet cassette into a unique NruI restriction site resulted in the loss of induction of mucoidy. Because of its ability to induce mucoidy, we designated this gene mucZ. Computer search for homologies to mucZ revealed 42% identity to an open reading frame located at 1 min of the E. coli chromosome. Interestingly, the C-terminal amino acid residues of MucZ share significant homology with the J domain of the DnaJ protein and its homologs, suggesting potential interactions between MucZ and components of the DnaK-chaperone machinery. Results presented in this paper suggest that E. coli requires DnaK-chaperone machinery for Lon-RcsA-mediated induction of capsule synthesis, as noticed first by S. Gottesman (personal communication). The induction caused by MucZ is independent of Lon-RcsA and is mediated through the two-component regulators RcsC and RcsB. DnaK and GrpE but not DnaJ are also required for the RcsB-mediated MucZ induction, and we propose that MucZ is a DnaJ-like chaperone protein that might be required for the formation of an active RcsA-RcsB complex and for the RcsC-dependent phosphorylation of RcsB. Discussions are presented that suggest three different roles for alternative forms of the DnaK-chaperone machinery in capsule production.	0
Abstract2class: Forming quasicrystals by monodisperse soft core particles Abstract: In traditional approaches to form quasicrystals, multiple competing length scales involved in particle size, shape, or interaction potential are believed to be necessary. It is unexpected that quasicrystals can be formed by monodisperse, isotropic particles interacting via a simple potential that does not contain explicit multiple length scales to stabilize quasicrystals. Here, we report the surprising finding of the formation of such quasicrystals in high-density systems of soft-core particles. Although there are length scales naturally introduced in our model systems, they do not establish the quasicrystalline order. In two dimensions, we find not only dodecagonal but also octagonal quasicrystals, which have not been found yet in soft quasicrystals. In such unexpected quasicrystals, particles tend to form pentagons, which are essential elements to develop the quasicrystalline order. Our findings thus pave an unexpected and simple way to form quasicrystals and pose a challenge for theoretical understanding of quasicrystals.	0
Abstract2class: A Fasciclin Protein Is Essential for Laccase-Mediated Selective Phenol Coupling in Sporandol Biosynthesis Abstract: The biaryl scaffold, often showing axial chirality, is a common feature of various fungal natural products. Their biosynthesis requires an oxidative phenol-coupling reaction usually catalyzed by laccases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, or peroxidases. The combination of a laccase and a fasciclin domain-containing (fas) protein is encoded in many biosynthetic gene clusters of biaryls from ascomycetes. However, such phenol-coupling systems including their regio- and stereoselectivity have not been characterized so far. Elucidating the biosynthesis of the antiparasitic binaphthalene sporandol from Chrysosporium merdarium, we demonstrate the combination of a laccase and a fas protein to be crucial for the dimerization reaction. Only the heterologous coproduction of the laccase and the fas protein led to a functional phenol-coupling system, whereas the laccase alone showed no coupling activity. Thus, the laccase/fas protein combination forms an independent group of phenol-coupling enzymes that determines the coupling activity and selectivity of the reaction concurrently and applies to the biosynthesis of many fungal natural products with a biaryl scaffold.	1
Abstract2class: Functions of genes and enzymes involved in phenalinolactone biosynthesis Abstract: Phenalinolactones are novel terpene glycoside antibiotics produced by Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. Inactivation of three oxygenase genes (plaO2, plaO3 and plaO5), two dehydrogenase genes (plaU, plaZ) and one putative acetyltransferase gene (plaV) led to the production of novel phenalinolactone derivatives (PL HS6, PL HS7, PL HS2 and PL X1). Furthermore, the exact biosynthetic functions of two enzymes were determined, and their in vitro activities were demonstrated. PlaO1, an Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, is responsible for the key step in gamma-butyrolactone formation, whereas PlaO5, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase, catalyses the 1-C-hydroxylation of phenalinolactone D. In addition, stable isotope feeding experiments with biosynthetic precursors shed light on the origin of the carbons in the gamma-butyrolactone moiety.	1
Abstract2class: A Transmissible Plasmid-Borne Pathogenicity Island Confers Piscibactin Biosynthesis in the Fish Pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida Abstract: The fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida produces the siderophore piscibactin. A gene cluster that resembles the Yersinia high-pathogenicity island (HPI) encodes piscibactin biosynthesis. Here, we report that this HPI-like cluster is part of a hitherto-uncharacterized 68-kb plasmid dubbed pPHDP70. This plasmid lacks homologs of genes that mediate conjugation, but we found that it could be transferred at low frequencies from P. damselae subsp. piscicida to a mollusk pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus strain and to other Gram-negative bacteria, likely dependent on the conjugative functions of the coresident plasmid pPHDP60. Following its conjugative transfer, pPHDP70 restored the capacity of a vibrioferrin mutant of V. alginolyticus to grow under low-iron conditions, and piscibactin became detectable in its supernatant. Thus, pPHDP70 appears to harbor all the genes required for piscibactin biosynthesis and transport. P. damselae subsp. piscicida strains cured of pPHDP70 no longer produced piscibactin, had impaired growth under iron-limited conditions, and exhibited markedly decreased virulence in fish. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of pPHDP70, with its capacity for piscibactin-mediated iron acquisition, in the virulence of P. damselae subsp. piscicida. Horizontal transmission of this plasmid-borne piscibactin synthesis gene cluster in the marine environment may facilitate the emergence of new pathogens.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. V. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)-acetamido]-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-azetidinones having various functional groups at C-4 position of beta-lactam Abstract: The synthesis and antibacterial activity of the 3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)acetamido]-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-azetidinones++ + having various functional groups at C-4 position of beta-lactam are described. These compounds exhibited a strong activity against a variety of Gram-negative bacteria including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Among various C-4 substituents explored, the fluoromethyl and carbamoyloxymethyl moiety were found to increase the activity.	0
Abstract2class: Allosteric pathways in tetrahydrofolate sensing riboswitch with dynamics correlation network Abstract: Riboswitches are cis-acting genetic control elements. Due to their fundamental importance in bacteria gene regulation, they have been proposed as antibacterial drug targets. Tetrahydrofolate (THF) is an essential cofactor of one-carbon transfer reactions and downregulates the expression of downstream genes. However, information on how to transfer from the binding site of THF to the expression platform is still unavailable. Herein, a nucleotide/nucleotide dynamics correlation network based on an all-atom molecular dynamic simulation was used to reveal the regulation mechanism of a THF-sensing riboswitch. Shortest pathway analysis based on the network illustrates that there is an allosteric pathway through the P2 helix to the pseudoknot, then to the P1 helix in the THF-riboswitch. Thus the hypothesis of "THF-binding induced allosteric switching" was proposed and evaluated using THF and pseudoknot weakened experiments. Furthermore, a possible allosteric pathway of C30-C31-G33-A34-G35-G36-G37-A38-G48-G47-U46-A90-U91-C92-G93-C94-G95-C96 was identified and confirmed through the perturbation of the network. The proposed allosteric mechanism and the underlying allosteric pathway provide fundamental insights for the regulation of THF sensing riboswitches.	0
Abstract2class: Steric Enforcement of cis-Epoxide Formation in the Radical C-O-Coupling Reaction by Which ( S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonate Epoxidase (HppE) Produces Fosfomycin Abstract: (S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonate [(S)-2-HPP, 1] epoxidase (HppE) reduces H2O2 at its nonheme-iron cofactor to install the oxirane "warhead" of the antibiotic fosfomycin. The net replacement of the C1 pro-R hydrogen of 1 by its C2 oxygen, with inversion of configuration at C1, yields the cis-epoxide of the drug [(1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonic acid (cis-Fos, 2)]. Here we show that HppE achieves ∼95% selectivity for C1 inversion and cis-epoxide formation via steric guidance of a radical-coupling mechanism. Published structures of the HppE·FeII·1 and HppE·ZnII·2 complexes reveal distinct pockets for C3 of the substrate and product and identify four hydrophobic residues-Leu120, Leu144, Phe182, and Leu193-close to C3 in one of the complexes. Replacement of Leu193 in the substrate C3 pocket with the bulkier Phe enhances stereoselectivity (cis:trans ∼99:1), whereas the Leu120Phe substitution in the product C3 pocket diminishes it (∼82:18). Retention of C1 configuration and trans-epoxide formation become predominant with the bulk-reducing Phe182Ala substitution in the substrate C3 pocket (∼13:87), trifluorination of C3 (∼23:77), or both (∼1:99). The effect of C3 trifluorination is counteracted by the more constrained substrate C3 pockets in the Leu193Phe (∼56:44) and Leu144Phe/Leu193Phe (∼90:10) variants. The ability of HppE to epoxidize substrate analogues bearing halogens at C3, C1, or both is inconsistent with a published hypothesis of polar cyclization via a C1 carbocation. Rather, specific enzyme-substrate contacts drive inversion of the C1 radical-as proposed in a recent computational study-to direct formation of the more potently antibacterial cis-epoxide by radicaloid C-O coupling.	0
Abstract2class: Structure-Activity Relationships for the Marine Natural Product Sintokamides: Androgen Receptor N-Terminus Antagonists of Interest for Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Abstract: Synthetic analogues of the marine natural product sintokamides have been prepared in order to investigate the structure-activity relationships for the androgen receptor N-terminal domain (AR NTD) antagonist activity of the sintokamide scaffold. An in vitro LNCaP cell-based transcriptional activity assay with an androgen-driven luciferase (Luc) reporter was used to monitor the potency of analogues. The data have shown that the chlorine atoms on the leucine side chains are essential for potent activity. Analogues missing the nonchlorinated methyl groups of the leucine side chains (C-1 and C-17) are just as active and in some cases more active than the natural products. Analogues with the natural R configuration at C-10 and the unnatural R configuration at C-4 are most potent. Replacing the natural propionamide N-terminus cap with the more sterically hindered pivaloylamide N-terminus cap leads to enhanced potency. The tetramic acid fragment and the methyl ether on the tetramic acid fragment are essential for activity. The SAR optimized analogue 76 is more selective, easier to synthesize, more potent, and presumed to be more resistant to proteolysis than the natural sintokamides.	0
Abstract2class: Utilization of the methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus for cloning of the tautomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus Abstract: Tautomycin (TTM), a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, consists of a polyketide chain containing a spiroketal moiety and an acyl chain bearing a dialkylmaleic anhydride structure. PCR using degenerate primers was used to clone genes from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus for formation of the methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein. This locus was found to contain five genes (ttmC, ttmA, ttmD, ttmB, and ttmE), one of which was used as a probe to clone the 110-kb TTM biosynthetic gene cluster. The involvement of the ttmA gene in TTM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and mutation complementation experiments.	1
Abstract2class: The mildiomycin biosynthesis: initial steps for sequential generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytidine 5'-monophosphate and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Streptoverticillium rimofaciens ZJU5119 Abstract: Mildiomycin (MIL) is a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic with strong activity against powdery mildew disease of plants. We have cloned the MIL biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptoverticillum rimofaciens ZJU5119 and shown that this organism also produces the related antifungal compound, deshydroxymethyl mildiomycin (dHM-MIL). A cosmid genomic library was screened for a putative nucleotide hydrolase gene that is related to blsM from the blasticidin S cluster. Six cosmids were identified that contained a 3.5 kb DNA fragment that harbors a homologue of blsM. The sequence of the fragment revealed two open-reading frames that are likely to function in MIL formation: milA is a CMP hydroxymethylase gene and milB is the homologue of the CMP hydrolase gene blsM. Insertional disruption of milA abolished the production of MIL but not dHM-MIL, whereas a milB knockout strain did not produce either of the peptidyl nucleosides. Recombinant MilA was produced in E. coli and shown to specifically introduce a C-5 hydroxymethyl group on CMP, but it did not accept cytosine or dCMP as a substrate. MilB was also expressed and purified from E. coli and shown to efficiently hydrolyze both hydroxymethyl-CMP (HMCMP) and could accept CMP as an alternative substrate. The ratio of free HMC and cytosine released by MilB was ca. 9:1 in in vitro assays, and is consistent with the higher levels of MIL compared to dHM-MIL that are produced by Streptoverticillum rimofaciens.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Abstract2class: Characteristics and activity analysis of epothilone operon promoters from Sorangium cellulosum strains in Escherichia coli Abstract: The epothilones, compounds with anticancer mechanisms similar to that of paclitaxel (Taxol), are produced by strains of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, and the gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis is organised as a large operon. In this work, we showed that the 440-bp promoter regions of the operons from eight S. cellulosum strains have 94.27 % DNA sequence identity and 50 % variability in promoter activity in Escherichia coli. A primer extension analysis revealed two transcriptional start sites (TSSs) at 246 (TSS1) and 193 bp (TSS2) upstream of the translation start site (TLS), respectively. Promoter truncation determined that the basal promoter from the So0157-2 strain is located within a 264-bp region containing weak promoter activity; whereas in the 38-bp region upstream, the 264-bp promoter was required for the strong promoter activity, which was dramatically increased by 11-fold in average. There was a conserved stem-loop structure between TSS2 and the TLS, which was identified in E. coli as a negative regulatory element. In addition, the upstream non-conserved 357-bp non-coding region contributes to the promoter activity, increasing it by 1.5-fold. In conclusion, the expression of the epothilone operon non-coding region in E. coli is regulated by a double promoter (with -35 and -10 regions and two distinct TSSs), a stem-loop structure, and a distal non-coding region.	1
Abstract2class: Binding of ISRIB reveals a regulatory site in the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B Abstract: The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved translational and transcriptional program affecting metabolism, memory, and immunity. The ISR is mediated by stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) that attenuates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. A chemical inhibitor of the ISR, ISRIB, reverses the attenuation of eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2α, protecting mice from neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury. We describe a 4.1-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human eIF2B with an ISRIB molecule bound at the interface between the β and δ regulatory subunits. Mutagenesis of residues lining this pocket altered the hierarchical cellular response to ISRIB analogs in vivo and ISRIB binding in vitro. Our findings point to a site in eIF2B that can be exploited by ISRIB to regulate translation.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of ilamycins featuring unusual building blocks and engineered production of enhanced anti-tuberculosis agents Abstract: Tuberculosis remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, novel anti-tuberculosis agents are urgently needed due to severe drug resistance and the co-epidemic of tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus. Here, we show the isolation of six anti-mycobacterial ilamycin congeners (1-6) bearing rare L-3-nitro-tyrosine and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic acid structural units from the deep sea-derived Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16. The biosynthesis of the rare L-3-nitrotyrosine and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic acid units as well as three pre-tailoring and two post-tailoring steps are probed in the ilamycin biosynthetic machinery through a series of gene inactivation, precursor chemical complementation, isotope-labeled precursor feeding experiments, as well as structural elucidation of three intermediates (6-8) from the respective mutants. Most impressively, ilamycins E1/E2, which are produced in high titers by a genetically engineered mutant strain, show very potent anti-tuberculosis activity with an minimum inhibitory concentration value ≈9.8 nM to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv constituting extremely potent and exciting anti-tuberculosis drug leads.Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, novel anti-TB agents are urgently needed due to severe drug resistance and the co-epidemic of TB/HIV. Here, the authors show that anti-mycobacterial ilamycin congeners bearing unusual structural units possess extremely potent anti-tuberculosis activities.	1
Abstract2class: Bioreductively Activatable Prodrug Conjugates of Combretastatin A-1 and Combretastatin A-4 as Anticancer Agents Targeted toward Tumor-Associated Hypoxia Abstract: The natural products combretastatin A-1 (CA1) and combretastatin A-4 (CA4) function as potent inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and as selective vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) in tumors. Bioreductively activatable prodrug conjugates (BAPCs) can enhance selectivity by serving as substrates for reductase enzymes specifically in hypoxic regions of tumors. A series of CA1-BAPCs incorporating nor-methyl, mono-methyl, and gem-dimethyl nitrothiophene triggers were synthesized together with corresponding CA4-BAPCs, previously reported by Davis (Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006, 5 (11), 2886), for comparison. The CA4-gem-dimethylnitrothiophene BAPC 45 proved exemplary in comparison to its nor-methyl 43 and mono-methyl 44 congeners. It was stable in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 24 h), was cleaved (25%, 90 min) by NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), was inactive (desirable prodrug attribute) as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization (IC50 > 20 μM), and demonstrated hypoxia-selective activation in the A549 cell line [hypoxia cytotoxicity ratio (HCR) = 41.5]. The related CA1-gem-dimethylnitrothiophene BAPC 41 was also promising (HCR = 12.5) with complete cleavage (90 min) upon treatment with POR. In a preliminary in vivo dynamic bioluminescence imaging study, BAPC 45 (180 mg/kg, ip) induced a decrease (within 4 h) in light emission in a 4T1 syngeneic mouse breast tumor model, implying activation and vascular disruption.	0
Abstract2class: Discovery of a Mosaic-Like Biosynthetic Assembly Line with a Decarboxylative Off-Loading Mechanism through a Combination of Genome Mining and Imaging Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the antiplasmodial natural product siphonazole was identified by using a combination of genome mining, imaging, and expression studies in the natural producer Herpetosiphon sp. B060. The siphonazole backbone is assembled from an unusual starter unit from the shikimate pathway that is extended by the action of polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases with unusual domain structures, including several split modules and a large number of duplicated domains and domains predicted to be inactive. Product release proceeds through decarboxylation and dehydration independent of the thioesterase SphJ and yields the diene terminus of siphonazole. High variation in terms of codon-usage within the gene cluster, together with the dislocated domain organization, suggest a recent emergence in evolutionary terms.	1
Abstract2class: Characterization of yatakemycin gene cluster revealing a radical S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase and highlighting spirocyclopropane biosynthesis Abstract: Yatakemycin (YTM), an antitumor natural product, represents the most potent member of a class of potent anticancer natural products including CC-1065 and duocarmycins. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of YTM, which was identified by genome scanning of Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356. This cluster consists of 31 open reading frames (ORFs) and was localized to a 36 kb DNA segment. Moreover, its involvement in YTM biosynthesis was confirmed by cluster deletion, gene replacement, and complementation. Inactivation of ytkT, which encodes a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein, created a mutant strain that failed to produce YTM but accumulated a new metabolite, which was structurally elucidated as a precursor that was related to the formation of the cyclopropane ring. More importantly, biochemical characterization of the radical SAM-dependent enzyme YtkT revealed that it is a novel C-methyltransferase and contributes to an advanced intermediate during formation of the cyclopropane ring through a radical mechanism in the YTM biosynthetic pathway. On the basis of in silico analysis, genetic experiments, structure elucidation of the novel intermediate, and biochemical characterization, a biosynthetic pathway for yatakemycin was proposed, which sets the stage to further investigate the novel enzymatic mechanisms and engineer the biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues.	1
Abstract2class: Precursor peptide-targeted mining of more than one hundred thousand genomes expands the lanthipeptide natural product family Abstract: Background:                       Lanthipeptides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide group of natural products and have a variety of biological activities ranging from antibiotics to antinociceptives. These peptides are cyclized through thioether crosslinks and can bear other secondary post-translational modifications. While lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters can be identified by the presence of genes encoding characteristic enzymes involved in the post-translational modification process, locating the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters is challenging due to their short length and high sequence variability, which limits the high-throughput exploration of lanthipeptide biosynthesis. To address this challenge, we enhanced the predictive capabilities of Rapid ORF Description & Evaluation Online (RODEO) to identify members of all four known classes of lanthipeptides.                  Results:                       Using RODEO, we mined over 100,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes in the RefSeq database. We identified nearly 8500 lanthipeptide precursor peptides. These precursor peptides were identified in a broad range of bacterial phyla as well as the Euryarchaeota phylum of archaea. Bacteroidetes were found to encode a large number of these biosynthetic gene clusters, despite making up a relatively small portion of the genomes in this dataset. A number of these precursor peptides are similar to those of previously characterized lanthipeptides, but even more were not, including potential antibiotics. One such new antimicrobial lanthipeptide was purified and characterized. Additionally, examination of the biosynthetic gene clusters revealed that enzymes installing secondary post-translational modifications are more widespread than initially thought.                  Conclusion:                       Lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters are more widely distributed and the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters are more diverse than previously appreciated, demonstrating that the lanthipeptide sequence-function space remains largely underexplored.	1
Abstract2class: Metabolic relation of cyanobacteria to aromatic compounds Abstract: Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green (micro)algae, are able to sustain many types of chemical stress because of metabolic adaptations that allow them to survive and successfully compete in a variety of ecosystems, including polluted ones. As photoautotrophic bacteria, these microorganisms synthesize aromatic amino acids, which are precursors for a large variety of substances that contain aromatic ring(s) and that are naturally formed in the cells of these organisms. Hence, the transformation of aromatic secondary metabolites by cyanobacteria is the result of the possession of a suitable "enzymatic apparatus" to carry out the biosynthesis of these compounds according to cellular requirements. Another crucial aspect that should be evaluated using varied criteria is the response of cyanobacteria to the presence of extracellular aromatic compounds. Some aspects of the relationship between aromatic compounds and cyanobacteria such as the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, the influence of aromatic compounds on these organisms and the fate of aromatic substances inside microalgal cells are presented in this paper. The search for this information has suggested that there is a lack of knowledge about the regulation of the biosynthesis of aromatic substances and about the transport of these compounds into cyanobacterial cells. These aspects are of pivotal importance with regard to the biotransformation of aromatic compounds and understanding them may be the goals of future research.	0
Abstract2class: Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate Abstract: The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site-specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High-resolution 19 F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano-to-micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.	0
Abstract2class: Dynamic Continuum of Molecular Assemblies for Controlling Cell Fates Abstract: Biological systems have evolved to create a structural and dynamic continuum of bio-macromolecular assemblies for the purpose of optimizing the system's functions. The formation of these dynamic higher-order assemblies is precisely controlled by biological cues. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic molecules spatiotemporally in or on live cells is still a big challenge, especially for performing functions. This concept article introduces the use of in situ reactions as a spatiotemporal control to form assemblies of small molecules that induce cell morphogenesis or apoptosis. After briefly introducing a representative example of a natural dynamic continuum of the higher-order assemblies, we describe enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) for constructing dynamic assemblies of small molecules, then discuss the use of EISA for controlling cell morphogenesis and apoptosis. Finally, we provide a brief outlook to discuss the future perspective of this exciting new research direction.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of versipelostatin: identification of an enzyme-catalyzed [4+2]-cycloaddition required for macrocyclization of spirotetronate-containing polyketides Abstract: Versipelostatin (VST) is an unusual 17-membered macrocyclic polyketide product that contains a spirotetronate skeleton. In this study, the entire VST biosynthetic gene cluster (vst) spanning 108 kb from Streptomyces versipellis 4083-SVS6 was identified by heterologous expression using a bacterial artificial chromosome vector. Here, we demonstrate that an enzyme, VstJ, catalyzes the stereoselective [4+2]-cycloaddition between the conjugated diene and the exocyclic olefin of a newly identified tetronate-containing intermediate to form the spirotetronate skeleton during VST biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Disruption of the Trichoderma reesei gul1 gene stimulates hyphal branching and reduces broth viscosity in cellulase production Abstract: Hyphal morphology is considered to have a close relationship with the production level of secreted proteins by filamentous fungi. In this study, the gul1 gene, which encodes a putative mRNA-binding protein, was disrupted in cellulase-producing fungus Trichoderma reesei. The hyphae of Δgul1 strain produced more lateral branches than the parent strain. Under the condition for cellulase production, disruption of gul1 resulted in smaller mycelial clumps and significantly lower viscosity of fermentation broth. In addition, cellulase production was improved by 22% relative to the parent strain. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a set of genes encoding cell wall remodeling enzymes as well as hydrophobins were differentially expressed in the Δgul1 strain. The results suggest that the regulatory role of gul1 in cell morphogenesis is likely conserved in filamentous fungi. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the engineering of gul1 in an industrially important fungus.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of Cyclic Depsipeptides and Their Dedicated Synthetase from Hapsidospora irregularis Abstract: Seven cyclic depsipeptides were isolated from Hapsidospora irregularis and structurally characterized as the calcium channel blocker leualacin and six new analogues based on the NMR and HRESIMS data. These new compounds were named leualacins B-G. The absolute configurations of the amino acids and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acids were determined by recording the optical rotation values. Biological studies showed that calcium influx elicited by leualacin F in primary human lobar bronchial epithelial cells involves the TRPA1 channel. Through genome sequencing and targeted gene disruption, a noniterative nonribosomal peptide synthetase was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of leualacin. A comparison of the structures of leualacin and its analogues indicated that the A2 and A4 domains of the leualacin synthetase are substrate specific, while A1, A3, and A5 can accept alternative precursors to yield new molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Purification of two Bacillus subtilis proteins which cross-react with antibodies directed against eukaryotic protein kinase C, the His HPr kinase and trigger factor Abstract: As in eukaryotes, phosphorylation of Ser residues in proteins appears to be common phenomenon in bacteria. Surprisingly, however, very few Ser/Thr protein kinases have been identified and in this study antibodies directed against mammalian protein kinase C (PKC) have been used in attempts to isolate conserved Ser/Thr protein kinases. Using the mAb M7 against rat brain PKC, a single 70 kDa band was identified in total cell extracts of Bacillus subtilis by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE, whilst using polyclonal antibody alpha-PKC1p against Saccharomyces cerevisiae PKC a single 67 kDa band was identified by the same procedure. The two proteins were purified independently on the basis of antibody recognition employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as a final step, which allowed subsequent microsequencing. The 70 kDa band was thus identified as the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent His HPr kinase, Enzyme 1 of the phosphotransferase system. This identity was confirmed using a mutant deleted for ptsl, encoding Enzyme 1. The 67 kDa protein was identified as a previously unknown B. subtilis 'trigger factor', homologous to an Escherichia coli protein-folding enzyme, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase implicated in cell division.	0
Abstract2class: Microneedle-Assisted Percutaneous Delivery of a Tetramethylpyrazine-Loaded Microemulsion Abstract: This study examined the efficacy of the percutaneous delivery of a tetramethylpyrazine-loaded microemulsion (TMP-ME) on skin pretreated with microneedles (MN). The TMP-ME formulation was optimized in vitro with skin permeation experiments, using a uniform experimental design, guided by a pseudo-ternary phase diagram, in which the TMP skin permeation level and mean particle size were indices. The effects of MN pretreatment on skin permeation by TMP-ME were assessed using in vitro skin permeation, in vivo skin microdialysis, and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The influence of MN pretreatment on the skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring the electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion. In the optimal formulation of TMP-ME, the weight percentages of Maisine® 35-1 (oil phase), Labrasol® (surfactant), and Transcutol® P (co-surfactant) were 7%, 30% and 10%, respectively, with 1.5% TMP loading. In the in vitro skin permeation study, MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a two-fold increase in a 24-h cumulative TMP permeation compared with TMP-ME alone (p < 0.05). In the skin microdialysis study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 1.25-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.93-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 0.88-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). Similarly, in the pharmacokinetic study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 2.11-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.67-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 1.07-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). The percutaneous electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion was 850 ± 50 Ω/cm² and 283 ± 104 Ω/cm² respectively, indicating that MN dramatically compromises the skin barrier. These results suggest that MN assistance increases the skin permeation rate and the extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME, and that the mechanism may involve the reversible barrier perturbation effect. The rate and extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME can be significantly enhanced by MN assistance, possibly because MN causes a reversible barrier perturbation effect on skin.	0
Abstract2class: Controlling the DNA binding specificity of bHLH proteins through intramolecular interactions Abstract: Reversible control of the conformation of proteins was employed to probe the relationship between flexibility and specificity of the basic helix-loop-helix protein MyoD. A fusion protein (apaMyoD) was designed where the basic DNA binding helix of MyoD was stablized by an amino-terminal extension with a sequence derived from the bee venom peptide apamin. The disulfide-stabilized helix from apamin served as a nucleus for a helix that extended for a further ten residues, thereby holding apaMyoD's DNA recognition helix in a predominantly alpha-helical conformation. The thermal stability of the DNA complexes of apaMyoD was increased by 13 degrees C relative to MyoD-bHLH. Measurements of the fluorescence anisotropy change on DNA binding indicated that apaMyoD bound to E-box-containing DNA sequences with enhanced affinity relative to MyoD-bHLH. Consequently, the DNA binding specificity of apaMyoD was increased 10-fold.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and deduced function of the granaticin-producing polyketide synthase gene cluster of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22 Abstract: A 6.5 kb region of DNA from Streptomyces violaceoruber, which contains polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for production of the benzoisochromane quinone moiety of the antibiotic, granaticin, was cloned and sequenced. Of six open reading frames (ORFs) identified, four (ORFs 1-4) would be transcribed in one direction and two (ORFs 5 and 6) divergently from ORFs 1-4. ORF1 and ORF2, which show evidence for translation coupling, encode (deduced) gene products which strongly resemble each other and the Escherichia coli fatty acid ketoacyl synthase (condensing enzyme), FabB. We conclude that ORF1 (which contains a characteristic cysteine residue) functions as a condensing enzyme, possibly as part of a heterodimeric protein including the product of ORF2. The predicted ORF3 gene product strikingly resembles acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid synthase (FAS), particularly in the region of the active site motif, while the predicted ORF5 and ORF6 gene products resemble known oxidoreductases, suggesting that they function as reductive steps required during assembly of the granaticin carbon skeleton. Comparison of the deduced ORF4 gene product with available protein databases failed to elucidate its potential function. The overall conclusion is that the granaticin-producing PKS would consist of at least six separate enzymes involved in carbon chain assembly, thus resembling a Type II, rather than a Type I, FAS.	1
Abstract2class: Prolyl hydroxylase substrate adenylosuccinate lyase is an oncogenic driver in triple negative breast cancer Abstract: Protein hydroxylation affects protein stability, activity, and interactome, therefore contributing to various diseases including cancers. However, the transiency of the hydroxylation reaction hinders the identification of hydroxylase substrates. By developing an enzyme-substrate trapping strategy coupled with TAP-TAG or orthogonal GST- purification followed by mass spectrometry, we identify adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) as an EglN2 hydroxylase substrate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ADSL expression is higher in TNBC than other breast cancer subtypes or normal breast tissues. ADSL knockout impairs TNBC cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. An integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis reveals that ADSL activates the oncogenic cMYC pathway by regulating cMYC protein level via a mechanism requiring ADSL proline 24 hydroxylation. Hydroxylation-proficient ADSL, by affecting adenosine levels, represses the expression of the long non-coding RNA MIR22HG, thus upregulating cMYC protein level. Our findings highlight the role of ADSL hydroxylation in controlling cMYC and TNBC tumorigenesis.	0
Abstract2class: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Abstract2class: Antifungal and Cytotoxic β-Resorcylic Acid Lactones from a Paecilomyces Species Abstract: Eight new β-resorcylic acid lactones (RALs), including the hypothemycin-type compounds paecilomycins N-P (1-3) and the radicicol-type metabolites dechloropochonin I (4), monocillins VI (5) and VII (6), 4'-hydroxymonocillin IV (7), and 4'-methoxymonocillin IV (8), along with nine known RALs (9-17), were isolated from the cultures of Paecilomyces sp. SC0924. Compounds 1 and 2 feature a novel 6/11/5 ring system, and 3 is the first 5'-keto RAL. The structures of 1-8 were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and theoretical calculations of ECD spectra. Compounds 3, 5, and 6 exhibit cytotoxicity against MCF-7, A549, and HeLa cells, and compounds 5 and 7 display antifungal activity against Peronophythora litchii.	0
Abstract2class: Specific small molecule inhibitors of Skp2-mediated p27 degradation Abstract: In the ubiquitin proteasome system, the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2 and its accessory protein, Cks1, promote proliferation largely by inducing the degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27. Overexpression of Skp2 in human cancers correlates with poor prognosis, and deregulation of SCF-Skp2-Cks1 promotes tumorigenesis in animal models. We identified small molecule inhibitors specific to SCF-Skp2 activity using in silico screens targeted to the binding interface for p27. These compounds selectively inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 degradation by reducing p27 binding through key compound-receptor contacts. In cancer cells, the compounds induced p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promoted cell-type-specific blocks in the G1 or G2/M phases. Designing SCF-Skp2-specific inhibitors may be a novel strategy to treat cancers dependent on the Skp2-p27 axis.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of WbiQ: An α1,2-fucosyltransferase from Escherichia coli O127:K63(B8), and synthesis of H-type 3 blood group antigen Abstract: Escherichia coli O127:K63(B8) possesses high human blood group H (O) activity due to its O-antigen repeating unit structure. In this work, the wbiQ gene from E. coli O127:K63(B8) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal GST affinity tag. Using the GST-WbiQ fusion protein, the wbiQ gene was identified to encode an α1,2-fucosyltransferase using a radioactivity based assay, thin-layer chromatography assay, as well confirming product formation by using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The fused enzyme (GST-WbiQ) has an optimal pH range from 6.5 to 7.5 and does not require the presence of a divalent metal to be enzymatically active. WbiQ displays strict substrate specificity, displaying activity only towards acceptors that contain Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-α-OR linkages; indicating that both the Gal and GalNAc residues are vital for enzymatic activity. In addition, WbiQ was used to prepare the H-type 3 blood group antigen, Fuc-α1,2-Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-α-OMe, on a milligram scale.	1
Abstract2class: Macrolactin is the polyketide biosynthesis product of the pks2 cluster of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: In the genome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, three operons pks1, pks2, and pks3 were identified which encode the biosynthesis of polyketides. pks1 and pks3 have been attributed to the production of bacillaene and difficidin/oxydifficidin, respectively, while the pks2 product remained hitherto unknown. Mass spectrometric analysis of the culture filtrates of the wild-type B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 and mutants revealed pks2-specific metabolites. By combination of the mass spectrometric and UV/vis data with a database search, these compounds were attributed to four members of the macrolactin family, macrolactin A and D as well as 7-O-malonyl- and 7-O-succinyl-macrolactin. This conclusion was verified by the isolation and structure elucidation of macrolactin A using mass spectrometric and 2D-NMR studies. Macrolactin biosynthesis was investigated using feeding experiments with (13)C-acetate. (13)C-labelled macrolactin A revealed an alternating labelling of its carbon skeleton with (13)C, indicating that acetate/malonate was used as the sole precursor. The macrolactin structure is compatible with the domain organization of the pks2-operon. Similarly to pks1 and pks3, pks2 is a modular polyketide synthase system of type I which exhibits a trans-acyltransferase architecture using a discrete acyltransferase enzyme iteratively in the assembly of macrolactin. Finally, the potential for macrolactin production on a genetic and metabolic basis was found to be widely distributed among Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains.	1
Abstract2class: Two Cooperative Glycosyltransferases Are Responsible for the Sugar Diversity of Saquayamycins Isolated from Streptomyces sp. KY 40-1 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of valuable natural products providing an excellent drug-tailoring tool. Herein, we report the identification of two cooperative glycosyltransferases from the sqn gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of saquayamycins in Streptomyces sp. KY40-1: SqnG1 and SqnG2. Gene inactivation of sqnG1 leads to 50-fold decrease in saquayamycin production, while inactivation of sqnG2 leads to complete production loss, suggesting that SqnG2 acts as dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase. Gene inactivation of a third putative glycosyltransferase-encoding gene, sqnG3, does not affect saquayamycin production in a major way, suggesting that SqnG3 has no or a supportive role in glycosylation. The data indicate that SqnG1 and SqnG2 are solely and possibly cooperatively responsible for the sugar diversity observed in saquayamycins 1-7. This is the first evidence of a glycosyltransferase system showing codependence to achieve dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase activity, utilizing NDP-activated d-olivose, l-rhodinose, as well as an unusual amino sugar, presumably 3,6-dideoxy-l-idosamine.	1
Abstract2class: Search for cell motility and angiogenesis inhibitors with potential anticancer activity: beauvericin and other constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Abstract: Wound-healing assay-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of the fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum EPH2RAA endophytic in Ephedra fasciculata afforded beauvericin (1), (-)-oxysporidinone (2), and two new N-methyl-2-pyridones, (-)-4,6'-anhydrooxysporidinone (3) and (-)-6-deoxyoxysporidinone (4). Beauvericin (1) inhibited migration of the metastatic prostate cancer (PC-3M) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells and showed antiangiogenic activity in HUVEC-2 cells at sublethal concentrations. Cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of F. oxysporum strain CECIS occurring in Cylindropuntia echinocarpus afforded rhodolamprometrin (5), bikaverin (6), and the new natural product 6-deoxybikaverin (7). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity in a panel of four sentinel cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung), MIA Pa Ca-2 (pancreatic), MCF-7 (breast), and SF-268 (CNS glioma), and only beauvericin (1) and bikaverin (6) were active, with 1 and 6 showing selective toxicity toward NCI-H460 and MIA Pa Ca-2, respectively. Interestingly, 6-deoxybikaverin (7) was completely devoid of activity, suggesting the requirement of the C-6 hydroxy group of bikaverin for its cytotoxic activity.	0
Abstract2class: Arginine biosynthesis and regulation in Lactobacillus plantarum: the carA gene and the argCJBDF cluster are divergently transcribed Abstract: A cluster of citrulline biosynthetic genes has been cloned and sequenced from a fragment of Lactobacillus plantarum CCM 1904 (ATCC 8014) DNA isolated as complementing a Bacillus subtilis argF mutation. The gene order was carA-argCJBDF, with carA transcribed divergently from the arg cluster. Although other gram-positive bacteria show similar arg clusters, this arrangement for carA is thus far unprecedented. Downstream from the arg cluster, two open reading frames (ORF7 and ORF8) having unknown functions were found. Sequence analysis of the end of a 10.5-kb cloned DNA fragment showed that argF was 3.5 kb from the ldhL gene coding for L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase. A tree representation of amino acid sequence clustering relationships of 31 ornithine carbamoyltransferases (OTCases) from various organisms revealed two prokaryotic groups: one with ArgF of L. plantarum and one with ArgF of B. subtilis, which are paralogous. This divergence was not observed in vivo because an L. plantarum argF mutant (AM 1215) harboring no OTCase activity was complemented by the argF genes of L. plantarum and B. subtilis. No OTCase activity was detectable when L. plantarum was grown in the presence of saturating amounts of arginine or citrulline. Arginine may repress the citrulline biosynthetic genes in L. plantarum by using 11 identified DNA motifs which resemble the Escherichia coli ARG box consensus and which are in most cases separated by multiples of 11 bp, corresponding to a DNA helical turn. The carA and argCJBDF genes are divergently transcribed. Their putative promoters are 6 bp apart and are partially overlapped by putative ARG boxes, suggesting concerted transcription regulation.	1
Abstract2class: Impact of the Staphylococcus epidermidis LytSR two-component regulatory system on murein hydrolase activity, pyruvate utilization and global transcriptional profile Abstract: Background:                       Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, mainly because of its ability to colonize implanted biomaterials by forming a biofilm. Extensive studies are focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation. The LytSR two-component regulatory system regulates autolysis and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. However, the role of LytSR played in S. epidermidis remained unknown.                  Results:                       In the present study, we demonstrated that lytSR knock-out in S. epidermidis did not alter susceptibility to Triton X-100 induced autolysis. Quantitative murein hydrolase assay indicated that disruption of lytSR in S. epidermidis resulted in decreased activities of extracellular murein hydrolases, although zymogram showed no apparent differences in murein hydrolase patterns between S. epidermidis strain 1457 and its lytSR mutant. Compared to the wild-type counterpart, 1457ΔlytSR produced slightly more biofilm, with significantly decreased dead cells inside. Microarray analysis showed that lytSR mutation affected the transcription of 164 genes (123 genes were upregulated and 41 genes were downregulated). Specifically, genes encoding proteins responsible for protein synthesis, energy metabolism were downregulated, while genes involved in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid transporters were upregulated. Impaired ability to utilize pyruvate and reduced activity of arginine deiminase was observed in 1457ΔlytSR, which is consistent with the microarray data.                  Conclusions:                       The preliminary results suggest that in S. epidermidis LytSR two-component system regulates extracellular murein hydrolase activity, bacterial cell death and pyruvate utilization. Based on the microarray data, it appears that lytSR inactivation induces a stringent response. In addition, LytSR may indirectly enhance biofilm formation by altering the metabolic status of the bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: The developmental regulator MtrA binds GlnR boxes and represses nitrogen metabolism genes in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: In Streptomyces, GlnR is an activator protein that activates nitrogen-assimilation genes under nitrogen-limiting conditions. However, less is known regarding the regulation of these genes under nitrogen-rich conditions. We determined that the developmental regulator MtrA represses nitrogen-assimilation genes in nitrogen-rich media and that it competes with GlnR for binding to GlnR boxes. The GlnR boxes upstream of multiple nitrogen genes, such as amtB, were confirmed as MtrA binding sites in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo by ChIP-qPCR analysis. Transcriptional analysis indicated that, on nutrient-rich medium, MtrA profoundly repressed expression of nitrogen-associated genes, indicating opposing roles for MtrA and GlnR in the control of nitrogen metabolism. Using in vitro and in vivo analysis, we also showed that glnR is itself a direct target of MtrA and that MtrA represses glnR transcription. We further demonstrated functional conservation of MtrA homologues in the recognition of GlnR boxes upstream of nitrogen genes from different actinobacterial species. As mtrA and glnR are widespread among actinomycetes, this mechanism of potential competitive control over nitrogen metabolism genes may be common in this group, adding a major new layer of complexity to the known regulatory network for nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces and related species.	0
Abstract2class: The stability of P2-layered sodium transition metal oxides in ambient atmospheres Abstract: Air-stability is one of the most important considerations for the practical application of electrode materials in energy-harvesting/storage devices, ranging from solar cells to rechargeable batteries. The promising P2-layered sodium transition metal oxides (P2-NaxTmO2) often suffer from structural/chemical transformations when contacted with moist air. However, these elaborate transitions and the evaluation rules towards air-stable P2-NaxTmO2 have not yet been clearly elucidated. Herein, taking P2-Na0.67MnO2 and P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 as key examples, we unveil the comprehensive structural/chemical degradation mechanisms of P2-NaxTmO2 in different ambient atmospheres by using various microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations and first-principle calculations. The extent of bulk structural/chemical transformation of P2-NaxTmO2 is determined by the amount of extracted Na+, which is mainly compensated by Na+/H+ exchange. By expanding our study to a series of Mn-based oxides, we reveal that the air-stability of P2-NaxTmO2 is highly related to their oxidation features in the first charge process and further propose a practical evaluating rule associated with redox couples for air-stable NaxTmO2 cathodes.	0
Abstract2class: Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in different regions: a meta-analysis Abstract: Background:                       To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance in different regions, a meta-analysis was carried out.                  Methods:                       Several databases were searched for relevant studies up to March 3, 2019. A bivariate random-effects model was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy.                  Results:                       We identified 97 studies involving 26,037 samples for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection were 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.95), 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99), respectively. For different regions, the pooled sensitivity were 0.94(95% CI 0.89-0.97) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-1.00) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high and middle/low income countries, respectively. The pooled sensitivity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high TB burden and middle/low prevalence countries, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection was excellent.	0
Abstract2class: Characteristics of an anaerobic, syntrophic, butyrate-degrading bacterium in paddy field soil Abstract: The number of syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacteria in a flooded paddy field soil was 1.7 x 10(3) MPN/g dry soil. Butyrate was degraded to acetate and methane when paddy soils were incubated anaerobically with the addition of butyrate. However, butyrate degradation was completely suppressed by the addition of the specific inhibitor of methanogenesis, 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) to the soil. A hydrogen-using methanogen, strain TM-8, was isolated from flooded paddy field soil. Strain TM-8 was identified as Methanobacterium formicicum based on its physiology and phylogeny. Syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacteria were enumerated and isolated using strain TM-8. A syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacterium, strain TB-6, was isolated in coculture with strain TM-8 from paddy soil. The strain was Gram-negative, had curved rods, and grew on crotonate. Sulfate was not used as an electron acceptor. Strain TB-6 was closely related to S. wolfei subsp. wolfei. The relation between strain TB-6 and the members of Syntrophomonas are discussed.	0
Abstract2class: Nonactin biosynthesis: the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster contains type II polyketide synthase-like genes Abstract: Nonactin is the parent compound of a group of highly atypical polyketide metabolites produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. In this paper we describe the isolation, sequencing, and analysis of 15¿ omitted¿559 bp of chromosomal DNA, containing the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster, from S. griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. Fourteen open reading frames were observed in the DNA sequence. Significantly, type II polyketide synthase (PKS) homologues were discovered in an apparent operon structure, which also contained the nonactate synthase gene (nonS), clustered with the tetranactin resistance gene. The deduced products of two of the genes (nonK and nonJ) are quite unusual ketoacyl synthase (KAS) alpha and KASbeta homologues. We speculate that nonactic acid, the polyketide precursor of nonactin, is synthesized by a type II PKS system.	1
Abstract2class: Quantum interferometric visibility as a witness of general relativistic proper time Abstract: Current attempts to probe general relativistic effects in quantum mechanics focus on precision measurements of phase shifts in matter-wave interferometry. Yet, phase shifts can always be explained as arising because of an Aharonov-Bohm effect, where a particle in a flat space-time is subject to an effective potential. Here we propose a quantum effect that cannot be explained without the general relativistic notion of proper time. We consider interference of a 'clock'-a particle with evolving internal degrees of freedom-that will not only display a phase shift, but also reduce the visibility of the interference pattern. According to general relativity, proper time flows at different rates in different regions of space-time. Therefore, because of quantum complementarity, the visibility will drop to the extent to which the path information becomes available from reading out the proper time from the 'clock'. Such a gravitationally induced decoherence would provide the first test of the genuine general relativistic notion of proper time in quantum mechanics.	0
Abstract2class: Deciphering indolocarbazole and enediyne aminodideoxypentose biosynthesis through comparative genomics: insights from the AT2433 biosynthetic locus Abstract: AT2433, an indolocarbazole antitumor antibiotic, is structurally distinguished by its aminodideoxypentose-containing disaccharide and asymmetrically halogenated N-methylated aglycon. Cloning and sequence analysis of AT2433 gene cluster and comparison of this locus with that encoding for rebeccamycin and the gene cluster encoding calicheamicin present an opportunity to study the aminodideoxypentose biosynthesis via comparative genomics. The locus was confirmed via in vitro biochemical characterization of two methyltransferases--one common to AT2433 and rebeccamycin, the other unique to AT2433--as well as via heterologous expression and in vivo bioconversion experiments using the AT2433 N-glycosyltransferase. Preliminary studies of substrate tolerance for these three enzymes reveal the potential to expand upon the enzymatic diversification of indolocarbazoles. Moreover, this work sets the stage for future studies regarding the origins of the indolocarbazole maleimide nitrogen and indolocarbazole asymmetry.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic organization and sequence of the Pseudomonas cepacia genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase Abstract: The locations of the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome were determined. This was accomplished through the construction of several subclones into the broad-host-range cloning vectors pRO2317, pRO2320, and pRO2321. The ability of each subclone to complement mutations in protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcaA) was tested in mutant strains derived from P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. These complementation studies also showed that the two subunits were expressed from the same promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence matched that determined by N-terminal analysis of regions of the isolated enzyme. Although over 400 nucleotides were sequenced before the start of the genes, no homology to known promoters was found. However, a terminator stem-loop structure was found immediately after the genes. The deduced amino acid sequence showed extensive homology with the previously determined amino acid sequence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from another Pseudomonas species.	0
Abstract2class: Nostophycin biosynthesis is directed by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase in the toxic cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain 152 Abstract: Cyanobacteria are a rich source of natural products with interesting pharmaceutical properties. Here, we report the identification, sequencing, annotation, and biochemical analysis of the nostophycin (npn) biosynthetic gene cluster. The npn gene cluster spans 45.1 kb and consists of three open reading frames encoding a polyketide synthase, a mixed polyketide nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The genetic architecture and catalytic domain organization of the proteins are colinear in arrangement, with the putative order of the biosynthetic assembly of the cyclic heptapeptide. NpnB contains an embedded monooxygenase domain linking nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) catalytic domains and predicted here to hydroxylate the nostophycin during assembly. Expression of the adenylation domains and subsequent substrate specificity assays support the involvement of this cluster in nostophycin biosynthesis. Biochemical analyses suggest that the loading substrate of NpnA is likely to be a phenylpropanoic acid necessitating deletion of a carbon atom to explain the biosynthesis of nostophycin. Biosyntheses of nostophycin and microcystin resemble each other, but the phylogenetic analyses suggest that they are distantly related to one another.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthetic pathway for the epipolythiodioxopiperazine acetylaranotin in Aspergillus terreus revealed by genome-based deletion analysis Abstract: Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are a class of fungal secondary metabolites derived from diketopiperazines. Acetylaranotin belongs to one structural subgroup of ETPs characterized by the presence of a seven-membered 4,5-dihydrooxepine ring. Defining the genes involved in acetylaranotin biosynthesis should provide a means to increase the production of these compounds and facilitate the engineering of second-generation molecules. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus produces acetylaranotin and related natural products. Using targeted gene deletions, we have identified a cluster of nine genes (including one nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, ataP) that is required for acetylaranotin biosynthesis. Chemical analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains enabled us to isolate 17 natural products from the acetylaranotin biosynthesis pathway. Nine of the compounds identified in this study are natural products that have not been reported previously. Our data have allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for acetylaranotin and related natural products.	1
Abstract2class: Composition of bacterial communities associated with natural and laboratory populations of Asobara tabida infected with Wolbachia Abstract: Asobara tabida wasps are fly endoparasitoids that naturally harbor three Wolbachia strains, which induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and control oogenesis. To investigate whether other bacteria play a role in wasp biology, we surveyed the bacterial communities of wild A. tabida populations originating from different regions of France and of laboratory colonies using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culture methods. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were found to be the main phyla represented in these populations. Among these were several cultured and uncultured representatives of the genera Acetobacter, Acidomonas, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Duganella, Herbaspirillum, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. In addition to Wolbachia, wild individuals harbored Rickettsia, which tended to be lost when insects were reared in the laboratory. The antibiotic treatment used to generate wasp sublines singly infected with Wolbachia also affected the overall bacterial composition, with most fingerprint sequences being characteristic of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We also screened for potentially heritable endosymbionts by PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization in stable laboratory lines, with only Wolbachia being consistently found in wasp ovaries.	0
Abstract2class: Characterization of the sugar-O-methyltransferase LobS1 in lobophorin biosynthesis Abstract: Lobophorins A (1) and B (2) belong to a large group of spirotetronate natural products with potent antibacterial and antitumor activities. The cloning of the lobophorin biosynthesis gene cluster from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127 identified a sugar-O-methyltransferase-encoding gene lobS1. The lobS1 inactivation mutant accumulated two new lobophorin analogs 3 and 4, different from 1 and 2 by lacking the 4-methyl group at the terminal L-digitoxose, respectively. Biochemical experiments verified that LobS1 was a SAM-dependent sugar-O-methyltransferase that required divalent metal ions for better activity. Antibacterial assays revealed compounds 3 and 4 were generally less potent than compounds 1 and 2. These findings suggest that the methylation on the terminal digitoxose by LobS1 tailors lobophorin biosynthesis and highlights the importance of this methylation for antibacterial potence.	1
Abstract2class: Constructing de novo H2O2 signaling via induced protein proximity Abstract: A new chemical strategy has been developed to generate de novo signaling pathways that link a signaling molecule, H2O2, to different downstream cellular events in mammalian cells. This approach combines the reactivity-based H2O2 sensing with the chemically induced protein proximity technology. By chemically modifying abscisic acid with an H2O2-sensitive boronate ester probe, novel H2O2 signaling pathways can be engineered to induce transcription, protein translocation and membrane ruffle formation upon exogenous or endogenous H2O2 stimulation. This strategy has also been successfully applied to gibberellic acid, which provides the potential to build signaling networks based on orthogonal cell stimuli.	0
Abstract2class: [Cloning, expression and characterization of the nucleotidylyltransferase gene-amiE in amicetin biosynthesis] Abstract: Objective:                       The aim of this study is to clone and express the nucleotidylytransferase encoding gene-amiE from the biosynthetic gene cluster of amicetin, a disaccharide nucleoside antibiotic, and to characterize AmiE in vitro.                  Methods:                       The amiE, encoding a nucleotidylytransferase of 257 amino acid, was PCR amplified and cloned into pET28a, resulting in the plasmid pCSG4001, which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expressing N-(His)6-tag AmiE. The recombinant AmiE was purified by affinity chromatography via AKTA Purifier 10 system. The AmiE-catalyzed reactions were performed using TTP (or UTP) and glucose-1-phosphate as substrates. The enzyme assays were analyzed by HPLC; the substrate flexibility of AmiE was probed with three unnatural sugars-1-phosphate, including galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate.                  Results:                       The N-(His)6-tag AmiE was expressed in E. coli in soluble form and was successfully purified via Ni2+ mediated affinity chromatography; in vitro biochemical experiments showed that AmiE could convert glucose-1-phosphate into TDP-glucose (or UDP-glucose) in the presence of TTP (or UTP). However, galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate were not substrates of AmiE.                  Conclusion:                       The amiE was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the purified AmiE was biochemically confirmed to be a nucleotylyltransferase in amicetin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Abstract2class: A new member of the 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one-containing aminomutase family from the enediyne kedarcidin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: 4-Methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO)-containing aminomutases catalyze the conversion of L-α-amino acids to β-amino acids with either an (R) or an (S) configuration. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are the only two natural substrates identified to date. The enediyne chromophore of the chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic kedarcidin (KED) harbors an (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine moiety reminiscent of the (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-β-tyrosine moiety of the C-1027 enediyne chromophore, the biosynthesis of which uncovered the first known MIO-containing aminomutase, SgcC4. Comparative analysis of the KED and C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters inspired the proposal for (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine biosynthesis starting from 2-aza-L-tyrosine, featuring KedY4 as a putative MIO-containing aminomutase. Here we report the biochemical characterization of KedY4, confirming its proposed role in KED biosynthesis. KedY4 is an MIO-containing aminomutase that stereospecifically catalyzes the conversion of 2-aza-L-tyrosine to (R)-2-aza-β-tyrosine, exhibiting no detectable activity toward 2-aza-L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as an alternative substrate. In contrast, SgcC4, which stereospecifically catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to (S)-β-tyrosine in C-1027 biosynthesis, exhibits minimal activity with 2-aza-L-tyrosine as an alternative substrate but generating (S)-2-aza-β-tyrosine, a product with the opposite stereochemistry of KedY4. This report of KedY4 broadens the scope of known substrates for the MIO-containing aminomutase family, and comparative studies of KedY4 and SgcC4 provide an outstanding opportunity to examine how MIO-containing aminomutases control substrate specificity and product enantioselectivity.	1
Abstract2class: The putative permease PhlE of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113 has a role in 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol resistance and in general stress tolerance Abstract: 2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol (PHL) is the primary determinant of the biological control activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113. The operon phlACBD encodes enzymes responsible for PHL biosynthesis from intermediate metabolites. The phlE gene, which is located downstream of the phlACBD operon, encodes a putative permease suggested to be a member of the major facilitator superfamily with 12 transmembrane segments. PhlE has been suggested to function in PHL export. Here the sequencing of the phlE gene from P. fluorescens F113 and the construction of a phlE null mutant, F113-D3, is reported. It is shown that F113-D3 produced less PHL than F113. The ratio of cell-associated to free PHL was not significantly different between the strains, suggesting the existence of alternative transporters for PHL. The phlE mutant was, however, significantly more sensitive to high concentrations of added PHL, implicating PhlE in PHL resistance. Furthermore, the phlE mutant was more susceptible to osmotic, oxidative and heat-shock stresses. Osmotic stress induced rapid degradation of free PHL by the bacteria. Based on these results, we propose that the role of phlE in general stress tolerance is to export toxic intermediates of PHL degradation from the cells.	1
Abstract2class: Glycopeptide biosynthesis: Dbv21/Orf2 from dbv/tcp gene clusters are N-Ac-Glm teicoplanin pseudoaglycone deacetylases and Orf15 from cep gene cluster is a Glc-1-P thymidyltransferase Abstract: The unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activities of glycopeptide antibiotics are conferred from the tailoring steps occurring on the aglycone. It was hypothesized that the sugar moiety attached to the aglycone is derived from an unusual UDP-glucosamine and is followed by an acylation reaction in the biosynthesis of teicoplanin/A40926. Here we report that three homologous (>65% identical) proteins Dbv21, Orf2*, and Orf15, previously assigned as hypothetical proteins in the biosynthesis of A40926, teicoplanin, and chloroeremomycin, respectively, are novel deacetylases (Dbv21 and Orf2*) and thymidyltransferase (Orf15). Dbv21 and Orf2* catalyze the deacetylation reaction of N-acetylglucosaminyl-teicoplanin pseudoaglycone, while Orf15 catalyzes the formation of dTDP-glucose that is required for the epi-vancosamine/vancosamine decoration of chloroeremomycin/vancomycin.	1
Abstract2class: Aminoacyl sulfonamide assembly in SB-203208 biosynthesis Abstract: Sulfonamide is present in many important drugs, due to its unique chemical and biological properties. In contrast, naturally occurring sulfonamides are rare, and their biosynthetic knowledge are scarce. Here we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of sulfonamide antibiotics, altemicidin, SB-203207, and SB-203208, from Streptomyces sp. NCIMB40513. The heterologous gene expression and biochemical analyses reveal unique aminoacyl transfer reactions, including the tRNA synthetase-like enzyme SbzA-catalyzed L-isoleucine transfer and the GNAT enzyme SbzC-catalyzed β-methylphenylalanine transfer. Furthermore, we elucidate the biogenesis of 2-sulfamoylacetic acid from L-cysteine, by the collaboration of the cupin dioxygenase SbzM and the aldehyde dehydrogenase SbzJ. Remarkably, SbzM catalyzes the two-step oxidation and decarboxylation of L-cysteine, and the subsequent intramolecular amino group rearrangement leads to N-S bond formation. This detailed analysis of the aminoacyl sulfonamide antibiotics biosynthetic machineries paves the way toward investigations of sulfonamide biosynthesis and its engineering.	1
Abstract2class: Discovery of Ibomycin, a Complex Macrolactone that Exerts Antifungal Activity by Impeding Endocytic Trafficking and Membrane Function Abstract: Natural products are invaluable historic sources of drugs for infectious diseases; however, the discovery of novel antimicrobial chemical scaffolds has waned in recent years. Concurrently, there is a pressing need for improved therapeutics to treat fungal infections. We employed a co-culture screen to identify ibomycin, a large polyketide macrolactone that has preferential killing activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. Using chemical and genome methods, we determined the structure of ibomycin and identified the biosynthetic cluster responsible for its synthesis. Chemogenomic profiling coupled with cell biological assays link ibomycin bioactivity to membrane function. The preferential activity of ibomycin toward C. neoformans is due to the ability of the compound to selectively permeate its cell wall. These results delineate a novel antifungal agent that is produced by one of the largest documented biosynthetic clusters to date and underscore the fact that there remains significant untapped chemical diversity of natural products with application in antimicrobial research.	1
Abstract2class: Unveiling the biosynthetic puzzle of destruxins in Metarhizium species Abstract: Insect pathogenic fungi produce a plethora of insecticidally and pharmaceutically active compounds, including 39 cyclohexadepsipeptide destruxins (dtxs). Even though dtxs were first discovered more than 50 y ago, the genes responsible for their biosynthesis were unknown until this study. Based on our comparative genomic information and targeted gene disruptions, we report the gene cluster for dtx biosynthesis in the insect pathogen Metarhizium robertsii. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase DtxS1 has six adenylation domains, two of which are capable of selecting different amino acids to synthesize dtx B and its analogs. The cytochrome P450 enzyme DtxS2 converts dtx B into other dtxs by a chain of reactions, each producing a new derivative. The aldo-keto reductase DtxS3 and aspartic acid decarboxylase DtxS4 are responsible for the conversion and provision of the first and last substrates for the dtx assembly line, respectively. Insect bioassays showed that dtxs could suppress both cellular and humoral immune responses thereby assisting fungal propagation in insects. The differing abilities of Metarhizium species to produce toxins is dependent on the presence of the dtxS1 gene. The toxigenic species are capable of killing multiple orders of insects, whereas the nontoxigenic Metarhizium spp. have narrow host ranges. Thus, the acquisition or retention of the dtx biosynthesis gene cluster in Metarhizium lineages has been coordinated with the evolution of fungal host specificity. The data from this study will facilitate the development of dtxs as bioinsecticides or pharmaceuticals.	1
Abstract2class: Structural basis for specific, high-affinity tetracycline binding by an in vitro evolved aptamer and artificial riboswitch Abstract: The tetracycline aptamer is an in vitro selected RNA that binds to the antibiotic with the highest known affinity of an artificial RNA for a small molecule (Kd approximately 0.8 nM). It is one of few aptamers known to be capable of modulating gene expression in vivo. The 2.2 A resolution cocrystal structure of the aptamer reveals a pseudoknot-like fold formed by tertiary interactions between an 11 nucleotide loop and the minor groove of an irregular helix. Tetracycline binds within this interface as a magnesium ion chelate. The structure, together with previous biochemical and biophysical data, indicates that the aptamer undergoes localized folding concomitant with tetracycline binding. The three-helix junction, h-shaped architecture of this artificial RNA is more complex than those of most aptamers and is reminiscent of the structures of some natural riboswitches.	0
Abstract2class: Catabolite activator protein-induced DNA bending in transcription initiation Abstract: We describe experiments that enable us to track the presence and direction of the DNA bend induced by Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) through the intermediate stages of transcription initiation at the lac promoter. Transcriptional complexes examined were formed on superhelical templates to enhance specific complex formation, and detected by electrophoretic analysis after restriction digestion. We found that the bend is maintained and even increased upon formation of closed and open complexes. Our results exclude the hypothesis that the energy of the CAP-induced bend is used to promote open complex formation. We now suggest a new model, in which DNA wraps around the CAP-polymerase complex to form a writhing structure equivalent to that at the end of an interwound superhelical domain. Formation of this structure may facilitate open complex formation. We further propose that the stored bend energy may be used to help counteract strong protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, thus assisting the process of RNA polymerase escape from the promoter.	0
Abstract2class: The Discovery and Biosynthesis of Nicotinic Myxochelins from an Archangium sp. SDU34 Abstract: Myxobacteria are a prolific source of structurally diverse natural products, and one of the best-studied myxobacterial products is the siderophore myxochelin. Herein, we report two new compounds, myxochelins N (1) and O (2), that are nicotinic paralogs of myxochelin A, from the terrestrial myxobacterium Archangium sp. SDU34; 2 is functionalized with a rare 2-oxazolidinone. A precursor-feeding experiment implied that the biosynthesis of 1 or 2 was due to altered substrate specificity of the loading module of MxcE, which likely accepts nicotinic acid and benzoic acid instead of more conventional 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. We also employed a phylogenomic approach to map the evolutionary relationships of the myxochelin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all the available myxobacterial genomes, to pave the way for the future discovery of potentially hidden myxochelin derivatives. Although the biological function of 1 and 2 is unclear yet, this work underpins that even extensively studied BGCs in myxobacteria can still produce new chemistry.	1
Abstract2class: An effective strategy for exploring unknown metabolic pathways by genome mining Abstract: Plants allocate an estimated 15-25% of their proteome to specialized metabolic pathways that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a genome mining strategy for exploring such unknown pathways and demonstrate this approach for triterpenoids by functionally characterizing three cytochrome P450s from Arabidopsis thaliana . Building on proven methods for characterizing oxidosqualene cyclases, we heterologously expressed in yeast known cyclases with candidate P450s chosen from gene clustering and microarray coexpression patterns. The yeast cultures produced mg/L amounts of plant metabolites in vivo without the complex phytochemical background of plant extracts. Despite this simplification, the product multiplicity and novelty overwhelmed analytical efforts by MS methods. HSQC analysis overcame this problem. Side-by-side HSQC comparisons of crude P450 extracts against a control resolved even minor P450 products among ~100 other yeast metabolites spanning a dynamic range of >10,000:1. HSQC and GC-MS then jointly guided purification and structure determination by classical NMR methods. Including our present results for P450 oxidation of thalianol, arabidiol, and marneral, the metabolic fate for most of the major triterpene synthase products in Arabidopsis is now at least partially known.	1
Abstract2class: Release of free DNA by membrane-impaired bacterial aerosols due to aerosolization and air sampling Abstract: We report here that stress experienced by bacteria due to aerosolization and air sampling can result in severe membrane impairment, leading to the release of DNA as free molecules. Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria were aerosolized and then either collected directly into liquid or collected using other collection media and then transferred into liquid. The amount of DNA released was quantified as the cell membrane damage index (ID), i.e., the number of 16S rRNA gene copies in the supernatant liquid relative to the total number in the bioaerosol sample. During aerosolization by a Collison nebulizer, the ID of E. coli and B. atrophaeus in the nebulizer suspension gradually increased during 60 min of continuous aerosolization. We found that the ID of bacteria during aerosolization was statistically significantly affected by the material of the Collison jar (glass > polycarbonate; P < 0.001) and by the bacterial species (E. coli > B. atrophaeus; P < 0.001). When E. coli was collected for 5 min by filtration, impaction, and impingement, its ID values were within the following ranges: 0.051 to 0.085, 0.16 to 0.37, and 0.068 to 0.23, respectively; when it was collected by electrostatic precipitation, the ID values (0.011 to 0.034) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those with other sampling methods. Air samples collected inside an equine facility for 2 h by filtration and impingement exhibited ID values in the range of 0.30 to 0.54. The data indicate that the amount of cell damage during bioaerosol sampling and the resulting release of DNA can be substantial and that this should be taken into account when analyzing bioaerosol samples.	0
Abstract2class: Genome Mining-Based Discovery of Fungal Macrolides Modified by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-Ethanolamine Phosphate Transferase Homologues Abstract: Through genome mining for fungal macrolide natural products, we discovered a characteristic family of putative macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters that contain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-ethanolamine phosphate transferase (GPI-EPT) homologue. Through the heterologous expression of two clusters from Aspergillus kawachii and Colletotrichum incanum, new macrolides, including those with phosphoethanolamine or phosphocholine moieties, were formed. This study is the first demonstration of the tailoring steps catalyzed by GPI-EPT homologues in natural product biosynthesis, and it uncovers a new gene resource for phospholipid-resembling fungal macrolides.	1
Abstract2class: Identification of the decumbenone biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium decumbens and the importance for production of calbistrin Abstract: Background:                       Filamentous fungi are important producers of secondary metabolites, low molecular weight molecules that often have bioactive properties. Calbistrin A is a secondary metabolite with an interesting structure that was recently found to have bioactivity against leukemia cells. It consists of two polyketides linked by an ester bond: a bicyclic decalin containing polyketide with structural similarities to lovastatin, and a linear 12 carbon dioic acid structure. Calbistrin A is known to be produced by several uniseriate black Aspergilli, Aspergillus versicolor-related species, and Penicillia. Penicillium decumbens produces calbistrin A and B as well as several putative intermediates of the calbistrin pathway, such as decumbenone A-B and versiol.                  Results:                       A comparative genomics study focused on the polyketide synthase (PKS) sets found in three full genome sequence calbistrin producing fungal species, P. decumbens, A. aculeatus and A. versicolor, resulted in the identification of a novel, putative 13-membered calbistrin producing gene cluster (calA to calM). Implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in P. decumbens allowed the targeted deletion of genes encoding a polyketide synthase (calA), a major facilitator pump (calB) and a binuclear zinc cluster transcription factor (calC). Detailed metabolic profiling, using UHPLC-MS, of the ∆calA (PKS) and ∆calC (TF) strains confirmed the suspected involvement in calbistrin productions as neither strains produced calbistrin nor any of the putative intermediates in the pathway. Similarly analysis of the excreted metabolites in the ∆calB (MFC-pump) strain showed that the encoded pump was required for efficient export of calbistrin A and B.                  Conclusion:                       Here we report the discovery of a gene cluster (calA-M) involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide calbistrin in P. decumbens. Targeted gene deletions proved the involvement of CalA (polyketide synthase) in the biosynthesis of calbistrin, CalB (major facilitator pump) for the export of calbistrin A and B and CalC for the transcriptional regulation of the cal-cluster. This study lays the foundation for further characterization of the calbistrin biosynthetic pathway in multiple species and the development of an efficient calbistrin producing cell factory.	1
Abstract2class: Occurrence of the Campylobacter resistance gene tetO in Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp Abstract: The distribution of nucleotide sequences related to tetK, tetL, tetM, and tetO was studied by dot blot hybridization in 178 strains of Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. that were resistant to tetracycline. The tetO gene, which is responsible for tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter spp., was detected in six Streptococcus strains and two Enterococcus strains, in which it was borne by similar plasmids. This observation confirms our previous proposal that tetO originated in gram-positive cocci. tetM, the most prevalent resistance gene, was present alone in 109 strains and associated with tetL in 33 strains in which the two genes contributed cooperatively to high-level tetracycline resistance. tetL was present alone in five Enterococcus strains, and tetK was detected in a single Streptococcus strain. The existence of 22 strains that did not hybridize to the probes suggest that tetracycline resistance in streptococci and enterococci involves additional gene classes as well.	0
Abstract2class: Cloning and functional analysis of the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. CS Abstract: Naphthomycins (NATs) are 29-membered naphthalenic ansamacrolactam antibiotics with antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Their biosynthesis starts from 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA). By PCR amplification with primers for AHBA synthase and amino-dehydroquinate (aDHQ) synthase, a genomic region containing orthologs of these genes was identified in Streptomyces sp. CS. It was confirmed to be involved in naphthomycin biosynthesis by deletion of a large DNA fragment, resulting in abolishment of naphthomycin production. A 106 kb region was sequenced, and 32 complete ORFs were identified, including five polyketide synthase genes, eight genes for AHBA synthesis, and putative genes for modification, regulation, transport or resistance. Targeted inactivation and complementation experiments proved that the halogenase gene nat1 is responsible for the chlorination of C-30 of NATs. The nat1 mutant could also be complemented with asm12, the halogenase gene of ansamitocin biosynthesis. Likewise, an asm12 mutant could be complemented with nat1, suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism for both halogenases. A putative hydroxylase gene, nat2, was also inactivated, whereupon the biosynthesis of NATs was completely abolished with a tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b accumulated, indicating the participation of nat2 in the formation of the naphthalene ring. The information presented here expands our understanding of the biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins, and may pave the way for engineering ansamacrolactams with improved pharmaceutical properties.	1
Abstract2class: SlyA regulates type III secretion system (T3SS) genes in parallel with the T3SS master regulator HrpL in Dickeya dadantii 3937 Abstract: The hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes of Dickeya dadantii 3937 encode a type III secretion system (T3SS) which is essential for its full virulence. Previous studies of the T3SS regulation in D. dadantii 3937 revealed that the expression of the hrp genes is regulated by a master regulator, HrpL, through the HrpX-HrpY-HrpS-HrpL and GacS-GacA-rsmB-RsmA pathways. In this work, we identified a novel regulator of the SlyA/MarR family, SlyA, which regulates hrp genes of the HrpL regulon in parallel with HrpL in D. dadantii. SlyA regulates the T3SS in a two-tier manner. It negatively regulates the expression of hrpL by downregulating hrpS and upregulating rsmA. Interestingly, concomitant with its downregulation of the hrpL, SlyA positively regulates the expression of hrpA and hrpN, two hrp genes located in the HrpL regulon. In contrast to Pectobacterium carotovorum, the expression of slyA is not controlled by ExpR and ExpI in D. dadantii 3937. We further show that SlyA is involved in controlling swimming motility and pellicle formation in D. dadantii 3937.	0
Abstract2class: New atomically precise M1Ag21 (M = Au/Ag) nanoclusters as excellent oxygen reduction reaction catalysts Abstract: By introducing 1,1'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as an activating ligand, two novel nanoclusters, M1Ag21 (M = Au/Ag), have been controllably synthesized and structurally characterized. The atomically precise structures of the M1Ag21 nanoclusters were determined by SCXC and further confirmed by ESI-TOF-MS, TGA, XPS, DPV, and FT-IR measurements. The M1Ag21 nanoclusters supported on activated carbon (C) are exploited as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in alkaline solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the catalytic activities of the two cluster-based systems originate from the significant ensemble synergy effect between the M13 kernel and dppf ligand in M1Ag21. This work sheds lights on the preparation of cluster-based electrocatalysts and other catalysts that are activated and modified by peripheral ligands.	0
Abstract2class: Structural analysis of Notch-regulating Rumi reveals basis for pathogenic mutations Abstract: Rumi O-glucosylates the EGF repeats of a growing list of proteins essential in metazoan development, including Notch. Rumi is essential for Notch signaling, and Rumi dysregulation is linked to several human diseases. Despite Rumi's critical roles, it is unknown how Rumi glucosylates a serine of many but not all EGF repeats. Here we report crystal structures of Drosophila Rumi as binary and ternary complexes with a folded EGF repeat and/or donor substrates. These structures provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and show that Rumi recognizes structural signatures of the EGF motif, the U-shaped consensus sequence, C-X-S-X-(P/A)-C and a conserved hydrophobic region. We found that five Rumi mutations identified in cancers and Dowling-Degos disease are clustered around the enzyme active site and adversely affect its activity. Our study suggests that loss of Rumi activity may underlie these diseases, and the mechanistic insights may facilitate the development of modulators of Notch signaling.	0
Abstract2class: Aryl Group Transfer from Tetraarylborato Anions to an Electrophilic Dicopper(I) Center and Mixed-Valence μ-Aryl Dicopper(I,II) Complexes Abstract: The synthesis of discrete, cationic binuclear μ-aryl dicopper complexes [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ar)DPFN]X (Ar = C6H5, 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3, and C6F5; DPFN = 2,7-bis(fluoro-di(2-pyridyl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridine; X = BAr4(-) and NTf2(-); Tf = SO2CF3) was achieved by treatment of a dicopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-NCCH3)DPFN]X2 (X = PF6(-) and NTf2(-)) with tetraarylborates. Structural characterization revealed symmetrically bridging aryl groups, and (1)H NMR spectroscopy evidenced the same structure in solution at 24 °C. Electrochemical investigation of the resulting arylcopper complexes uncovered reversible redox events that led to the synthesis and isolation of a rare mixed-valence organocopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ph)DPFN](NTf2)2 in high yield. The solid-state structure of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex exhibits inequivalent copper centers, despite a short Cu···Cu distance. Electronic and variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex suggest that the degree of spin localization is temperature-dependent, with a high degree of spin localization observed at lower temperatures. Electronic structure calculations agree with the experimental results and suggest that the spin is localized almost entirely on one metal center.	0
Abstract2class: 'Quantized' states of the charge-density wave in microcrystals of K(0.3)MoO3 Abstract: Quantization of electrons in solids can typically be observed in microscopic samples if the mean free path of the electrons exceeds the dimensions of the sample. A special case is a quasi one-dimensional metal, in which electrons condense into a collective state. This state, a charge-density wave (CDW), is a periodic modulation of both the lattice and electron density. Here, we demonstrate that samples of K(0.3)MoO(3), a typical CDW conductor, show jumps in conduction, regular in temperature. The jumps correspond to transitions between discrete states of the CDW and reveal the quantization of the wave vector of electrons near the Fermi vector. The effect involves both quantum and classical features of the CDW: the quantum condensate demonstrates modes, resembling those of a classical wave in a resonator. The analysis of the steps allows extremely precise studies of the CDW wave-vector variations and reveals new prospects for structural studies of electronic crystals and fine effects in their electronic states and lattice motions.	0
Abstract2class: The gut microbiota in young and middle-aged rats showed different responses to chicken protein in their diet Abstract: Background:                       Meat protein in the diet has been shown to be beneficial for the growth of Lactobacillus in the caecum of growing rats; however, it is unknown whether gut microbiota in middle-aged animals have the same responses to meat protein diets. This study compared the composition of the gut microbiota between young and middle-aged rats after being fed 17.7% chicken protein diet for 14 days.                  Methods:                       Feces were collected on day 0 and day 14 from young rats (4 weeks old) and middle-aged rats (64 weeks old) fed with 17.7% chicken protein diets. The composition of the gut bacteria was analyzed by sequencing the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.                  Results:                       The results showed that the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly different between young and middle-aged rats on both day 0 and day 14. The percentage of Firmicutes decreased for middle-aged rats (72.1% versus 58.1% for day 0 and day 14, respectively) but increased for young rats (41.5 versus 57.7% for day 0 and day 14, respectively). The percentage of Bacteroidetes increased to 31.2% (20.5% on day 0) for middle-aged rats and decreased to 29.6% (41.3% on day 0) for young rats. The relative abundance of the beneficial genus Lactobacillus increased in response to the intake of chicken protein in the young group, while it had the opposite effect in the middle-aged group.                  Conclusion:                       The results of our study demonstrated that 17.7% chicken protein diet promoted the beneficial genus Lactobacillus in young rats, but the opposite effect were found in the middle-aged group. To evaluate the linkage between diet and host health, age effect should be considered in the future studies.	0
Abstract2class: Efficient and Reproducible Multigene Expression after Single-Step Transfection Using Improved BAC Transgenesis and Engineering Toolkit Abstract: Achieving stable expression of a single transgene in mammalian cells remains challenging; even more challenging is obtaining simultaneous stable expression of multiple transgenes at reproducible, relative expression levels. Previously, we attained copy-number-dependent, chromosome-position-independent expression of reporter minigenes by embedding them within a BAC "scaffold" containing the mouse Msh3-Dhfr locus (DHFR BAC). Here, we extend this "BAC TG-EMBED" approach. First, we report a toolkit of endogenous promoters capable of driving transgene expression over a 0.01- to 5-fold expression range relative to the CMV promoter, allowing fine-tuning of relative expression levels of multiple reporter genes. Second, we demonstrate little variation in expression level and long-term expression stability of a reporter gene embedded in BACs containing either transcriptionally active or inactive genomic regions, making the choice of BAC scaffolds more flexible. Third, we present a novel BAC assembly scheme, "BAC-MAGIC", for inserting multiple transgenes into BAC scaffolds, which is much more time-efficient than traditional galK-based methods. As a proof-of-principle for our improved BAC TG-EMBED toolkit, we simultaneously fluorescently labeled three nuclear compartments at reproducible, relative intensity levels in 94% of stable clones after a single transfection using a DHFR BAC scaffold containing 4 transgenes assembled with BAC-MAGIC. Our extended BAC TG-EMBED toolkit and BAC-MAGIC method provide an efficient, versatile platform for stable simultaneous expression of multiple transgenes at reproducible, relative levels.	0
Abstract2class: A highly unusual polyketide synthase directs dawenol polyene biosynthesis in Stigmatella aurantiaca Abstract: Enormous progress in the field of polyketide biosynthesis has led to the establishment of rules for general text book biosynthetic logic and consequently to the assumption that biosynthetic genes can be easily correlated with the corresponding natural products. However, non-textbook examples of polyketide assembly continue to be discovered suggesting the gene to product and product to gene predictions need improvement, especially as they are increasingly used in the post-genomic era. Here, we analyzed the genomic blueprint of a myxobacterial multi-producer of secondary metabolites, Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, for its biosynthetic potential by genome-mining. In addition to the five polyketide synthase and/or nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of known function we identified a further 13 genomic regions exemplifying the enormous genetic potential for the production of additional chemical diversity by this strain. We show by gene inactivation and heterologous expression of the newly identified biosynthetic pathway for dawenol that the biosynthesis of this known polyene does not follow text book biosynthetic logic. Intriguingly, a genomic locus encoding an unusual polyketide synthase exhibiting similarity to gene loci involved in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and secondary lipids was identified.	1
Abstract2class: Chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of homogeneous glycoforms of antibody Fc domain. Presence of a bisecting sugar moiety enhances the affinity of Fc to FcγIIIa receptor Abstract: Structurally well-defined IgG-Fc glycoforms are highly demanded for understanding the effects of glycosylation on an antibody's effector functions. We report in this paper chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of an array of homogeneous IgG-Fc glycoforms. The chemoenzymatic approach consists of the chemical synthesis of defined N-glycan oxazolines as donor substrates, the expression of the Fc domain in a CHO cell line in the presence of an α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, and an endoglycosidase-catalyzed glycosylation of the deglycosylated Fc domain (GlcNAc-Fc homodimer) with the synthetic glycan oxazolines. The enzyme from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) was found to be remarkably efficient to take various modified N-glycan core oxazolines, including the bisecting sugar-containing derivatives, for Fc glycosylation remodeling, resulting in the formation of the corresponding homogeneous Fc glycoforms. Nevertheless, neither Endo-A nor the Mucor hiemalis endoglycosidase mutants (EndoM-N175A and EndoM-N175Q) were able to transfer full-length complex-type N-glycan to the Fc domain, implicating the limitations of these two enzymes in Fc glycosylation remodeling. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies with the synthetic IgG-Fc glycoforms unambiguously proved that the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc moiety could significantly enhance the binding of Fc to FcγRIIIa, the activating Fcγ receptor, independent of Fc core-fucosylation. Interestingly, the Fc glycoforms carrying an unusual bisecting sugar moiety such as a mannose or a LacNAc moiety also demonstrated enhanced affinity to FcγRIIIa. On the orther hand, the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc or core-fucosylation had little effect on the affinity of Fc to the inhibitory Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIb. Our experimental data also showed that the α-linked mannose residues in the pentasaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 core was essential to maintain a high affinity of Fc to both FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb. The synthetic homogeneous Fc glycoforms thus provide a useful tool for elucidating how a fine Fc N-glycan structure precisely affects the function of the Fc domain.	0
Abstract2class: Identification of a flavin:NADH oxidoreductase involved in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin. Purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme Abstract: The biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin by Streptomyces coelicolor involves the oxidative dimerization and hydroxylation of a precursor, most likely dihydrokalafungin, as the final steps in its formation. Mutations in the actVB gene block these last steps, and the mutants secrete kalafungin as a shunt product. To investigate the role of the actVB gene in these transformation, we have overexpressed the gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVB was shown to catalyze the reduction of FMN by NADH to give NAD and FMNH2, which, unusually, is released into solution. The protein contains no chromogenic cofactors and exhibits no requirements for added metal ions. The reaction obeys simple kinetics and proceeds through the formation of a ternary complex; Km values for FMN and NADH are 1.5 and 7.3 microM, respectively, and kcat is about 5 s-1. FAD and riboflavin are also substrates for the enzyme, although they have much higher Km values. The subunit structure of the enzyme was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation, which showed the protein to exist in rapid equilibrium between monomer and dimer forms. The possible role of this oxidoreductase in the oxidative chemistry of actinorhodin biosynthesis is discussed.	1
Abstract2class: Echinocandin B biosynthesis: a biosynthetic cluster from Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 8112 and reassembly of the subclusters Ecd and Hty from Aspergillus pachycristatus NRRL 11440 reveals a single coherent gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Echinocandins are nonribosomal lipopeptides produced by ascommycete fungi. Due to their strong inhibitory effect on fungal cell wall biosynthesis and lack of human toxicity, they have been developed to an important class of antifungal drugs. Since 2012, the biosynthetic gene clusters of most of the main echinocandin variants have been characterized. Especially the comparison of the clusters allows a deeper insight for the biosynthesis of these complex structures.                  Results:                       In the genome of the echinocandin B producer Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 8112 we have identified a gene cluster (Ani) that encodes echinocandin biosynthesis. Sequence analyses showed that Ani is clearly delimited from the genomic context and forms a monophyletic lineage with the other echinocandin gene clusters. Importantly, we found that the disjunct genomic location of the echinocandin B gene cluster in A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 on two separate subclusters, Ecd and Hty, at two loci was likely an artifact of genome misassembly in the absence of a reference sequence. We show that both sequences can be aligned resulting a single cluster with a gene arrangement collinear compared to other clusters of Aspergillus section Nidulantes. The reassembled gene cluster (Ecd/Hty) is identical to a putative gene cluster (AE) that was previously deposited at the NCBI as a sequence from A. delacroxii NRRL 3860. PCR amplification of a part of the gene cluster resulted a sequence that was very similar (97 % identity), but not identical to that of AE.                  Conclusions:                       The Echinocandin B biosynthetic cluster from A. nidulans NRRL 8112 (Ani) is particularly similar to that of A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 (Ecd/Hty). Ecd/Hty was originally reported as two disjunct sub-clusters Ecd and Hty, but is in fact a continuous sequence with the same gene order as in Ani. According to sequences of PCR products amplified from genomic DNA, the echinocandin B producer A. delacroxii NRRL 3860 is closely related to A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440. A PCR-product from the gene cluster was very similar, but clearly distinct from the sequence published for A. delacroxii NRRL 3860 at the NCBI (No. AB720074). As the NCBI entry is virtually identical with the re-assembled Ecd/Hty cluster, it is likely that it originates from A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 rather than A. delacroxii NRRL 3860.	1
Abstract2class: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin, an SJG-136 monomeric analog Abstract: Tomaymycin produced by Streptomyces achromogenes is a naturally produced pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). The biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin was identified and sequenced. The gene cluster analysis reveals a novel biosynthetic pathway for the anthranilate moiety of PBDs. Gene replacement and chemical complementation studies were used to confirm the proposed biosynthetic pathway.	1
Abstract2class: Ecological dynamics of toxic Microcystis spp. and microcystin-degrading bacteria in Dianchi Lake, China Abstract: Toxic cyanobacterial blooms directly threaten both human safety and the ecosystem of surface waters. The widespread occurrence of these organisms, coupled with the tumor-promoting properties of the microcystin toxins that they produce, demands action to mitigate their potential impacts and, thus, a robust understanding of their ecological dynamics. In the present work, the abundance of toxic Microcystis spp. and microcystin (MC)-degrading bacteria in Dianchi Lake, located in Yunnan Province, China, was studied using quantitative PCR. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from June 2010 to December 2011 at three sampling stations within this freshwater lake. Results revealed that variation in the abundance of both total Microcystis spp. and toxic Microcystis spp. exhibited similar trends during the period of the algal bloom, including the reinvasion, pelagic growth, sedimentation, and overwintering periods, and that the proportion of toxic Microcystis was highest during the bloom and lowest in winter. Importantly, we observed that peaks in mlrA gene copy numbers of MC-degrading bacteria occurred in the months following observed peaks in MC concentrations. To understand this phenomenon, we added MCs to the MC-degrading bacteria (designated strains HW and SW in this study) and found that MCs significantly enhanced mlrA gene copy numbers over the number for the control by a factor of 5.2 for the microcystin-RR treatment and a factor of 3.7 for the microcystin-LR treatment. These results indicate that toxic Microcystis and MC-degrading bacteria exert both direct and indirect effects on each other and that MC-degrading bacteria also mediate a shift from toxic to nontoxic populations of Microcystis.	0
Abstract2class: Core assembly mechanism of quinocarcin/SF-1739: bimodular complex nonribosomal peptide synthetases for sequential mannich-type reactions Abstract: Quinocarcin and SF-1739, potent antitumor antibiotics, share a common tetracyclic tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ)-pyrrolidine core scaffold. Herein, we describe the identification of their biosynthetic gene clusters and biochemical analysis of Qcn18/Cya18 generating the previously unidentified extender unit dehydroarginine, which is a component of the pyrrolidine ring. ATP-inorganic pyrophosphate exchange experiments with five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) enabled us to identify their substrates. On the basis of these data, we propose that a biosynthetic pathway comprising a three-component NRPS/MbtH family protein complex, Qcn16/17/19, plays a key role in the construction of tetracyclic THIQ-pyrrolidine core scaffold involving sequential Pictet-Spengler and intramolecular Mannich reactions. Furthermore, data derived from gene inactivation experiments led us to propose late-modification steps of quinocarcin.	1
Abstract2class: Structural Characterization and Bioactivity Analysis of the Two-Component Lantibiotic Flv System from a Ruminant Bacterium Abstract: The discovery of new ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has greatly benefitted from the influx of genomic information. The lanthipeptides are a subset of this class of compounds. Adopting the genome-mining approach revealed a novel lanthipeptide gene cluster encoded in the genome of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, an anaerobic bacterium that is an important member of the rumen microbiota of livestock. The post-translationally modified peptides were produced via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Subsequent structural characterization and assessment of their bioactivity revealed features reminiscent of and distinct from previously reported lanthipeptides. The lanthipeptides of R. flavefaciens FD-1 represent a unique example within two-component lanthipeptides, consisting of a highly conserved α-peptide and a diverse set of eight β-peptides.	1
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T (DSM 10154) consists of d-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fucp3NAc). Thymidine diphosphate-activated d-Fucp3NAc serves as precursor for the assembly of structural polysaccharides in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-d-galactose (dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc) involves five enzymes. The first two steps of the reaction are catalyzed by enzymes that are part of the well studied dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, namely d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB). The enzymes catalyzing the last three synthesis reactions have not been characterized biochemically so far. These steps include an isomerase, a transaminase, and a transacetylase. We identified all five genes involved by chromosome walking in the Gram-positive organism A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T and overexpressed the three new enzymes heterologously in Escherichia coli. The activities of these enzymes were monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the intermediate products formed were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis. Alignment of the newly identified proteins with known sequences revealed that the elucidated pathway in this Gram-positive organism may also be valid in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative organisms. The key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc has been identified as an isomerase, which converts the 4-keto educt into the 3-keto product, with concomitant epimerization at C-4 to produce a 6-deoxy-d-xylo configuration. This is the first report of the functional characterization of the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc and description of a novel type of isomerase capable of synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-3-ulose from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose.	1
Abstract2class: Macrodiolide formation by the thioesterase of a modular polyketide synthase Abstract: Elaiophylin is an unusual C2 -symmetric antibiotic macrodiolide produced on a bacterial modular polyketide synthase assembly line. To probe the mechanism and selectivity of diolide formation, we sought to reconstitute ring formation in vitro by using a non-natural substrate. Incubation of recombinant elaiophylin thioesterase/cyclase with a synthetic pentaketide analogue of the presumed monomeric polyketide precursor of elaiophylin, specifically its N-acetylcysteamine thioester, produced a novel 16-membered C2 -symmetric macrodiolide. A linear dimeric thioester is an intermediate in ring formation, which indicates iterative use of the thioesterase active site in ligation and subsequent cyclization. Furthermore, the elaiophylin thioesterase acts on a mixture of pentaketide and tetraketide thioesters to give both the symmetric decaketide diolide and the novel asymmetric hybrid nonaketide diolide. Such thioesterases have potential as tools for the in vitro construction of novel diolides.	0
Abstract2class: Simultaneous determination of the total number of aquatic bacteria and the number thereof involved in respiration Abstract: The electron transport system of respiring organisms reduces 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT) to INT-formazan. Respiring bacteria deposit accumulated INT-formazan intracellularly as dark red spots. Corresponding to electron transport system activity, these deposits attain a size and a degree of optical density which allows them to be examined by light microscopy. If polycarbonate filters and epifluorescence microscopy are applied to analyze an INT-treated water sample, it is possible to differentiate between respiring and apparently nonrespiring bacteria. This differentiation, which permits determinations of the total number of bacteria and the proportion thereof involved in respiration, is realized directly within one and the same microscopic image. Initial applications of the present method for hydrobiological purposes showed that the proportion of respiring aquatic bacteria ranged between 6 to 12% (samples taken from coastal areas of the Baltic Sea) and 5 to 36% (samples taken from freshwater lakes and ponds). Cells of 1.6 to 2.4 micrometer (freshwater) and 0.4 micrometer (Baltic Sea) account for the highest proportion of respiring bacteria.	0
Abstract2class: Direct visualization of the outer membrane of mycobacteria and corynebacteria in their native state Abstract: The cell envelope of mycobacteria, which include the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, is crucial for their success as pathogens. Despite a continued strong emphasis on identifying the multiple chemical components of this envelope, it has proven difficult to combine its components into a comprehensive structural model, primarily because the available ultrastructural data rely on conventional electron microscopy embedding and sectioning, which are known to induce artifacts. The existence of an outer membrane bilayer has long been postulated but has never been directly observed by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. Here we have used cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) to perform a detailed ultrastructural analysis of three species belonging to the Corynebacterineae suborder, namely, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, in their native state. We provide new information that accurately describes the different layers of the mycobacterial cell envelope and challenges current models of the organization of its components. We show a direct visualization of an outer membrane, analogous to that found in gram-negative bacteria, in the three bacterial species examined. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mycolic acids, the hallmark of mycobacteria and related genera, are essential for the formation of this outer membrane. In addition, a granular layer and a low-density zone typifying the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria are apparent in CEMOVIS images of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. Based on our observations, a model of the organization of the lipids in the outer membrane is proposed. The architecture we describe should serve as a reference for future studies to relate the structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope to its function.	0
Abstract2class: Frankobactin Metallophores Produced by Nitrogen-Fixing Frankia Actinobacteria Function in Toxic Metal Sequestration Abstract: A series of new metallophores, referred to as frankobactins, were extracted from cultures of the symbiotic and nitrogen-fixing actinobacterium Frankia sp. CH37. Structure elucidation revealed a 2-hydroxyphenyl-substituted oxazoline core and a chain composed of five proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids, suggesting nonribosomal peptide synthesis as the biosynthetic origin. By whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and comparison with other Frankia strains, the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis was detected. Spectrophotometric titration of frankobactin with Fe(III) and Cu(II) and mass spectrometry established the 1:1 (metal:frankobactin) coordination. Uptake experiments suggested that frankobactin A1 (1) did not serve to recruit iron, but to detoxify Cu(II). As frankobactin A1 prevents the cellular entry of Cu(II), it could play a crucial role in the symbiosis of Frankia sp. and its host in the reclamation of copper-contaminated soil.	1
Abstract2class: The actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus: a genetic hall of mirrors for synthesis of a molecule with mirror symmetry Abstract: A gene cluster was identified which contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of actinomycin encompassing 50 kb of contiguous DNA on the chromosome of Streptomyces chrysomallus. It contains 28 genes with biosynthetic functions and is bordered on both sides by IS elements. Unprecedentedly, the cluster consists of two large inverted repeats of 11 and 13 genes, respectively, with four nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in the middle. Nine genes in each repeat have counterparts in the other, in the same arrangement but in the opposite orientation, suggesting an inverse duplication of one of the arms during the evolution of the gene cluster. All of the genes appear to be organized into operons, each corresponding to a functional section of actinomycin biosynthesis, such as peptide assembly, regulation, resistance, and biosynthesis of the precursor of the actinomycin chromophore 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA). For 4-MHA synthesis, functional analysis revealed genes that encode pathway-specific isoforms of tryptophan dioxygenase, kynurenine formamidase, and hydroxykynureninase, which are distinct from the corresponding enzyme activities of cellular tryptophan catabolism in their regulation and in part in their substrate specificity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the pathway-specific tryptophan metabolism in Streptomyces most probably evolved divergently from the normal pathway of tryptophan catabolism to provide an extra or independent supply of building blocks for the synthesis of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites.	1
Abstract2class: Variochelins, Lipopeptide Siderophores from Variovorax boronicumulans Discovered by Genome Mining Abstract: Photoreactive siderophores have a major impact on the growth of planktonic organisms. To date, these molecules have mainly been reported from marine bacteria, although evidence is now accumulating that some terrestrial bacteria also harbor the biosynthetic potential for their production. In this paper, we describe the genomics-driven discovery and characterization of variochelins, lipopeptide siderophores from the bacterium Variovorax boronicumulans, which thrives in soil and freshwater habitats. Variochelins are different from most other lipopeptide siderophores in that their biosynthesis involves a polyketide synthase. We demonstrate that the ferric iron complex of variochelin A possesses photoreactive properties and present the MS-derived structures of two degradation products that emerge upon light exposure.	1
Abstract2class: Functional analysis of a prenyltransferase gene (paxD) in the paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Paxilline is an indole-diterpene produced by Penicillium paxilli. Six genes (paxB, C, G, M, P, and Q) in paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster were previously shown to be responsible for paxilline biosynthesis. In this study, we have characterized paxD, which is located next to paxQ and has weak similarities to fungal dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase genes. PaxD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the purified enzyme was used for in vitro analysis. When paxilline and dimethylallyl diphosphate were used as substrates, one major and one minor product, which were identified as di-prenyl paxilline and mono-prenyl paxilline by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, were formed. The structure of the major product was determined to be 21,22-diprenylated paxilline, showing that PaxD catalyzed the successive di-prenylation. Traces of both products were detected in culture broth of P. paxilli by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The enzyme is likely to be a dimer and required no divalent cations. The optimum pH and temperature were 8.0 and 37 °C, respectively. The Km values were calculated as 106.4 ± 5.4 μM for paxilline and 0.57 ± 0.02 μM for DMAPP with a kcat of 0.97 ± 0.01/s.	1
Abstract2class: Insights into the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide and antibiotics through the structures of two retaining glycosyltransferases from family GT4 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the synthesis of the myriad glycoconjugates that are central to life. One of the largest families is GT4, which contains several enzymes of therapeutic significance, exemplified by WaaG and AviGT4. WaaG catalyses a key step in lipopolysaccharide synthesis, while AviGT4, produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes, contributes to the synthesis of the antibiotic avilamycin A. Here we present the crystal structure of both WaaG and AviGT4. The two enzymes contain two "Rossmann-like" (beta/alpha/beta) domains characteristic of the GT-B fold. Both recognition of the donor substrate and the catalytic machinery is similar to other retaining GTs that display the GT-B fold. Structural information is discussed with respect to the evolution of GTs and the therapeutic significance of the two enzymes.	1
Abstract2class: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. V. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-[(Z)-2-methoxycarbonylvinylthio]-7 beta- [(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(oxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 3-[(Z)-2-methoxycarbonylvinylthio]-7 beta-[(2- aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-cephalosporins (1) having various oxyimino groups (Z-form) at the alpha position of the C-7 side chain was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats. Of these, the cephalosporin (1a) with a hydroxyimino group in the C-7 side chain showed a potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus as well as good oral absorption in rats. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Abstract2class: Designed post-self-assembly structural and functional modifications of a truncated tetrahedron Abstract: Post-self-assembly modifications of a discrete metal-organic supramolecular structure have been developed. Such modifications allow the properties of the self-assembled supramolecular species to be changed in a simple and efficient manner (>90% yield). Initiated by the application of chemical stimuli, the post-self-assembly modifications described herein result in three distinct changes to the supramolecular system: an individual building-block component change, an overall structural modification, and a functional evolution of a [6+4] metal-organic supramolecular structure. The three modifications have been carefully examined by a range of characterization methods, including NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR measurements, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulations.	0
Abstract2class: Complex regulation of secondary metabolism controlling pathogenicity in the phytopathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata Abstract: The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata includes seven pathogenic variants (pathotypes), which produce different host-selective toxins and cause disease on different plants. The Japanese pear, strawberry and tangerine pathotypes produce AK-toxin, AF-toxin and ACT-toxin, respectively, which have a common structural moiety, 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid (EDA). Here, we identified a new gene, AKT7 (AK-toxin biosynthetic gene 7), from the Japanese pear pathotype, which encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and functions to limit AK-toxin production. AKT7 homologs were found in the strawberry pathotype, but not the tangerine pathotype. However, the strawberry pathotype homolog appeared to include a premature stop codon. Although the Japanese pear pathotype strain has multiple copies of AKT7, a single-copy disruption resulted in mutants with increased production of AK-toxin and EDA. AKT7 overexpression in the three pathotypes caused marked reductions of toxin and EDA production, suggesting that Akt7 catalyzes a side reaction of EDA or its precursor. AKT7 overexpression caused reduced virulence in these pathotypes. We also found that AKT7 transcripts predominantly include misspliced mRNAs, which have premature stop codons. Our observations suggest that the AK-toxin production required for full virulence is regulated in a complex way by the copy number and intron information content of AKT7.	1
Abstract2class: Nucleotide sequence and characterization of a Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a flagellar switch protein Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis fliM gene has been determined. This gene encodes a 38-kDa protein that is homologous to the FliM flagellar switch proteins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Expression of this gene in Che+ cells of E. coli and B. subtilis interferes with normal chemotaxis. The nature of the chemotaxis defect is dependent upon the host used. In B. subtilis, overproduction of FliM generates mostly nonmotile cells. Those cells that are motile switch less frequently. Expression of B. subtilis FliM in E. coli also generates nonmotile cells. However, those cells that are motile have a tumble bias. The B. subtilis fliM gene cannot complement an E. coli fliM mutant. A frameshift mutation was constructed in the fliM gene, and the mutation was transferred onto the B. subtilis chromosome. The mutant has a Fla- phenotype. This phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that the FliM protein encodes a component of the flagellar switch in B. subtilis. Additional characterization of the fliM mutant suggests that the hag and mot loci are not expressed. These loci are regulated by the SigD form of RNA polymerase. We also did not observe any methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in an in vivo methylation experiment. The expression of these proteins is also dependent upon SigD. It is possible that a functional basal body-hook complex may be required for the expression of SigD-regulated chemotaxis and motility genes.	0
Abstract2class: A Single-Chain Photoswitchable CRISPR-Cas9 Architecture for Light-Inducible Gene Editing and Transcription Abstract: Optical control of CRISPR-Cas9-derived proteins would be useful for restricting gene editing or transcriptional regulation to desired times and places. Optical control of Cas9 functions has been achieved with photouncageable unnatural amino acids or by using light-induced protein interactions to reconstitute Cas9-mediated functions from two polypeptides. However, these methods have only been applied to one Cas9 species and have not been used for optical control of different perturbations at two genes. Here, we use photodissociable dimeric fluorescent protein domains to engineer single-chain photoswitchable Cas9 (ps-Cas9) proteins in which the DNA-binding cleft is occluded at baseline and opened upon illumination. This design successfully controlled different species and functional variants of Cas9, mediated transcriptional activation more robustly than previous optogenetic methods, and enabled light-induced transcription of one gene and editing of another in the same cells. Thus, a single-chain photoswitchable architecture provides a general method to control a variety of Cas9-mediated functions.	0
Abstract2class: Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster from Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The indole-diterpene paxilline is a potent tremorgenic mammalian mycotoxin and a known inhibitor of maxi-K ion channels. The gene cluster responsible for paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli was identified by mapping four large plasmid-induced chromosome deletions. The cluster is predicted to lie within a 50 kb region of chromosome Va and to contain 17 genes, including a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase (paxG), two FAD-dependent monooxygenases (paxM and N), two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (paxP and Q), a dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT) synthase (paxD) and two possible transcription factors (paxR and paxS), which contain a Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding motif. Targeted replacement of paxG confirmed that it is essential for paxilline biosynthesis but dispensable for growth. The GGPP for primary metabolism is predicted to be provided by a second GGPP synthase (ggs1) that was cloned, sequenced and mapped to chromosome IV. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression of paxG, paxM and paxP in submerged liquid cultures of P. paxilli increased dramatically with the onset of paxilline biosynthesis. In contrast, the expression of beta-tubulin (tub2) and ggs1 was not induced. This is the first description of the molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster.	1
Abstract2class: Temporal sequence of events during the initiation process in Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid replication: roles of the dnaA and dnaC gene products and ribonucleic acid polymerase Abstract: Three thermosensitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) initiation mutants of Escherichia coli exposed to the restrictive temperature for one to two generations were examined for the ability to reinitiate DNA replication after returning to the permissive temperature in the presence of rifampin, chloramphenicol, or nalidixic acid. Reinitiation in the dnaA mutant was inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas renitiation was not inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas reinitiation was not inhibited in two dnaC mutants by either rifampin or chloramphenicol. To observe the rifampin inhibition, the antibiotic must be added at least 10 min before return to the permissive temperature. The rifampin inhibition of reinitiation was not observed when a rifampin-resistant ribonucleic acid ((RNA) polymerase gene was introduced into the dnaA mutant, demonstrating that RNA polymerase synthesizes one or more RNA species required for the initation of DNA replication (origin-RNA). Reinitiation at 30 degrees C was not inhibited by streptolydigin in a stretolydigin-sensitive dnaA muntant. Incubation in the presence of nalidixic acid prevented subsequent reinitiation in the dnaC28 mutant but did not inhibit reinitiation in the dnaA5 muntant. These results demonstrate that the dnaA gene product acts before or during the synthesis of an origin-RNA, RNA polymerase synthesizes this origin RNA, and the dnaC gene product is involved in a step after this RNA synthesis event. Furthermore, these results suggest that the dnaC gene product is involved in the first deoxyribounucleotide polymerization event wheareas the dnaA gene product acts prior to this event. A model is presented describing the temporal sequence of events that occur during initiation of a round of DNA replication, based on results in this and the accompanying paper.	0
Abstract2class: Quantitative glycomics from fluidic glycan microarrays Abstract: A hallmark of cell-surface processes involving glycans is their multivalent interaction with glycan binding proteins (GBPs). Such a multivalent interaction depends critically on the mobility and density of signaling molecules on the membrane surface. While glycan microarrays have been used in exploring multivalent interactions, the lack of mobility and the difficulty in controlling surface density both limit their quantitative applications. Here we apply a fluidic glycan microarray, with glycan density varying for orders of magnitude, to profile cell surface interaction using a model system, the adhesion of Escherichia coli to mannose. We show the quantitative determination of monovalent and multivalent adhesion channels; the latter can be inhibited by nanopartices presenting a high density of mannosyl groups. These results reveal a new E. coli adhesion mechanism: the switching in the FimH adhesion protein avidity from monovalent to multivalent as the density of mobile mannosyl groups increases; such avidity switching enhances binding affinity and triggers multiple fimbriae anchoring. Affinity enhancement toward FimH has only been observed before for oligo-mannose due to the turn on of secondary interactions outside the mannose binding pocket. We suggest that the new mechanism revealed by the fluidic microarray is of general significance to cell surface interactions: the dynamic clustering of simple sugar groups (homogeneous or heterogeneous) on the fluidic membrane surface may simulate the functions of complex glycan molecules.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane-Type Sesquiterpene Esters Abstract: Drimane-type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane-type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a γ-butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster-associated cytochrome P450 and FAD-binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane-type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.	1
Abstract2class: Toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1. Nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes and their expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes which encode the first three enzymes in the catabolism of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1 was determined. The genes encode the three components of the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system: reductaseTOL (todA), ferredoxinTOL (todB), and the two subunits of the terminal dioxygenase (todC1C2); (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (todD); and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE). Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the tod genes was used to construct clones of Escherichia coli JM109 that overproduce toluene dioxygenase (JM109(pDT-601]; toluene dioxygenase and (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (JM109(pDTG602]; and toluene dioxygenase, (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase, and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (JM109(pDTG603]. The overexpression of the tod-C1C2BADE gene products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three E. coli JM109 strains harboring the plasmids pDTG601, pDTG602, and pDTG603, after induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, oxidized toluene to (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene, 3-methylcatechol, and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate, respectively. The tod-C1C2BAD genes show significant homology to the reported nucleotide sequence for benzene dioxygenase and cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase from P. putida 136R-3 (Irie, S., Doi, S., Yorifuji, T., Takagi, M., and Yano, K. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 5174-5179). In addition, significant homology was observed between the nucleotide sequences for the todDE genes and the sequences reported for cis-1,2-dihydroxy-6-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Furukawa, K., Arimura, N., and Miyazaki, T. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 427-429).	0
Abstract2class: Spliceostatin hemiketal biosynthesis in Burkholderia spp. is catalyzed by an iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Abstract: Spliceostatins are potent spliceosome inhibitors biosynthesized by a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) system of the trans-acyl transferase (AT) type. Burkholderia sp. FERM BP-3421 produces hemiketal spliceostatins, such as FR901464, as well as analogs containing a terminal carboxylic acid. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence for hemiketal biosynthesis by oxidative decarboxylation rather than the previously hypothesized Baeyer-Villiger oxidative release postulated to be catalyzed by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) activity internal to the last module of the PKS. Inactivation of Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene fr9P led to loss of hemiketal congeners, whereas the mutant was still able to produce all major carboxylic acid-type compounds. FMO mutants, on the other hand, produced both hemiketal and carboxylic acid analogs containing an exocyclic methylene instead of an epoxide, indicating that the FMO is involved in epoxidation rather than Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Moreover, recombinant Fr9P enzyme was shown to catalyze hydroxylation to form β-hydroxy acids, which upon decarboxylation led to hemiketal FR901464. Finally, a third oxygenase activity encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Fr9R, was assigned as a 4-hydroxylase based on gene inactivation results. Identification and deletion of the gene involved in hemiketal formation allowed us to generate a strain--the dioxygenase fr9P(-) mutant--that accumulates only the carboxylic acid-type spliceostatins, which are as potent as the hemiketal analogs, when derivatized to increase cell permeability, but are chemically more stable.	1
Abstract2class: Pneumocandin biosynthesis: involvement of a trans-selective proline hydroxylase Abstract: Echinocandins are cyclic nonribosomal hexapeptides based mostly on nonproteinogenic amino acids and displaying strong antifungal activity. Despite previous studies on their biosynthesis by fungi, the origin of three amino acids, trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline, as well as trans-3-hydroxy-4-methylproline, is still unknown. Here we describe the identification, overexpression, and characterization of GloF, the first eukaryotic α-ketoglutarate/Fe(II) -dependent proline hydroxylase from the pneumocandin biosynthesis cluster of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis ATCC 74030. In in vitro transformations with L-proline, GloF generates trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline simultaneously in a ratio of 8:1; the latter reaction was previously unknown for proline hydroxylase catalysis. trans-4-Methyl-L-proline is converted into the corresponding trans-3-hydroxyproline. All three hydroxyprolines required for the biosynthesis of the echinocandins pneumocandins A0 and B0 in G. lozoyensis are thus provided by GloF. Sequence analyses revealed that GloF is not related to bacterial proline hydroxylases, and none of the putative proteins with high sequence similarity in the databases has been characterized so far.	1
Abstract2class: Cs3VO(O2)2CO3: an exceptionally thermostable carbonatoperoxovanadate with an extremely large second-harmonic generation response Abstract: A novel nonlinear optical (NLO) carbonatoperoxovanadate, Cs3VO(O2)2CO3, with an exceptionally high thermostability was successfully synthesized by introducing highly polarizable Cs+ cations and inorganic polydentate carbonate anions into asymmetric peroxovanadates. The structure of Cs3VO(O2)2CO3 is composed of distorted [VO(O2)2CO3]3- units and charge balancing Cs+ cations. The title compound exhibits the largest NLO intensity ever found in the current carbonate NLO materials, i.e., 23.0 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The remarkably strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) response originates from the synergistic effect of the exceedingly polarizable Cs+ cations, distortive polyhedra of the V5+ cation, delocalized π orbitals in CO3 groups, and distorted localized π orbitals in O2 groups. First-principles calculations indicated that introducing the polarizable cations into peroxovanadates not only induces the enhancement of the SHG response but also improves the thermal stability of the framework.	0
Abstract2class: The Immunosuppressant Brasilicardin: Determination of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in the Heterologous Host Amycolatopsis japonicum Abstract: Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 is the producer of the immunosuppressants brasilicardins A-D. Brasilicardin is a promising compound because of its unique mode of action and its higher potency and reduced toxicity compared to today's standard drugs. However, production of brasilicardin is so far hampered as Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 synthesizes brasilicardin in only low amounts and represents a human pathogen (biosafety level 2 BSL2). In order to achieve a safe and high yield production of brasilicardin A (BraA), the authors heterologously express the brasilicardin gene cluster in the nocardioform actinomycete Amycolatopsis japonicum (A. japonicum::bcaAB01), which is fast growing, genetically accessible and closely related to N. terpenica IFM 0406. In A. japonicum::bcaAB01, four brasilicardin congeners, intermediates of the BraA biosynthesis, are produced. Investigation of the genes flanking the previously defined brasilicardin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed two novel genes (bra0, bra12), which are involved in brasilicardin biosynthesis: bra12 encodes a transcriptional activator of the brasilicardin gene cluster. bra0 codes for a dioxygenase involved in methoxylation of brasilicardin. Based on this finding the authors are able to revise the proposed brasilicardin biosynthesis.	1
Abstract2class: Genes coding for hepatotoxic heptapeptides (microcystins) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena strain 90 Abstract: The cluster of microcystin synthetase genes from Anabaena strain 90 was sequenced and characterized. The total size of the region is 55.4 kb, and the genes are organized in three putative operons. The first operon (mcyA-mcyB-mcyC) is transcribed in the opposite direction from the second operon (mcyG-mcyD-mcyJ-mcyE-mcyF-mcyI) and the third operon (mcyH). The genes mcyA, mcyB, and mcyC encode nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), while mcyD codes for a polyketide synthase (PKS), and mcyG and mcyE are mixed NRPS-PKS genes. The genes mcyJ, mcyF, and mcyI are similar to genes coding for a methyltransferase, an aspartate racemase, and a D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, respectively. The region in the first module of mcyB coding for the adenylation domain was found to be 96% identical with the corresponding part of mcyC, suggesting a recent duplication of this fragment and a replacement in mcyB. In Anabaena strain 90, the order of the domains encoded by the genes in the two sets (from mcyG to mcyI and from mcyA to mcyC) is colinear with the hypothetical order of the enzymatic reactions for microcystin biosynthesis. The order of the microcystin synthetase genes in Anabaena strain 90 differs from the arrangement found in two other cyanobacterial species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii. The average sequence match between the microcystin synthetase genes of Anabaena strain 90 and the corresponding genes of the other species is 74%. The identity of the individual proteins varies from 67 to 81%. The genes of microcystin biosynthesis from three major producers of this toxin are now known. This makes it possible to design probes and primers to identify the toxin producers in the environment.	1
Abstract2class: Dual phenazine gene clusters enable diversification during biosynthesis Abstract: Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) bridging genotype and phenotype continuously evolve through gene mutations and recombinations to generate chemical diversity. Phenazine BGCs are widespread in bacteria, and the biosynthetic mechanisms of the formation of the phenazine structural core have been illuminated in the last decade. However, little is known about the complex phenazine core-modification machinery. Here, we report the diversity-oriented modifications of the phenazine core through two distinct BGCs in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus szentirmaii, which lives in symbiosis with nematodes. A previously unidentified aldehyde intermediate, which can be modified by multiple enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, is a common intermediate bridging the pathways encoded by these BGCs. Evaluation of the antibiotic activity of the resulting phenazine derivatives suggests a highly effective strategy to convert Gram-positive specific phenazines into broad-spectrum antibiotics, which might help the bacteria-nematode complex to maintain its special environmental niche.	1
Abstract2class: High glycolytic flux improves pyruvate production by a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain Abstract: We report pyruvate formation in Escherichia coli strain ALS929 containing mutations in the aceEF, pfl, poxB, pps, and ldhA genes which encode, respectively, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate oxidase, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The glycolytic rate and pyruvate productivity were compared using glucose-, acetate-, nitrogen-, or phosphorus-limited chemostats at a growth rate of 0.15 h(-1). Of these four nutrient limitation conditions, growth under acetate limitation resulted in the highest glycolytic flux (1.60 g/g . h), pyruvate formation rate (1.11 g/g h), and pyruvate yield (0.70 g/g). Additional mutations in atpFH and arcA (strain ALS1059) further elevated the steady-state glycolytic flux to 2.38 g/g h in an acetate-limited chemostat, with heterologous NADH oxidase expression causing only modest additional improvement. A fed-batch process with strain ALS1059 using defined medium with 5 mM betaine as osmoprotectant and an exponential feeding rate of 0.15 h(-1) achieved 90 g/liter pyruvate, with an overall productivity of 2.1 g/liter h and yield of 0.68 g/g.	0
Abstract2class: Identification and partial characterization of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene responsible for cereulide production in emetic Bacillus cereus Abstract: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Due to its chemical structure, (D-O-Leu-D-Ala-L-O-Val-L-Val)(3), cereulide might be synthesized nonribosomally. Therefore, degenerate PCR primers targeted to conserved sequence motifs of known nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes were used to amplify gene fragments from a cereulide-producing B. cereus strain. Sequence analysis of one of the amplicons revealed a DNA fragment whose putative gene product showed significant homology to valine activation NRPS modules. The sequences of the flanking regions of this DNA fragment revealed a complete module that is predicted to activate valine, as well as a putative carboxyl-terminal thioesterase domain of the NRPS gene. Disruption of the peptide synthetase gene by insertion of a kanamycin cassette through homologous recombination produced cereulide-deficient mutants. The valine-activating module was highly conserved when sequences from nine emetic B. cereus strains isolated from diverse geographical locations were compared. Primers were designed based on the NRPS sequence, and the resulting PCR assay, targeting the ces gene, was tested by using a panel of 143 B. cereus group strains and 40 strains of other bacterial species showing PCR bands specific for only the cereulide-producing B. cereus strains.	1
Abstract2class: Salivaricin G32, a Homolog of the Prototype Streptococcus pyogenes Nisin-Like Lantibiotic SA-FF22, Produced by the Commensal Species Streptococcus salivarius Abstract: Salivaricin G32, a 2667 Da novel member of the SA-FF22 cluster of lantibiotics, has been purified and characterized from Streptococcus salivarius strain G32. The inhibitory peptide differs from the Streptococcus pyogenes-produced SA-FF22 in the absence of lysine in position 2. The salivaricin G32 locus was widely distributed in BLIS-producing S. salivarius, with 6 (23%) of 26 strains PCR-positive for the structural gene, slnA. As for most other lantibiotics produced by S. salivarius, the salivaricin G32 locus can be megaplasmid encoded. Another member of the SA-FF22 family was detected in two Streptococcus dysgalactiae of bovine origin, an observation supportive of widespread distribution of this lantibiotic within the genus Streptococcus. Since the inhibitory spectrum of salivaricin G32 includes Streptococcus pyogenes, its production by S. salivarius, either as a member of the normal oral microflora or as a commercial probiotic, could serve to enhance protection of the human host against S. pyogenes infection.	1
Abstract2class: Direct observation of an enamine intermediate in amine catalysis Abstract: An enamine intermediate is believed to be the central feature of biological catalysts, such as aldolases and small molecule amine organocatalysts. Despite decades of investigation of naturally occurring aldolase enzymes and recent studies on designed aldolase antibodies and organocatalysts, direct structural observation of an enamine intermediate has proven to be rare. Herein, we report the observation of a stable enamine intermediate in the crystal structure of an aldolase antibody 33F12 in complex with a 1,3-diketone derivative. This enamine complex structure provides strong evidence that fewer residues are essential for amine catalysis within the hydrophobic environments of this catalytic antibody than speculated for natural aldolase enzymes and should serve to guide future studies aimed at the rational design of these types of catalysts, as well as organocatalysts. Indeed, enamine catalysis in proteins might be more simplistic than previously imagined.	0
Abstract2class: The sequence of a 1.8-mb bacterial linear plasmid reveals a rich evolutionary reservoir of secondary metabolic pathways Abstract: Plasmids are mobile genetic elements that play a key role in the evolution of bacteria by mediating genome plasticity and lateral transfer of useful genetic information. Although originally considered to be exclusively circular, linear plasmids have also been identified in certain bacterial phyla, notably the actinomycetes. In some cases, linear plasmids engage with chromosomes in an intricate evolutionary interplay, facilitating the emergence of new genome configurations by transfer and recombination or plasmid integration. Genome sequencing of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064, a Gram-positive soil bacterium known for its production of a diverse array of biotechnologically important secondary metabolites, revealed a giant linear plasmid of 1.8 Mb in length. This megaplasmid (pSCL4) is one of the largest plasmids ever identified and the largest linear plasmid to be sequenced. It contains more than 20% of the putative protein-coding genes of the species, but none of these is predicted to be essential for primary metabolism. Instead, the plasmid is densely packed with an exceptionally large number of gene clusters for the potential production of secondary metabolites, including a large number of putative antibiotics, such as staurosporine, moenomycin, beta-lactams, and enediynes. Interestingly, cross-regulation occurs between chromosomal and plasmid-encoded genes. Several factors suggest that the megaplasmid came into existence through recombination of a smaller plasmid with the arms of the main chromosome. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that heavy traffic of genetic information between Streptomyces plasmids and chromosomes may facilitate the rapid evolution of secondary metabolite repertoires in these bacteria.	1
Abstract2class: Identification and analysis of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster and its use for manipulating glycopeptide biosynthesis in Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908 Abstract: Seven complete genes and one incomplete gene for the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotic balhimycin were isolated from the producer, Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908, by a reverse-cloning approach and characterized. Using oligonucleotides derived from glycosyltransferase sequences, a 900-bp glycosyltransferase gene fragment was amplified and used to identify a DNA fragment of 9,882 bp. Of the identified open reading frames, three (oxyA to -C) showed significant sequence similarities to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and one (bhaA) showed similarities to halogenase, and the genes bgtfA to -C showed similarities to glycosyltransferases. Glycopeptide biosynthetic mutants were created by gene inactivation experiments eliminating oxygenase and glycosyltransferase functions. Inactivation of the oxygenase gene(s) resulted in a balhimycin mutant (SP1-1) which was not able to synthesize an antibiotically active compound. Structural analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, fragmentation studies, and amino acid analysis demonstrated that these oxygenases are involved in the coupling of the aromatic side chains of the unusual heptapeptide. Mutant strain HD1, created by inactivation of the glycosyltransferase gene bgtfB, produced at least four different compounds which were not glycosylated but still antibiotically active.	1
Abstract2class: Investigation of a 6-MSA Synthase Gene Cluster in Aspergillus aculeatus Reveals 6-MSA-derived Aculinic Acid, Aculins A-B and Epi-Aculin A Abstract: Aspergillus aculeatus, a filamentous fungus belonging to the Aspergillus clade Nigri, is an industrial workhorse in enzyme production. Recently we reported a number of secondary metabolites from this fungus; however, its genetic potential for the production of secondary metabolites is vast. In this study we identified a 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthase from A. aculeatus, and verified its functionality by episomal expression in A. aculeatus and heterologous expression in A. nidulans. Feeding studies with fully (13) C-labeled 6-MSA revealed that 6-MSA is incorporated into aculinic acid, which further incorporates into three compounds that we name aculins A and B, and epi-aculin A, described here for the first time. Based on NMR data and bioinformatic studies we propose the structures of the compounds as well as a biosynthetic pathway leading to formation of aculins from 6-MSA.	1
Abstract2class: Classification of virulent and temperate bacteriophages of Listeria spp. on the basis of morphology and protein analysis Abstract: A set of 22 phages of Listeria species (listeriaphages) (21 temperate and 1 virulent) were compared on the basis of morphology and protein composition. All 22 phages had icosahedral heads and exhibited either contractile or noncontractile tails. They represented two different morphotypes. Twenty phages belonged to the Siphoviridae family and could be differentiated only on the basis of tail length. Accordingly, they could be assigned to previously defined listeriaphage species. Two other phages were classified as members of the Myoviridae family, one of which (A511) should be regarded as a new species. It was found to be substantially different from all other known listeriaphages. All phages exhibited typical protein profiles, which were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent laser densitometrical analysis of the gels. It was then possible to distinguish eight protein subgroups on the basis of unique protein patterns. This classification corresponds well to the previous groupings based on host range. Most of the phages revealed two or three major proteins ranging from 21 to 24 kDa and 30 to 36 kDa. In addition, at least 10 minor proteins could be observed for each phage. Our results indicate that the major proteins are structural proteins of the capsid and tail, and the protein band ranging from 30 to 35 kDa could clearly be assigned to the proteins of the phage capsid.	0
Abstract2class: Substrate specificity of the lanthipeptide peptidase ElxP and the oxidoreductase ElxO Abstract: The final step in lanthipeptide biosynthesis involves the proteolytic removal of an N-terminal leader peptide. In the class I lanthipeptide epilancin 15X, this step is performed by the subtilisin-like serine peptidase ElxP. Bioinformatic, kinetic, and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ElxP recognizes the stretch of amino acids DLNPQS located near the proteolytic cleavage site of its substrate, ElxA. When the ElxP recognition motif was inserted into the noncognate lanthipeptide precursor NisA, ElxP was able to proteolytically remove the leader peptide from NisA. Proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP during the biosynthesis of epilancin 15X exposes an N-terminal dehydroalanine on the core peptide of ElxA that hydrolyzes to a pyruvyl group. The short-chain dehydrogenase ElxO reduces the pyruvyl group to a lactyl moiety in the final step of epilancin 15X maturation. Using synthetic peptides, we also investigated the substrate specificity of ElxO and determined the 1.85 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme.	1
Abstract2class: A call to order at the spirochaetal host-pathogen interface Abstract: As the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi shuttles back and forth between arthropod vector and vertebrate host, it encounters vastly different and hostile environments. Major mechanisms contributing to the success of this pathogen throughout this complex transmission cycle are phase and antigenic variation of abundant and serotype-defining surface lipoproteins. These peripherally membrane-anchored virulence factors mediate niche-specific interactions with vector/host factors and protect the spirochaete from the perils of the mammalian immune response. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Tilly, Bestor and Rosa redefine the roles of two lipoproteins, OspC and VlsE, during mammalian infection. Using a variety of promoter fusions in combination with a sensitive in vivo 'use it or lose it' gene complementation assay, the authors demonstrate that proper sequential expression of OspC followed by VlsE indeed matters. A previously suggested general functional redundancy between these and other lipoproteins is shown to be limited and dependent on an immunodeficient experimental setting that is arguably of diminished ecological relevance. These data reinforce the notion that OspC plays a unique role during initial infection while the antigenically variant VlsE proteins allow for persistence in the mammalian host.	0
Abstract2class: A copper-containing oxidase catalyzes C-nitrosation in nitrosobenzamide biosynthesis Abstract: Although C-nitroso aromatic compounds have several bioactivities of medicinal interest, the biosynthetic enzymes involved in C-nitrosation have remained unknown until now. Here, we report the entire biosynthesis pathway of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in Streptomyces murayamaensis, in which a tyrosinase-like copper-containing monooxygenase is responsible for the C-nitrosation. This finding indicates diverse catalytic functions of tyrosinase-like copper-containing monooxygenases in nature.	1
Abstract2class: A Simple and Versatile Amide Directing Group for C-H Functionalizations Abstract: Achieving selective C-H activation at a single and strategic site in the presence of multiple C-H bonds can provide a powerful and generally useful retrosynthetic disconnection. In this context, a directing group serves as a compass to guide the transition metal to C-H bonds by using distance and geometry as powerful recognition parameters to distinguish between proximal and distal C-H bonds. However, the installation and removal of directing groups is a practical drawback. To improve the utility of this approach, one can seek solutions in three directions: 1) Simplifying the directing group, 2) using common functional groups or protecting groups as directing groups, and 3) attaching the directing group to substrates via a transient covalent bond to render the directing group catalytic. This Review describes the rational development of an extremely simple and yet broadly applicable directing group for Pd(II) , Rh(III) , and Ru(II) catalysts, namely the N-methoxy amide (CONHOMe) moiety. Through collective efforts in the community, a wide range of C-H activation transformations using this type of simple directing group have been developed.	0
Abstract2class: Structure and biosynthesis of fumosorinone, a new protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor firstly isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea Abstract: Fumosorinone, isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea, is a new 2-pyridone alkaloid which is elucidated by HRESIMS 1D and 2DNMR. Fumosorinone is structurally similar to tenellin and desmethylbassianin but it differs in chain length and degree of methylation. It is characterized by a classic noncompetitive inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (IC50 14.04μM) which was implicated as a negative regulator of insulin receptor signaling and a potential drug target for the treatment of type II diabetes and other associated metabolic syndromes. For further study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumosorinone from ongoing genome sequencing project, and it was verified by a direct knock-out strategy, reported for the first time in I. fumosorosea, using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in conjunction with linear deletion cassettes. The biosynthetic gene cluster includes a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, two cytochrome P450 enzyme genes, a trans-enoyl reductase gene, and other two transcription regulatory genes. Comparison of fumosorinone biosynthetic cluster with known gene clusters gives further insight into biosynthesis of pyridone alkaloids and provides the foundation for combinatorial biosynthesis for new fumosorinone derivatives.	1
Abstract2class: Genetic structure and parasitization-related ability divergence of a nematode fungal pathogen Hirsutella minnesotensis following founder effect in China Abstract: The fungal parasitoid, Hirsutella minnesotensis, is a dominant parasitoid of the soybean cyst nematode, which is a destruction pest of soybean crops. We investigated population structure and parasitism pattern in samples of H. minnesotensis in China to reveal the spreading pattern of this fungal species and the underlying mechanism generating the parasitization-related ability variability in Chinese population. In cross-inoculation experiments using different combinations of H. minnesotensis and soybean cyst nematode samples from China, most H. minnesotensis isolates fitted the criterion for "local versus foreign" parasitism profile, exhibiting local adaptation pattern to the SCN host. However, the genetic analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphisms with clone-corrected samples based on ten DNA fragments in 56 isolates of H. minnesotensis from China revealed that the Chinese H. minnesotensis population was a clonal lineage that underwent a founder event. The results demonstrated that the Chinese H. minnesotensis population had generated parasitization-related ability diversity after a founder event through individual variation or phenotypic plasticity other than local adaptation. The rapid divergence of parasitization-related abilities with simple genetic structure in Chinese H. minnesotensis population indicates a fundamental potential for the establishment of invasive fungal species, which is a prerequisite for biological control agents.	0
Abstract2class: The partitioned Rhizobium etli genome: genetic and metabolic redundancy in seven interacting replicons Abstract: We report the complete 6,530,228-bp genome sequence of the symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacterium Rhizobium etli. Six large plasmids comprise one-third of the total genome size. The chromosome encodes most functions necessary for cell growth, whereas few essential genes or complete metabolic pathways are located in plasmids. Chromosomal synteny is disrupted by genes related to insertion sequences, phages, plasmids, and cell-surface components. Plasmids do not show synteny, and their orthologs are mostly shared by accessory replicons of species with multipartite genomes. Some nodulation genes are predicted to be functionally related with chromosomal loci encoding for the external envelope of the bacterium. Several pieces of evidence suggest an exogenous origin for the symbiotic plasmid (p42d) and p42a. Additional putative horizontal gene transfer events might have contributed to expand the adaptive repertoire of R. etli, because they include genes involved in small molecule metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation. Twenty-three putative sigma factors, numerous isozymes, and paralogous families attest to the metabolic redundancy and the genomic plasticity necessary to sustain the lifestyle of R. etli in symbiosis and in the soil.	1
Abstract2class: A new highly selective fluorescent K+ sensor Abstract: We describe the synthesis, properties, and application of a new fluorescent potassium chemosensor, KS2, for K(+) sensing and imaging in live cells. By virtue of a strong electron-withdrawing group, 2-dicyanomethylene-3-cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran (TCF), with a triazacryptand ligand, the new sensor can respond to K(+) up to 1.6 M. This is the first highly selective intracellular sensor suitable for sensing K(+) over a broad and high concentration range. Confocal fluorescence microscopy has established the utility of KS2 for live-cell K(+) detection. The application of KS2 combined with other sensors will be of great benefit for investigating cellular metabolism, detecting and diagnosing diseases including cancer, and monitoring responses to therapy.	0
Abstract2class: Ultra-thin van der Waals crystals as semiconductor quantum wells Abstract: Control over the quantization of electrons in quantum wells is at the heart of the functioning of modern advanced electronics; high electron mobility transistors, semiconductor and Capasso terahertz lasers, and many others. However, this avenue has not been explored in the case of 2D materials. Here we apply this concept to van der Waals heterostructures using the thickness of exfoliated crystals to control the quantum well dimensions in few-layer semiconductor InSe. This approach realizes precise control over the energy of the subbands and their uniformity guarantees extremely high quality electronic transport in these systems. Using tunnelling and light emitting devices, we reveal the full subband structure by studying resonance features in the tunnelling current, photoabsorption and light emission spectra. In the future, these systems could enable development of elementary blocks for atomically thin infrared and THz light sources based on intersubband optical transitions in few-layer van der Waals materials.	0
Abstract2class: Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was measured during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus by radioactive thymidine incorporation, autoradiography, and chemical analysis. Microcysts contained an average of 6.6 conserved units of DNA, corresponding to 3 to 4 chromosomes per cell. Correlation of the DNA content and chromosome number of microcysts indicated that the molecular weight of the nonreplicating M. xanthus chromosome is 4.9 x 10(9) daltons. DNA synthesis was initiated 3.5 to 4 hr after induction of germination. From 4 to 6 hr, the rate of synthesis was constant and the accumulation was linear. After a lag period (6 to 6.5 hr), the rate of DNA synthesis increased, reaching a second plateau at 9 hr. From 9 to 11 hr, the rate was again constant and the accumulation was linear. Cellular division during germination showed an unusual kind of synchrony. A model is presented that accounts for chromosomal replication and cell division during microcyst germination.	0
Abstract2class: Biosynthesis of an anti-tuberculosis sesterterpenoid asperterpenoid A Abstract: A putative three-gene cluster for asperterpenoid A was identified. Step-wise reconstitution of this gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae reveals that astC encodes a sesterterpene cyclase to synthesize preasperterpenoid A, which is dually oxidized by a P450 enzyme AstB to give asperterpenoid A along with a minor product asperterpenoid B, and asperterpenoid A is further oxidized by another P450 eznyme AstA to afford a new sesterterpenoid asperterpenoid C. Unexpectedly, asperterpenoids A and B, but not the final product asperterpenoid C, exhibit potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase B with IC50 values of 3-6 μM.	1
Abstract2class: Mutations affecting transcription pausing in the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon Abstract: Pausing during transcription of the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon was proposed to play a role in its regulation by attenuation. Substitution mutations in the B. subtilis pyr DNA specifying the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the previously identified transcription pause sites substantially reduced pausing at these sites in vitro. This result confirms the general utility of this mutagenic strategy for studying transcriptional pausing. Pyrimidine-mediated repression in vivo of pyr-lacZ fusions containing some of these substitution mutations was substantially lower than those observed with the wild-type pyr-lacZ fusions. However, these defects in regulation were correlated with alterations in the stability of the terminator stem-loop specified by the attenuator, rather than with their effects on transcriptional pausing in vitro.	0
