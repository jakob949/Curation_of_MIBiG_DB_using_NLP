Title: Role of the Streptococcus mutans irvA gene in GbpC-independent, dextran-dependent aggregation and biofilm formation Abstract: Dextran-dependent aggregation (DDAG) of Streptococcus mutans is an in vitro phenomenon that is believed to represent a property of the organism that is beneficial for sucrose-dependent biofilm development. GbpC, a cell surface glucan-binding protein, is responsible for DDAG in S. mutans when cultured under defined stressful conditions. Recent reports have described a putative transcriptional regulator gene, irvA, located just upstream of gbpC, that is normally repressed by the product of an adjacent gene, irvR. When repression of irvA is relieved, there is a resulting increase in the expression of GbpC and decreases in competence and synthesis of the antibiotic mutacin I. This study examined the role of irvA in DDAG and biofilm formation by engineering strains that overexpressed irvA (IrvA+) on an extrachromosomal plasmid. The IrvA+ strain displayed large aggregation particles that did not require stressful growth conditions. A novel finding was that overexpression of irvA in a gbpC mutant background retained a measure of DDAG, albeit very small aggregation particles. Biofilms formed by the IrvA+ strain in the parental background possessed larger-than-normal microcolonies. In a gbpC mutant background, the overexpression of irvA reversed the fragile biofilm phenotype normally associated with loss of GbpC. Real-time PCR and Northern blot analyses found that expression of gbpC did not change significantly in the IrvA+ strain but expression of spaP, encoding the major surface adhesin P1, increased significantly. Inactivation of spaP eliminated the small-particle DDAG. The results suggest that IrvA promotes DDAG not only by GbpC, but also via an increase in P1.	0
Title: Microbiota of the Gut-Lymph Node Axis: Depletion of Mucosa-Associated Segmented Filamentous Bacteria and Enrichment of Methanobrevibacter by Colistin Sulfate and Linco-Spectin in Pigs Abstract: Microorganisms are translocated from the gut to lymphatic tissues via immune cells, thereby challenging and training the mammalian immune system. Antibiotics alter the gut microbiome and consecutively might also affect the corresponding translocation processes, resulting in an imbalanced state between the intestinal microbiota and the host. Hence, understanding the variant effects of antibiotics on the microbiome of gut-associated tissues is of vital importance for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and animal health. In the present study, we analyzed the microbiome of (i) pig feces, ileum, and ileocecal lymph nodes under the influence of antibiotics (Linco-Spectin and Colistin sulfate) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for high-resolution community profiling and (ii) ileocecal lymph nodes in more detail with two additional methodological approaches, i.e., cultivation of ileocecal lymph node samples and (iii) metatranscriptome sequencing of a single lymph node sample. Supplementation of medicated feed showed a local effect on feces and ileal mucosa-associated microbiomes. Pigs that received antibiotics harbored significantly reduced amounts of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) along the ileal mucosa (p = 0.048; 199.17-fold change) and increased amounts of Methanobrevibacter, a methanogenic Euryarchaeote in fecal samples (p = 0.005; 20.17-fold change) compared to the control group. Analysis of the porcine ileocecal lymph node microbiome exposed large differences between the viable and the dead fraction of microorganisms and the microbiome was altered to a lesser extent by antibiotics compared with feces and ileum. The core microbiome of lymph nodes was constituted mainly of Proteobacteria. RNA-sequencing of a single lymph node sample unveiled transcripts responsible for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as protein turnover, DNA replication and signal transduction. The study presented here is the first comparative study of microbial communities in feces, ileum, and its associated ileocecal lymph nodes. In each analyzed site, we identified specific phylotypes susceptible to antibiotic treatment that can have profound impacts on the host physiological and immunological state, or even on global biogeochemical cycles. Our results indicate that pathogenic bacteria, e.g., enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, could escape antibiotic treatment by translocating to lymph nodes. In general ileocecal lymph nodes harbor a more diverse and active community of microorganisms than previously assumed.	0
Title: Revision of the Cyclisation Mechanism for the Diterpene Spiroviolene and Investigations of Its Mass Spectrometric Fragmentation Abstract: The diterpene spiroviolene, its diterpene synthase from Streptomyces violens and the experimentally determined terpene cyclisation mechanism were reported in 2017. Recently, the structure of spiroviolene was revised based on a total synthesis, with consequences for the cyclisation mechanism. Herein, a reinvestigation of the terpene cyclisation to spiroviolene and the mass spectrometric fragmentation mechanism investigated by 13 C-labelling experiments are presented.	0
Title: Conidiophore stalk-less1 encodes a putative zinc-finger protein involved in the early stage of conidiation and mycelial infection in Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: Over recent decades, many pathogenicity genes of Magnaporthe oryzae have been identified but only a very limited number of genes have been identified that encode components of the conidiogenesis pathway. We report here a T-DNA insertional mutant that completely lost conidiation ability. Further investigation revealed that this mutant did not develop any conidiophore, and that the T-DNA was integrated into an annotated gene designated as conidiophore stalk-less1 or COS1. Complementation experiments suggested that COS1 may be a determinant of conidiation. Sequence analysis revealed that COS1 putatively encodes a 491-amino-acid zinc-finger protein and the protein was revealed localized to nucleus. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based expression analysis indicated that two homologues of conidiophore-related genes were affected by the cos1 mutation, suggesting that Cos1 may function as a transcriptional regulator controlling genes responsible for conidiation. Inoculations of rice roots and wounded leaves with mycelia suggested that COS1 is not required for pathogenicity. Moreover, mutation of COS1 may aggravate infection of wounded leaves. Interestingly, different from the wild-type strain, mycelia of the cos1 mutant successfully infected host cells and caused visible symptoms on unwounded leaf blades and sheaths, indicating that Cos1 may have a role in some unknown mechanism of mycelial infection of M. oryzae.	0
Title: Characterization of the aminocoumarin ligase SimL from the simocyclinone pathway and tandem incubation with NovM,P,N from the novobiocin pathway Abstract: Simocyclinone D(8) consists of an anguicycline C-glycoside tethered by a tetraene diester linker to an aminocoumarin. Unlike the antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A(1), the phenolic hydroxyl group of the aminocoumarin in simocyclinone is not glycosylated with a decorated noviosyl moiety that is the pharmacophore for targeting bacterial DNA gyrase. We have expressed the Streptomyces antibioticus simocyclinone ligase SimL, purified it from Escherichia coli, and established its ATP-dependent amide bond forming activity with a variety of polyenoic acids including retinoic acid and fumagillin. We have then used the last three enzymes from the novobiocin pathway, NovM, NovP, and NovN, to convert a SimL product to a novel novobiocin analogue, in which the 3-prenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate of novobiocin is replaced with a tetraenoate moiety, to evaluate antibacterial activity.	1
Title: Computational design of a time-dependent histone deacetylase 2 selective inhibitor Abstract: Development of isoform-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors is of great biological and medical interest. Among 11 zinc-dependent HDAC isoforms, it is particularly challenging to achieve isoform inhibition selectivity between HDAC1 and HDAC2 due to their very high structural similarities. In this work, by developing and applying a novel de novo reaction-mechanism-based inhibitor design strategy to exploit the reactivity difference, we have discovered the first HDAC2-selective inhibitor, β-hydroxymethyl chalcone. Our bioassay experiments show that this new compound has a unique time-dependent selective inhibition on HDAC2, leading to about 20-fold isoform-selectivity against HDAC1. Furthermore, our ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations, a state-of-the-art approach to study reactions in biological systems, have elucidated how the β-hydroxymethyl chalcone can achieve the distinct time-dependent inhibition toward HDAC2.	0
Title: Mathermycin, a Lantibiotic from the Marine Actinomycete Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652 Abstract: Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides belonging to the family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and feature thioether linkages in their structures. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of a cinnamycin analog, named mathermycin, from Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652 and reconstituted its biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans and Escherichia coli Key posttranslational modification enzymes of mathermycin were characterized. Mathermycin exhibited antimicrobial activity and therefore represents an example of cinnamycin-like lantibiotics from Marinactinospora species.IMPORTANCE The discovery of new antimicrobial compounds that can be used as potential drugs is in urgent need due to increasing bacterial resistance to current antibiotics. Lantibiotics are important antimicrobial compounds that have found applications in both the clinic setting and food industry. We report here the discovery of a new lantibiotic, mathermycin, from a marine-derived Marinactinospora thermotolerans strain and elucidation of its biosynthesis. We also demonstrate that mathermycin possesses antimicrobial activity toward a Bacillus strain.	1
Title: Subtilomycin: a new lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans Abstract: Bacteriocins are attracting increased attention as an alternative to classic antibiotics in the fight against infectious disease and multidrug resistant pathogens. Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans displays a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, as well as several pathogenic Candida species. This activity is in part associated with a newly identified lantibiotic, herein named as subtilomycin. The proposed biosynthetic cluster is composed of six genes, including protein-coding genes for LanB-like dehydratase and LanC-like cyclase modification enzymes, characteristic of the class I lantibiotics. The subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster in B. subtilis strain MMA7 is found in place of the sporulation killing factor (skf) operon, reported in many B. subtilis isolates and involved in a bacterial cannibalistic behaviour intended to delay sporulation. The presence of the subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster appears to be widespread amongst B. subtilis strains isolated from different shallow and deep water marine sponges. Subtilomycin possesses several desirable industrial and pharmaceutical physicochemical properties, including activity over a wide pH range, thermal resistance and water solubility. Additionally, the production of the lantibiotic subtilomycin could be a desirable property should B. subtilis strain MMA7 be employed as a probiotic in aquaculture applications.	1
Title: Reveromycin A biosynthesis uses RevG and RevJ for stereospecific spiroacetal formation Abstract: Spiroacetal compounds are ubiquitous in nature, and their stereospecific structures are responsible for diverse pharmaceutical activities. Elucidation of the biosynthetic mechanisms that are involved in spiroacetal formation will open the door to efficient generation of stereospecific structures that are otherwise hard to synthesize chemically. However, the biosynthesis of these compounds is poorly understood, owing to difficulties in identifying the responsible enzymes and analyzing unstable intermediates. Here we comprehensively describe the spiroacetal formation involved in the biosynthesis of reveromycin A, which inhibits bone resorption and bone metastases of tumor cells by inducing apoptosis in osteoclasts. We performed gene disruption, systematic metabolite analysis, feeding of labeled precursors and conversion studies with recombinant enzymes. We identified two key enzymes, dihydroxy ketone synthase and spiroacetal synthase, and showed in vitro reconstruction of the stereospecific spiroacetal structure from a stable acyclic precursor. Our findings provide insights into the creation of a variety of biologically active spiroacetal compounds for drug leads.	1
Title: Characterization of the maduropeptin biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinomadura madurae ATCC 39144 supporting a unifying paradigm for enediyne biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic maduropeptin (MDP) from Actinomadura madurae ATCC 39144 was cloned and sequenced. Cloning of the mdp gene cluster was confirmed by heterologous complementation of enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS) mutants from the C-1027 producer Streptomyces globisporus and the neocarzinostatin producer Streptomyces carzinostaticus using the MDP enediyne PKS and associated genes. Furthermore, MDP was produced, and its apoprotein was isolated and N-terminal sequenced; the encoding gene, mdpA, was found to reside within the cluster. The biosynthesis of MDP is highlighted by two iterative type I PKSs--the enediyne PKS and a 6-methylsalicylic acid PKS; generation of (S)-3-(2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid derived from L-alpha-tyrosine; a unique type of enediyne apoprotein; and a convergent biosynthetic approach to the final MDP chromophore. The results demonstrate a platform for engineering new enediynes by combinatorial biosynthesis and establish a unified paradigm for the biosynthesis of enediyne polyketides.	1
Title: Novel features of the polysaccharide-digesting gliding bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae as revealed by genome sequence analysis Abstract: The 6.10-Mb genome sequence of the aerobic chitin-digesting gliding bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae (phylum Bacteroidetes) is presented. F. johnsoniae is a model organism for studies of bacteroidete gliding motility, gene regulation, and biochemistry. The mechanism of F. johnsoniae gliding is novel, and genome analysis confirms that it does not involve well-studied motility organelles, such as flagella or type IV pili. The motility machinery is composed of Gld proteins in the cell envelope that are thought to comprise the "motor" and SprB, which is thought to function as a cell surface adhesin that is propelled by the motor. Analysis of the genome identified genes related to sprB that may encode alternative adhesins used for movement over different surfaces. Comparative genome analysis revealed that some of the gld and spr genes are found in nongliding bacteroidetes and may encode components of a novel protein secretion system. F. johnsoniae digests proteins, and 125 predicted peptidases were identified. F. johnsoniae also digests numerous polysaccharides, and 138 glycoside hydrolases, 9 polysaccharide lyases, and 17 carbohydrate esterases were predicted. The unexpected ability of F. johnsoniae to digest hemicelluloses, such as xylans, mannans, and xyloglucans, was predicted based on the genome analysis and confirmed experimentally. Numerous predicted cell surface proteins related to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusC and SusD, which are likely involved in binding of oligosaccharides and transport across the outer membrane, were also identified. Genes required for synthesis of the novel outer membrane flexirubin pigments were identified by a combination of genome analysis and genetic experiments. Genes predicted to encode components of a multienzyme nonribosomal peptide synthetase were identified, as were novel aspects of gene regulation. The availability of techniques for genetic manipulation allows rapid exploration of the features identified for the polysaccharide-digesting gliding bacteroidete F. johnsoniae.	1
Title: Bacteriocin ASM1 is an O/S-diglycosylated, plasmid-encoded homologue of glycocin F Abstract: Here, we report on the biochemical characterization of a new glycosylated bacteriocin (glycocin), ASM1, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum A-1 and analysis of the A-1 bacteriocinogenic genes. ASM1 is 43 amino acids in length with Ser18-O- and Cys43-S-linked N-acetylglucosamine moieties that are essential for its inhibitory activity. Its only close homologue, glycocin F (GccF), has five amino acid substitutions all residing in the flexible C-terminal 'tail' and a lower IC50 (0.9 nm) compared to that of ASM1 (1.5 nm). Asm/gcc genes share the same organization (asmH← →asmABCDE→F), and the asm genes reside on an 11 905-bp plasmid dedicated to ASM1 production. The A-1 genome also harbors a gene encoding a 'rare' bactofencin-type bacteriocin. As more examples of prokaryote S-GlcNAcylation are discovered, the functions of this modification may be understood.	1
Title: Modified oxidosqualene cyclases in the formation of bioactive secondary metabolites: biosynthesis of the antitumor clavaric acid Abstract: Hypholoma sublateritium is a basidiomycete that produces the antitumor compound clavaric acid. We cloned a gene encoding an oxidosqualene cyclase (occ) that is involved in the conversion of oxidosqualene to clavaric acid. Mutants disrupted in occ by gene replacement were unable to synthesize clavaric acid, but did not require sterols for growth. Amplification of the occ gene produced a 35-67% increase in clavaric acid yield. Northern analysis of occ gene expression confirmed that there is a clear correlation of occ expression and clavaric acid biosynthesis. Analysis of the occ-encoded oxidosqualene cyclase revealed that it has VSDCVGE motif instead of the consensus VSDCTAE sequence of the active center. In summary, there is an oxidosqualene cyclase specific for secondary metabolite biosynthesis; this is in agreement with the finding of two squalene cyclases in the sequenced genomes of basidiomycetes.	1
Title: Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium Abstract: Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density-dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain Nostoc punctiforme, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high-titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.	1
Title: New eutectic ionic liquids for lipase activation and enzymatic preparation of biodiesel Abstract: The enzymatic preparation of biodiesel has been hampered by the lack of suitable solvents with desirable properties such as high lipase compatibility, low cost, low viscosity, high biodegradability, and ease of product separation. Recent interest in using ionic liquids (ILs) as advanced reaction media has led to fast reaction rates and high yields in the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel. However, conventional (i.e., cation-anion paired) ILs based on imidazolium and other quaternary ammonium salts remain too expensive for wide application at industrial scales. In this study, we report on newly-synthesized eutectic ILs derived from choline acetate or choline chloride coupled with biocompatible hydrogen-bond donors, such as glycerol. These eutectic solvents have favorable properties including low viscosity, high biodegradability, and excellent compatibility with Novozym(®) 435, a commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B. Furthermore, in a model biodiesel synthesis system, we demonstrate high reaction rates for the enzymatic transesterification of Miglyol(®) oil 812 with methanol, catalyzed by Novozym(®) 435 in choline acetate/glycerol (1:1.5 molar ratio). The high conversion (97%) of the triglyceride obtained within 3 h, under optimal conditions, suggests that these novel eutectic solvents warrant further exploration as potential media in the enzymatic production of biodiesel.	0
Title: Comparison of cysteine and tryptophan content of insoluble proteins derived from wild-type and mi-1 strains of Neurospora crassa Abstract: The possibility of an amino acid substitution (cysteine for tryptophan) in a membrane protein of the [mi-1] strain of Neurospora crassa has been investigated in detail by using a double radioactive labeling procedure. Auxotrophic strains of Neurospora having wild-type [+] or [mi-1] cytoplasm have been grown under conditions which result in the specific labeling of protein tryptophan with (3)H and protein cysteine with (35)S. Although the least soluble 1 to 20% of the [mi-1] mitochondrial membrane protein was usually found to have a higher Cys/Trp ratio (ratio of cysteine plus half-cystine to tryptophan) than the corresponding [+] fraction, it has been shown that these differences were due mainly to the presence of differential amounts of a very insoluble, cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) material. The same Cys-rich material was found in variable amounts in both [+] and [mi-1] cultures, but the concentration was usually higher in the [mi-1] cultures. The Cys-rich material is clearly distinct from "structural protein" on the basis of amino acid composition and appears to have no direct relationship to the [mi-1] phenotype. In the absence of the Cys-rich material, no difference between the Cys/Trp ratios of corresponding [+] and [mi-1] membrane proteins could be detected. We conclude, therefore, that the previously postulated amino acid substitution of cysteine for tryptophan in [mi-1] membrane protein is incorrect.	0
Title: Quorum Sensing in a Methane-Oxidizing Bacterium Abstract: Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy and serve as a major sink for the potent greenhouse gas methane in freshwater ecosystems. Dissecting the molecular details of how these organisms interact in the environment may increase our understanding of how they perform this important ecological role. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing (QS) systems to regulate gene expression in a cell density-dependent manner. We have identified a QS system in the genome of Methylobacter tundripaludum, a dominant methane oxidizer in methane enrichments of sediment from Lake Washington (Seattle, WA). We determined that M. tundripaludum produces primarily N-3-hydroxydecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C10-HSL) and that its production is governed by a positive feedback loop. We then further characterized this system by determining which genes are regulated by QS in this methane oxidizer using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and discovered that this system regulates the expression of a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster. Finally, we detected an extracellular factor that is produced by M. tundripaludum in a QS-dependent manner. These results identify and characterize a mode of cellular communication in an aerobic methane-oxidizing bacterium.IMPORTANCE Aerobic methanotrophs are critical for sequestering carbon from the potent greenhouse gas methane in the environment, yet the mechanistic details of chemical interactions in methane-oxidizing bacterial communities are not well understood. Understanding these interactions is important in order to maintain, and potentially optimize, the functional potential of the bacteria that perform this vital ecosystem function. In this work, we identify a quorum sensing system in the aerobic methanotroph Methylobacter tundripaludum and use both chemical and genetic methods to characterize this system at the molecular level.	1
Title: Hydrogen Production by the Photosynthetic Bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum Abstract: Continuous photosynthetic production of hydrogen by Rhodospirillum rubrum in batch cultures was observed up to 80 days with the hydrogen donor, pure lactate or lactic acid-containing wastes, supplied periodically. Hydrogen was produced at an average rate of 6 ml/h per g (dry weight) of cells with whey as a hydrogen donor. In continuous cultures with glutamate as a growth-limiting nitrogen source and lactate as a hydrogen donor, hydrogen was evolved at a rate of 20 ml/h per g (dry weight). The composition of the gas evolved remained practically constant (70 to 75% H(2), 25 to 30% CO(2)). Photosynthetic bacteria processing specific organic wastes could be an advantage in large-scale production of hydrogen together with food protein of high value, compared to other biological systems.	0
Title: Direct Sequencing of tRNA by 2D-HELS-AA MS Seq Reveals Its Different Isoforms and Dynamic Base Modifications Abstract: Post-transcriptional modifications are intrinsic to RNA structure and function. However, methods to sequence RNA typically require a cDNA intermediate and are either not able to sequence these modifications or are tailored to sequence one specific nucleotide modification only. Interestingly, some of these modifications occur with <100% frequency at their particular sites, and site-specific quantification of their stoichiometries is another challenge. Here, we report a direct method for sequencing tRNAPhe without cDNA by integrating a two-dimensional hydrophobic RNA end-labeling strategy with an anchor-based algorithm in mass spectrometry-based sequencing (2D-HELS-AA MS Seq). The entire tRNAPhe was sequenced and the identity, location, and stoichiometry of all eleven different RNA modifications was determined, five of which were not 100% modified, including a 2'-O-methylated G (Gm) in the wobble anticodon position as well as an N2, N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G), a 7-methylguanosine (m7G), a 1-methyladenosine (m1A), and a wybutosine (Y), suggesting numerous post-transcriptional regulations in tRNA. Two truncated isoforms at the 3'-CCA tail of the tRNAPhe (75 nt with a 3'-CC tail (80% abundance) and 74 nt with a 3'-C tail (3% abundance)) were identified in addition to the full-length 3'-CCA-tailed tRNAPhe (76 nt, 17% abundance). We discovered a new isoform with A-G transitions/editing at the 44 and 45 positions in the tRNAPhe variable loop, and discuss possible mechanisms related to the emergence and functions of the isoforms with these base transitions or editing. Our method revealed new isoforms, base modifications, and RNA editing as well as their stoichiometries in the tRNA that cannot be determined by current cDNA-based methods, opening new opportunities in the field of epitranscriptomics.	0
Title: Recognition of a tetranucleotide loop of signal recognition particle RNA by protein SRP19 Abstract: The interaction of protein SRP19 with the RNA component of human signal recognition particle (SRP) was studied by site-directed mutagenesis of the SRP RNA. The effects of nucleotide changes in the tetranucleotide loop (tetraloop) of helix 6 showed that SRP19 recognizes a tetraloop in a sequence-specific manner. Adenosine 149 at the third position of the tetraloop was essential for binding. In contrast, changes of the base at the second position had no effect. Mutations that disrupt or compensate individual SRP RNA helices were generated to investigate the importance of base pairing and to identify other binding sites. Considerable base pairing was essential in helix 6. Another SRP19-binding site was located in the distal part of helix 8. The primary sequences of the tetraloop-binding protein SR19 and of bacterial ribosomal protein S15 are shown to be similar.	0
Title: Beta-glucuronidase as a sensitive and versatile reporter in actinomycetes Abstract: Here we describe a versatile and sensitive reporter system for actinomycetes that is based on gusA, which encodes the β-glucuronidase enzyme. A series of gusA-containing transcriptional and translational fusion vectors were constructed and utilized to study the regulatory cascade of the phenalinolactone biosynthetic gene cluster. Furthermore, these vectors were used to study the efficiency of translation initiation at the ATG, GTG, TTG, and CTG start codons. Surprisingly, constructs using a TTG start codon showed the best activity, whereas those using ATG or GTG were approximately one-half or one-third as active, respectively. The CTG fusion showed only 5% of the activity of the TTG fusion. A suicide vector, pKGLP2, carrying gusA in its backbone was used to visually detect merodiploid formation and resolution, making gene targeting in actinomycetes much faster and easier. Three regulatory genes, plaR1, plaR2, and plaR3, involved in phenalinolactone biosynthesis were efficiently replaced with an apramycin resistance marker using this system. Finally, we expanded the genetic code of actinomycetes by introducing the nonproteinogenic amino acid N-epsilon-cyclopentyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine with the GusA protein as a reporter.	1
Title: Kaempulchraols A-H, Diterpenoids from the Rhizomes of Kaempferia pulchra Collected in Myanmar Abstract: Eight new diterpenoids, kaempulchraols A-H (1-8), along with five known analogues were isolated from the CHCl3-soluble extract of rhizomes of Kaempferia pulchra of Myanmar. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction analysis. All the isolates were tested for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (A549, human lung cancer; HeLa, human cervix cancer; PANC-1 and PSN-1, human pancreatic cancer; MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer) and TIG-3, normal human primary fibroblast cells. Kaempulchraol F (6) exhibited weak activity against the human pancreatic PSN-1 cell line with an IC50 value of 12.3 μM.	0
Title: Shift to Pseudomonic acid B production in P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 by mutation of mupirocin tailoring genes mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE Abstract: Mupirocin, a polyketide-derived antibiotic from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB10586, is a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PA) that target isoleucyl-tRNA synthase. The mup gene cluster encodes both type I polyketide synthases and monofunctional enzymes that should play a role during the conversion of the product of the polyketide synthase into the active antibiotic (tailoring). By in-frame deletion analysis of selected tailoring open-reading frames we show that mupQ, mupS, mupT, and mupW are essential for mupirocin production, whereas mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE are essential for production of PA-A but not PA-B. Therefore, PA-B is not simply produced by hydroxylation of PA-A but is either a precursor of PA-A or a shunt product. In the mupW mutant, a new metabolite lacking the tetrahydropyran ring is produced, implicating mupW in oxidation of the 16-methyl group.	1
Title: The pleitropic regulator AdpAch is required for natamycin biosynthesis and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces chattanoogensis Abstract: The complete natamycin (NTM) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chattanoogensis was cloned and confirmed by the disruption of pathway-specific activator genes. Comparative cluster analysis with its counterpart in Streptomyces natalensis revealed different cluster architecture between these two clusters. Compared with the highly conserved coding sequences, sequence variations appear to occur frequently in the intergenic regions. The evolutionary change of nucleotide sequence in the intergenic regions has given rise to different transcriptional organizations in the two clusters and resulted in altered gene regulation. These results provide insight into the evolution of antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters. In addition, we cloned a pleitropic regulator gene, adpA(ch), in S. chattanoogensis. Using the genetic system that we developed for this strain, adpA(ch) was deleted from the genome of S. chattanoogensis. The ΔadpA(ch) mutant showed a conditionally sparse aerial mycelium formation phenotype and defects in sporulation; it also lost the ability to produce NTM and a diffusible yellow pigment normally produced by S. chattanoogensis. RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcription of adpA(ch) was constitutive in YEME liquid medium. By using rapid amplification of 5' complementary DNA ends, two transcription start sites were identified upstream of the adpA(ch) coding region. Quantitative transcriptional analysis showed that the expression level of the NTM regulatory gene scnRI decreased 20-fold in the ΔadpA(ch) mutant strain, while the transcription of the other activator gene scnRII was not significantly affected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that AdpA(ch) binds to its own promoter but fails to bind to the promoter region of scnRI, indicating that the control of scnRI by AdpA(ch) is exerted in an indirect way. This work not only provides a platform and a new potential target for increasing the titre of NTM by genetic manipulation, but also advances the understanding of the regulation of NTM biosynthesis.	1
Title: Modeling of bacterial growth with shifts in temperature Abstract: The temperature of chilled foods is an important variable for the shelf life of a product in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73% of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93% of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift.	0
Title: Regulation of the biosynthesis of thiopeptide antibiotic cyclothiazomycin by the transcriptional regulator SHJG8833 in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 Abstract: Cyclothiazomycin is a member of the thiopeptide antibiotics, which are usually complicated derivatives of ribosomally synthesized peptides. A gene cluster containing 12 ORFs identical to the clt cluster encoding cyclothiazomycin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 was revealed by genome sequencing in S. hygroscopicus 5008. Genes SHJG8833 and SHJG8837 of the cluster and flanking gene SHJG8838 were predicted to encode regulatory proteins from different families. In this study, we showed that the newly identified cluster is functional and we investigated the roles of these regulatory genes in the regulation of cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis. We determined that SHJG8833, but not SHJG8837 or SHJG8838, is critical for cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis. The transcriptional start point of SHJG8833 was located to a thymidine 54 nt upstream of the start codon. Inactivation of SHJG8833 abrogated the production of cyclothiazomycin, and synthesis could be restored by reintroducing SHJG8833 into the mutant strain. Gene expression analyses indicated that SHJG8833 regulates a consecutive set of seven genes from SHJG8826 to SHJG8832, whose products are predicted to be involved in different steps in the construction of the main framework of cyclothiazomycin. Transcriptional analysis indicated that these seven genes may form two operons, SHJG8826-27 and SHJG8828-32. Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that the DNA-binding domain of SHJG8833 binds the promoters of SHJG8826 and SHJG8828 and sequences internal to SHJG8826 and SHJG8829, and a conserved binding sequence was deduced. These results indicate that SHJG8833 is a positive regulator that controls cyclothiazomycin biosynthesis by activating structural genes in the clt cluster.	1
Title: Trypsin mediates growth phase-dependent transcriptional tegulation of genes involved in biosynthesis of ruminococcin A, a lantibiotic produced by a Ruminococcus gnavus strain from a human intestinal microbiota Abstract: Ruminococcin A (RumA) is a trypsin-dependent lantibiotic produced by Ruminococcus gnavus E1, a gram-positive strict anaerobic strain isolated from a human intestinal microbiota. A 12.8-kb region from R. gnavus E1 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of RumA, has been cloned and sequenced. It consisted of 13 open reading frames, organized in three operons with predicted functions in lantibiotic biosynthesis, signal transduction regulation, and immunity. One unusual feature of the locus is the presence of three almost identical structural genes, all of them encoding the RumA precursor. In order to determine the role of trypsin in RumA production, the transcription of the rum genes has been investigated under inducing and noninducing conditions. Trypsin activity is needed for the growth phase-dependent transcriptional activation of RumA operons. Our results suggest that bacteriocin production by R. gnavus E1 is controlled through a complex signaling mechanism involving the proteolytic processing of a putative extracellular inducer-peptide by trypsin, a specific environmental cue of the digestive ecosystem.	1
Title: Localization of ligands within human carbonic anhydrase II using 19F pseudocontact shift analysis Abstract: Unraveling the native structure of protein-ligand complexes in solution enables rational drug design. We report here the use of 19F pseudocontact shift (PCS) NMR as a method to determine fluorine positions of high affinity ligands bound within the drug target human carbonic anhydrase II with high accuracy. Three different ligands were localized within the protein by analysis of the obtained PCS from simple one-dimensional 19F spectra with an accuracy of up to 0.8 Å. In order to validate the PCS, four to five independent magnetic susceptibility tensors induced by lanthanide chelating tags bound site-specifically to single cysteine mutants were refined. Least-squares minimization and a Monte-Carlo approach allowed the assessment of experimental errors on the intersection of the corresponding four to five PCS isosurfaces. By defining an angle score that reflects the relative isosurface orientation for different tensor combinations, it was established that the ligand can be localized accurately using only three tensors, if the isosurfaces are close to orthogonal. For two out of three ligands, the determined position closely matched the X-ray coordinates. Our results for the third ligand suggest, in accordance with previously reported ab initio calculations, a rotated position for the difluorophenyl substituent, enabling a favorable interaction with Phe-131. The lanthanide-fluorine distance varied between 22 and 38 Å and induced 19F PCS ranged from 0.078 to 0.409 ppm, averaging to 0.213 ppm. Accordingly, even longer metal-fluorine distances will lead to meaningful PCS, rendering the investigation of protein-ligand complexes significantly larger than 30 kDa feasible.	0
Title: The mbo operon is specific and essential for biosynthesis of mangotoxin in Pseudomonas syringae Abstract: Mangotoxin is an antimetabolite toxin produced by certain Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strains. This toxin is an oligopeptide that inhibits ornithine N-acetyl transferase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ornithine and arginine. Previous studies have reported the involvement of the putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase MgoA in virulence and mangotoxin production. In this study, we analyse a new chromosomal region of P. syringae pv. syringae UMAF0158, which contains six coding sequences arranged as an operon (mbo operon). The mbo operon was detected in only mangotoxin-producing strains, and it was shown to be essential for the biosynthesis of this toxin. Mutants in each of the six ORFs of the mbo operon were partially or completely impaired in the production of the toxin. In addition, Pseudomonas spp. mangotoxin non-producer strains transformed with the mbo operon gained the ability to produce mangotoxin, indicating that this operon contains all the genetic information necessary for mangotoxin biosynthesis. The generation of a single transcript for the mbo operon was confirmed and supported by the allocation of a unique promoter and Rho-independent terminator. The phylogenetic analysis of the P. syringae strains harbouring the mbo operon revealed that these strains clustered together.	1
Title: Synchronous intramolecular cycloadditions of the polyene macrolactam polyketide heronamide C Abstract: A growing number of natural products appear to arise from biosynthetic pathways that involve pericyclic reactions. We show here that for the heronamides this can occur via two spontaneous pathways involving alternative thermal or photochemical intramolecular cycloadditions.	1
Title: Complementation of CTB7 in the Maize Pathogen Cercospora zeina Overcomes the Lack of In Vitro Cercosporin Production Abstract: Gray leaf spot (GLS), caused by the sibling species Cercospora zeina or Cercospora zeae-maydis, is cited as one of the most important diseases threatening global maize production. C. zeina fails to produce cercosporin in vitro and, in most cases, causes large coalescing lesions during maize infection, a symptom generally absent from cercosporin-deficient mutants in other Cercospora spp. Here, we describe the C. zeina cercosporin toxin biosynthetic (CTB) gene cluster. The oxidoreductase gene CTB7 contained several insertions and deletions as compared with the C. zeae-maydis ortholog. We set out to determine whether complementing the defective CTB7 gene with the full-length gene from C. zeae-maydis could confer in vitro cercosporin production. C. zeina transformants containing C. zeae-maydis CTB7 were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and were evaluated for in vitro cercosporin production. When grown on nitrogen-limited medium in the light-conditions conducive to cercosporin production in other Cercospora spp.-one transformant accumulated a red pigment that was confirmed to be cercosporin by the KOH assay, thin-layer chromatography, and ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our results indicated that C. zeina has a defective CTB7, but all other necessary machinery required for synthesizing cercosporin-like molecules and, thus, C. zeina may produce a structural variant of cercosporin during maize infection.	1
Title: Structurally Diverse Metabolites from the Soft Coral Sinularia verruca Collected in the South China Sea Abstract: Nineteen metabolites with diverse structures, including the rare pyrroloindoline alkaloid verrupyrroloindoline (1), the unprecedented highly fused benzosesquiterpenoid verrubenzospirolactone (2), the new asteriscane-type sesquiterpenoid 10-deoxocapillosanane D (3), and the two new cyclopentenone derivatives (4S*,5S*)-4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2,3-dimethyl-4-pentylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (4) and (S)-4-hydroxy-5-methylene-2,3-dimethyl-4-pentylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (5), were isolated from a South China Sea collection of the soft coral Sinularia verruca. Eleven previously described marine metabolites (7-15, 18, and 19) were also obtained as well as three new EtOH-adduct artifacts (6, 16, and 17). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and by comparison with previously reported data. Compounds 4, 5, and 16 showed protection against the cytopathic effects of HIV-1 infection with EC50 values of 5.8-34 μM, and 4, 6, and 16 exhibited inhibition against LPS-induced NO production with IC50 values of 24-28 μM.	0
Title: New Vocabulary for Bacterial Communication Abstract: Quorum sensing (QS) is widely accepted as a procedure that bacteria use to converse. However, prevailing thinking places acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) at the forefront of this communication pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. With the advent of high-throughput genomics and the subsequent influx of bacterial genomes, bioinformatics analysis has determined that the genes encoding AHL biosynthesis, originally discovered to be indispensable for QS (LuxI-like proteins and homologues), are often absent in QS-capable bacteria. Instead, the sensing protein (LuxR-like proteins) is present with an apparent inability to produce any outgoing AHL signal. Recently, several signals for these LuxR solos have been identified. Herein, advances in the field of QS are discussed, with a particular focus on recent research in the field of bacterial cell-cell communication.	0
Title: Efficient extracellular production of recombinant proteins in E. coli via enhancing expression of dacA on the genome Abstract: D, D-carboxypeptidase DacA plays an important role in the synthesis and stabilization of Escherichia coli cell wall peptidoglycan. The production level of extracellular recombinant proteins in E. coli can be enhanced by high D, D-carboxypeptidase activity. Construction of expression systems under optimal promoters is one of the main strategies to realize high protein production in E. coli. In this study, the promoter PdacA-3 from DacA on the genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) was verified to be efficient for recombinant green fluorescent protein using the plasmid mutant pET28a-PdacA with PdacA-3. Meanwhile, the promoter PdacA-3 was engineered to increase the production level of proteins via inserting one or two Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences between the promoter PdacA-3 and the target genes. The expression level of dacA on the genome was increased by the improved transcription of the engineered promoters (especially after inserting one additional SD sequence). The engineered promoters increased cell membrane permeabilities to significantly enhance the secretion production of extracellular recombinant proteins in E. coli. Among them, the extracellular recombinant amylase activities in E. coli BL21::1SD-pET28a-amyK and E. coli BL21::2SD-pET28a-amyK were increased by 2.0- and 1.6-fold that of the control (E. coli BL21-pET28a-amyK), respectively. Promoter engineering also affected the morphology and growth of the E. coli mutants. It was indicated that the engineered promoters enhanced the expression of dacA on the genome to disturb the synthesis and structural stability of cell wall peptidoglycans.	0
Title: Production and Uptake of Distinct Endogenous Catecholate-Type Siderophores Are Required for Iron Acquisition and Virulence in Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Bacteria use siderophores to scavenge iron from environmental or host sources. The iron acquisition systems of Chromobacterium violaceum, a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that can cause infections in humans, are still unknown. In this work, we demonstrated that C. violaceum produces putative distinct endogenous siderophores, here named chromobactin and viobactin, and showed that they are each required for iron uptake and virulence. An in silico analysis in the genome of C. violaceum revealed that genes related to synthesis and uptake of chromobactin (cba) and viobactin (vba) are located within two secondary-metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. Using a combination of gene deletions and siderophore detection assays, we revealed that chromobactin and viobactin are catecholate siderophores synthesized from the common precursor 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHB) on two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes (CbaF and VbaF) and taken up by two TonB-dependent receptors (CbuA and VbuA). Infection assays in mice revealed that both the synthesis and the uptake of chromobactin or viobactin are required for the virulence of C. violaceum, since only the mutant strains that do not produce any siderophores or are unable to take up both of them were attenuated for virulence. In addition, the mutant strain unable to take up both siderophores showed a pronounced attenuation of virulence in vivo and reduced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in in vitro assays, suggesting that extracellularly accumulated siderophores modulate the host immune response. Overall, our results revealed that C. violaceum uses distinct endogenous siderophores for iron uptake and its establishment in the host.	1
Title: Conservation of the genes for HC-toxin biosynthesis in Alternaria jesenskae Abstract: Background:                       HC-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, is a virulence determinant for the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum. It was recently discovered that another fungus, Alternaria jesenskae, also produces HC-toxin.                  Results:                       The major genes (collectively known as AjTOX2) involved in the biosynthesis of HC-toxin were identified from A. jesenskae by genomic sequencing. The encoded orthologous proteins share 75-85% amino acid identity, and the genes for HC-toxin biosynthesis are duplicated in both fungi. The genomic organization of the genes in the two fungi show a similar but not identical partial clustering arrangement. A set of representative housekeeping proteins show a similar high level of amino acid identity between C. carbonum and A. jesenskae, which is consistent with the close relatedness of these two genera within the family Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes).                  Conclusions:                       This is the first report that the plant virulence factor HC-toxin is made by an organism other than C. carbonum. The genes may have moved by horizontal transfer between the two species, but it cannot be excluded that they were present in a common ancestor and lost from other species of Alternaria and Cochliobolus.	1
Title: A specific role of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea thioesterase II gene in the function of modular polyketide synthases Abstract: Bacterial modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes are commonly associated with another gene that encodes a thioesterase II (TEII) believed to remove aberrantly loaded substrates from the PKS. Co-expression of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea ery-ORF5 TEII and eryA genes encoding 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) in Streptomyces hosts eliminated or significantly lowered production of 8,8'-deoxyoleandolide [15-nor-6-deoxyerythronolide B (15-nor-6dEB)], which arises from an acetate instead of a propionate starter unit. Disruption of the TEII gene in an industrial Sac. erythraea strain caused a notable amount of 15-norerythromycins to be produced by utilization of an acetate instead of a propionate starter unit and also resulted in moderately lowered production of erythromycin compared with the amount produced by the parental strain. A similar behaviour of the TEII gene was observed in Escherichia coli strains that produce 6dEB and 15-methyl-6dEB. Direct biochemical analysis showed that the ery-ORF5 TEII enzyme favours hydrolysis of acetyl groups bound to the loading acyl carrier protein domain (ACP(L)) of DEBS. These results point to a clear role of the TEII enzyme, i.e. removal of a specific type of acyl group from the ACP(L) domain of the DEBS1 loading module.	1
Title: Automated Continuous Evolution of Proteins in Vivo Abstract: We present automated continuous evolution (ACE), a platform for the hands-free directed evolution of biomolecules. ACE pairs OrthoRep, a genetic system for continuous targeted mutagenesis of user-selected genes in vivo, with eVOLVER, a scalable and automated continuous culture device for precise, multiparameter regulation of growth conditions. By implementing real-time feedback-controlled tuning of selection stringency with eVOLVER, genes of interest encoded on OrthoRep autonomously traversed multimutation adaptive pathways to reach desired functions, including drug resistance and improved enzyme activity. The durability, scalability, and speed of biomolecular evolution with ACE should be broadly applicable to protein engineering as well as prospective studies on how selection parameters and schedules shape adaptation.	0
Title: Binding of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides and synthetic oligomannose clusters to human antibody 2G12: implications for HIV-1 vaccine design Abstract: Human antibody 2G12 broadly neutralizes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates and shows protective activity against viral challenge in animal models. Previous mutational analysis suggested that 2G12 recognized a novel cluster of high-mannose type oligosaccharides on HIV-1 gp120. To explore the carbohydrate antigen for HIV-1 vaccine design, we have studied the binding of 2G12 to an array of HIV-1 high-mannose type oligosaccharides by competitive ELISAs and found that Man9GlcNAc is 210- and 74-fold more effective than Man5GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc in binding to 2G12. The results establish that the larger high-mannose oligosaccharide on HIV-1 is the favorable subunit for 2G12 recognition. To mimic the putative epitope of 2G12, we have created scaffold-based multivalent Man9 clusters and found that the galactose-scaffolded bi-, tri-, and tetra-valent Man9 clusters are 7-, 22-, and 73-fold more effective in binding to 2G12 than the monomeric Man9GlcNAc2Asn. The experimental data shed light on further structural optimization of epitope mimics for developing a carbohydrate-based HIV-1 vaccine.	0
Title: Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos Abstract: Genome editing holds promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. However, it is difficult to determine off-target effects of editing due to single-nucleotide polymorphism in individuals. Here we developed a method named GOTI (genome-wide off-target analysis by two-cell embryo injection) to detect off-target mutations by editing one blastomere of two-cell mouse embryos using either CRISPR-Cas9 or base editors. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of progeny cells of edited and nonedited blastomeres at embryonic day 14.5 showed that off-target single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were rare in embryos edited by CRISPR-Cas9 or adenine base editor, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, cytosine base editing induced SNVs at more than 20-fold higher frequencies, requiring a solution to address its fidelity.	0
Title: Acetylaszonalenin biosynthesis in Neosartorya fischeri. Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster by genomic mining and functional proof of the genes by biochemical investigation Abstract: Based on the structural information of acetylaszonalenin isolated from Neosartorya fischeri, a putative biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the genome sequence of this fungus by genomic mining. This cluster consists of three genes coding for a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (AnaPS), a prenyltransferase (AnaPT), and an acetyltransferase (AnaAT). The coding sequences of anaPT and anaAT were cloned in pQE70 and pQE60, respectively, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The soluble His(6) fusion proteins were purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. The structures of the enzymatic products were elucidated by NMR and mass spectroscopy analysis. AnaPT was found to catalyze the reverse prenylation of (R)-benzodiazepinedione at position C3 of the indole moiety in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate, resulting in formation of aszonalenin. AnaAT was found to catalyze the acetylation of aszonalenin at position N1 of the indoline moiety in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, resulting in formation of acetylaszonalenin. Km values of AnaPT were determined for dimethylallyl diphosphate at 156 microm and for (R)-benzodiazepinedione at 232 microm. Km values of AnaAT were determined for acetyl coenzyme A at 96 microm and for aszonalenin at 61 microm. The turnover numbers of the AnaPT and AnaAT reactions were determined at 1.5 and 0.14 s(-1), respectively.	1
Title: Calcium Regulates S100A12 Zinc Sequestration by Limiting Structural Variations Abstract: Antimicrobial proteins such as S100A12 and S100A8/A9 are highly expressed and secreted by neutrophils during infection and participate in human immune response by sequestering transition metals. At neutral pH, S100A12 sequesters Zn2+ with nanomolar affinity, which is further enhanced upon calcium binding. We investigated the pH dependence of human S100A12 zinc sequestration by using Co2+ as a surrogate. Apo-S100A12 exhibits strong Co2+ binding between pH 7.0 and 10.0 that progressively diminishes as the pH is decreased to 5.3. Ca2+ -S100A12 can retain nanomolar Co2+ binding up to pH 5.7. NMR spectroscopic measurements revealed that calcium binding does not alter the side-chain protonation of the Co2+ /Zn2+ binding histidine residues. Instead, the calcium-mediated modulation is achieved by restraining pH-dependent conformational changes to EF loop 1, which contains Co2+ /Zn2+ binding Asp25. This calcium-induced enhancement of Co2+ /Zn2+ binding might assist in the promotion of antimicrobial activities in humans by S100 proteins during neutrophil activation under subneutral pH conditions.	0
Title: Synthetic tetra-acylated derivatives of lipid A from Porphyromonas gingivalis are antagonists of human TLR4 Abstract: Tetra-acylated lipid As derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS have been synthesized using a key disaccharide intermediate functionalized with levulinate (Lev), allyloxycarbonate (Alloc) and anomeric dimethylthexylsilyl (TDS) as orthogonal protecting groups and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbamate (Fmoc) and azido as amino protecting groups. Furthermore, an efficient cross-metathesis has been employed for the preparation of the unusual branched R-(3)-hydroxy-13-methyltetradecanic acid and (R)-3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoic acid of P. gingivalis lipid A. Biological studies have shown that the synthetic lipid As cannot activate human and mouse TLR2 and TLR4 to produce cytokines. However, it has been found that the compounds are potent antagonist of cytokine secretion by human monocytic cells induced by enteric LPS.	0
Title: N-amidation by copper-mediated cross-coupling of organostannanes or boronic acids with o-acetyl hydroxamic acids Abstract: A general nonoxidative N-amidation of organostannanes and boronic acids has been developed. Under nonbasic conditions a wide variety of aryl, alkenyl, and heteroaryl organostannanes and boronic acids couple efficiently with O-acetyl hydroxamic acids in the presence of Cu(I) sources.	0
Title: Functional characterization of the initiation enzyme of S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis in Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer glycoprotein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a is composed of repeating units [-->2)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-l-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->], with a 2-O-methyl modification of the terminal trisaccharide at the nonreducing end of the glycan chain, a core saccharide composed of two or three alpha-l-rhamnose residues, and a beta-d-galactose residue as a linker to the S-layer protein. In this study, we report the biochemical characterization of WsaP of the S-layer glycosylation gene cluster as a UDP-Gal:phosphoryl-polyprenol Gal-1-phosphate transferase that primes the S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a. Our results demonstrate that the enzyme transfers in vitro a galactose-1-phosphate from UDP-galactose to endogenous phosphoryl-polyprenol and that the C-terminal half of WsaP carries the galactosyltransferase function, as already observed for the UDP-Gal:phosphoryl-polyprenol Gal-1-phosphate transferase WbaP from Salmonella enterica. To confirm the function of the enzyme, we show that WsaP is capable of reconstituting polysaccharide biosynthesis in WbaP-deficient strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.	1
Title: Paenimacrolidin, a novel macrolide antibiotic from Paenibacillus sp. F6-B70 active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Paenibacillus sp. F6-B70 was selected from several dozens of isolates with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using a 16S rDNA-based screening method. F6-B70 contained polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters in its genome revealed by PCR amplification of conserved adenylation and ketosynthase (KS) domains. Phylogenetic data suggested that the strain hosts trans-AT PKSs and their product may be a branched molecule. An antibiotic was subsequently isolated from the methanol extract of F6-B70 cells. The molecular formula of the antibiotic was deduced to be C(33) H(50) NaO(6) ([M + Na](+) , m/z 565.3505) by analysis of electrospray ionization mass spectral data. Elucidation of the structure by nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy revealed that the active compound, paenimacrolidin (PAM), was a novel 22-membered macrolide with side-chains. The new antibiotic, mainly as a bacteriostatic agent, inhibits a couple of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus sp. strains. The antibiotic capacity of PAM was compromised by its instability, which can be overcome significantly with addition of an anti-oxidant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of an active macrolide from paenibacilli, which may be a promising source of novel antibiotics.	1
Title: Understanding the Effects of Coordination and Self-Assembly on an Emissive Phenothiazine Abstract: The local environment surrounding luminophores can significantly influence their photophysical properties. Herein, we report the self-assembly of a highly emissive platinum(II)-based metallacage. In order to accommodate the connectivity of the platinum(II) building block used in the self-assembly process, the luminophore-containing building block adopts a highly twisted geometry relative to its free form, leading to the emergence of an emissive transition with a radiative rate constant an order of magnitude higher than that of the free luminophore. This increased rate constant is the primary driver for the 10-fold increase in quantum yield from 4.2% to 40%. Model complexes with platinum or methyl groups bound to the nitrogen were synthesized. These complexes had lower quantum yields (10% and non-emissive, respectively) due mainly to decreases in radiative rate constants. Computational studies were conducted and indicated that the excited state of the ensembles, as well as the model complexes, is a result of charge transfer to the pyridyl groups, in contrast to the free luminophore, which involves the diphenyl sulfone moiety. The differences in quantum yields can be explained by a twist in the chromophore upon coordination of platinum or methylation on the pyridyl group, leading to intersystem crossing to a triplet state. This state then becomes more emissive with the addition of platinum, which increases the radiative rate constant via the heavy atom effect. The formation of a metallacage also decreases the non-radiative rate constant by inhibiting the intramolecular motions of the incorporated luminophore.	0
Title: 4-Aminophthalimide Amino Acids as Small and Environment-Sensitive Fluorescent Probes for Transmembrane Peptides Abstract: Fluorescence probing of transmembrane (TM) peptides is needed to complement state-of-the art methods-mainly oriented circular dichroism and solid-state NMR spectroscopy-and to allow imaging in living cells. Three new amino acids incorporating the solvatofluorescent 4-aminophthalimide in their side chains were synthesized in order to examine the local polarity in the α-helical TM fragment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor. It was possible to distinguish their locations, either in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer or at the membrane surface, by fluorescence readout, including blue shift and increased quantum yield. An important feature is the small size of the 4-aminophthalimide chromophore. It makes one of the new amino acids approximately isosteric to tryptophan, typically used as a very small fluorescent amino acid in peptides and proteins. In contrast to the only weakly fluorescent indole system in tryptophan, the 4-aminophthalimide moiety produces a significantly more informative fluorescence readout and is selectively excited outside the biopolymer absorption range.	0
Title: The actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus: a genetic hall of mirrors for synthesis of a molecule with mirror symmetry Abstract: A gene cluster was identified which contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of actinomycin encompassing 50 kb of contiguous DNA on the chromosome of Streptomyces chrysomallus. It contains 28 genes with biosynthetic functions and is bordered on both sides by IS elements. Unprecedentedly, the cluster consists of two large inverted repeats of 11 and 13 genes, respectively, with four nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in the middle. Nine genes in each repeat have counterparts in the other, in the same arrangement but in the opposite orientation, suggesting an inverse duplication of one of the arms during the evolution of the gene cluster. All of the genes appear to be organized into operons, each corresponding to a functional section of actinomycin biosynthesis, such as peptide assembly, regulation, resistance, and biosynthesis of the precursor of the actinomycin chromophore 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA). For 4-MHA synthesis, functional analysis revealed genes that encode pathway-specific isoforms of tryptophan dioxygenase, kynurenine formamidase, and hydroxykynureninase, which are distinct from the corresponding enzyme activities of cellular tryptophan catabolism in their regulation and in part in their substrate specificity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the pathway-specific tryptophan metabolism in Streptomyces most probably evolved divergently from the normal pathway of tryptophan catabolism to provide an extra or independent supply of building blocks for the synthesis of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Histone H2A.Z subunit exchange controls consolidation of recent and remote memory Abstract: Memory formation is a multi-stage process that initially requires cellular consolidation in the hippocampus, after which memories are downloaded to the cortex for maintenance, in a process termed systems consolidation. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate both types of consolidation, but histone variant exchange, in which canonical histones are replaced with their variant counterparts, is an entire branch of epigenetics that has received limited attention in the brain and has never, to our knowledge, been studied in relation to cognitive function. Here we show that histone H2A.Z, a variant of histone H2A, is actively exchanged in response to fear conditioning in the hippocampus and the cortex, where it mediates gene expression and restrains the formation of recent and remote memory. Our data provide evidence for H2A.Z involvement in cognitive function and specifically implicate H2A.Z as a negative regulator of hippocampal consolidation and systems consolidation, probably through downstream effects on gene expression. Moreover, alterations in H2A.Z binding at later stages of systems consolidation suggest that this histone has the capacity to mediate stable molecular modifications required for memory retention. Overall, our data introduce histone variant exchange as a novel mechanism contributing to the molecular basis of cognitive function and implicate H2A.Z as a potential therapeutic target for memory disorders.	0
Title: Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714 Abstract: In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.	1
Title: Paerucumarin, a new metabolite produced by the pvc gene cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The pvc gene cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to the biosynthesis of both the pyoverdine chromophore and pseudoverdine. Our reinvestigation of the role this gene cluster plays in P. aeruginosa secondary metabolite biosynthesis shows that its major product is actually paerucumarin, a novel isonitrile functionalized cumarin.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus Abstract: An S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase has been isolated and purified from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus ATCC 13257. Deamination represents the major metabolic route of S-adenosylhomocysteine in this organism. The protein was found to be monomeric with a molecular weight of 56,100 +/- 1,600. The activity was optimal at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C, and the deaminase was inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate but not by metal chelators. The Km for S-adenosylhomocysteine is 2.5 mM, and the Ki for inhibition by deoxycoformycin is 1.6 nM.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster that encodes the biosynthesis of the antitumor substance BE-54017 Abstract: Soil is predicted to contain thousands of unique bacterial species per gram. Soil DNA libraries represent large reservoirs of biosynthetic diversity from which diverse secondary metabolite gene clusters can be recovered and studied. The screening of an archived soil DNA library using primers designed to target oxytryptophan dimerization genes allowed us to identify and functionally characterize the first indolotryptoline biosynthetic gene cluster. The recovery and heterologous expression of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the antitumor substance BE-54017 is reported here. Transposon mutagenesis identified two monooxygenases, AbeX1 and AbeX2, as being responsible for the transformation of an indolocarbazole precursor into the indolotryptoline core of BE-54017.	1
Title: Gold(I)-catalyzed dearomative Rautenstrauch rearrangement: enantioselective access to cyclopenta[b]indoles Abstract: A highly enantioselective dearomative Rautenstrauch rearrangement catalyzed by cationic (S)-DTBM-Segphosgold(I) is reported. This reaction provides a straightforward method to prepare enantioenriched cyclopenta[b]indoles. These studies show vast difference in enantioselectivity in the reactions of propargyl acetates and propargyl acetals in the chiral ligand-controlled Rautenstrauch reaction.	0
Title: Efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of biotinylated human serum albumin-sialoglycoside conjugates containing O-acetylated sialic acids Abstract: Sialyl Tn (STn) and sialyl lactoside derivatives containing O-acetylated sialic acid residues have been chemoenzymatically synthesized using a one-pot three-enzyme system and conjugated to biotinylated human serum albumin (HSA) using an adipic acid para-nitrophenyl ester coupling reagent. This approach provides an efficient and general protocol for preparing carbohydrate-protein conjugates containing base-sensitive groups.	0
Title: Reprogramming acyl carrier protein interactions of an Acyl-CoA promiscuous trans-acyltransferase Abstract: Protein interactions between acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) and trans-acting acyltransferase domains (trans-ATs) are critical for regioselective extender unit installation by many polyketide synthases, yet little is known regarding the specificity of these interactions, particularly for trans-ATs with unusual extender unit specificities. Currently, the best-studied trans-AT with nonmalonyl specificity is KirCII from kirromycin biosynthesis. Here, we developed an assay to probe ACP interactions based on leveraging the extender unit promiscuity of KirCII. The assay allows us to identify residues on the ACP surface that contribute to specific recognition by KirCII. This information proved sufficient to modify a noncognate ACP from a different biosynthetic system to be a substrate for KirCII. The findings form a foundation for further understanding the specificity of trans-AT:ACP protein interactions and for engineering modular polyketide synthases to produce analogs.	0
Title: Two Cooperative Glycosyltransferases Are Responsible for the Sugar Diversity of Saquayamycins Isolated from Streptomyces sp. KY 40-1 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of valuable natural products providing an excellent drug-tailoring tool. Herein, we report the identification of two cooperative glycosyltransferases from the sqn gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of saquayamycins in Streptomyces sp. KY40-1: SqnG1 and SqnG2. Gene inactivation of sqnG1 leads to 50-fold decrease in saquayamycin production, while inactivation of sqnG2 leads to complete production loss, suggesting that SqnG2 acts as dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase. Gene inactivation of a third putative glycosyltransferase-encoding gene, sqnG3, does not affect saquayamycin production in a major way, suggesting that SqnG3 has no or a supportive role in glycosylation. The data indicate that SqnG1 and SqnG2 are solely and possibly cooperatively responsible for the sugar diversity observed in saquayamycins 1-7. This is the first evidence of a glycosyltransferase system showing codependence to achieve dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase activity, utilizing NDP-activated d-olivose, l-rhodinose, as well as an unusual amino sugar, presumably 3,6-dideoxy-l-idosamine.	1
Title: Thirteen posttranslational modifications convert a 14-residue peptide into the antibiotic thiocillin Abstract: The thiazolylpeptides are a family of >50 bactericidal antibiotics that block the initial steps of bacterial protein synthesis. Here, we report a biosynthetic gene cluster for thiocillin and establish that it, and by extension the whole class, is ribosomally synthesized. Remarkably, the C-terminal 14 residues of a 52-residue peptide precursor undergo 13 posttranslational modifications to give rise to thiocillin, making this antibiotic the most heavily posttranslationally-modified peptide known to date.	1
Title: Manipulation of regulatory genes reveals complexity and fidelity in hormaomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Hormaomycin (HRM) is a structurally remarkable peptide produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384 that acts as a Streptomyces signaling metabolite and exhibits potent antibiotic activity against coryneform actinomycetes. HRM biosynthetic studies have been hampered by inconsistent and low production. To enhance fermentation titers, the role of its cluster-encoded regulatory genes was investigated. Extra copies of the putative regulators hrmA and hrmB were introduced into the wild-type strain, resulting in an increase of HRM production and its analogs up to 135-fold. For the HrmB overproducer, six bioactive analogs were isolated and characterized. This study demonstrates that HrmA and HrmB are positive regulators in HRM biosynthesis. A third gene, hrmH, was identified as encoding a protein capable of shifting the metabolic profile of HRM and its derivatives. Its manipulation resulted in the generation of an additional HRM analog.	1
Title: Crystal structures of phosphite dehydrogenase provide insights into nicotinamide cofactor regeneration Abstract: The enzyme phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent conversion of phosphite to phosphate and represents the first biological catalyst that has been shown to conduct the enzymatic oxidation of phosphorus. Despite investigation for more than a decade into both the mechanism of its unusual reaction and its utility in cofactor regeneration, there has been a lack of any structural data for PTDH. Here we present the cocrystal structure of an engineered thermostable variant of PTDH bound to NAD(+) (1.7 Å resolution), as well as four other cocrystal structures of thermostable PTDH and its variants with different ligands (all between 1.85 and 2.3 Å resolution). These structures provide a molecular framework for understanding prior mutational analysis and point to additional residues, located in the active site, that may contribute to the enzymatic activity of this highly unusual catalyst.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc rpsL and rpsG genes Abstract: The Leptospira biflexa rpsL and rpsG genes were sequenced. Although similar in many respects, proteins encoded by these L. biflexa genes had several unusual features when compared with homologous proteins of other organisms. Unlike the rpsL genes of other eubacteria, the L. biflexa rpsL gene is adjacent to a rpoC-like gene.	0
Title: Cytochrome P450 OxyBtei catalyzes the first phenolic coupling step in teicoplanin biosynthesis Abstract: Bacterial cytochrome P450s form a remarkable clade of the P450 superfamily of oxidative hemoproteins, and are often involved in the biosynthesis of complex natural products. Those in a subgroup known as "Oxy enzymes" play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycopeptide antibiotics, including vancomycin and teicoplanin. The Oxy enzymes catalyze crosslinking of aromatic residues in the non-ribosomal antibiotic precursor peptide while it remains bound to the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS); this crosslinking secures the three-dimensional structure of the glycopeptide, crucial for antibiotic activity. We have characterized OxyBtei , the first of the Oxy enzymes in teicoplanin biosynthesis. Our results reveal that OxyBtei possesses a structure similar to those of other Oxy proteins and is active in crosslinking NRPS-bound peptide substrates. However, OxyBtei displays a significantly altered activity spectrum against peptide substrates compared to its well-studied vancomycin homologue.	1
Title: Merochlorins A-D, cyclic meroterpenoid antibiotics biosynthesized in divergent pathways with vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases Abstract: Meroterpenoids are mixed polyketide-terpenoid natural products with a broad range of biological activities. Herein, we present the structures of four new meroterpenoid antibiotics, merochlorins A-D, produced by the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain CNH-189, which possess novel chemical skeletons unrelated to known bacterial agents. Draft genome sequencing, mutagenesis, and heterologous biosynthesis in the genome-minimized model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor provided the 57.6 kb merochlorin gene cluster that contains two genes encoding rare bacterial vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) genes. Pathway expression of two different fosmid clones that differ largely by the presence or absence of the VHPO gene mcl40 resulted in the differential biosynthesis of merochlorin C, suggesting that Mcl40 catalyzes an unprecedented 15-membered chloronium-induced macrocyclization reaction converting merochlorin D to merochlorin C.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the goadsporin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0584 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of goadsporin, a polypeptide antibiotic containing thiazole and oxazole rings, was cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0584. The cluster contains a structural gene, godA, and nine god (goadsporin) genes involved in post-translational modification, immunity and transcriptional regulation. Although the gene organization is similar to typical bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters, each goadsporin biosynthetic gene shows low homology to these genes. Goadsporin biosynthesis is initiated by the translation of godA, and the subsequent cyclization, dehydration and acetylation are probably catalysed by godD, godE, godF, godG and godH gene products. godI shows high similarity to the 54 kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle and plays an important role in goadsporin immunity. Furthermore, four goadsporin analogues were produced by site-directed mutagenesis of godA, suggesting that this biosynthesis machinery is used for the heterocyclization of peptides.	1
Title: Two new tailoring enzymes, a glycosyltransferase and an oxygenase, involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin A in Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717 Abstract: Urdamycin A, the principal product of Streptomyces fradiae Tu2717, is an angucycline-type antibiotic and anticancer agent containing C-glycosidically linked D-olivose. To extend knowledge of the biosynthesis of urdamycin A the authors have cloned further parts of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Three new ORFs (urdK, urdJ and urdO) were identified on a 3.35 kb fragment, and seven new ORFs (urdL, urdM, urdJ2, urdZl, urdGT2, urdG and urdH) on an 8.05 kb fragment. The deduced products of these genes show similarities to transporters (urdJ and urdJ2), regulatory genes (urdK), reductases (urdO), cyclases (urdL) and deoxysugar biosynthetic genes (urdG, urdH and urdZ1). The product of urdM shows striking sequence similarity to oxygenases (N-terminal sequence) as well as reductases (C-terminal sequence), and the deduced amino acid sequence of urdGT2 resembles those of glycosyltransferases. To determine the function of urdM and urdGT2, targeted gene inactivation experiments were performed. The resulting urdM deletion mutant strains accumulated predominantly rabelomycin, indicating that UrdM is involved in oxygenation at position 12b of urdamycin A. A mutant in which urdGT2 had been deleted produced urdamycin I, urdamycin J and urdamycin K instead of urdamycin A. Urdamycins I, J and K are tetracyclic angucyclinones lacking a C-C connected deoxysugar moiety. Therefore UrdGT2 must catalyse the earliest glycosyltransfer step in the urdamycin biosynthetic pathway, the C-glycosyltransfer of one NDP-D-olivose.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of the PR-toxin gene cluster in Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium chrysogenum: cross talk of secondary metabolite pathways Abstract: The PR-toxin is a potent mycotoxin produced by Penicillium roqueforti in moulded grains and grass silages and may contaminate blue-veined cheese. The PR-toxin derives from the 15 carbon atoms sesquiterpene aristolochene formed by the aristolochene synthase (encoded by ari1). We have cloned and sequenced a four gene cluster that includes the ari1 gene from P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of the four genes (named prx1 to prx4) resulted in a reduction of 65-75% in the production of PR-toxin indicating that the four genes encode enzymes involved in PR-toxin biosynthesis. Interestingly the four silenced mutants overproduce large amounts of mycophenolic acid, an antitumor compound formed by an unrelated pathway suggesting a cross-talk of PR-toxin and mycophenolic acid production. An eleven gene cluster that includes the above mentioned four prx genes and a 14-TMS drug/H(+) antiporter was found in the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum. This eleven gene cluster has been reported to be very poorly expressed in a transcriptomic study of P. chrysogenum genes under conditions of penicillin production (strongly aerated cultures). We found that this apparently silent gene cluster is able to produce PR-toxin in P. chrysogenum under static culture conditions on hydrated rice medium. Noteworthily, the production of PR-toxin was 2.6-fold higher in P. chrysogenum npe10, a strain deleted in the 56.8kb amplifiable region containing the pen gene cluster, than in the parental strain Wisconsin 54-1255 providing another example of cross-talk between secondary metabolite pathways in this fungus. A detailed PR-toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on all available evidence.	1
Title: Identification of the common biosynthetic gene cluster for both antimicrobial streptoaminals and antifungal 5-alkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines Abstract: 5-Alkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines (5aTHQs) and streptoaminals (STAMs) are natural products isolated from the combined-culture of Streptomyces nigrescens HEK616 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP-B0596. Despite their unique structures, their biosynthetic pathway has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we conducted a feeding experiment using 13C-labeled acetates and demonstrated that 5aTHQs are likely synthesized by the action of polyketide synthase (PKS). Based on this observation, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for 5aTHQs. Interestingly, the same gene cluster was also responsible for the structurally-distinct STAMs. The gene cluster contains nine genes encoding one acyl carrier protein, two sets of ketosynthases (KSs) and chain length factors (CLFs), one aminotransferase/reductase bifunctional protein, two ketoreductases, and one thioesterase. KSs and CLFs are classified into the phylogenetically distinct clades from those of known type II PKSs. Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and subsequent gene inactivation clearly indicated that all of the nine genes were required for the biosynthesis of both compounds. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, chain elongation by PKS, reductive cleavage of a thioester bond, and subsequent transamination generate the core skeleton of both compounds. Differences in the oxidation states of the products result in a distinct cyclization mode to yield 5aTHQs and STAMs.	1
Title: Identification, cloning and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin Abstract: From our in-house microbial genome database of secondary metabolite producers, we identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin from Streptomyces nobilis JCM4274. We report herein the cloning of the 127-kb entire gene cluster for desertomycin biosynthesis using bacterial artificial chromosome vector. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster for desertomycin was introduced in the heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans TK23, with an average yield of more than 130 mg l-1.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the spectinabilin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spectabilis Abstract: Spectinabilin is a rare nitrophenyl-substituted polyketide metabolite. Here we report the cloning and heterologous expression of the spectinabilin gene cluster from Streptomyces spectabilis. Unexpectedly, this gene cluster is evolutionarily closer to the aureothin gene cluster than to the spectinabilin gene cluster from Streptomyces orinoci. Moreover, the two nearly identical spectinabilin gene clusters use a distinctly different regulation mechanism.	1
Title: LC-MS-based metabolomics study of marine bacterial secondary metabolite and antibiotic production in Salinispora arenicola Abstract: An LC-MS-based metabolomics approach was used to characterise the variation in secondary metabolite production due to changes in the salt content of the growth media as well as across different growth periods (incubation times). We used metabolomics as a tool to investigate the production of rifamycins (antibiotics) and other secondary metabolites in the obligate marine actinobacterial species Salinispora arenicola, isolated from Great Barrier Reef (GBR) sponges, at two defined salt concentrations and over three different incubation periods. The results indicated that a 14 day incubation period is optimal for the maximum production of rifamycin B, whereas rifamycin S and W achieve their maximum concentration at 29 days. A "chemical profile" link between the days of incubation and the salt concentration of the growth medium was shown to exist and reliably represents a critical point for selection of growth medium and harvest time.	1
Title: Enzymatic Self-Assembly Confers Exceptionally Strong Synergism with NF-κB Targeting for Selective Necroptosis of Cancer Cells Abstract: As a promising molecular process for selectively inhibiting cancer cells without inducing acquired drug resistance, enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) usually requires relatively high dosages. Despite its discovery 30 years ago, the translation of the knowledge about NF-κB signaling into clinic remains complicated due to the broad roles of NF-κB in cellular regulation. Here we show that integrating EISA and NF-κB targeting boosts the efficacy of EISA over an order of magnitude without compromising selectivity against cancer cells. That is, in situ enzymatic self-assembly of a tetrapeptide results in nanofibers, which hardly affect cell viability, but lead to inductive expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) and decreased expression of three key proteins at the upstream of NF-κB pathway in the cancer cells. Adding the inhibitors targeting NF-κB further decreases the expressions of those upstream proteins, which turns the otherwise innocuous nanofibers to being lethal to the cancer cells, likely causing necroptosis. As the first case of using supramolecular processes to enable synthetic lethality, this work illustrates a versatile approach to translate key regulatory circuits into promising therapeutic targets.	0
Title: Transposon Tn917lacZ mutagenesis of Bacillus subtilis: identification of two new loci required for motility and chemotaxis Abstract: We have used Tn917lacZ to mutagenize the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and have isolated mutants that are defective in chemotaxis and motility. Mapping of the transposon inserts identified two new loci. Mutations in one of these loci generated mutants that had paralyzed flagella. Accordingly, we designate this a mot locus. The other locus is closely linked to the first and encodes proteins specifying chemotaxis functions. This locus is designated the cheX locus. Both the mot and cheX loci map close to ptsI. An additional transposon insert that maps in the hag locus was obtained. The pattern of beta-galactosidase expression from some of the transposons suggested that the mot locus is regulated by sigD, a minor sigma factor of B. subtilis. The cheX locus appeared to be under the control of vegetative sigA. Four transposon inserts were mapped to a previously characterized che locus near spcB. These mutants did not produce flagellin and were defective in the methylation of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. This locus probably encodes proteins required for flagellum biosynthesis and other proteins that are required for the methylation response.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of LL-Z1272β: Discovery of a New Member of NRPS-like Enzymes for Aryl-Aldehyde Formation Abstract: LL-Z1272β (1) is a prenylated aryl-aldehyde produced by several fungi; it also serves as a key pathway intermediate for many fungal meroterpenoids. Despite its importance in the biosynthesis of natural products, the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of 1 has yet to be elucidated. Here we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1 from Stachybotrys bisbyi PYH05-7, and elucidated the biosynthetic route to 1. The biosynthesis involves a polyketide synthase, a prenyltransferase, and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like enzyme, which is responsible for the generation of the aldehyde functionality. Interestingly, the NRPS-like enzyme only accepts the farnesylated substrate to catalyze the carboxylate reduction; this represents a new example of a substrate for adenylation domains.	1
Title: The tcmVI region of the tetracenomycin C biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces glaucescens encodes the tetracenomycin F1 monooxygenase, tetracenomycin F2 cyclase, and, most likely, a second cyclase Abstract: Certain mutations in the tcmVI region of the Streptomyces glaucescens chromosome affect formation of the D ring of the polyketide antibiotic tetracenomycin C (TCM C). This region lies immediately upstream from the TCM C polyketide synthase genes (tcmKLM), and the nucleotide sequence reveals the presence of three small genes, tcmH, tcmI, and tcmJ. On the basis of the phenotypes of mutants and the effects of these genes, when coupled on a plasmid with the tcmKLMN177 genes (tcmN177 is a 3'-truncated version of tcmN), on the production of TCM intermediates in a TCM- mutant, the tcmH gene encodes the C-5 monooxygenase that converts TCM F1 to TCM D3, the tcmI gene encodes the D-ring cyclase that converts TCM F2 to TCM F1 (mutations in this gene are responsible for the type VI phenotype), and the tcmJ gene most likely encodes the B-ring cyclase that acts in the biosynthesis of TCM F2. Furthermore, it appears that the N-terminal domain of the tcmN gene product (encoded by the tcmN177 gene) acts later in the biosynthesis of TCM F2 than the product of tcmJ, suggesting that the N-terminal domain of the TcmN protein is the C-ring cyclase.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the DNA region responsible for Megacin A-216 production in Bacillus megaterium 216 Abstract: Upon induction, Bacillus megaterium 216 produces the bacteriocin megacin A-216, which leads to lysis of the producer cell and kills B. megaterium and a few other bacterial species. The DNA region responsible for megacinogeny was cloned in B. megaterium. The nucleotide sequence of a 5,494-bp-long subfragment was determined, and the function of the genes on this fragment was studied by generating deletions and analyzing their effects on MegA phenotypes. An open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 293-amino-acid protein was identified as the gene (megA) coding for megacin A-216. BLAST searches detected sequence similarity between megacin A-216 and proteins with phospholipase A2 activity. Purified biologically active megacin A-216 preparations contained three proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the largest protein is the full-length translation product of the megA gene, whereas the two shorter proteins are fragments of the long protein created by cleavage between Gln-185 and Val-186. The molecular masses of the three polypeptides are 32,855, 21,018, and 11,855 Da, respectively. Comparison of different megacin preparations suggests that the intact chain as well as the two combined fragments can form biologically active megacin. An ORF located next to the megA gene and encoding a 91-amino-acid protein was shown to be responsible for the relative immunity displayed by the producer strain against megacin A-216. Besides the megA gene, at least two other genes, including a gene encoding a 188-amino-acid protein sharing high sequence similarity with RNA polymerase sigma factors, were shown to be required for induction of megacin A-216 expression.	1
Title: Planomonospora: A Metabolomics Perspective on an Underexplored Actinobacteria Genus Abstract: Despite an excellent track record, microbial drug discovery suffers from high rates of rediscovery. Better workflows for the rapid investigation of complex extracts are needed to increase throughput and to allow early prioritization of samples. In addition, systematic characterization of poorly explored strains is seldomly performed. Here, we report a metabolomic study of 72 isolates belonging to the rare actinomycete genus Planomonospora, using a workflow of commonly used open access tools to investigate its secondary metabolites. The results reveal a correlation of chemical diversity and strain phylogeny, with classes of metabolites exclusive to certain phylogroups. We were able to identify previously reported Planomonospora metabolites, including the ureylene-containing oligopeptide antipain, the thiopeptide siomycin including new congeners, and the ribosomally synthesized peptides sphaericin and lantibiotic 97518. In addition, we found that Planomonospora strains can produce the siderophore desferrioxamine or a salinichelin-like peptide. Analysis of the genomes of three newly sequenced strains led to the detection of 59 gene cluster families, of which three were connected to products found by LC-MS/MS profiling. This study demonstrates the value of metabolomic studies to investigate poorly explored taxa and provides a first picture of the biosynthetic capabilities of the genus Planomonospora.	0
Title: Reconstitution of a Highly Reducing Type II PKS System Reveals 6π-Electrocyclization Is Required for o-Dialkylbenzene Biosynthesis Abstract: Natural products containing an o-dialkylbenzene moiety exhibit a wide variety of bioactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, and antiangiogenic activities. However, the biosynthetic scheme of the o-dialkylbenzene moiety remains unclear. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of compounds 1 and 2 in Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404, which contains a rare o-dialkylbenzene moiety, and successfully reconstituted the biosynthesis of 1 using 22 recombinant enzymes in vitro. Our study established a biosynthetic route for the o-tolyl group within the o-dialkylbenzene moiety, where the triene intermediate 3 loaded onto a unique acyl carrier protein (ACP) is elongated by a specific ketosynthase-chain length factor pair of a type II polyketide synthase system with the aid of a putative isomerase to be termed "electrocyclase" and a thioesterase-like enzyme in the BGC. The C2-elongated all-trans diketo-triene intermediate is subsequently isomerized to the 6Z configuration by the electrocyclase to allow intramolecular 6π-electrocyclization, followed by coenzyme FAD/FMN-dependent dehydrogenation. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the key genes are all conserved in BGCs of natural products containing an o-dialkylbenzene moiety, suggesting that the proposed biosynthetic scheme is a common strategy to form o-dialkylbenzenes in nature.	1
Title: The colicin G, H and X determinants encode microcins M and H47, which might utilize the catecholate siderophore receptors FepA, Cir, Fiu and IroN Abstract: The colicin G producer Escherichia coli CA46, the colicin H producer E. coli CA58 and E. coli Nissle 1917 (DSM 6601) were shown to produce microcin H47 and the newly described microcin M. Both microcins were exported like colicin V by an RND-type export system, including TolC. The gene cluster encoding microcins H47 and M in strains CA46 and CA58 is nearly identical to that in strain DSM 6601, except that two additional genes are included. A Fur box identified in front of the microcin-encoding genes explained the observed iron regulation of microcin production. The catecholate siderophore receptors Fiu, Cir and FepA from E. coli and IroN, Cir and FepA from Salmonella were identified as receptors for microcins M, H47 and E492. IroN takes up the glucose-containing catecholate siderophore salmochelin, whose synthesis is encoded in the iro gene cluster found in Salmonella and certain, often uropathogenic, E. coli strains. A gene in this iro cluster, iroB, which encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, was also found in the microcin H47/M and microcin E492 gene clusters. These microcins could aid the producing strain in competing against enterobacteria that utilize catecholate siderophores.	1
Title: Sensing DNA through DNA Charge Transport Abstract: DNA charge transport chemistry involves the migration of charge over long molecular distances through the aromatic base pair stack within the DNA helix. This migration depends upon the intimate coupling of bases stacked one with another, and hence any perturbation in that stacking, through base modifications or protein binding, can be sensed electrically. In this review, we describe the many ways DNA charge transport chemistry has been utilized to sense changes in DNA, including the presence of lesions, mismatches, DNA-binding proteins, protein activity, and even reactions under weak magnetic fields. Charge transport chemistry is remarkable in its ability to sense the integrity of DNA.	0
Title: Chemical Reporters for Exploring Microbiology and Microbiota Mechanisms Abstract: The advances made in bioorthogonal chemistry and the development of chemical reporters have afforded new strategies to explore the targets and functions of specific metabolites in biology. These metabolite chemical reporters have been applied to diverse classes of bacteria including Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mycobacteria, and more complex microbiota communities. Herein we summarize the development and application of metabolite chemical reporters to study fundamental pathways in bacteria as well as microbiota mechanisms in health and disease.	0
Title: Screening for a diamond in the rough Abstract: Contrary to the standard of eliminating antimicrobial hits that collapse bacterial proton motive force (PMF), in this issue of Chemistry and Biology, Farha and colleagues describe the value of screens to identify molecules that dissipate PMF, yet are nonbacteriolytic and selectively toxic.	0
Title: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei: characterization of the enzyme, cloning and sequencing of the gene, and expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei (optimal growth temperature, 100 to 103 degrees C) was purified to homogeneity. This enzyme was strictly phosphate dependent, utilized either NAD+ or NADP+, and was insensitive to pentalenolactone like the enzyme from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanothermus fervidus. The enzyme exhibited a considerable thermostability, with a 44-min half-life at 100 degrees C. The amino acid sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from P. woesei was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the coding gene. Compared with the enzyme homologs from mesophilic archaebacteria (Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanobacterium formicicum) and an extremely thermophilic archaebacterium (Methanothermus fervidus), the primary structure of the P. woesei enzyme exhibited a strikingly high proportion of aromatic amino acid residues and a low proportion of sulfur-containing residues. The coding gene of P. woesei was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, thus providing an ideal basis for detailed structural and functional studies of that enzyme.	0
Title: Cereulide synthesis in emetic Bacillus cereus is controlled by the transition state regulator AbrB, but not by the virulence regulator PlcR Abstract: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to the antibiotic valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that cereulide is produced non-ribosomally by the plasmid-encoded peptide synthetase Ces. Using deletion mutants of the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72, the influence of the well-known transcription factors PlcR, Spo0A and AbrB on cereulide production and on the transcription of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster was investigated. Our data demonstrate that cereulide synthesis is independent of the B. cereus specific virulence regulator PlcR but belongs to the Spo0A-AbrB regulon. Although cereulide production turned out to be independent of sporulation, it required the activity of the sporulation factor Spo0A. The sigma(A)-promoted transcription of spo0A was found to be crucial for cereulide production, while the sigma(H)-driven transcription of spo0A did not affect cereulide synthesis. Overexpression of the transition state factor AbrB in B. cereus F4810/72 resulted in a non-toxic phenotype. Moreover, AbrB was shown to bind efficiently to the main promoter region of the ces operon, indicating that AbrB acts as a repressor of cereulide production by negatively affecting ces transcription.	1
Title: Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues Abstract: Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino acid backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino acid-containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino acids result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine. The reaction can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino acids into genetically encoded precursors in Escherichia coli In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino acid components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification.	1
Title: The in vitro characterization of polyene glycosyltransferases AmphDI and NysDI Abstract: The overproduction, purification, and in vitro characterization of the polyene glycosyltransferases (GTs) AmphDI and NysDI are reported. A novel nucleotidyltransferase mutant (RmlA Q83D) for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of unnatural GDP-sugar donors in conjunction with polyene GT-catalyzed sugar exchange/reverse reactions allowed the donor and acceptor specificities of these novel enzymes to be probed. The evaluation of polyene GT aglycon and GDP-sugar donor specificity revealed some tolerance to aglycon structural diversity, but stringent sugar specificity, and culminated in new polyene analogues in which L-gulose or D-mannose replace the native sugar D-mycosamine.	0
Title: Mithramycin SK, a novel antitumor drug with improved therapeutic index, mithramycin SA, and demycarosyl-mithramycin SK: three new products generated in the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus through combinatorial biosynthesis Abstract: To gain initial structure-activity relationships regarding the highly functionalized pentyl side chain attached at C-3 of mithramycin (MTM), we focused on a post-polyketide synthase (post-PKS) tailoring step of the MTM biosynthesis by Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, which was proposed to be catalyzed by ketoreductase (KR) MtmW. In this last step of the MTM biosynthesis, a keto group of the pentyl side chain is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and we anticipated the generation of an MTM derivative with an additional keto group in the 3-side chain. Insertional inactivation of mtmW, a gene located ca. 8 kb downstream of the mithramycin-PKS genes, yielded an S. argillaceus mutant, which accumulated three new mithramycin analogues, namely mithramycin SA, demycarosyl-mithramycin SK, and mithramycin SK (MTM-SK). The structures of these three compounds confirmed indirectly the proposed role of MtmW in MTM biosynthesis. However, the new mithramycin derivatives bear unexpectedly shorter 3-side chains (ethyl or butyl) than MTM, presumably caused by nonenzymatic rearrangement or cleavage reactions of the initially formed pentyl side chain with a reactive beta-dicarbonyl functional group. The major product, MTM-SK, was tested in vitro against a variety of human cancer cell lines, as well as in an in vitro toxicity assay, and showed an improved therapeutic index, in comparison to the parent drug, MTM.	1
Title: WA8242A1, A2 and B, novel secretory phospholipase A2 inhibitors produced by Streptomyces violaceusniger. II. Biological properties Abstract: WA8242A1, A2 and B, novel inhibitors of secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2), were obtained from Streptomyces violaceusniger No. 8242. WA8242B inhibited secretory group I and II PLA2s in a dose-dependent manner. The mode of inhibition of group II PLA2 by WA8242B was in competitive fashion. WA8242B inhibited group II PLA2-induced Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, WA8242B was effective in mouse zymosan writhing model.	0
Title: Identification and analysis of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster and its use for manipulating glycopeptide biosynthesis in Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908 Abstract: Seven complete genes and one incomplete gene for the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotic balhimycin were isolated from the producer, Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908, by a reverse-cloning approach and characterized. Using oligonucleotides derived from glycosyltransferase sequences, a 900-bp glycosyltransferase gene fragment was amplified and used to identify a DNA fragment of 9,882 bp. Of the identified open reading frames, three (oxyA to -C) showed significant sequence similarities to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and one (bhaA) showed similarities to halogenase, and the genes bgtfA to -C showed similarities to glycosyltransferases. Glycopeptide biosynthetic mutants were created by gene inactivation experiments eliminating oxygenase and glycosyltransferase functions. Inactivation of the oxygenase gene(s) resulted in a balhimycin mutant (SP1-1) which was not able to synthesize an antibiotically active compound. Structural analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, fragmentation studies, and amino acid analysis demonstrated that these oxygenases are involved in the coupling of the aromatic side chains of the unusual heptapeptide. Mutant strain HD1, created by inactivation of the glycosyltransferase gene bgtfB, produced at least four different compounds which were not glycosylated but still antibiotically active.	1
Title: Sterol carrier protein-2 directly interacts with caveolin-1 in vitro and in vivo Abstract: HDL-mediated reverse-cholesterol transport as well as phosphoinositide signaling are mediated through plasma membrane microdomains termed caveolae/lipid rafts. However, relatively little is known regarding mechanism(s) whereby these lipids traffic to or are targeted to caveolae/lipid rafts. Since sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) binds both cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol, the possibility that SCP-2 might interact with caveolin-1 and caveolae was examined. Double immunolabeling and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy showed that a small but significant portion of SCP-2 colocalized with caveolin-1 primarily at the plasma membrane of L-cells and more so within intracellular punctuate structures in hepatoma cells. In SCP-2 overexpressing L-cells, SCP-2 was detected in close proximity to caveolin, 48 +/- 4 A, as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and immunogold electron microscopy. Cell fractionation of SCP-2 overexpressing L-cells and Western blotting detected SCP-2 in purified plasma membranes, especially in caveolae/ lipid rafts as compared to the nonraft fraction. SCP-2 and caveolin-1 were coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-caveolin-1 and anti-SCP-2. Finally, a yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that SCP-2 directly interacts with caveolin-1 in vivo. These interactions of SCP-2 with caveolin-1 were specific since a functionally related protein, phosphatidyinositol transfer protein (PITP), colocalized much less well with caveolin-1, was not in close proximity to caveolin-1 (i.e., >120 A), and was not coimmunoprecipitated by anti-caveolin-1 from cell lysates. In summary, it was shown for the first time that SCP-2 (but not PITP) selectively interacted with caveolin-1, both within the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. These data contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of SCP-2 in cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol targeted from intracellular sites of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to caveolae/lipid rafts at the cell surface plasma membrane.	0
Title: Increasing the reaction rate of hydroxynitrile lyase from Hevea brasiliensis toward mandelonitrile by copying active site residues from an esterase that accepts aromatic esters Abstract: The natural substrate of hydroxynitrile lyase from rubber tree (HbHNL, Hevea brasiliensis) is acetone cyanohydrin, but synthetic applications usually involve aromatic cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile. To increase the activity of HbHNL toward this unnatural substrate, we replaced active site residues in HbHNL with the corresponding ones from esterase SABP2 (salicylic acid binding protein 2). Although this enzyme catalyzes a different reaction (hydrolysis of esters), its natural substrate (methyl salicylate) contains an aromatic ring. Three of the eleven single-amino-acid-substitution variants of HbHNL reacted more rapidly with mandelonitrile. The best was HbHNL-L121Y, with a kcat 4.2 times higher and high enantioselectivity. Site-saturation mutagenesis at position 121 identified three other improved variants. We hypothesize that the smaller active site orients the aromatic substrate more productively.	0
Title: Detection of miRNA expression in intact cells using activatable sensor oligonucleotides Abstract: We describe a technology for the profiling of miRNA expression in intact cells. The technology is based on sensor oligonucleotides that are cleavable, completely complementary to a target miRNA, and dual-labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher. Upon entering the cell, the sensor oligonucleotide binds its specific miRNA target through complementary base-pairing. This triggers assembly of the endogenous RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) around the miRNA-sensor duplex and cleavage of the sensor oligonucleotide, resulting in separation between the dye and quencher, and a fluorescence turn-on. In the presented feasibility studies, we focus on a specific miRNA (miR-10b) implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Using a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we illustrate the application of this technology for miRNA detection with nanomolar sensitivity in both a cell-free system and intact cells.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of anatoxin-a and analogues (anatoxins) in cyanobacteria Abstract: Freshwater cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites that are toxic to humans and animals, the so-called cyanotoxins. Among them, anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are potent neurotoxins that are agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. These alkaloids provoke a rapid death if ingested at low doses. Recently, the cluster of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins, the ana cluster, has been identified in Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, and a biosynthetic pathway was proposed. This biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro using purified enzymes confirming the predicted pathway. One of the enzymes, AnaB a prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase, was crystallized and its three dimensional structure solved confirming its reaction mechanism. Three other ana clusters have now been identified and sequenced in other cyanobacteria. These clusters show similarities and some differences suggesting a common evolutionary origin. In particular, the cluster from Cylindrospermum stagnale PCC 7417, possesses an extra gene coding for an F420-dependent oxidoreductase that is likely involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroanatoxin-a. This review summarizes all these new data and discusses them in relation to the production of anatoxins in the environment.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the beta-amino acid moiety of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 featuring beta-amino acyl-S-carrier protein intermediates Abstract: The enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 chromoprotein is produced by Streptomyces globisporus. The biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety (boxed) of the C-1027 chromophore (1) from l-tyrosine (3) and its incorporation into 1 are catalyzed by six enzymes: SgcC, SgcC1, SgcC2, SgcC3, SgcC4, ShcC5. In vivo and in vitro characterization of these enzymes delineated this pathway, unveiling a novel strategy for beta-amino acid modification featuring beta-amino acyl-S-carrier protein intermediates. These findings shed new light into beta-amino acid biosynthesis and present a new opportunity to engineer the C-1027 biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues as exemplified by 20-deschloro-C-1027 (4), 20-deschro-22-deshydroxy-C-1027 (5), and 22-deshydroxy-C-1027 (6).	1
Title: Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the complestatin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Streptomyces lavendulae produces complestatin, a cyclic peptide natural product that antagonizes pharmacologically relevant protein-protein interactions including formation of the C4b,2b complex in the complement cascade and gp120-CD4 binding in the HIV life cycle. Complestatin, a member of the vancomycin group of natural products, consists of an alpha-ketoacyl hexapeptide backbone modified by oxidative phenolic couplings and halogenations. The entire complestatin biosynthetic and regulatory gene cluster spanning ca. 50 kb was cloned and sequenced. It consisted of 16 ORFs, encoding proteins homologous to nonribosomal peptide synthetases, cytochrome P450-related oxidases, ferredoxins, nonheme halogenases, four enzymes involved in 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg) biosynthesis, transcriptional regulators, and ABC transporters. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase consisted of a priming module, six extending modules, and a terminal thioesterase; their arrangement and domain content was entirely consistent with functions required for the biosynthesis of a heptapeptide or alpha-ketoacyl hexapeptide backbone. Two oxidase genes were proposed to be responsible for the construction of the unique aryl-ether-aryl-aryl linkage on the linear heptapeptide intermediate. Hpg, 3,5-dichloro-Hpg, and 3,5-dichloro-hydroxybenzoylformate are unusual building blocks that repesent five of the seven requisite monomers in the complestatin peptide. Heterologous expression and biochemical analysis of 4-hydroxyphenylglycine transaminon confirmed its role as an aminotransferase responsible for formation of all three precursors. The close similarity but functional divergence between complestatin and chloroeremomycin biosynthetic genes also presents a unique opportunity for the construction of hybrid vancomycin-type antibiotics.	1
Title: Biochemical Dissection of the Natural Diversification of Microcystin Provides Lessons for Synthetic Biology of NRPS Abstract: The cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystin is assembled at a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complex. The enormous structural diversity of this peptide, which is also found in closely related strains, is the result of frequent recombination events and point mutations. Here, we have compared the in vitro activation profiles of related monospecific and multispecific modules that either strictly incorporate leucine or arginine or incorporate chemically diverse amino acids in parallel into microcystin. By analyzing di- and tri-domain proteins we have dissected the role of adenylation and condensation domains for substrate specificity. We have further analyzed the role of subdomains and provide evidence for an extended gatekeeping function for the condensation domains of multispecific modules. By reproducing natural point mutations, we could convert a monospecific module into a multispecific module. Our findings may inspire novel synthetic biology approaches and demonstrate how recombination platforms of NRPSs have developed in nature.	1
Title: Repeat IGRA testing in Canadian health workers: conversions or unexplained variability? Abstract: Background:                       Although North American hospitals are switching from tuberculin testing (TST) to interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), data are limited on the association between occupational exposure and serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) results in healthcare workers (HCWs).                  Methods:                       In a cohort of Canadian HCWs, TST and QFT were performed at study enrolment (TST1 and QFT1) and 1 year later (TST2 and QFT2). Conversion and reversion rates were estimated, and correlation with TB exposure was assessed.                  Results:                       Among 258 HCWs, median age was 36.8 years, 188/258 (73%) were female and 183/258 (71%) were Canadian-born. In 245 subjects with a negative QFT1 we found a QFT conversion rate of 5.3% (13/245, 95% CI 2.9-8.9%). Using more stringent definitions, QFT conversion rates ranged from 2.0 to 5.3%. No TST conversions were found among the 241 HCWs with negative TST1, and no measure of recent TB exposure was associated with QFT conversions. In the 13 HCWs with a positive QFT1, 62% reverted.                  Conclusion:                       Using the conventional QFT conversion definition, we found a higher than expected rate of conversion. Recent occupational exposures were not associated with QFT conversions, and no TST conversions occurred in this cohort, suggesting the 'conversions' may not reflect new TB infection.	0
Title: Cloning of the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 and its heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans Abstract: Staurosporine is a representative member of indolocarbazole antibiotics. The entire staurosporine biosynthetic and regulatory gene cluster spanning 20-kb was cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 and sequenced. The gene cluster consists of 14 ORFs and the amino acid sequence homology search revealed that it contains three genes, staO, staD, and staP, coding for the enzymes involved in the indolocarbazole aglycone biosynthesis, two genes, staG and staN, for the bond formation between the aglycone and deoxysugar, eight genes, staA, staB, staE, staJ, staI, staK, staMA, and staMB, for the deoxysugar biosynthesis and one gene, staR is a transcriptional regulator. Heterologous gene expression of a 38-kb fragment containing a complete set of the biosynthetic genes for staurosporine cloned into pTOYAMAcos confirmed its role in staurosporine biosynthesis. Moreover, the distribution of the gene for chromopyrrolic acid synthase, the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole aglycone, in actinomycetes was investigated, and rebD homologs were shown to exist only in the strains producing indolocarbazole antibiotics.	1
Title: Semi-Rationally Designed Short Peptides Self-Assemble and Bind Hemin to Promote Cyclopropanation Abstract: The self-assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanoassemblies capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have semi-rationally designed a series of seven-residue peptides that form hemin-binding catalytic amyloids to facilitate enantioselective cyclopropanation with efficiencies that rival those of engineered hemin proteins. These results demonstrate that: 1) Catalytic amyloids can bind complex metallocofactors to promote practically important multisubstrate transformations. 2) Even essentially flat surfaces of amyloid assemblies can impart a substantial degree of enantioselectivity without the need for extensive optimization. 3) The ease of peptide preparation allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the preparation of peptides made from d-amino acids with complete reversal of enantioselectivity.	0
Title: 5S clavam biosynthesis is controlled by an atypical two-component regulatory system in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Streptomyces clavuligerus produces a collection of five clavam metabolites, including the clinically important β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, as well as four structurally related metabolites called 5S clavams. The paralogue gene cluster of S. clavuligerus is one of three clusters of genes for the production of these clavam metabolites. A region downstream of the cluster was analyzed, and snk, res1, and res2, encoding elements of an atypical two-component regulatory system, were located. Mutation of any one of the three genes had no effect on clavulanic acid production, but snk and res2 mutants produced no 5S clavams, whereas res1 mutants overproduced 5S clavams. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses showed that transcription of cvm7p (which encodes a transcriptional activator of 5S clavam biosynthesis) and 5S clavam biosynthetic genes was eliminated in snk and in res2 mutants but that snk and res2 transcription was unaffected in a cvm7p mutant. Both snk and res2 mutants could be complemented by introduction of cvm7p under the control of an independently regulated promoter. In vitro assays showed that Snk can autophosphorylate and transfer its phosphate group to both Res1 and Res2, and Snk-H365, Res1-D52, and Res2-D52 were identified as the phosphorylation sites for the system. Dephosphorylation assays indicated that Res1 stimulates dephosphorylation of Res2∼P. These results suggest a regulatory cascade in which Snk and Res2 form a two-component system controlling cvm7p transcription, with Res1 serving as a checkpoint to modulate phosphorylation levels. Cvm7P then activates transcription of 5S clavam biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: Chemoselective immobilization of proteins by microcontact printing and bio-orthogonal click reactions Abstract: Herein, a combination of microcontact printing of functionalized alkanethiols and site-specific modification of proteins is utilized to chemoselectively immobilize proteins onto gold surfaces, either by oxime- or copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide click chemistry. Two molecules capable of click reactions were synthesized, an aminooxy-functionalized alkanethiol and an azide-functionalized alkanethiol, and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation on gold was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The alkanethiols were then individually patterned onto gold surfaces by microcontact printing. Site-specifically modified proteins-horse heart myoglobin (HHMb) containing an N-terminal α-oxoamide and a red fluorescent protein (mCherry-CVIA) with a C-terminal alkyne-were immobilized by incubation onto respective stamped functionalized alkanethiol patterns. Pattern formation was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Quinolidomicin, the Largest Known Macrolide of Terrestrial Origin: Identification and Heterologous Expression of a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster over 200 kb Abstract: Quinolidomicin A1 is the largest macrolide compound from terrestrial sources, consisting of a 60-membered ring, and its biosynthetic gene cluster was revealed to be over 200 kb. The gene cluster for quinolidomicin was cloned and heterologously expressed. Confirmation of the product led to a structural revision, in which the hydroxy group in the chromophore moiety of the reported structure was replaced by an amine group.	1
Title: Tricarbocyclic core formation of tyrosine-decahydrofluorenes implies a three-enzyme cascade with XenF-mediated sigmatropic rearrangement as a prerequisite Abstract: Tyrosine-decahydrofluorene derivatives feature a fused [6.5.6] tricarbocyclic core and a 13-membered para-cyclophane ether. Herein, we identified new xenoacremones A, B, and C (1-3) from the fungal strain Xenoacremonium sinensis ML-31 and elucidated their biosynthetic pathway using gene deletion in the native strain and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. The hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) XenE together with enoyl reductase XenG were confirmed to be responsible for the formation of the tyrosine-nonaketide skeleton. This skeleton was subsequently dehydrated by XenA to afford a pyrrolidinone moiety. XenF catalyzed a novel sigmatropic rearrangement to yield a key cyclohexane intermediate as a prerequisite for the formation of the multi-ring system. Subsequent oxidation catalyzed by XenD supplied the substrate for XenC to link the para-cyclophane ether, which underwent subsequent spontaneous Diels-Alder reaction to give the end products. Thus, the results indicated that three novel enzymes XenF, XenD, and XenC coordinate to assemble the [6.5.6] tricarbocyclic ring and para-cyclophane ether during biosynthesis of complex tyrosine-decahydrofluorene derivatives.	1
Title: Quantum dots as a novel immunofluorescent detection system for Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot-conjugated antibodies were successfully developed to label Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. This novel fluorescence system exhibited superior photostability, gave 1.5- to 9-fold-higher signal-to-noise ratios than traditional organic dyes in detecting C. parvum, and allowed dual-color detection for C. parvum and G. lamblia.	0
Title: Antimycobacterial Rufomycin Analogues from Streptomyces atratus Strain MJM3502 Abstract: This study represents a systematic chemical and biological study of the rufomycin (RUF) class of cyclic heptapeptides, which our anti-TB drug discovery efforts have identified as potentially promising anti-TB agents that newly target the caseinolytic protein C1, ClpC1. Eight new RUF analogues, rufomycins NBZ1-NBZ8 (1-8), as well as five known peptides (9-13) were isolated and characterized from the Streptomyces atratus strain MJM3502. Advanced Marfey's and X-ray crystallographic analysis led to the assignment of the absolute configuration of the RUFs. Several isolates exhibited potent activity against both pathogens M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. abscessus, paired with favorable selectivity (selectivity index >60), which collectively underscores the promise of the rufomycins as potential anti-TB drug leads.	0
Title: Pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin and interaction with cisapride and sucralfate Abstract: In an open, randomized, triple crossover study, the effects of cisapride and sucralfate on the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin were assessed. Fifteen healthy volunteers received 400 mg of sparfloxacin as a single oral dose on day 0. In a random order, concomitant doses of 10 mg of cisapride three times daily from day -2 to day 2 and 1 g of sucralfate four times daily from day -2 to day 0 were administered. Sparfloxacin concentrations were measured by bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters for sparfloxacin alone were as follows (mean +/- standard deviation): maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), 1.27 +/- 0.39 microg/ml; time to C(max) (T(max)), 4.1 +/- 1.9 h; area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 35.0 +/- 9.7 microg x h/ml; mean residence time, 28.5 +/- 5.7 h; half-life (t1/2), 20 +/- 4 h; urinary recovery (UR x f), 11.0% +/- 2.7%; and metabolite-sparfloxacin ratio in urine, 2.6. For the cisapride group there was a significant decrease in the sparfloxacin T(max) (1.9 +/- 2.1 h) and a significant increase in C(max) (1.74 +/- 0.73 microg/ml). The QTc interval for patients receiving sparfloxacin and cisapride was prolonged by 7.7% compared to the QTc interval during medication-free periods. Significant differences in the values for the group receiving sucralfate compared to the values for the group receiving sparfloxacin alone were found: C(max), 0.77 +/- 0.31 microg/ml; AUC, 18.6 +/- 5.8 microg x h/ml; t1/2, 26 +/- 10 h; and UR x f, 5.8 +/- 1.8%. Concomitant adminstration of cisapride accelerates the absorption and increases the peak concentration of sparfloxacin without having a significant effect on the extent of bioavailability. Coadministration of sucralfate leads to a 44% decrease in the bioavailability of sparfloxacin.	0
Title: Synthetic microbial communities of heterotrophs and phototrophs facilitate sustainable growth Abstract: Microbial communities comprised of phototrophs and heterotrophs hold great promise for sustainable biotechnology. Successful application of these communities relies on the selection of appropriate partners. Here we construct four community metabolic models to guide strain selection, pairing phototrophic, sucrose-secreting Synechococcus elongatus with heterotrophic Escherichia coli K-12, Escherichia coli W, Yarrowia lipolytica, or Bacillus subtilis. Model simulations reveae metabolic exchanges that sustain the heterotrophs in minimal media devoid of any organic carbon source, pointing to S. elongatus-E. coli K-12 as the most active community. Experimental validation of flux predictions for this pair confirms metabolic interactions and potential production capabilities. Synthetic communities bypass member-specific metabolic bottlenecks (e.g. histidine- and transport-related reactions) and compensate for lethal genetic traits, achieving up to 27% recovery from lethal knockouts. The study provides a robust modelling framework for the rational design of synthetic communities with optimized growth sustainability using phototrophic partners.	0
Title: Dendritic growth gated by a steroid hormone receptor underlies increases in activity in the developing Drosophila locomotor system Abstract: As animals grow, their nervous systems also increase in size. How growth in the central nervous system is regulated and its functional consequences are incompletely understood. We explored these questions, using the larval Drosophila locomotor system as a model. In the periphery, at neuromuscular junctions, motoneurons are known to enlarge their presynaptic axon terminals in size and strength, thereby compensating for reductions in muscle excitability that are associated with increases in muscle size. Here, we studied how motoneurons change in the central nervous system during periods of animal growth. We find that within the central nervous system motoneurons also enlarge their postsynaptic dendritic arbors, by the net addition of branches, and that these scale with overall animal size. This dendritic growth is gated on a cell-by-cell basis by a specific isoform of the steroid hormone receptor ecdysone receptor-B2, for which functions have thus far remained elusive. The dendritic growth is accompanied by synaptic strengthening and results in increased neuronal activity. Electrical properties of these neurons, however, are independent of ecdysone receptor-B2 regulation. We propose that these structural dendritic changes in the central nervous system, which regulate neuronal activity, constitute an additional part of the adaptive response of the locomotor system to increases in body and muscle size as the animal grows.	0
Title: Functional genomics analysis of free fatty acid production under continuous phosphate limiting conditions Abstract: Free fatty acids (FFA) are an attractive platform chemical that serves as a functional intermediate in metabolic pathways for producing oleochemicals. Many groups have established strains of Escherichia coli capable of producing various chain-length mixtures of FFA by heterologous expression of acyl-ACP thioesterases. For example, high levels of dodecanoic acid are produced by an E. coli strain expressing the Umbellularia californica FatB2 thioesterase, BTE. Prior studies achieved high dodecanoic acid yields and productivities under phosphate-limiting media conditions. In an effort to understand the metabolic and physiological changes that led to increased FFA production, the transcriptome of this strain was assessed as a function of nutrient limitation and growth rate. FFA generation under phosphate limitation led to consistent changes in transporter expression, osmoregulation, and central metabolism. Guided by these results, targeted knockouts led to a further ~11 % in yield in FFA.	0
Title: Genomics-Driven Discovery of Phytotoxic Cytochalasans Involved in the Virulence of the Wheat Pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: The etiology of fungal pathogenesis of grains is critical to global food security. The large number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters uncovered in fungal plant pathogen genome sequencing projects suggests that we have a significant knowledge gap about the secondary metabolite repertoires of these pathogens and their roles in plant pathogenesis. Cytochalasans are a family of natural products of significant interest due to their ability to bind to actin and interfere with cellular processes that involved actin polymerization; however, our understanding of their biosynthesis and biological roles remains incomplete. Here, we identified a putative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) gene cluster (phm) that was upregulated in the pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum during its infection on wheat. Overexpression of the transcription factor gene phmR encoded in the phm gene cluster resulted in the production of two leucine-derived cytochalasans, phomacins D and E (1 and 2, respectively), and an acetonyl adduct phomacin F. Heterologous expression of the PKS-NRPS gene phmA and the trans-enoyl reductase (ER) gene phmE in Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of a novel 2-pyrrolidone precursor prephomacin. Reverse genetics and wheat seedling infection assays showed that ΔphmA mutants exhibited significantly reduced virulence compared to the wild type. We further demonstrated that both 1 and 2 showed potent actin polymerization-inhibitory activities and exhibited potentially monocot-specific antigerminative activities. The findings from this study have advanced our knowledge based on the biosynthesis and biological roles of cytochalasans, the latter of which could have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fungus-plant interactions.	1
Title: Englerins: A Comprehensive Review Abstract: In the decade since the discovery of englerin A (1) and its potent activity in cancer models, this natural product and its analogues have been the subject of numerous chemical, biological, and preclinical studies by many research groups. This review summarizes published findings and proposes further research directions required for entry of an englerin analogue into clinical trials for kidney cancer and other conditions.	0
Title: Genetic and transcriptional analysis of the siderophore malleobactin biosynthesis and transport genes in the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen that causes melioidosis, an invasive disease of humans and animals. To address the response of this bacterium to iron-limiting conditions, we first performed a global transcriptional analysis of RNA extracted from bacteria grown under iron-limiting and iron-rich conditions by microarrays. We focused our study on those open reading frames (ORFs) induced under iron limitation, which encoded predicted proteins that could be involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of the siderophore malleobactin. We purified this siderophore and determined that it consisted of at least three compounds with different molecular weights. We demonstrated that ORFs BPSL1776 and BPSL1774, designated mbaA and mbaF, respectively, are involved in the biosynthesis of malleobactin, while BPSL1775, named fmtA, is involved in its transport. These genes are in an operon with two other ORFs (mbaJ and mbaI) whose transcription is under the control of MbaS, a protein that belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors. Interestingly, the transcription of the mbaA, fmtA, and mbaS genes is not controlled by the availability of the siderophore malleobactin.	1
Title: Genetically targetable and color-switching fluorescent probe Abstract: Color bind: We have developed a probe TMR-para-MG that switches its fluorescence emission upon binding to a fluorogen-activating protein (FAP). In cells that express FAP, this dye labels target sites in one color and mitochondria in another color, thus it might be a suitable tool for monitoring changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.	0
Title: Fluostatins produced by the heterologous expression of a TAR reassembled environmental DNA derived type II PKS gene cluster Abstract: Culture independent approaches for accessing small molecules produced by uncultured bacteria are often hampered by the inability to easily clone environmental DNA (eDNA) fragments large enough to capture intact biosynthetic gene clusters that can be used in heterologous expression studies. Here we show that homology screening of eDNA megalibraries for clones containing natural product biosynthetic genes, coupled with transformation-assisted recombination (TAR) in yeast, can be used to access large, functionally intact, natural product gene clusters from the environment. The eDNA derived gene cluster reported here was functionally reconstructed from two overlapping cosmid clones using TAR. The isolation and structure elucidation of three new fluostatins (F, G, and H) produced by this TAR reconstructed gene cluster is described.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of a type II peptidyl carrier protein from the bleomycin producer Streptomyces verticillus ATCC 15003 Abstract: Background:                       Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) catalyze the assembly of a structurally diverse group of peptides by the multiple-carrier thiotemplate mechanism. All NRPSs known to date are exclusively type I modular enzymes that consist of domains, such as adenylation (A), peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and condensation (C) domains, for individual enzyme activities. Although several A and PCP domains have been demonstrated to function independently, aminoacylation in trans has been successful only between PCPs and their cognate A domains.                  Results:                       We have identified within the bleomycin-biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 the blmI gene that encodes a discrete PCP protein. We overexpressed the blmI gene in Escherichia coli, purified the BlmI protein, and demonstrated that apo-BlmI can be efficiently modified into holo-BlmI either in vivo or in vitro by PCP-specific 4'-phosphopantetheine transferases (PPTases). Unlike the PCP domains in type I NRPSs, BlmI lacks its cognate A domain and can be aminoacylated by Val-A, an A domain from a completely unrelated type I NRPS.                  Conclusions:                       BlmI represents the first characterized type II PCP. The BlmI type II PCP, like the PCP domains of type I NRPSs, can be 4'-phospho-pantetheinylated by PCP-specific PPTases but is biochemically distinct in that it can be aminoacylated by an A domain from a completely unrelated type I NRPS. Our results provide for the first time the genetic and biochemical evidence to support the existence of a type II NRPS, which might be useful in the combinatorial manipulation of NRPS proteins to generate novel peptides.	1
Title: Direct visualization of the outer membrane of mycobacteria and corynebacteria in their native state Abstract: The cell envelope of mycobacteria, which include the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, is crucial for their success as pathogens. Despite a continued strong emphasis on identifying the multiple chemical components of this envelope, it has proven difficult to combine its components into a comprehensive structural model, primarily because the available ultrastructural data rely on conventional electron microscopy embedding and sectioning, which are known to induce artifacts. The existence of an outer membrane bilayer has long been postulated but has never been directly observed by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. Here we have used cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) to perform a detailed ultrastructural analysis of three species belonging to the Corynebacterineae suborder, namely, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, in their native state. We provide new information that accurately describes the different layers of the mycobacterial cell envelope and challenges current models of the organization of its components. We show a direct visualization of an outer membrane, analogous to that found in gram-negative bacteria, in the three bacterial species examined. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mycolic acids, the hallmark of mycobacteria and related genera, are essential for the formation of this outer membrane. In addition, a granular layer and a low-density zone typifying the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria are apparent in CEMOVIS images of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. Based on our observations, a model of the organization of the lipids in the outer membrane is proposed. The architecture we describe should serve as a reference for future studies to relate the structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope to its function.	0
Title: The 2008 update of the Aspergillus nidulans genome annotation: a community effort Abstract: The identification and annotation of protein-coding genes is one of the primary goals of whole-genome sequencing projects, and the accuracy of predicting the primary protein products of gene expression is vital to the interpretation of the available data and the design of downstream functional applications. Nevertheless, the comprehensive annotation of eukaryotic genomes remains a considerable challenge. Many genomes submitted to public databases, including those of major model organisms, contain significant numbers of wrong and incomplete gene predictions. We present a community-based reannotation of the Aspergillus nidulans genome with the primary goal of increasing the number and quality of protein functional assignments through the careful review of experts in the field of fungal biology.	0
Title: Iodothyronamines are oxidatively deaminated to iodothyroacetic acids in vivo Abstract: 3-Iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) are bioactive metabolites of the hormone thyroxine (T(4)). In the present study, the ability of T(1)AM and 3,3',5-triiodothyronamine (T(3)AM) to be metabolized to 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA(1)) and Triac, respectively, was investigated. Both T(1)AM and T(3)AM were converted to their respective iodinated thyroacetic acid analogues in both cell and tissue extracts. This conversion could be significantly inhibited with the monamine oxidase (MAO) and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibitor iproniazid. TA(1) was found to be present in trace quantities in human serum and in substantial levels in serum from T(1)AM-treated rats. These results demonstrate that iodothyronamines are substrates for amine oxidases and that this metabolism may be the source of the corresponding endogenous arylacetic acid products Triac and TA(1).	0
Title: Effects of addition of elicitors on rimocidin biosynthesis in Streptomyces rimosus M527 Abstract: The polyene macrolide rimocidin, produced by Streptomyces rimosus M527, is highly effective against a broad range of fungal plant pathogens, but at low yields. Elicitation is an effective method of stimulating the yield of bioactive secondary metabolites. In this study, the biomass and filtrate of a culture broth of Escherichia coli JM109, Bacillus subtilis WB600, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum were employed as elicitors to promote rimocidin production in S. rimosus M527. Adding culture broth and biomass of S. cerevisiae (A3) and F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (B4) resulted in an increase of rimocidin production by 51.2% and 68.3% respectively compared with the production under normal conditions in 5-l fermentor. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcriptions of ten genes (rimA to rimK) located in the gene cluster involved in rimocidin biosynthesis in A3 or B4 elicitation experimental group were all higher than those of a control group. Using a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system, GUS enzyme activity assay, and Western blot analysis, we discovered that elicitation of A3 or B4 increased protein synthesis in S. rimosus M527. These results demonstrate that the addition of elicitors is a useful approach to improve rimocidin production.Key Points • An effective strategy for enhancing rimocidin production in S. rimosus M527 is demonstrated. • Overproduction of rimocidin is a result of higher expressed structural genes followed by an increase in protein synthesis.	1
Title: Glucocorticoid compounds modify smoothened localization and hedgehog pathway activity Abstract: The Hedgehog signaling pathway is linked to a variety of diseases, notably a range of cancers. The first generation of drug screens identified Smoothened (Smo), a membrane protein essential for signaling, as an attractive drug target. Smo localizes to the primary cilium upon pathway activation, and this transition is critical for the response to Hedgehog ligands. In a high content screen directly monitoring Smo distribution in Hedgehog-responsive cells, we identified different glucocorticoids as specific modulators of Smo ciliary accumulation. One class promoted Smo accumulation, conferring cellular hypersensitivity to Hedgehog stimulation. In contrast, a second class inhibited Smo ciliary localization and signaling activity by both wild-type Smo, and mutant forms of Smo, SmoM2, and SmoD473H, that are refractory to previously identified Smo antagonists. These findings point to the potential for developing glucocorticoid-based pharmacological modulation of Smo signaling to treat mutated drug-resistant forms of Smo, an emerging problem in long-term cancer therapy. They also raise a concern about potential crosstalk of glucocorticoid drugs in the Hedgehog pathway, if therapeutic administration exceeds levels associated with on-target transcriptional mechanisms of glucocorticoid action.	0
Title: Synthetic studies toward amphidinolide B1: synthesis of the C9-C26 fragment Abstract: [reaction: see text] The synthesis of the C9-C26 portion of amphidinolide B1 is described. A Fleming allylation followed by elimination was employed for the construction of the C13-C15 diene portion. Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was utilized for regioselective functionalization of a styrene-derived alkene, in the presence of the C13-C15 diene functionality. A highly diastereoselective aldol reaction was developed to establish the C18 stereochemistry.	0
Title: Bioactive phenazines from an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp Abstract: Three new phenazine-type compounds, named phenazines SA-SC (1-3), together with four new natural products (4-7), were isolated from the fermentation broth of an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp. NA04227. The structures of these compounds were determined by extensive analyses of NMR, high resolution mass spectroscopic data, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. Sequencing and analysis of the genome data allowed us to identify the gene cluster (spz) and propose a biosynthetic pathway for these phenazine-type compounds. Additionally, compounds 1-5 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and compound 3 showed antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus.	1
Title: Extensive post-translational modification, including serine to D-alanine conversion, in the two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147 Abstract: Lacticin 3147 is a two-component bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis DPC3147. In order to further characterize the biochemical nature of the bacteriocin, both peptides were isolated which together are responsible for the antimicrobial activity. The first, LtnA1, is a 3,322 Da 30-amino acid peptide and the second component, LtnA2, is a 29-amino acid peptide with a mass of 2,847 Da. Conventional amino acid analysis revealed that both peptides contain the thioether amino acid, lanthionine, as well as an excess of alanine to that predicted from the genetic sequence of the peptides. Chiral phase gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry of amino acid composition indicated that both LtnA1 and LtnA2 contain D-alanine residues and amino acid sequence analysis of LtnA1 confirmed that the D-alanine results from post-translational modification of a serine residue in the primary translation product. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lacticin 3147 is a novel, two-component, D-alanine containing lantibiotic that undergoes extensive post-translational modification which may account for its potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.	1
Title: Mechanistic studies on histone catalyzed cleavage of apyrimidinic/apurinic sites in nucleosome core particles Abstract: Duplex DNA containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lesion undergoes cleavage significantly more rapidly in nucleosome core particles (NCPs) than it does when free. The mechanism of AP cleavage within NCPs was studied through independently generating lesions within them. AP mediated DNA cleavage within NCPs is initiated by DNA-protein cross-link (DPC(un)) formation followed by β-elimination to give DPCs containing cleaved DNA (DPC(cl)). Hydrolysis of DPC(cl) produces a DNA single strand break (SSB). C2-dideuteration of AP showed that deprotonation from this position is involved in the rate-determining step. Experiments utilizing NCPs containing mutated histone H4 proteins indicated that lysine residues in the amino terminal tail are involved in both DPC formation and β-elimination steps. Lysines 16 and 20 seem to play a greater role in reacting with AP at superhelical location 1.5, but other amino acids (e.g., lysines 5, 8, and 12) compensate in their absence. The mechanism of rapid double strand breaks in bistranded, clustered AP lesions was studied by independently preparing reaction intermediates within model NCPs. A single strand break on one strand enhances the cleavage of a proximal AP on the opposite strand.	0
Title: Developmental decline in neuronal regeneration by the progressive change of two intrinsic timers Abstract: Like mammalian neurons, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons lose axon regeneration ability as they age, but it is not known why. Here, we report that let-7 contributes to a developmental decline in anterior ventral microtubule (AVM) axon regeneration. In older AVM axons, let-7 inhibits regeneration by down-regulating LIN-41, an important AVM axon regeneration-promoting factor. Whereas let-7 inhibits lin-41 expression in older neurons through the lin-41 3' untranslated region, lin-41 inhibits let-7 expression in younger neurons through Argonaute ALG-1. This reciprocal inhibition ensures that axon regeneration is inhibited only in older neurons. These findings show that a let-7-lin-41 regulatory circuit, which was previously shown to control timing of events in mitotic stem cell lineages, is reutilized in postmitotic neurons to control postdifferentiation events.	0
Title: Characterization of a molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic gene cluster in Rhodobacter capsulatus which is specific for the biogenesis of dimethylsulfoxide reductase Abstract: The DMSO reductase of Rhodobacter capsulatus contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and is located in the periplasm. DNA sequence analysis identified four genes involved in the biosynthesis of the Moco (moaA, moaD, moeB and moaC) immediately downstream of the dor (DMSO respiratory) gene cluster. Rhodobacter capsulatus MoaA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His6-tagged protein. Although, the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies, EPR spectroscopy showed that MoaA contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster. A moaA mutant was constructed and its phenotype indicates that the Moco biosynthetic gene cluster downstream of the dor operon is specific for the biogenesis of DMSO reductase. Two forms of DMSO reductase were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the moaA mutant. A mature form of DMSO reductase was located in the periplasm and a precursor form was found in the cytoplasm.	1
Title: Halogenation-Guided Chemical Screening Provides Insight into Tjipanazole Biosynthesis by the Cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua Abstract: Halogenated natural products (HNPs) show a wide range of interesting biological activities. Chemistry-guided screening with a software tool dedicated to identifying halogenated compounds in HPLC-MS data indicated the presence of several uncharacterised HNPs in an extract of the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua (Näg.) Gomont 108b. Three new natural products, tjipanazoles K, L, and M, were isolated from this strain together with the known tjipanazoles D and I. Taking into account the structures of all tjipanazole derivatives detected in this strain, reanalysis of the tjipanazole biosynthetic gene cluster allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the tjipanazoles. As the isolated tjipanazoles show structural similarity to arcyriaflavin A, an inhibitor of the clinically relevant multidrug-transporter ABCG2 overexpressed by different cancer cell lines, the isolated compounds were tested for ABCG2 inhibitory activity. Only tjipanazole K showed appreciable transporter inhibition, whereas the compounds lacking the pyrrolo[3,4-c] ring or featuring additional chloro substituents were found to be much less active.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of elloramycin in Streptomyces olivaceus requires glycosylation by enzymes encoded outside the aglycon cluster Abstract: Elloramycin is an anthracycline-like antitumour drug produced by Streptomyces olivaceus Tü2353. Cosmid cos16F4 has been previously shown to direct the biosynthesis of the elloramycin aglycon 8-demethyltetracenomycin C (8-DMTC), but not elloramycin. Sequencing of the 24.2 kb insert in cos16F4 shows the presence of 17 genes involved in elloramycin biosynthesis (elm genes) together with another additional eight ORFs probably not involved in elloramycin biosynthesis. The 17 genes would code for the biosynthesis of the polyketide moiety, sugar transfer, methylation of the tetracyclic ring and the sugar moiety, and export. Four genes (rhaA, rhaB, rhaC and rhaD) encoding the enzymic activities required for the biosynthesis of the sugar l-rhamnose were also identified in the S. olivaceus chromosome. The involvement of this rhamnose gene cluster in elloramycin biosynthesis was demonstrated by insertional inactivation of the rhaB gene, generating a non-producer mutant that accumulates the 8-DMTC C aglycon. Coexpression of cos16F4 with pEM4RO (expressing the four rhamnose biosynthesis genes) in Streptomyces lividans led to the formation of elloramycin, demonstrating that both subclusters are required for elloramycin biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to most of the biosynthesis gene clusters from actinomycetes, genes involved in the biosynthesis of elloramycin are located in two chromosomal loci.	1
Title: Overexpression of a type III PKS gene affording novel violapyrones with enhanced anti-influenza A virus activity Abstract: Background:                       Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are simple homodimer ketosynthases that distribute across plants, fungi, and bacteria, catalyzing formation of pyrone- and resorcinol-types aromatic polyketides with various bioactivities. The broad substrate promiscuity displayed by type III PKSs makes them wonderful candidates for expanding chemical diversity of polyketides.                  Results:                       Violapyrone B (VLP B, 10), an α-pyrone compound produced by deepsea-derived Streptomyces somaliensis SCSIO ZH66, is encoded by a type III PKS VioA. We overexpressed VioA in three different hosts, including Streptomyces coelicolor M1146, Streptomyces sanyensis FMA as well as the native producer S. somaliensis SCSIO ZH66, leading to accumulation of different violapyrone compounds. Among them, S. coelicolor M1146 served as the host producing the most abundant violapyrones, from which five new (2-4, 7 and 12) and nine known (1, 5, 6, 8-11, 13 and 14) compounds were identified. Anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus activity of these compounds was then evaluated using ribavirin as a positive control (IC50 = 112.9 μM), revealing that compounds 11-14 showed considerable activity with IC50 values of 112.7, 26.9, 106.7 and 28.8 μM, respectively, which are significantly improved as compared to that of VLP B (10) (IC50 > 200 μM). The productions of 10 and 13 were increased by adding P450 inhibitor metyrapone. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis experiment led to demonstration of the residue S242 to be essential for the activity of VioA.                  Conclusions:                       Biological background of the expression hosts is an important factor impacting on the encoding products of type III PKSs. By using S. coelicolor M1146 as cell factory, we were able to generate fourteen VLPs compounds. Anti-H1N1 activity assay suggested that the lipophilic nature of the alkyl chains of VLPs plays an important role for the activity, providing valuable guidance for further structural optimization of VLPs.	1
Title: Identification of the herboxidiene biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 Abstract: The 53-kb biosynthetic gene cluster for the novel anticholesterol natural product herboxidiene was identified in Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. In addition to herboxidiene, a biosynthetic intermediate, 18-deoxy-herboxidiene, was also isolated from the fermentation broth of S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 as a minor metabolite.	1
Title: Synthesis of functionalized cyclohexenone core of welwitindolinones via rhodium-catalyzed [5 + 1] cycloaddition Abstract: The cyclohexenone core of welwitindolinones was synthesized by a Rh(I)-catalyzed [5 + 1]-cycloaddition of an allenylcyclopropane with CO. A pentasubstituted cyclopropane was prepared successfully by a Rh(II)-catalyzed intramolecular cyclopropanation of alkenes with chlorodiazoacetates.	0
Title: Improving the coverage of the cyanobacterial phylum using diversity-driven genome sequencing Abstract: The cyanobacterial phylum encompasses oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes of a great breadth of morphologies and ecologies; they play key roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. The chloroplasts of all photosynthetic eukaryotes can trace their ancestry to cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria also attract considerable interest as platforms for "green" biotechnology and biofuels. To explore the molecular basis of their different phenotypes and biochemical capabilities, we sequenced the genomes of 54 phylogenetically and phenotypically diverse cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of cyanobacterial genomes reveals the molecular basis for many aspects of cyanobacterial ecophysiological diversity, as well as the convergence of complex morphologies without the acquisition of novel proteins. This phylum-wide study highlights the benefits of diversity-driven genome sequencing, identifying more than 21,000 cyanobacterial proteins with no detectable similarity to known proteins, and foregrounds the diversity of light-harvesting proteins and gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, our results provide insight into the distribution of genes of cyanobacterial origin in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Moreover, this study doubles both the amount and the phylogenetic diversity of cyanobacterial genome sequence data. Given the exponentially growing number of sequenced genomes, this diversity-driven study demonstrates the perspective gained by comparing disparate yet related genomes in a phylum-wide context and the insights that are gained from it.	1
Title: Real-Time BODIPY-Binding Assay To Screen Inhibitors of the Early Oligomerization Process of Aβ1-42 Peptide Abstract: Misfolding and aggregation of amyloid β1-42 peptide (Aβ1-42) play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting the highly cytotoxic oligomeric species formed during the early stages of the aggregation process represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the toxicity associated with Aβ1-42. Currently, the thioflavin T (ThT) assay is the only established spectrofluorometric method to screen aggregation inhibitors. The success of the ThT assay is that it can detect Aβ1-42 aggregates with high β-sheet content, such as protofibrils or fibrils, which appear in the late aggregation steps. Unfortunately, by using the ThT assay, the detection of inhibitors of early soluble oligomers that present a low β-sheet character is challenging. Herein, a new, facile, and robust boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) real-time assay suitable for 96-well plate format, which allows screening of compounds as selective inhibitors of the formation of Aβ1-42 oligomers, is reported. These inhibitors decrease the cellular toxicity of Aβ1-42, although they fail in the ThT assay. The findings have been confirmed and validated by structural analysis and cell viability assays under comparable experimental conditions. It is demonstrated that the BODIPY assay is a convenient method to screen and discover new candidate compounds that slow down or stop the pathological early oligomerization process and are active in the cellular assay. Therefore, it is a suitable complementary screening method of the current ThT assay.	0
Title: An antibody CDR3-erythropoietin fusion protein Abstract: X-ray crystallographic analysis of a bovine antibody (BLV1H12) revealed a unique scaffold in its ultralong heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3H) that folds into a solvent exposed, antiparallel β-stranded "stalk" fused with a disulfide cross-linked "knob" domain. This unusual variable region motif provides a novel approach for generating chimeric antibodies with novel activities. Toward this end, human erythropoietin (hEPO) was substituted for the "knob" domain in this antibody to afford an antibody-hEPO (Ab-hEPO) fusion protein that efficiently expresses in mammalian cells. Ab-hEPO proliferated TF-1 cells with a potency comparable to that of hEPO (EC50 ∼ 0.03 nM) and exhibits a significantly extended plasma half-life (>6 days) in mice relative to hEPO (∼4 h). Mice treated with the Ab-hEPO fusion protein show sustained elevated hematocrit for more than two weeks. This work demonstrates the utility of BLV1H12 CDR3 fusions as a novel approach for generating potent polypeptides with enhanced pharmacological properties.	0
Title: Rapid PCR amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes leads to a predictive familial classification model Abstract: A universal PCR method for the rapid amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and the application of this methodology to clone remaining prototypical genes from producers of structurally determined enediynes in both family types are presented. A phylogenetic analysis of the new pool of bona fide enediyne PKS genes, consisting of three from 9-membered producers (neocarzinostatin, C1027, and maduropeptin) and three from 10-membered producers (calicheamicin, dynemicin, and esperamicin), reveals a clear genotypic distinction between the two structural families from which to form a predictive model. The results from this study support the postulation that the minimal enediyne PKS helps define the structural divergence of the enediyne core and provides the key tools for generating enediyne hybrid genes/molecular scaffolds; by using the model, a classification is also provided for the unknown enediyne PKS genes previously identified via genome scanning.	1
Title: Novel features in a combined polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase: the myxalamid biosynthetic gene cluster of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca Sga15 Abstract: Background:                       Myxobacteria have been well established as a potent source for natural products with biological activity. They produce a considerable variety of compounds which represent typical polyketide structures with incorporated amino acids (e.g. the epothilons, the myxothiazols and the myxalamids). Several of these secondary metabolites are effective inhibitors of the electron transport via the respiratory chain and have been widely used. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the biosynthesis of these structures is of considerable interest, because such information adds to the limited knowledge as to how polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) interact and how they might be manipulated in order to form novel antibiotics.                  Results:                       A DNA region of approximately 50000 base pairs from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sga15 was sequenced and shown by gene disruption to be involved in myxalamid biosynthesis. Sequence analysis reveals that the myxalamids are formed by a combined PKS/NRPS system. The terminal NRPS MxaA extends the assembled polyketide chain of the myxalamids with alanine. MxaA contains an N-terminal domain with homology to NAD binding proteins, which is responsible during the biogenesis for a novel type of reductive chain release giving rise to the 2-amino-propanol moiety of the myxalamids. The last module of the PKS reveals an unprecedented genetic organization; it is encoded on two genes (mxaB1 and mxaB2), subdividing the domains of one module from each other. A sequence comparison of myxobacterial acyl-transferase domains with known systems from streptomycetes and bacilli reveals that consensus sequences proposed to be specific for methylmalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are not always reliable.                  Conclusions:                       The complete biosynthetic gene cluster of the myxalamid-type electron transport inhibitor from S. aurantiaca Sga15 has been cloned and analyzed. It represents one of the few examples of combined PKS/NRPS systems, the analysis and manipulation of which has the potential to generate novel hybrid structures via combinatorial biosynthesis (e.g. via module-swapping techniques). Additionally, a new type of reductive release from PKS/NRPS systems is described.	1
Title: The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926 by nonomuraea species Abstract: The glycopeptide A40926 is the precursor of dalbavancin, a second-generation glycopeptide currently under clinical development. The dbv gene cluster, devoted to A40926 biosynthesis, was isolated and characterized from the actinomycete Nonomuraea species ATCC39727. From sequence analysis, 37 open reading frames (ORFs) participate in A40926 biosynthesis, regulation, resistance, and export. Of these, 27 ORFs find a match in at least one of the previously characterized glycopeptide gene clusters, while 10 ORFs are, so far, unique to the dbv cluster. Putative genes could be identified responsible for some of the tailoring steps (attachment of glucosamine, sugar oxidation, and mannosylation) expected during A40926 biosynthesis. After constructing a Nonomuraea mutant by deleting dbv ORFs 8 to 10, the novel compound dechloromannosyl-A40926 aglycone was isolated.	1
Title: Noncanonical self-assembly of multifunctional DNA nanoflowers for biomedical applications Abstract: DNA nanotechnology has been extensively explored to assemble various functional nanostructures for versatile applications. Mediated by Watson-Crick base-pairing, these DNA nanostructures have been conventionally assembled through hybridization of many short DNA building blocks. Here we report the noncanonical self-assembly of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, termed as nanoflowers (NFs), and the versatile biomedical applications. These NFs were assembled from long DNA building blocks generated via rolling circle replication (RCR) of a designer template. NF assembly was driven by liquid crystallization and dense packaging of building blocks, without relying on Watson-Crick base-pairing between DNA strands, thereby avoiding the otherwise conventional complicated DNA sequence design. NF sizes were readily tunable in a wide range, by simply adjusting such parameters as assembly time and template sequences. NFs were exceptionally resistant to nuclease degradation, denaturation, or dissociation at extremely low concentration, presumably resulting from the dense DNA packaging in NFs. The exceptional biostability is critical for biomedical applications. By rational design, NFs can be readily incorporated with myriad functional moieties. All these properties make NFs promising for versatile applications. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, in this study, NFs were integrated with aptamers, bioimaging agents, and drug loading sites, and the resultant multifunctional NFs were demonstrated for selective cancer cell recognition, bioimaging, and targeted anticancer drug delivery.	0
Title: pfaB products determine the molecular species produced in bacterial polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis Abstract: When pDHA4, a vector carrying all five pfaA-pfaE genes responsible for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) biosynthesis in Moritella marina MP-1, was coexpressed in Escherichia coli with the individual pfaA-pfaD genes for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) biosynthesis from Shewanella pneumatophori SCRC-2738, both polyunsaturated fatty acids were synthesized only in the recombinant carrying pfaB for EPA synthesis. Escherichia coli coexpressing a deleted construct comprising pfaA, pfaC, pfaD and pfaE for EPA and pfaB for DHA produced EPA and DHA. Both EPA and DHA were detected in bacteria that inherently contained pfa genes for DHA. These results suggest that PfaB is the key enzyme determining the final product in EPA or DHA biosynthesis.	1
Title: Production of lipopeptides in Bacillus sp. CS93 isolated from Pozol Abstract: Bacillus sp. strain CS93, which was previously isolated from Pozol, was previously shown to produce iturin A, bacilysin and chlorotetaine. To investigate the biosynthetic mechanism of chlorotetaine production, the bac genes were amplified from genomic DNA of Bacillus sp. CS93 by PCR and sequenced. The genes bacABCDE were determined, but no gene that might code for a halogenating enzyme was detected either within the gene cluster or in the flanking sequences. Following further analysis of culture supernatants that were active against bacteria by liquid chromatography-MS, it was not possible to detect bacilysin/chlorotetaine. However, in methanolic fractions containing antibacterial activity, molecular ions characteristic of surfactins and fengycin were detectable by electrospray MS. Using primers complementary for conserved regions of nonribosomal peptide synthase, it was possible to amplify gene fragments that had a high degree of homology with known surfactin and fengycin biosynthetic genes. Thus, in addition to the known antimicrobial compounds, we have shown that this strain produces other bioactive lipopeptides, which might account for some of the medicinal properties of Pozol.	1
Title: Inhibition of erythromycin synthesis by disruption of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase gene eryM in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) decarboxylase is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the biological function of this enzyme has not been established in any organism. To elucidate the structure and function of this enzyme, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreaus) was cloned and sequenced. This gene would encode a polypeptide of 417 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence matched the experimentally determined amino acid sequences of 25 N-terminal residues each of the enzyme and of an internal peptide obtained by proteolysis of the purified enzyme. This decarboxylase showed homology with aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a single transcript. The transcription initiation site was 220 bp upstream of the start codon. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene yielded a protein that cross-reacted with antiserum prepared against S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and catalyzed decarboxylation of [3-14C]malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and 14CO2. The S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted by homologous recombination using an integrating vector pWHM3. The gene-disrupted transformant did not produce immunologically cross-reacting 45-kDa decarboxylase, lacked malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, and could not produce erythromycin. Exogenous propionate restored the ability to produce erythromycin. These results strongly suggest that the decarboxylase provides propionyl-CoA for erythromycin synthesis probably via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA derived from succinyl-CoA, and therefore the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene is designated eryM. The gene disrupted mutants also did not produce pigments.	1
Title: The genome of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 and its use for the reconstruction of metabolic pathways involved in xanthan biosynthesis Abstract: The complete genome sequence of the Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strain B100 was established. It consisted of a chromosome of 5,079,003bp, with 4471 protein-coding genes and 62 RNA genes. Comparative genomics showed that the genes required for the synthesis of xanthan and xanthan precursors were highly conserved among three sequenced X. campestris pv. campestris genomes, but differed noticeably when compared to the remaining four Xanthomonas genomes available. For the xanthan biosynthesis genes gumB and gumK earlier translational starts were proposed, while gumI and gumL turned out to be unique with no homologues beyond the Xanthomonas genomes sequenced. From the genomic data the biosynthesis pathways for the production of the exopolysaccharide xanthan could be elucidated. The first step of this process is the uptake of sugars serving as carbon and energy sources wherefore genes for 15 carbohydrate import systems could be identified. Metabolic pathways playing a role for xanthan biosynthesis could be deduced from the annotated genome. These reconstructed pathways concerned the storage and metabolization of the imported sugars. The recognized sugar utilization pathways included the Entner-Doudoroff and the pentose phosphate pathway as well as the Embden-Meyerhof pathway (glycolysis). The reconstruction indicated that the nucleotide sugar precursors for xanthan can be converted from intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway, some of which are also intermediates of glycolysis or the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Xanthan biosynthesis requires in particular the nucleotide sugars UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronate, and GDP-mannose, from which xanthan repeat units are built under the control of the gum genes. The updated genome annotation data allowed reconsidering and refining the mechanistic model for xanthan biosynthesis.	1
Title: Molecular basis of S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis in Geobacillus stearothermophilus Abstract: The Gram-positive bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a possesses a cell wall containing an oblique surface layer (S-layer) composed of glycoprotein subunits. O-Glycans with the structure [-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->](n) (= 13-18), a2-O-methyl group capping the terminal repeating unit at the nonreducing end and a -->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-[(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap](n) (= 1-2)(1-->3)- adaptor are linked via a beta-D-Galp residue to distinct sites of the S-layer protein SgsE. S-layer glycan biosynthesis is encoded by a polycistronic slg (surface layer glycosylation) gene cluster. Four assigned glycosyltransferases named WsaC-WsaF, were investigated by a combined biochemical and NMR approach, starting from synthetic octyl-linked saccharide precursors. We demonstrate that three of the enzymes are rhamnosyltransferases that are responsible for the transfer of L-rhamnose from a dTDP-beta-L-Rha precursor to the nascent S-layer glycan, catalyzing the formation of the alpha1,3- (WsaC and WsaD) and beta1,2-linkages (WsaF) present in the adaptor saccharide and in the repeating units of the mature S-layer glycan, respectively. These enzymes work in concert with a multifunctional methylrhamnosyltransferase (WsaE). The N-terminal portion of WsaE is responsible for the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reaction of the terminal alpha1,3-linked L-rhamnose residue, and the central and C-terminal portions are involved in the transfer of L-rhamnose from dTDP-beta-L-rhamnose to the adaptor saccharide to form the alpha1,2- and alpha1,3-linkages during S-layer glycan chain elongation, with the methylation and the glycosylation reactions occurring independently. Characterization of these enzymes thus reveals the complete molecular basis for S-layer glycan biosynthesis.	1
Title: Selection of Lactiplantibacillus Strains for the Production of Fermented Table Olives Abstract: Lactiplantibacillus strains (n. 77) were screened for technological properties (e.g., xylose fermentation, EPS production, antimicrobial activity, tolerance to NaCl and phenolic compounds, oleuropein degradation and hydroxytyrosol formation) relevant for the production of fermented table olives. Survival to olive mill wastewater (OMW) and to simulated gastro-intestinal tract (GIT), the capability to grow at different combinations of NaCl and pH values, radical scavenging activities and biofilm formation were further investigated in 15 selected strains. The screening step revealed high diversity among Lactiplantibacillus strains. Most of the strains were able to ferment xylose, while only a few strains produced EPS and had inhibitory activity against Y. lipolytica. Resistance to phenolic compounds (gallic, protocatechuic, hydroxybenzoic and syringic acids), as well as the ability to release hydroxytyrosol from oleuropein, was strain-specific. OMWs impaired the survival of selected strains, while combinations of NaCl ≤ 6% and pH ≥ 4.0 were well tolerated. DPPH and hydroxyl radical degradation were strain-dependent, while the capability to form biofilm was affected by incubation time. Strains were very tolerant to the GIT. The genome of Lpb. pentosus O17 was sequenced and analysed to verify the presence of genes involved in the degradation and metabolism of phenolic compounds. O17 lacks carboxylesterase and gallate decarboxylase (subunits B and D) sequences, and its gene profile differs from that of other publicly available Lpb. pentosus genomes.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells Inhibitor NFAT-133 in Streptomyces pactum Abstract: NFAT-133 is a Streptomyces-derived aromatic polyketide compound with immunosuppressive, antidiabetic, and antitrypanosomal activities. It inhibits transcription mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), leading to the suppression of interleukin-2 expression and T cell proliferation. It also activates the AMPK pathway in L6 myotubes and increases glucose uptake. In addition to NFAT-133, a number of its congeners, e.g., panowamycins and benwamycins, have been identified. However, little is known about their modes of formation in the producing organisms. Through genome sequencing of Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456, gene inactivation, and genetic complementation experiments, the biosynthetic gene cluster of NFAT-133 and its congeners has been identified. The cluster contains a highly disordered genetic organization of type I modular polyketide synthase genes with several genes that are necessary for the formation of the aromatic core unit and tailoring processes. In addition, a number of new analogs of NFAT-133 were isolated and their chemical structures elucidated. It is suggested that the heptaketide NFAT-133 is derived from an octaketide intermediate, TM-123. The current study shows yet another unusual biosynthetic pathway involving a noncanonical polyketide synthase assembly line to produce a group of small molecules with valuable bioactivities.	1
Title: The genomisotopic approach: a systematic method to isolate products of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: With the increasing number of genomes sequenced and available in the public domain, a large number of orphan gene clusters, for which the encoded natural product is unknown, have been identified. These orphan gene clusters represent a tremendous source of novel and possibly bioactive compounds. Here, we describe a "genomisotopic approach," which employs a combination of genomic sequence analysis and isotope-guided fractionation to identify unknown compounds synthesized from orphan gene clusters containing nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Analysis of the Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 genome led to the identification of an orphan gene cluster predicted to code for the biosynthesis of a lipopeptide natural product. Application of the genomisotopic approach to isolate the product of this gene cluster resulted in the discovery of orfamide A, founder of a group of bioactive cyclic lipopeptides.	1
Title: Precisely Tailoring Upconversion Dynamics via Energy Migration in Core-Shell Nanostructures Abstract: Upconversion emission dynamics have long been believed to be determined by the activator and its interaction with neighboring sensitizers. Herein this assumption is, however, shown to be invalid for nanostructures. We demonstrate that excitation energy migration greatly affects upconversion emission dynamics. "Dopant ions' spatial separation" nanostructures are designed as model systems and the intimate link between the random nature of energy migration and upconversion emission time behavior is unraveled by theoretical modelling and confirmed spectroscopically. Based on this new fundamental insight, we have successfully realized fine control of upconversion emission time behavior (either rise or decay process) by tuning the energy migration paths in various specifically designed nanostructures. This result is significant for applications of this type of materials in super resolution spectroscopy, high-density data storage, anti-counterfeiting, and biological imaging.	0
Title: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acids D, C, and B: Evolution of a Unified Synthetic Strategy Abstract: A unified synthetic strategy leading to the total synthesis of (-)-nodulisporic acids D, C, and B is described. Key synthetic transformations include a nickel-chromium-mediated cyclization, an aromatic ring functionalization employing a novel copper-promoted alkylation, a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling cascade/indole ring construction, and a palladium-mediated regio- and diastereoselective allylic substitution/cyclization reaction, the latter to construct ring D.	0
Title: Insights into the pamamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Pamamycins are macrodiolides of polyketide origin with antibacterial activities. Their biosynthesis has been proposed to utilize succinate as a building block. However, the mechanism of succinate incorporation into a polyketide was unclear. Here, we report identification of a pamamycin biosynthesis gene cluster by aligning genomes of two pamamycin-producing strains. This unique cluster contains polyketide synthase (PKS) genes encoding seven discrete ketosynthase (KS) enzymes and one acyl-carrier protein (ACP)-encoding gene. A cosmid containing the entire set of genes required for pamamycin biosynthesis was successfully expressed in a heterologous host. Genetic and biochemical studies allowed complete delineation of pamamycin biosynthesis. The pathway proceeds through 3-oxoadipyl-CoA, a key intermediate in the primary metabolism of the degradation of aromatic compounds. 3-Oxoadipyl-CoA could be used as an extender unit in polyketide assembly to facilitate the incorporation of succinate.	1
Title: Identification of potential type III secretion proteins via heterologous expression of Vibrio parahaemolyticus DNA Abstract: We employed a heterologous secretion assay to identify proteins potentially secreted by type III secretion systems (T3SSs) in Vibrio parahaemolyticus. N-terminal sequences from 32 proteins within T3SS genomic islands and seven proteins from elsewhere in the chromosome included proteins that were recognized for export by the Yersinia enterocolitica flagellar T3SS.	0
Title: Comparison of tolerance of four bacterial nanocellulose-producing strains to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors Abstract: Background:                       Through pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification lignocellulosic biomass has great potential as a low-cost feedstock for production of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a high value-added microbial product, but inhibitors formed during pretreatment remain challenging. In this study, the tolerance to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors of three new BNC-producing strains were compared to that of Komagataeibacter xylinus ATCC 23770. Inhibitors studied included furan aldehydes (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and phenolic compounds (coniferyl aldehyde and vanillin). The performance of the four strains in the presence and absence of the inhibitors was assessed using static cultures, and their capability to convert inhibitors by oxidation and reduction was analyzed.                  Results:                       Although two of the new strains were more sensitive than ATCC 23770 to furan aldehydes, one of the new strains showed superior resistance to both furan aldehydes and phenols, and also displayed high volumetric BNC yield (up to 14.78 ± 0.43 g/L) and high BNC yield on consumed sugar (0.59 ± 0.02 g/g). The inhibitors were oxidized and/or reduced by the strains to be less toxic. The four strains exhibited strong similarities with regard to predominant bioconversion products from the inhibitors, but displayed different capacity to convert the inhibitors, which may be related to the differences in inhibitor tolerance.                  Conclusions:                       This investigation provides information on different performance of four BNC-producing strains in the presence of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors. The results will be of benefit to the selection of more suitable strains for utilization of lignocellulosics in the process of BNC-production.	0
Title: Cloning and functional expression of an esterase gene in Aspergillus parasitcus Abstract: Within the 80 kb aflatoxin pathway gene cluster characterized earlier, and between adhA and norA genes, we have identified an estA gene encoding an esterase from wild type strain Aspergillus parasiticus SRRC 143. The 1,500 bp genomic DNA and 945 bp cDNA sequences were determined for estA. Outside of the aflatoxin pathway gene cluster, an additional copy of the estA gene (named estA2) was also cloned from the same A. parasiticus strain. Comparison of the estA and estA2 sequences showed 9 substitutions within the 314 amino acid residues of their gene products, and no apparent defect was identified in the estA2. The estA gene is a homolog of the stcI gene identified in A. nidulans involved in the biosynthesis of sterigmatocystin and dihydro-sterigmatocystin for the conversion of versiconal hemiacetal acetate to versiconal. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that the estA is constitutively expressed. And only this estA gene, which is located within the aflatoxin pathway gene cluster, is expressed; no expression of the estA2 gene was detected under both aflatoxin conducive and non-conducive conditions. Possible reasons for the preferential expression of the estA over the estA2 gene have been discussed.	1
Title: Dioxygenases, key enzymes to determine the aglycon structures of fusicoccin and brassicicene, diterpene compounds produced by fungi Abstract: Fusicoccin A and cotylenin A are structurally related diterpene glucosides and show a phytohormone-like activity. However, only cotylenin A induces the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Since the cotylenin A producer lost its ability to proliferate during preservation, a study on the relationship between structure and activity was carried out and a modified fusicoccin A with hydroxyl group at the 3-position showed a similar biological activity with that of cotylenin A. We then searched for an enzyme source that catalyzes the introduction of a hydroxyl group into the 3-position and found that brassicicene C, which is structurally related to fusicoccin A with hydroxyl group at the 3-position, was produced by Alternaria brassicicola ATCC96836. We recently cloned a brassicicene C biosynthetic gene cluster including the genes encoding fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene synthase and two cytochrome P450s, which were responsible for the formation of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol. In this study, we report that a α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, the gene coding for which was located in the cluster, catalyzed a hydroxylation at the 3-position of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol. On the other hand, a α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, which had been identified in a fusicoccin A biosynthetic gene cluster, catalyzed the 16-oxidation of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol to yield an aldehyde (8β-hydroxyfusicocca-1,10(14)-dien-16-al), although both dioxygenases had 51% amino acid sequence identity. These findings suggested that the dioxygenases played critical roles for the formation of the fusicoccin A-type and cotylenin A-/brassicicene C-type aglycons. Moreover, we showed that short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase located in the fusicoccin A biosynthetic gene cluster catalyzed the reduction of the aldehyde to yield fusicocca-1,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol.	1
Title: Stereochemistry and mechanism of a microbial phenylalanine aminomutase Abstract: The stereochemistry of a phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) on the andrimid biosynthetic pathway in Pantoea agglomerans (Pa) is reported. PaPAM is a member of the 4-methylidene-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one (MIO)-dependent family of catalysts and isomerizes (2S)-α-phenylalanine to (3S)-β-phenylalanine, which is the enantiomer of the product made by the mechanistically similar aminomutase TcPAM from Taxus plants. The NH(2) and pro-(3S) hydrogen groups at C(α) and C(β), respectively, of the substrate are removed and interchanged completely intramolecularly with inversion of configuration at the migration centers to form β-phenylalanine. This is a contrast to the retention of configuration mechanism followed by TcPAM.	1
Title: A desaturase gene involved in the formation of 1,14-nonadecadiene in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 Abstract: The marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 synthesizes two alkenes, 1-nonadecene and 1,14-nonadecadiene. Whereas the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the terminal double bond in both alkenes has been characterized, the origin of the internal double bond in 1,14-nonadecadiene has not. In this study, we demonstrate that a gene encoding an uncharacterized desaturase is involved in the formation of the internal double bond of 1,14-nonadecadiene. Further, at low temperatures, the desaturase gene is essential for growth, and in wild-type cells the levels of 1,14-nonadecadiene increase relative to that of cells grown at 38°C. These data suggest that 1,14-nonadecadiene plays a role in responding to cold stress.	1
Title: Enhancement of expression and apparent secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) in Escherichia coli B Abstract: Escherichia coli B has been engineered as a biocatalyst for the conversion of lignocellulose into ethanol. Previous research has demonstrated that derivatives of E. coli B can produce high levels of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) as a periplasmic product and that this enzyme can function with commercial fungal cellulase to increase ethanol production. In this study, we have demonstrated two methods that improve celZ expression in E. coli B. Initially, with a low-copy-number vector, two E. coli glycolytic gene promoters (gap and eno) were tested and found to be less effective than the original celZ promoter. By screening 18,000 random fragments of Zymomonas mobilis DNA, a surrogate promoter was identified which increased celZ expression up to sixfold. With this promoter, large polar inclusion bodies were clearly evident in the periplasmic space. Sequencing revealed that the most active surrogate promoter is derived from five Sau3A1 fragments, one of which was previously sequenced in Z. mobilis. Visual inspection indicated that this DNA fragment contains at least five putative promoter regions, two of which were confirmed by primer extension analysis. Addition of the out genes from E. chrysanthemi EC16 caused a further increase in the production of active enzyme and facilitated secretion or release of over half of the activity into the extracellular environment. With the most active construct, of a total of 13,000 IU of active enzyme per liter of culture, 7,800 IU was in the supernatant. The total active endoglucanase was estimated to represent 4 to 6% of cellular protein.	0
Title: Isolation and structure determination of a new cytotoxic peptide, curacozole, from Streptomyces curacoi based on genome mining Abstract: Using genome mining, a new cytotoxic peptide named curacozole was isolated from Streptomyces curacoi. Through ESI-MS and NMR analyses, curacozole was determined to be a macrocyclic peptide containing two isoleucine, two thiazole and three oxazole moieties. Curacozole exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against HCT116 and HOS cancer cells. The proposed biosynthetic gene cluster of curacozole was identified and compared with that of the related compound YM-216391.	1
Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies on the putative dTDP sugar epimerase NovW from the novobiocin biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovW (subunit MW = 22 289 Da), a putative dTDP sugar epimerase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallizes in space group P4(3)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 59.20, c = 109.23 A. Native data to a resolution of 2.0 A were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on a rotating-anode X-ray generator. Preliminary analysis of these data indicated that the asymmetric unit corresponded to a monomer, whilst dynamic light scattering (DLS) suggested that NovW was a dimer in solution. NovW is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin, which targets the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, and represents the first enzyme to be crystallized from this biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Total synthesis of herboxidiene/GEX 1A Abstract: A convergent enantioselective synthesis of herboxidiene/GEX 1A (1) is described that features a double stereodifferentiating crotylation, [4 + 2] annulation, and a silicon-based sp2-sp2 cross-coupling to assemble the conjugated diene.	0
Title: Progress toward Eukaryotic Semisynthetic Organisms: Translation of Unnatural Codons Abstract: We have created a bacterial semisynthetic organism (SSO) that retains an unnatural base pair (UBP) in its DNA, transcribes it into mRNA and tRNA with cognate unnatural codons and anticodons, and after the tRNA is charged with a noncanonical amino acid synthesizes proteins containing the noncanonical amino acid. Here, we report the first progress toward the creation of eukaryotic SSOs. After demonstrating proof-of-concept with human HEK293 cells, we show that a variety of different unnatural codon-anticodon pairs can efficiently mediate the synthesis of unnatural proteins in CHO cells. Interestingly, we find that there are both similarities and significant differences between how the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes recognize the UBP, with the eukaryotic ribosome appearing more tolerant. The results represent the first progress toward eukaryotic SSOs and, in fact, suggest that such SSOs might be able to retain more unnatural information than their bacterial counterparts.	0
Title: Protein kinase Ime2 is associated with mycelial growth, conidiation, osmoregulation, and pathogenicity in Fusarium oxysporum Abstract: Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. niveum is one of the most serious diseases impairing watermelon yield and quality. Inducer of meiosis 2 (Ime2) is the founding member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays important roles in yeasts and other filamentous fungi. In this study, we analyzed the functions of FoIme2, the ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ime2 in F. oxysporum f.sp. niveum. The FoIme2-deleted mutants exhibited obvious morphological abnormalities, including slower vegetative growth, more branches in the edge hyphae and a reduction in conidia production. Compared to the wild type, the mutants were hypersensitive to the osmotic stressor NaCl but were more insensitive to the membrane stressor SDS. The deletion of FoIme2 also caused a reduction in pathogenicity. Transcriptional analysis revealed that FoIme2 acts downstream of FoOpy2 which is an upstream sensor of the MAPK kinase cascade. These results indicate that FoIme2 is important in the development and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum, and provide new insight for the analysis of the pathogenic mechanism of F. oxysporum.	0
Title: Accessing Multiple Classes of 2 H-Indazoles: Mechanistic Implications for the Cadogan and Davis-Beirut Reactions Abstract: The Cadogan cyclization is a robust but harsh method for the synthesis of 2 H-indazoles, a valuable class of nitrogen heterocycles. Although nitrene generation by exhaustive deoxygenation is widely accepted as the operating mechanism in the reductive cyclization of nitroaromatics, non-nitrene pathways have only been theorized previously. Here, 2 H-indazole N-oxides were synthesized through an interrupted Cadogan/Davis-Beirut reaction and are presented as direct evidence of competent oxygenated intermediates; mechanistic implications for both reactions are discussed. Isolation and characterization of these N-oxides enabled a formal Cadogan cyclization at room temperature for 2 H-indazole synthesis.	0
Title: Host-dependent heterologous expression of berninamycin gene cluster leads to linear thiopeptide antibiotics Abstract: Berninamycins are a class of thiopeptide antibiotics with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Heterologous expression of the berninamycin (ber) biosynthetic gene cluster from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 11878 in different terrestrial model Streptomyces hosts led to the production of berninamycins A (1) and B (2) in Streptomyces lividans SBT18 and Streptomyces coelicolor M1154, while two new linearized berninamycins J (3) and K (4) were obtained in Streptomyces albus J1074. Their structures were elucidated by detailed interpretation of NMR data and Marfey's method. Bioactivity assays showed that the linear thiopeptides 3 and 4 were less potent than 1 and 2 in antibacterial activity. This work indicates that undefined host-dependent enzymes might be responsible for generating the linear thiopeptides 3 and 4 in S. albus J1074.	1
Title: Genetic variation of adenylation domains of the anabaenopeptin synthesis operon and evolution of substrate promiscuity Abstract: Anabaenopeptins (AP) are bioactive cyclic hexapeptides synthesized nonribosomally in cyanobacteria. APs are characterized by several conserved motifs, including the ureido bond, N-methylation in position 5, and d-Lys in position 2. All other positions of the AP molecule are variable, resulting in numerous structural variants. We have identified a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) operon from Planktothrix agardhii strain CYA126/8 consisting of five genes (apnA to apnE) encoding six NRPS modules and have confirmed its role in AP synthesis by the generation of a mutant via insertional inactivation of apnC. In order to correlate the genetic diversity among adenylation domains (A domains) with AP structure variation, we sequenced the A domains of all six NRPS modules from seven Planktothrix strains differing in the production of AP congeners. It is remarkable that single strains coproduce APs bearing either of the chemically divergent amino acids Arg and Tyr in exocyclic position 1. Since the A domain of the initiation module (the ApnA A₁ domain) has been proposed to activate the amino acid incorporated into exocyclic position 1, we decided to analyze this domain both biochemically and phylogenetically. Only ApnA A₁ enzymes from strains producing AP molecules containing Arg or Tyr in position 1 were found to activate these two chemically divergent amino acids in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of apn A domain sequences revealed that strains with a promiscuous ApnA A₁ domain are derived from an ancestor that activates only Arg. Surprisingly, positive selection appears to affect only three codons within the apnA A₁ gene, suggesting that this remarkable promiscuity has evolved from point mutations only.	1
Title: Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of coxsackievirus replication Abstract: No antiviral drugs currently exist for the treatment of enterovirus infections, which are often severe and potentially life threatening. Molecular screening of small molecule libraries identified fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as a potent inhibitor of coxsackievirus replication. Fluoxetine did not interfere with either viral entry or translation of the viral genome. Instead, fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine markedly reduced the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. In view of its favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile, fluoxetine warrants additional study as a potential antiviral agent for enterovirus infections.	0
Title: Identification of the perosamine synthetase gene of Brucella melitensis 16M and involvement of lipopolysaccharide O side chain in Brucella survival in mice and in macrophages Abstract: Brucella organisms are facultative intracellular bacteria that may infect many species of animals as well as humans. The smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) has been reported to be an important virulence factor of these organisms, but the genetic basis of expression of the S-LPS O antigen has not yet been described. Likewise, the role of the O side chain of S-LPS in the survival of Brucella has not been clearly defined. A mini-Tn5 transposon mutant library of Brucella melitensis 16M was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the O side chain of Brucella. One mutant, designated B3B2, failed to express any O side chain as confirmed by ELISA, Western blot analysis, and colony coloration with crystal violet. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the transposon disrupted an open reading frame with significant homology to the putative perosamine synthetase genes of Vibrio cholerae O1 and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The low G+C content of this DNA region suggests that this gene may have originated from a species other than a Brucella sp. The survival of B. melitensis mutant strain B3B2 in the mouse model and in bovine macrophages was examined. The results suggested that S-LPS or, more precisely, its O side chain is essential for survival in mice but not in macrophages.	1
Title: Molecular genetic characterization of terreic acid pathway in Aspergillus terreus Abstract: Terreic acid is a natural product derived from 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA). A compact gene cluster for its biosynthesis was characterized. Isolation of the intermediates and shunt products from the mutant strains, combined with bioinformatic analyses, allowed for the proposition of a biosynthetic pathway for terreic acid.	1
Title: Promysalin, a salicylate-containing Pseudomonas putida antibiotic, promotes surface colonization and selectively targets other Pseudomonas Abstract: Under control of the Gac regulatory system, Pseudomonas putida RW10S1 produces promysalin to promote its own swarming and biofilm formation, and to selectively inhibit many other pseudomonads, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This amphipathic antibiotic is composed of salicylic acid and 2,8-dihydroxymyristamide bridged by a unique 2-pyrroline-5-carboxyl moiety. In addition to enzymes for salicylic acid synthesis and activation, the biosynthetic gene cluster encodes divergent type II fatty acid biosynthesis components, unusual fatty acid-tailoring enzymes (two Rieske-type oxygenases and an amidotransferase), an enzyme resembling a proline-loading module of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and the first prokaryotic member of the BAHD family of plant acyltransferases. Identification of biosynthetic intermediates enabled to propose a pathway for synthesis of this bacterial colonization factor.	1
Title: Comparative genome mining and heterologous expression of an orphan NRPS gene cluster direct the production of ashimides Abstract: The ever-increasing bacterial genomic repositories reveal a great number of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, representing a tremendous resource for natural product discovery. Genome mining of the marine Streptomyces sp. NA03103 indicates the presence of an orphan nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster (asm), to which there are no homologous gene clusters in the public genome databases. Heterologous expression of the asm gene cluster in the S. lividans SBT18 strain led to the discovery of two novel cyclopeptides, ashimides A and B (1 and 2), with 2 showing cytotoxic activity. In addition, we use bioinformatic analysis, gene inactivation and stable isotope labelling experiments, as well as in vitro biochemical assays, to present a coherent and novel assembly line for ashimide biosynthesis, featuring an unusual desaturation, halogenation and cyclization cascade catalyzed by a P450 monooxygenase and a FAD-dependent halogenase.	1
Title: Facile transfer of [2Fe-2S] clusters from the diabetes drug target mitoNEET to an apo-acceptor protein Abstract: MitoNEET (mNT) is an outer mitochondrial membrane target of the thiazolidinedione diabetes drugs with a unique fold and a labile [2Fe-2S] cluster. The rare 1-His and 3-Cys coordination of mNT's [2Fe-2S] leads to cluster lability that is strongly dependent on the presence of the single histidine ligand (His87). These properties of mNT are similar to known [2Fe-2S] shuttle proteins. Here we investigated whether mNT is capable of cluster transfer to acceptor protein(s). Facile [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer is observed between oxidized mNT and apo-ferredoxin (a-Fd) using UV-VIS spectroscopy and native-PAGE, as well as with a mitochondrial iron detection assay in cells. The transfer is unidirectional, proceeds to completion, and occurs with a second-order-reaction rate that is comparable to known iron-sulfur transfer proteins. Mutagenesis of His87 with Cys (H87C) inhibits transfer of the [2Fe-2S] clusters to a-Fd. This inhibition is beyond that expected from increased cluster kinetic stability, as the equivalently stable Lys55 to Glu (K55E) mutation did not inhibit transfer. The H87C mutant also failed to transfer its iron to mitochondria in HEK293 cells. The diabetes drug pioglitazone inhibits iron transfer from WT mNT to mitochondria, indicating that pioglitazone affects a specific property, [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer, in the cellular environment. This finding is interesting in light of the role of iron overload in diabetes. Our findings suggest a likely role for mNT in [2Fe-2S] and/or iron transfer to acceptor proteins and support the idea that pioglitazone's antidiabetic mode of action may, in part, be to inhibit transfer of mNT's [2Fe-2S] cluster.	0
Title: Functional dissection of a multimodular polypeptide of the pikromycin polyketide synthase into monomodules by using a matched pair of heterologous docking domains Abstract: The pikromyin polyketide synthase (PKS) in Streptomyces venezulae is comprised of a loading module and six extension modules, which generate the corresponding 14-membered macrolactone product. PikAI is a multimodular component of this PKS and houses both the loading domain and the first two extension modules, joined by short intraprotein linkers. We have shown that PikAI can be separated into two proteins at either of these linkers, only when matched pairs of docking domains (DDs) from a heterologous modular phoslactomycin PKS are used in place of the intraprotein linker. In both cases the yields of pikromycin produced by the S. venezuelae mutant were 50% of that of a S. venezuelae strain expressing the native trimodular PikAI. This observation provides the first demonstration that such separations do not dramatically impact the efficiency of the entire in vivo biosynthetic process. Expression of module 2 as a monomodular protein fused to a heterologous N-terminal docking domain was also observed to give almost a tenfold improvement in the in vivo generation of pikromycin from a synthetic diketide intermediate. These results demonstrate the utility of DDs to manipulate biosynthetic processes catalyzed by modular PKSs and the quest to generate novel polyketide products.	0
Title: The acarbose-biosynthetic enzyme AcbO from Actinoplanes sp. SE 50/110 is a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate 2-epimerase Abstract: The C7-cyclitol 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is the first precursor of the cyclitol moiety of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose in Actinoplanes sp. SE50. The 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone becomes phosphorylated at C7 by the ATP dependent kinase AcbM prior to the next modifications. Preliminary data gave evidences that the AcbO protein could catalyse the first modification step of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. Therefore, the AcbO protein, the encoding gene of which is also part of the acbKMLNOC operon, was overproduced and purified. Indeed the purified protein catalysed the 2-epimerisation of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. The chemical structure of the purified reaction product was proven by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be 5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate.	1
Title: Diversity of Polyketide Chains Achieved by Deleting the Tailoring Genes in the Biosynthesis of Ansatrienins Abstract: The ast gene cluster (GenBank accession numbers KF813023.1 and KP284551) was characterized to be responsible for the biosynthesis of ansatrienins in Streptomyces sp. XZQH13, which contains astC, astF1, and astF2 genes involved in the assembly of the N-cyclohexanoyl d-alanyl side chain and the hydroxylation of C-19, respectively. Further to investigating the biosynthetic mechanism of ansatrienins, herein we constructed the mutant strains XZQH13OEΔastF2 and XZQH13OEΔastCΔastF2. Three new ansatrienin analogues, namely, ansatrienols I-K (1-3), along with trienomycinol (4) and 3-O-demethyltrienomycinol (5), were isolated from the XZQH13OEΔastCΔastF2 strain, and trienomycin A (6) and trienomycin G (7) were isolated from the XZQH13OEΔastF2 strain. Their structures were determined by a combination of high-resolution MS (ESI) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Accordingly, a pathway for the biosynthesis of these new ansatrienins was proposed.	1
Title: The Nocardia cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 genome shows ongoing adaptation of an environmental Actinobacteria to a pathogen's lifestyle Abstract: Background:                       Nocardia cyriacigeorgica is recognized as one of the most prevalent etiological agents of human nocardiosis. Human exposure to these Actinobacteria stems from direct contact with contaminated environmental matrices. The full genome sequence of N. cyriacigeorgica strain GUH-2 was studied to infer major trends in its evolution, including the acquisition of novel genetic elements that could explain its ability to thrive in multiple habitats.                  Results:                       N. cyriacigeorgica strain GUH-2 genome size is 6.19 Mb-long, 82.7% of its CDS have homologs in at least another actinobacterial genome, and 74.5% of these are found in N. farcinica. Among N. cyriacigeorgica specific CDS, some are likely implicated in niche specialization such as those involved in denitrification and RuBisCO production, and are found in regions of genomic plasticity (RGP). Overall, 22 RGP were identified in this genome, representing 11.4% of its content. Some of these RGP encode a recombinase and IS elements which are indicative of genomic instability. CDS playing part in virulence were identified in this genome such as those involved in mammalian cell entry or encoding a superoxide dismutase. CDS encoding non ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) were identified, with some being likely involved in the synthesis of siderophores and toxins. COG analyses showed this genome to have an organization similar to environmental Actinobacteria.                  Conclusion:                       N. cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 genome shows features suggesting a diversification from an ancestral saprophytic state. GUH-2 ability at acquiring foreign DNA was found significant and to have led to functional changes likely beneficial for its environmental cycle and opportunistic colonization of a human host.	0
Title: Characterization of FdmV as an amide synthetase for fredericamycin A biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus ATCC 43944 Abstract: Fredericamycin (FDM) A is a pentadecaketide natural product that features an amide linkage. Analysis of the fdm cluster from Streptomyces griseus ATCC 43944, however, failed to reveal genes encoding the types of amide synthetases commonly seen in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro characterizations of FdmV, an asparagine synthetase (AS) B-like protein, as an amide synthetase that catalyzes the amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis. This is supported by the findings that (i) inactivation of fdmV in vivo afforded the ΔfdmV mutant strain SB4027 that abolished FDM A and FDM E production but accumulated FDM C, a biosynthetic intermediate devoid of the characteristic amide linkage; (ii) FdmV in vitro catalyzes conversion of FDM C to FDM B, a known intermediate for FDM A biosynthesis (apparent K(m) = 162 ± 67 μM and k(cat) = 0.11 ± 0.02 min(-1)); and (iii) FdmV also catalyzes the amidation of FDM M-3, a structural analog of FDM C, to afford amide FDM M-6 in vitro, albeit at significantly reduced efficiency. Preliminary enzymatic studies revealed that, in addition to the common nitrogen sources (L-Gln and free amine) of class II glutamine amidotransferases (to which AS B belongs), FdmV can also utilize L-Asn as a nitrogen donor. The amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis is proposed to occur after C-8 hydroxylation but before the carbaspirocycle formation.	1
Title: Structure and deduced function of the granaticin-producing polyketide synthase gene cluster of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22 Abstract: A 6.5 kb region of DNA from Streptomyces violaceoruber, which contains polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for production of the benzoisochromane quinone moiety of the antibiotic, granaticin, was cloned and sequenced. Of six open reading frames (ORFs) identified, four (ORFs 1-4) would be transcribed in one direction and two (ORFs 5 and 6) divergently from ORFs 1-4. ORF1 and ORF2, which show evidence for translation coupling, encode (deduced) gene products which strongly resemble each other and the Escherichia coli fatty acid ketoacyl synthase (condensing enzyme), FabB. We conclude that ORF1 (which contains a characteristic cysteine residue) functions as a condensing enzyme, possibly as part of a heterodimeric protein including the product of ORF2. The predicted ORF3 gene product strikingly resembles acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid synthase (FAS), particularly in the region of the active site motif, while the predicted ORF5 and ORF6 gene products resemble known oxidoreductases, suggesting that they function as reductive steps required during assembly of the granaticin carbon skeleton. Comparison of the deduced ORF4 gene product with available protein databases failed to elucidate its potential function. The overall conclusion is that the granaticin-producing PKS would consist of at least six separate enzymes involved in carbon chain assembly, thus resembling a Type II, rather than a Type I, FAS.	1
Title: Clinical response and tolerability to and safety of saquinavir with low-dose ritonavir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected mothers and their infants Abstract: Saquinavir boosted with low-dose ritonavir given with zidovudine and lamivudine was well tolerated by pregnant women and their infants. All mothers had <400 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA copies/ml at delivery. Two had elevated liver transaminases and amylase. Seven infant adverse events were possibly treatment related (anemia, neutropenia, and hyperbilirubinemia).	0
Title: Vertical transmission of highly similar bla CTX-M-1-harboring IncI1 plasmids in Escherichia coli with different MLST types in the poultry production pyramid Abstract: Objectives:                       The purpose of this study was to characterize sets of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected longitudinally from different flocks of broiler breeders, meconium of 1-day-old broilers from theses breeder flocks, as well as from these broiler flocks before slaughter.                  Methods:                       Five sets of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli were studied by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), phylogenetic grouping, PCR-based replicon typing and resistance profiling. The bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids of one set (pHV295.1, pHV114.1, and pHV292.1) were fully sequenced and subjected to comparative analysis.                  Results:                       Eleven different MLST sequence types (ST) were identified with ST1056 the predominant one, isolated in all five sets either on the broiler breeder or meconium level. Plasmid sequencing revealed that bla CTX-M-1 was carried by highly similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids that were 105 076 bp, 110 997 bp, and 117 269 bp in size, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The fact that genetically similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids were found in ESBL-producing E. coli of different MLST types isolated at the different levels in the broiler production pyramid provides strong evidence for a vertical transmission of these plasmids from a common source (nucleus poultry flocks).	0
Title: Genome sequence of the marine bacterium Vibrio campbellii DS40M4, isolated from open ocean water Abstract: Vibrio sp. strain DS40M4 is a marine bacterium that was isolated from open ocean water. In this work, using genomic taxonomy, we were able to classify this bacterium as V. campbellii. Our genomic analysis revealed that V. campbellii DS40M4 harbors genes related to iron transport, virulence, and environmental fitness, such as those encoding anguibactin and vanchrobactin biosynthesis proteins, type II, III, IV, and VI secretion systems, and proteorhodopsin.	1
Title: Expression of the eicosapentaenoic acid synthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. in a transgenic marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp Abstract: The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) synthesis gene cluster isolated from a marine bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens strain SCRC-2738, was cloned and expressed in the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. A broad-host-range cosmid vector, pJRD215 (10.2 kb, Smr Kmr), was used to clone a 38 kb insert, pEPA, containing the EPA synthesis gene cluster, creating plasmid pJRDEPA (approx. 48 kb). This plasmid was transferred to the cyanobacterial host at a frequency of 2.2 x 10(-7). Cyanobacterial transconjugants grown at 29 degrees C produced 0.12 mg EPA (g dry weight)-1, whereas those grown at 23 degrees C produced 0.56 mg EPA (g dry weight)-1. The yield was further improved to 0.64 mg (g dry weight)-1 by incubation for 1 d at 17 degrees C. This is believed to be the first successful cloning and expression of such a large heterologous gene cluster in a marine cyanobacterium.	1
Title: Microbial conversion of anthracyclinones to daunomycin by blocked mutants of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus Abstract: Baumycin-negative mutants of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ME130-A4 do not convert daunomycinone to daunomycin and baumycins. They biosynthesize daunomycin from aklavinone and epsilon-rhodomycinone, indicating the glycosidation of the aglycone before the synthesis of daunomycinone. The biosynthetic pathway from epsilon-rhodomycinone to daunomycin was further confirmed by studying the bioconversion of anthracyclinones and anthracyclines, which are presumed to be intermediates.	0
Title: Biogenesis of Yersinia pestis PsaA in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine (RASV) strain Abstract: Yersinia pestis PsaA is an adhesin important for the establishment of bacterial infection. PsaA synthesis requires the products of the psaEFABC genes. Here, by prediction analysis, we identified a PsaA signal sequence with two signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage sites, type-I and type-II (SPase-I and SPase-II). By Edman degradation and site-directed mutagenesis, the precise site for one of these Spase-I PsaA cleavage sites was located between alanine and serine at positions 31 and 32, respectively. Yersinia pestis psaA expression and the role of the PsaB and PsaC proteins were evaluated in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains. PsaA was detected in total extracts as a major 15-kDa (mature) and 18-kDa (unprocessed) protein bands. PsaA synthesis was not altered by a DeltaA31-DeltaS32 double-deletion mutation. In contrast, the synthesis of PsaA (DeltaA31-DeltaS32) in Y. pestis and delivery to the supernatant was decreased. Otherwise, substitution of the amino acid cysteine at position 26 by valine involved in the SPase-II cleavage site did not show any effect on the secretion of PsaA in Salmonella and Yersinia. These results help clarify the secretion pathway of PsaA for the possible development of vaccines against Y. pestis.	0
Title: Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli dnaK replication protein Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaK+ gene was cloned into the "runaway" plasmid vector pMOB45 resulting in a large overproduction of the dnaK protein. The dnaK protein was purified by following its ability to complement the replication of single-stranded M13 bacteriophage DNA in a reaction system dependent on the presence of the lambda O and P DNA replication proteins. The DNA replication activity of the dnaK protein is also essential for lambda dv DNA replication in vitro, since antibodies against it were shown to inhibit the reaction. Purified dnaK protein preparations possess a weak ATPase activity and an autophosphorylating activity which copurify with its DNA replication activity throughout all purification steps. The dnaK protein is an acidic largely monomeric protein of Mr = 72,000 and 78,400 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively. The amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence match those predicted from the DNA sequence of the dnaK gene (Bardwell, J.C.A., and Craig, E. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 848-852).	0
Title: Metabolic Responses of Bacterial Cells to Immobilization Abstract: In recent years immobilized cells have commonly been used for various biotechnological applications, e.g., antibiotic production, soil bioremediation, biodegradation and biotransformation of xenobiotics in wastewater treatment plants. Although the literature data on the physiological changes and behaviour of cells in the immobilized state remain fragmentary, it is well documented that in natural settings microorganisms are mainly found in association with surfaces, which results in biofilm formation. Biofilms are characterized by genetic and physiological heterogeneity and the occurrence of altered microenvironments within the matrix. Microbial cells in communities display a variety of metabolic differences as compared to their free-living counterparts. Immobilization of bacteria can occur either as a natural phenomenon or as an artificial process. The majority of changes observed in immobilized cells result from protection provided by the supports. Knowledge about the main physiological responses occurring in immobilized cells may contribute to improving the efficiency of immobilization techniques. This paper reviews the main metabolic changes exhibited by immobilized bacterial cells, including growth rate, biodegradation capabilities, biocatalytic efficiency and plasmid stability.	0
Title: Regulation of penicillinase synthesis: a mutation in Staphylococcus aureus unlinked to the penicillinase plasmid that reduced penicillinase inducibility Abstract: A mutant of Staphylococcus aureus strain 655 was isolated that is restricted in penicillinase induction. Wild-type plasmids that bear penicillinase determinants could not be fully induced in this mutant, 655par-1; hence, the responsible mutation is not located on the plasmid. Mutant plasmid PI(258)penI443, which produces penicillinase constitutively in wild-type cells, was fully constitutive for penicillinase production when it was harbored by mutant 655par-1. Therefore, the bacterial mutation does not interfere directly with the transcription of the penZ gene or translation of the penicillinase messenger ribonucleic acid. Mutant plasmid PII(147)penI220 was fully inducible in the mutant bacterium, even though the wild-type plasmid PII(147) was only partially inducible in the par-1 mutant. Thus, in the presence of inducer, complementation appears to occur between the product of the par-1 gene and the product of the penI220 gene. These results suggest that the par-1 gene codes for a penicillinase antire-pressor.	0

Title: New alpha-amylase inhibitor, trestatins. I. Isolation, characterization and biological activities of trestatins A, B and C Abstract: Trestatin complex which exhibited a potent inhibitory activity on various alpha-amylases has been isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces dimorphogenes nov. sp. NR-320-OM7HB. Three major components, trestatins A, B and C, have been purified by adsorption and ion-exchange chromatography. Their spectral and chemical properties suggested that trestatins were novel basic oligosaccharide homologues each characterized by the possession of a trehalose moiety at the non-reducing end of the molecule.	0
Title: Cloning of a Vibrio cholerae vibriobactin gene cluster: identification of genes required for early steps in siderophore biosynthesis Abstract: Vibrio cholerae secretes the catechol siderophore vibriobactin in response to iron limitation. Vibriobactin is structurally similar to enterobactin, the siderophore produced by Escherichia coli, and both organisms produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) as an intermediate in siderophore biosynthesis. To isolate and characterize V. cholerae genes involved in vibriobactin biosynthesis, we constructed a genomic cosmid bank of V. cholerae DNA and isolated clones that complemented mutations in E. coli enterobactin biosynthesis genes. V. cholerae homologs of entA, entB, entC, entD, and entE were identified on overlapping cosmid clones. Our data indicate that the vibriobactin genes are clustered, like the E. coli enterobactin genes, but the organization of the genes within these clusters is different. In this paper, we present the organization and sequences of genes involved in the synthesis and activation of DHBA. In addition, a V. cholerae strain with a chromosomal mutation in vibA was constructed by marker exchange. This strain was unable to produce vibriobactin or DHBA, confirming that in V. cholerae VibA catalyzes an early step in vibriobactin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of the eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. BR-2 Abstract: Forty-four eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-producing microbial strains were isolated from the intestines of marine fishes. Among them, one strain showing a maximum level of EPA (4.78%of total fatty acids) was identified as Shewanella sp. BR-2 on the basis of its 16S rRNA sequence. The EPA content reached a maximum level during the mid-exponential phase of cell growth, and gradually decreased with further growth of the cells. A cosmid DNA including the EPA biosynthesis gene cluster consisting of pfaA-E was isolated from a cosmid library of genomic DNA of Shewanella sp. BR-2, named pCosEPA-BR2. An E. coli clone harboring pCosEPA-BR2 produced EPA at a maximum level of 7.5%of total fatty acids, confirming the EPA biosynthesis activity of the cloned gene cluster.	1
Title: Clostridiolysin S, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from Clostridium botulinum Abstract: Through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, Clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. Using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in C. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen Clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin S, a key virulence factor from group A Streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. Genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin S-like gene cluster from Clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin S.	1
Title: In vitro reconstitution and crystal structure of p-aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) involved in aureothin biosynthesis Abstract: p-Aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) from Streptomyces thioluteus catalyzes the formation of unusual polyketide synthase starter unit p-nitrobenzoic acid (pNBA) from p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in the biosynthesis of antibiotic aureothin. AurF is a metalloenzyme, but its native enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated in vitro, and its catalytic mechanism is unclear. In addition, the nature of the cofactor remains a controversy. Here, we report the in vitro reconstitution of the AurF enzyme activity, the crystal structure of AurF in the oxidized state, and the cocrystal structure of AurF with its product pNBA. Our combined biochemical and structural analysis unequivocally indicates that AurF is a non-heme di-iron monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential oxidation of aminoarenes to nitroarenes via hydroxylamine and nitroso intermediates.	1
Title: A one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis for the universal precursor of antidiabetes and antiviral bis-indolylquinones Abstract: Bis-indolylquinones represent a class of fungal natural products that display antiretroviral, antidiabetes, or cytotoxic bioactivities. Recent advances in Aspergillus genomic mining efforts have led to the discovery of the tdiA-E-gene cluster, which is the first genetic locus dedicated to bis-indolylquinone biosynthesis. We have now genetically and biochemically characterized the enzymes TdiA (bis-indolylquinone synthetase) and TdiD (L-tryptophan:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase), which, together, confer biosynthetic abilities for didemethylasterriquinone D to Aspergillus nidulans. This compound is the universal intermediate for all bis-indolylquinones. In this biochemical study of a bis-indolylquinone synthetase and a fungal natural product transaminase, we present a one-pot chemoenzymatic protocol to generate didemethylasterriquinone D in vitro. As TdiA resembles a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, yet catalyzes carbon-carbon-bond formation, we discuss the implications for peptide synthetase chemistry.	1
Title: Transcription of the sex-determining region genes Sry and Zfy in the mouse preimplantation embryo Abstract: We have confirmed the faster growth of male preimplantation mouse embryos. We have also studied the transcription of Y chromosomal genes postulated to have a role in sex determination, using the highly sensitive technique of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction at these early stages. We find that two sex-determining region genes, Sry and Zfy, are transcribed during mouse preimplantation development, while the Zfy homologs Zfx and Zfa and a sex-determining region gene originally called A1s9 (now called Ube1y-1) are not. We also show that the anti-Müllerian hormone gene, which contains a Sry consensus binding element in its 5' promoter region, is not transcribed at this time. Developmental curves show that Sry and Zfy are expressed commencing at the two-cell stage. These results suggest that mammalian sex determination starts prior to gonad differentiation.	0
Title: Histone-catalyzed cleavage of nucleosomal DNA containing 2-deoxyribonolactone Abstract: Oxidized abasic sites such as 2-deoxyribonolactone (L) are produced in DNA by a variety of oxidizing agents, including potent cytotoxic antitumor natural products. 2-Deoxyribonolactone is labile under alkaline conditions, but its half-life in free DNA at pH 7.5 is approximately 1 week. Independent generation of L at defined positions within nucleosomes reveals that the histone proteins catalyze strand scission and increase the rate between 11- and ∼43-fold. Mechanistic studies indicate that DNA-protein cross-links are not intermediates en route to strand scission and that C2 deprotonation is the rate-determining step. The use of mutant histone H4 proteins demonstrates that the lysine-rich tail that is often post-translationally modified in cells contributes to the cleavage of L but is not the sole source of the enhanced cleavage rates. Consideration of DNA repair in cells suggests that L formation in nucleosomal DNA as part of bistranded lesions by antitumor antibiotics results in de facto double strand breaks, the most deleterious form of DNA damage.	0
Title: Structural disorder in expanding the functionome of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases Abstract: Over the past decade, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) have emerged as a new class of regulatory proteins with widespread functions beyond their classic role in protein synthesis. The functional expansion concurs with the incorporation of new domains and motifs to AARSs and coincides with the emergence of the multi-synthetase complex (MSC) during the course of eukaryotic evolution. Notably, the new domains in AARSs are often found to be structurally disordered or to be linked to the enzyme cores via unstructured linkers. We performed bioinformatic analysis and classified the 20 human cytoplasmic AARSs into three groups based on their propensities for structural disorder. The analysis also suggests that, while the assembly of the MSC mainly involves ordered structural domains, structurally disordered regions play an important role in activating and expanding the regulatory functions of AARSs.	0
Title: Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1 from a dump of roasted pyrites can be exploited as bacterial catalyst for the biogenesis of selenium and tellurium nanoparticles Abstract: Background:                       Bacteria have developed different mechanisms for the transformation of metalloid oxyanions to non-toxic chemical forms. A number of bacterial isolates so far obtained in axenic culture has shown the ability to bioreduce selenite and tellurite to the elemental state in different conditions along with the formation of nanoparticles-both inside and outside the cells-characterized by a variety of morphological features. This reductive process can be considered of major importance for two reasons: firstly, toxic and soluble (i.e. bioavailable) compounds such as selenite and tellurite are converted to a less toxic chemical forms (i.e. zero valent state); secondly, chalcogen nanoparticles have attracted great interest due to their photoelectric and semiconducting properties. In addition, their exploitation as antimicrobial agents is currently becoming an area of intensive research in medical sciences.                  Results:                       In the present study, the bacterial strain Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1, isolated from a dump of roasted arsenopyrites as residues of a formerly sulfuric acid production near Scarlino (Tuscany, Italy) was analyzed for its capability of efficaciously bioreducing the chalcogen oxyanions selenite (SeO32-) and tellurite (TeO32-) to their respective elemental forms (Se0 and Te0) in aerobic conditions, with generation of Se- and Te-nanoparticles (Se- and TeNPs). The isolate could bioconvert 2 mM SeO32- and 0.5 mM TeO32- to the corresponding Se0 and Te0 in 48 and 120 h, respectively. The intracellular accumulation of nanomaterials was demonstrated through electron microscopy. Moreover, several analyses were performed to shed light on the mechanisms involved in SeO32- and TeO32- bioreduction to their elemental states. Results obtained suggested that these oxyanions are bioconverted through two different mechanisms in Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1. Glutathione (GSH) seemed to play a key role in SeO32- bioreduction, while TeO32- bioconversion could be ascribed to the catalytic activity of intracellular NADH-dependent oxidoreductases. The organic coating surrounding biogenic Se- and TeNPs was also characterized through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This analysis revealed interesting differences among the NPs produced by Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1 and suggested a possible different role of phospholipids and proteins in both biosynthesis and stabilization of such chalcogen-NPs.                  Conclusions:                       In conclusion, Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1 has demonstrated to be an ideal candidate for the bioconversion of toxic oxyanions such as selenite and tellurite to their respective elemental forms, producing intracellular Se- and TeNPs possibly exploitable in biomedical and industrial applications.	0
Title: Dihydrofolate reductase of the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. The enzyme and its coding gene Abstract: Halobacterium volcanii mutants that are resistant to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimethoprim contain DNA sequence amplifications. This paper describes the cloning and nucleic acid sequencing of the amplified DNA sequence of the H. volcanii mutant WR215. This sequence contains an open reading frame that codes for an amino acid sequence that is homologous to the amino acid sequences of dihydrofolate reductases from different sources. As a result of the gene amplification, the trimethoprim-resistant mutant overproduces dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate-mediated chromatographies. It is shown that the enzyme comprises 5% of the cell protein. The amino acid sequence of the first 15 amino acids of the enzyme fits the coding sequence of the gene. Preliminary biochemical characterization shows that the enzyme is unstable at salt concentrations lower than 2 M and that its activity increases with increase in the KCl or NaCl concentrations.	0
Title: Novel flavonol glycosides from the aerial parts of lentil (Lens culinaris) Abstract: While the phytochemical composition of lentil (Lens culinaris) seeds is well described in scientific literature, there is very little available data about secondary metabolites from lentil leaves and stems. Our research reveals that the aerial parts of lentil are a rich source of flavonoids. Six kaempferol and twelve quercetin glycosides were isolated, their structures were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and chemical methods. This group includes 16 compounds which have not been previously described in the scientific literature: quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-galactopyranoside-7-O-β-D-glucuropyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-galacto-pyranoside-7-O-β-D-glucuropyranoside (3), their derivatives 4-10,12-15,17,18 acylated with caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, or 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid and kaempferol 3-O-{[(6-O-E-p-coumaroyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)]-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)}-β-D-galactopyranoside-7-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (11). Their DPPH scavenging activity was also evaluated. This is probably the first detailed description of flavonoids from the aerial parts of lentil.	0
Title: Elevation of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase activity in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters Abstract: The single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin sulfate (0.5 mg (potency) per 100 g body weight) in hamsters rapidly increased the activity of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16) of the lung, a major regulatory enzyme for the synthesis of acidic glycosaminoglycan (AGAG). The activity increased as early as day 2, reached maximum level at day 10, then decreased and returned to the control level at day 45. The content of AGAG was also increased by bleomycin treatment, but the increase of AGAG followed the elevation of the enzyme activity. These results suggest that the early elevation of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase activity is closely related to the accumulation of AGAG in the fibrosing lung caused by bleomycin.	0
Title: Palladium-catalyzed, copper(I)-mediated coupling of boronic acids and benzylthiocyanate. A cyanide-free cyanation of boronic acids Abstract: A new method for the synthesis of nitriles is described. As a complement to the classic cyanation of aryl halides using cyanide sources and a transition metal catalyst, the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of thiocyanates with boronic acids in the presence of copper(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate (CuTC) affords nitriles in good to excellent yields.	0
Title: Mechanistic insights into a Ca2+-dependent family of alpha-mannosidases in a human gut symbiont Abstract: Colonic bacteria, exemplified by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, play a key role in maintaining human health by harnessing large families of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) to exploit dietary polysaccharides and host glycans as nutrients. Such GH family expansion is exemplified by the 23 family GH92 glycosidases encoded by the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. Here we show that these are alpha-mannosidases that act via a single displacement mechanism to utilize host N-glycans. The three-dimensional structure of two GH92 mannosidases defines a family of two-domain proteins in which the catalytic center is located at the domain interface, providing acid (glutamate) and base (aspartate) assistance to hydrolysis in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The three-dimensional structures of the GH92s in complex with inhibitors provide insight into the specificity, mechanism and conformational itinerary of catalysis. Ca(2+) plays a key catalytic role in helping distort the mannoside away from its ground-state (4)C(1) chair conformation toward the transition state.	0
Title: Simocyclinones, novel cytostatic angucyclinone antibiotics produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040 II. Structure elucidation and biosynthesis Abstract: The simocyclinones D4 (1) and D8 (2), members of a novel class of antibiotics, were isolated from the mycelial extract of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040 and consist of angucyclinone, deoxysugar, octatetraene dicarboxylate and aminocoumarin structural elements. The structure elucidation was done by one and two dimensional NMR experiments, and other spectroscopic methods in combination with incorporation experiments using 13C labelled precursors.	1
Title: Identification, expression, and DNA sequence of the GDP-mannose biosynthesis genes encoded by the O7 rfb gene cluster of strain VW187 (Escherichia coli O7:K1) Abstract: The O7-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in strains of Escherichia coli consists of a repeating unit made of galactose, mannose, rhamnose, 4-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyglucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. We have recently cloned and characterized genetically the O7-specific LPS biosynthesis region (rfbEcO7) of the E. coli O7:K1 strain VW187 (C. L. Marolda, J. Welsh, L. Dafoe, and M. A. Valvano, J. Bacteriol. 172:3590-3599, 1990). In this study, we localized the gnd gene encoding gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at one end of the rfbEcO7 gene cluster and sequenced that end of the cluster. Three open reading frames (ORF) encoding polypeptides of 275, 464, and 453 amino acids were identified upstream of gndEcO7, all transcribed toward the gnd gene. ORF275 had 45% similarity at the protein level with ORF16.5, which occupies a similar position in the Salmonella enterica LT2 rfb region, and presumably encodes a nucleotide sugar transferase. The polypeptides encoded by ORFs 464 and 453 were expressed under the control of the ptac promoter and visualized in Coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and by maxicell analysis. ORF464 expressed GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase and ORF453 encoded a phosphomannomutase, the enzymes for the biosynthesis pathway of GDP-mannose, one of the nucleotide sugar precursors for the formation of the O7 repeating unit. They were designated rfbMEcO7 and rfbKEcO7, respectively. The RfbMEcO7 polypeptide was homologous to the corresponding protein in S. enterica LT2, XanB of Xanthomonas campestris, and AlgA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylases. RfbKEcO7 was very similar to CpsG of S. enterica LT2, an enzyme presumably involved in the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide colanic acid, but quite different from the corresponding RfbK protein of S. enterica LT2.	1
Title: Antibiotic-producing symbionts dynamically transition between plant pathogenicity and insect-defensive mutualism Abstract: Pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria associated with eukaryotic hosts often lack distinctive genomic features, suggesting regular transitions between these lifestyles. Here we present evidence supporting a dynamic transition from plant pathogenicity to insect-defensive mutualism in symbiotic Burkholderia gladioli bacteria. In a group of herbivorous beetles, these symbionts protect the vulnerable egg stage against detrimental microbes. The production of a blend of antibiotics by B. gladioli, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin and two new antimicrobial compounds, the macrolide lagriene and the isothiocyanate sinapigladioside, likely mediate this defensive role. In addition to vertical transmission, these insect symbionts can be exchanged via the host plant and retain the ability to initiate systemic plant infection at the expense of the plant's fitness. Our findings provide a paradigm for the transition between pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles and shed light on the evolution and chemical ecology of this defensive mutualism.	1
Title: Deposition Bias of Chromatin Proteins Inverts under DNA Replication Stress Conditions Abstract: Following DNA replication, equal amounts of chromatin proteins are distributed over sister chromatids by re-deposition of parental chromatin proteins and deposition of newly synthesized chromatin proteins. Molecular mechanisms balancing the allocation of new and old chromatin proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the genome-wide distribution of new chromatin proteins relative to parental DNA template strands and replication initiation zones using the double-click-seq. Under control conditions, new chromatin proteins were preferentially found on DNA replicated by the lagging strand machinery. Strikingly, replication stress induced by hydroxyurea or curaxin treatment and inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) or p53 inactivation inverted the observed chromatin protein deposition bias to the strand replicated by the leading strand polymerase in line with previously reported effects on replication protein A occupancy. We propose that asymmetric deposition of newly synthesized chromatin proteins onto sister chromatids reflects differences in the processivity of leading and lagging strand synthesis.	0
Title: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acids D, C, and B: Evolution of a Unified Synthetic Strategy Abstract: A unified synthetic strategy leading to the total synthesis of (-)-nodulisporic acids D, C, and B is described. Key synthetic transformations include a nickel-chromium-mediated cyclization, an aromatic ring functionalization employing a novel copper-promoted alkylation, a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling cascade/indole ring construction, and a palladium-mediated regio- and diastereoselective allylic substitution/cyclization reaction, the latter to construct ring D.	0
Title: Isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycetin, a linear polyketide T cell-specific immunomodulator from Streptomyces sp. CK4412 Abstract: The bacterial genus Streptomyces has long been appreciated for its ability to produce various kinds of medically important secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, anti-tumour agents, immunosuppressants and enzyme inhibitors. Tautomycetin (TMC), which is produced by Streptomyces sp. CK4412, is a novel activated T cell-specific immunosuppressive compound with an ester bond linkage between a terminal cyclic anhydride moiety and a linear polyketide chain bearing an unusual terminal alkene. Using a Streptomyces polyketide methylmalonyl-CoA acyltransferase gene as a probe, three overlapping cosmids were isolated from the genomic library of TMC-producing Streptomyces sp. CK4412. Sequence information of an approximately 70 kb contiguous DNA region revealed two multi-modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), and 12 additional gene products presumably involved in TMC biosynthesis. The deduced roles for most of the TMC PKS catalytic domains were consistent with the expected functions necessary for TMC chain elongation and processing. In addition, disruption of a putative TMC acyl-CoA transferase gene, located upstream of the PKS gene locus, completely abolished TMC biosynthesis. Taken together, these data provide strong supporting evidence that the cloned gene cluster identified in this study is responsible for TMC biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. CK4412, and set the stage for detailed genetic and biochemical studies of the biosynthesis of this important metabolite.	1
Title: Blue light-induced dimerization of a bacterial LOV-HTH DNA-binding protein Abstract: With their utilization of light-driven allostery to control biochemical activities, photosensory proteins are of great interest as model systems and novel reagents for use by the basic science and engineering communities. One such protein, the light-activated EL222 transcription factor, from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, is appealing for such studies, as it harnesses blue light to drive the reorientation of light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) sensory and helix-turn-helix (HTH) effector domains to allow photoactivation of gene transcription in natural and artificial systems. The protein conformational changes required for this process are not well understood, in part because of the relatively short lifetime of the EL222 photoexcited state (τ ∼ 29 s), which complicates its characterization via certain biophysical methods. Here we report how we have circumvented this limitation by creating an EL222 variant harboring V41I, L52I, A79Q, and V121I point mutations (AQTrip) that stabilizes the photoactivated state. Using the wild-type and AQTrip EL222 proteins, we have probed EL222 activation using a combination of solution scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electromobility shift assays. Size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering indicate that AQTrip oligomerizes in the absence of DNA and selects for an EL222 dimer-DNA complex in the presence of DNA substrates. These results are confirmed in wild-type EL222 with a high-affinity DNA-binding site that stabilizes the complex. NMR analyses of the EL222-DNA complex confirm a 2:1 stoichiometry in the presence of a previously characterized DNA substrate. Combined, these novel approaches have validated a key mechanistic step, whereby blue light induces EL222 dimerization through LOV and HTH interfaces.	0
Title: Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide transport to the outer membrane in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by peptidomimetic antibiotics Abstract: The asymmetric outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet and phospholipid in the inner leaflet. During OM biogenesis, LPS is transported from the periplasm into the outer leaflet by a complex comprising the OM proteins LptD and LptE. Recently, a new family of macrocyclic peptidomimetic antibiotics that interact with LptD of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was discovered. Here we provide evidence that the peptidomimetics inhibit the LPS transport function of LptD. One approach to monitor LPS transport involved studies of lipid A modifications. Some modifications occur only in the inner membrane while others occur only in the OM, and thus provide markers for LPS transport within the bacterial envelope. We prepared a conditional lptD mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 that allowed control of lptD expression from the rhamnose promoter. With this mutant, the effects caused by the antibiotic on the wild-type strain were compared with those caused by depleting LptD in the mutant strain. When LptD was depleted in the mutant, electron microscopy revealed accumulation of membrane-like material within cells and OM blebbing; this mirrored similar effects in the wild-type strain caused by the antibiotic. Moreover, the bacterium responded to the antibiotic, and to depletion of LptD, by introducing the same lipid A modifications, consistent with inhibition by the antibiotic of LptD-mediated LPS transport. This conclusion was further supported by monitoring the radiolabelling of LPS from [¹⁴C]acetate, and by fractionation of IM and OM components. Overall, the results provide support for a mechanism of action for the peptidomimetic antibiotics that involves inhibition of LPS transport to the cell surface.	0
Title: Operon for biosynthesis of lipstatin, the Beta-lactone inhibitor of human pancreatic lipase Abstract: Lipstatin, isolated from Streptomyces toxytricini as a potent and selective inhibitor of human pancreatic lipase, is a precursor for tetrahydrolipstatin (also known as orlistat, Xenical, and Alli), the only FDA-approved antiobesity medication for long-term use. Lipstatin features a 2-hexyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7,10-hexadecadienoic-β-lactone structure with an N-formyl-l-leucine group attached as an ester to the 5-hydroxy group. It has been suggested that the α-branched 3,5-dihydroxy fatty acid β-lactone moiety of lipstatin in S. toxytricini is derived from Claisen condensation between two fatty acid substrates, which are derived from incomplete oxidative degradation of linoleic acid based on feeding experiments. In this study, we identified a six-gene operon (lst) that was essential for the biosynthesis of lipstatin by large-deletion, complementation, and single-gene knockout experiments. lstA, lstB, and lstC, which encode two β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III homologues and an acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase homologue, were indicated to be responsible for the generation of the α-branched 3,5-dihydroxy fatty acid backbone. Subsequently, the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene lstE and the putative formyltransferase gene lstF were involved in decoration of the α-branched 3,5-dihydroxy fatty acid chain with an N-formylated leucine residue. Finally, the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-homologous gene lstD might be responsible for the reduction of the β-keto group of the biosynthetic intermediate, thereby facilitating the formation of the unique β-lactone ring.	1
Title: Identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding the thiopeptide antibiotic cyclothiazomycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics are an important class of natural products resulting from posttranslational modifications of ribosomally synthesized peptides. Cyclothiazomycin is a typical thiopeptide antibiotic that has a unique bridged macrocyclic structure derived from an 18-amino-acid structural peptide. Here we reported cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of the cyclothiazomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22. Remarkably, successful heterologous expression of a 22.7-kb gene cluster in Streptomyces lividans 1326 suggested that there is a minimum set of 15 open reading frames that includes all of the functional genes required for cyclothiazomycin production. Six genes of these genes, cltBCDEFG flanking the structural gene cltA, were predicted to encode the enzymes required for the main framework of cyclothiazomycin, and two enzymes encoded by a putative operon, cltMN, were hypothesized to participate in the tailoring step to generate the tertiary thioether, leading to the final cyclization of the bridged macrocyclic structure. This rigorous bioinformatics analysis based on heterologous expression of cyclothiazomycin resulted in an ideal biosynthetic model for us to understand the biosynthesis of thiopeptides.	1
Title: Expression of functional Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasomes in Escherichia coli Abstract: The two genes encoding the constituent subunits of the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome were expressed in Escherichia coli yielding fully assembled molecules as shown by electron microscopy. The recombinant proteasomes were purified to homogeneity and were shown to have proteolytic activity indistinguishable from proteasomes isolated from T. acidophilum.	0
Title: Sequence analysis of the four plasmid genes required to produce the circular peptide antibiotic microcin J25 Abstract: A 4.8-kb plasmid region carrying the four genes mcjABCD necessary for production of and immunity to the cyclic peptide antibiotic microcin J25 (MccJ25) has been sequenced. mcjA encodes the primary structure of MccJ25 as a precursor endowed with an N-terminal extension of 37 amino acids. The products of mcjB and mcjC are thought to be involved in microcin maturation, which implies cleavage of McjA and head-tail linkage of the 21-residue pro-MccJ25. The predicted McjD polypeptide, which is highly similar to several ABC exporters, was found to be required for MccJ25 secretion, thus explaining its ability to confer immunity to MccJ25.	1
Title: Characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from rivers and lakes in Switzerland Abstract: One of the currently most relevant resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae is the production of enzymes that lead to modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and even carbapenem resistance, mainly extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases. A worrisome aspect is the spread of ESBL and carbapenemase producers into the environment. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and to further characterize ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in rivers and lakes in Switzerland. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 21 (36.2%) of the 58 bodies of water sampled. One river sample tested positive for a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strain. Seventy-four individual strains expressing an ESBL phenotype were isolated. Species identification revealed 60 Escherichia coli strains, seven Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains, five Raoultella planticola strains, one Enterobacter cloacae strain, and one Enterobacter amnigenus strain. Three strains were identified as SHV-12 ESBL producers, and 71 strains carried genes encoding CTX-M ESBLs. Of the 71 strains with CTX-M ESBL genes, 8 isolates expressed CTX-M-1, three produced CTX-M-3, 46 produced CTX-M-15, three produced CTX-M-55, one produced CTX-M-79, six produced CTX-M-14, and four produced CTX-M-27. Three of the four CTX-M-27 producers belonged to the multiresistant pandemic sequence type E. coli B2:ST131 that is strongly associated with potentially severe infections in humans and animals.	0
Title: Evolution of the terminal regions of the Streptomyces linear chromosome Abstract: Comparative analysis of the Streptomyces chromosome sequences, between Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC23877 (whose partial sequence is released in this study), revealed a highly compartmentalized genetic organization of their genome. Indeed, despite the presence of specific genomic islands, the central part of the chromosome appears highly syntenic. In contrast, the chromosome of each species exhibits large species-specific terminal regions (from 753 to 1,393 kb), even when considering closely related species (S. ambofaciens and S. coelicolor). Interestingly, the size of the central conserved region between species decreases as the phylogenetic distance between them increases, whereas the specific terminal fraction reciprocally increases in size. Between highly syntenic central regions and species-specific chromosomal parts, there is a notable degeneration of synteny due to frequent insertions/deletions. This reveals a massive and constant genomic flux (from lateral gene transfer and DNA rearrangements) affecting the terminal contingency regions. We speculate that a gradient of recombination rate (i.e., insertion/deletion events) toward the extremities is the force driving the exclusion of essential genes from the terminal regions (i.e., chromosome compartmentalization) and generating a fast gene turnover for strong adaptation capabilities.	1
Title: Isotopic graphene-isolated-Au-nanocrystals with cellular Raman-silent signals for cancer cell pattern recognition Abstract: For cancer diagnosis, technologies must be capable of molecular recognition, and they must possess a built-in pattern recognition component for efficient imaging and discrimination of targeted cancer cells. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags based on plasmonically active nanoparticles hold promise for accurate and efficient cancer cell recognition, owing to ultra-narrow peak and sensitive optical properties. However, a complex fingerprint spectrum increases data analysis difficulty, making it necessary to develop multicolor SERS tags with a simple fingerprint spectrum. To address this, we herein fabricated SERS-encoded nanoparticles (NPs) with stable and simple fingerprint spectrum through synthesis of isotopic cellular Raman-silent graphene-isolated-Au-nanocrystals (GIANs) and conjugation with phospholipid-polyethylene glycol-linked aptamers to target proteins overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. GIANs, which possess the properties of graphitic nanomaterials, such as super-stable optical properties and high Raman cross-section, showed enhanced SERS signals. The 2D-band Raman shift of GIAN, which located in the cellular Raman-silent region, was easily regulated through fabrication of isotopic GIANs without changing their molecular structure. Such GIAN tags demonstrated multiplexed Raman imaging capability, both in vivo and in vitro, with low background interference. Moreover, cell membrane protein (nucleolin, mucin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule)-specific, aptamer-conjugated isotopic GIANs were fabricated and feasibly applied to built-in coding for rapid imaging and pattern recognition of targeted cancer cells. Such isotopic GIAN-aptamer-encoders show high potential for efficient cancer cell identification and diagnosis.	0
Title: Metagenomic natural product discovery in lichen provides evidence for a family of biosynthetic pathways in diverse symbioses Abstract: Bacteria are a major source of natural products that provide rich opportunities for both chemical and biological investigation. Although the vast majority of known bacterial metabolites derive from free-living organisms, increasing evidence supports the widespread existence of chemically prolific bacteria living in symbioses. A strategy based on bioinformatic prediction, symbiont cultivation, isotopic enrichment, and advanced analytics was used to characterize a unique polyketide, nosperin, from a lichen-associated Nostoc sp. cyanobacterium. The biosynthetic gene cluster and the structure of nosperin, determined from 30 μg of compound, are related to those of the pederin group previously known only from nonphotosynthetic bacteria associated with beetles and marine sponges. The presence of this natural product family in such highly dissimilar associations suggests that some bacterial metabolites may be specific to symbioses with eukaryotes and encourages exploration of other symbioses for drug discovery and better understanding of ecological interactions mediated by complex bacterial metabolites.	1
Title: Discovery of pentangular polyphenols hexaricins A-C from marine Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 by genome mining Abstract: Many novel microbial nature products were discovered from Actinobacteria by genome mining methods. However, only a few number of genome mining works were carried out in rare actinomycetes. An important reason precluding the genome mining efforts in rare actinomycetes is that most of them are recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Herein, we chose the rare marine actinomycete Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 to explore its secondary metabolite diversity by genome mining. The genetic manipulation method has never been established for Streptosporangium strains. At first, we set up the genetic system of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 unprecedentedly. The draft genome sequencing of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 revealed that it contains more than 20 cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters. A type II polyketide synthases-containing cluster (the hex cluster) was predicted to encode compounds with a pentangular polyphenol scaffold by in silico analysis. The products of the hex cluster were uncovered by comparing the metabolic profile of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 with that of the hex30 inactivated mutant, in which a key ketoreductase gene was disrupted. Finally, three pentangular polyphenols were isolated and named as hexaricins A (1), B (2), and C (3). The inconsistency of the stereochemistry of C-15 in hexaricins A, B, and C indicates a branch point in their biosynthesis. Finally, the biosynthetic pathway of the hexaricins was proposed based on bioinformatics analysis.	1
Title: Bioinformatic Mapping of Radical S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-Translationally Modified Peptides Identifies New Cα, Cβ, and Cγ-Linked Thioether-Containing Peptides Abstract: Recently developed bioinformatic tools have bolstered the discovery of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Using an improved version of Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online (RODEO 2.0), a biosynthetic gene cluster mining algorithm, we bioinformatically mapped the sactipeptide RiPP class via the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that form the characteristic sactionine (sulfur-to-α carbon) cross-links between cysteine and acceptor residues. Hundreds of new sactipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters were uncovered, and a novel sactipeptide "huazacin" with growth-suppressive activity against Listeria monocytogenes was characterized. Bioinformatic analysis further suggested that a group of sactipeptide-like peptides heretofore referred to as six cysteines in forty-five residues (SCIFFs) might not be sactipeptides as previously thought. Indeed, the bioinformatically identified SCIFF peptide "freyrasin" was demonstrated to contain six thioethers linking the β carbons of six aspartate residues. Another SCIFF, thermocellin, was shown to contain a thioether cross-linked to the γ carbon of threonine. SCIFFs feature a different paradigm of non-α carbon thioether linkages, and they are exclusively formed by radical SAM enzymes, as opposed to the polar chemistry employed during lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Therefore, we propose the renaming of the SCIFF family as radical non-α thioether peptides (ranthipeptides) to better distinguish them from the sactipeptide and lanthipeptide RiPP classes.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Nematophin and Its Elongated Derivatives in Entomopathogenic Bacteria Abstract: Nematophin, a known antibiotic natural product against Staphylococcus aureus for almost 20 years, is produced by all strains of Xenorhabdus nematophila. Despite its simple structure, its biosynthesis was unknown. Its biosynthetic pathway is reported using heterologous production in Escherichia coli. Additionally, the identification, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of six extended nematophin derivatives from Xenorhabdus PB62.4 carrying an additional valine are reported. Preliminary bioactivity studies suggest a biological role of these compounds in the bacteria-nematode-insect symbiosis.	1
Title: Directed Accumulation of Anticancer Depsipeptides by Characterization of Neoantimycins Biosynthetic Pathway and an NADPH-Dependent Reductase Abstract: Neoantimycins (NATs) are members of antimycin-types of depsipeptides with outstanding anticancer activities. We isolated NAT-A (1) and -F (2) from the fermentation extract of Streptomyces conglobatus. The NAT biosynthetic gene cluster ( nat BGC) was identified by genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. nat BGC includes two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and one polyketide synthase (PKS) gene, and a gene cassette (10 genes), of which the encoded enzymes share high homology to the ones responsible for 3-formamidosalicylate (3-FAS) biosynthesis in the antimycin biosynthetic pathway. Heterologous expression of the partial nat BGC without the 3-FAS gene cassette in the antimycin producer, Streptomyces albus J1074, results in the production of 1 and 2, suggesting that the nat BGC indeed directs NATs biosynthesis. Targeted in-frame deletion of the reductase gene ( natE) abolished the production of 1 and 2 but accumulated two NAT derivatives, the known NAT-H (3) and a new NAT-I (4). Biochemical verification demonstrated that the recombinant NatE indeed catalyzes an NADPH-dependent reaction of 3 or 4 to 1 or 2, respectively. Compound 3 presented significantly stronger activities against eight cancer cell lines than the ones using cisplatin, the clinical chemotherapy medicine. In particular, 3 displayed 559- and 57-fold higher activity toward human melanoma and cervix epidermoid carcinoma cells, respectively, compared with cisplatin. The new derivative, 4, was 1.5- to 10.9-fold more active than cisplatin toward five cancer cell lines. The evaluation of NATs biosynthesis depicted here will pave the way to generate new NAT derivatives through rational pathway engineering.	1
Title: Small-molecule screening identifies the selanazal drug ebselen as a potent inhibitor of DMT1-mediated iron uptake Abstract: HEK293T cells overexpressing divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) were established to screen for small-molecule inhibitors of iron uptake. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we tested 2000 known bioactive compounds to find 3 small molecules that potently block ferrous iron uptake. One of the inhibitors, ebselen, is a seleno compound used in clinical trials as a protective agent against ischemic stroke. Ebselen inhibited Fe(II) uptake (IC(50) of approximately 0.22 microM), but did not influence Fe(III) transport or DMT1-mediated manganese uptake. An unrelated antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiobarbamate (PDTC), also inhibited DMT1 activity (IC(50) of approximately 1.54 microM). Both ebselen and PDTC increased cellular levels of reduced glutathione. These observations indicate that Fe(II) transport by DMT1 can be modulated by cellular redox status and suggest that ebselen may act therapeutically to limit iron-catalyzed damage due to transport inhibition.	0
Title: Identification and molecular genetic analysis of the cichorine gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: We recently demonstrated that the phytotoxin cichorine is produced by Aspergillus nidulans. Through a set of targeted deletions, we have found a cluster of seven genes that are required for its biosynthesis. Two of the deletions yielded molecules that give information about the biosynthesis of this metabolite.	1
Title: Mechanism of amido-thiourea catalyzed enantioselective imine hydrocyanation: transition state stabilization via multiple non-covalent interactions Abstract: An experimental and computational investigation of amido-thiourea promoted imine hydrocyanation has revealed a new and unexpected mechanism of catalysis. Rather than direct activation of the imine by the thiourea, as had been proposed previously in related systems, the data are consistent with a mechanism involving catalyst-promoted proton transfer from hydrogen isocyanide to imine to generate diastereomeric iminium/cyanide ion pairs that are bound to catalyst through multiple noncovalent interactions; these ion pairs collapse to form the enantiomeric alpha-aminonitrile products. This mechanistic proposal is supported by the observation of a statistically significant correlation between experimental and calculated enantioselectivities induced by eight different catalysts (P << 0.01). The computed models reveal a basis for enantioselectivity that involves multiple stabilizing and destabilizing interactions between substrate and catalyst, including thiourea-cyanide and amide-iminium interactions.	0
Title: Bacteroides fragilis NCTC9343 produces at least three distinct capsular polysaccharides: cloning, characterization, and reassignment of polysaccharide B and C biosynthesis loci Abstract: Bacteroides fragilis produces a capsular polysaccharide complex (CPC) that is directly involved in its ability to induce abscesses. Two distinct capsular polysaccharides, polysaccharide A (PS A) and PS B, have been shown to be synthesized by the prototype strain for the study of abscesses, NCTC9343. Both of these polysaccharides in purified form induce abscesses in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate that the CPC of NCTC9343 is composed of at least three distinct capsular polysaccharides: PS A, PS B, and PS C. A previously described locus contains genes whose products are involved in the biosynthesis of PS C rather than PS B as was originally suggested. The actual PS B biosynthesis locus was cloned, sequenced, and found to contain 22 genes in an operon-type structure. A mutant with a large chromosomal deletion of the PS B biosynthesis locus was created so that the contribution of PS B to the formation of abscesses could be assessed in a rodent model. Although purified PS B can induce abscesses, removal of this polysaccharide does not attenuate the organism's ability to induce abscesses.	1
Title: An environmental bacterial taxon with a large and distinct metabolic repertoire Abstract: Cultivated bacteria such as actinomycetes are a highly useful source of biomedically important natural products. However, such 'talented' producers represent only a minute fraction of the entire, mostly uncultivated, prokaryotic diversity. The uncultured majority is generally perceived as a large, untapped resource of new drug candidates, but so far it is unknown whether taxa containing talented bacteria indeed exist. Here we report the single-cell- and metagenomics-based discovery of such producers. Two phylotypes of the candidate genus 'Entotheonella' with genomes of greater than 9 megabases and multiple, distinct biosynthetic gene clusters co-inhabit the chemically and microbially rich marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Almost all bioactive polyketides and peptides known from this animal were attributed to a single phylotype. 'Entotheonella' spp. are widely distributed in sponges and belong to an environmental taxon proposed here as candidate phylum 'Tectomicrobia'. The pronounced bioactivities and chemical uniqueness of 'Entotheonella' compounds provide significant opportunities for ecological studies and drug discovery.	1
Title: Optimization of growth media components for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from organic acids by Ralstonia eutropha Abstract: We employed systematic mixture analysis to determine optimal levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate for cell growth and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production by Ralstonia eutropha H16. Butyrate was the preferred acid for robust cell growth and high PHA production. The 3-hydroxyvalerate content in the resulting PHA depended on the proportion of propionate initially present in the growth medium. The proportion of acetate dramatically affected the final pH of the growth medium. A model was constructed using our data that predicts the effects of these acids, individually and in combination, on cell dry weight (CDW), PHA content (%CDW), PHA production, 3HV in the polymer, and final culture pH. Cell growth and PHA production improved approximately 1.5-fold over initial conditions when the proportion of butyrate was increased. Optimization of the phosphate buffer content in medium containing higher amounts of butyrate improved cell growth and PHA production more than 4-fold. The validated organic acid mixture analysis model can be used to optimize R. eutropha culture conditions, in order to meet targets for PHA production and/or polymer HV content. By modifying the growth medium made from treated industrial waste, such as palm oil mill effluent, more PHA can be produced.	0
Title: Single-cell FRET imaging of transferrin receptor trafficking dynamics by Sfp-catalyzed, site-specific protein labeling Abstract: Fluorescence imaging of living cells depends on an efficient and specific method for labeling the target cellular protein with fluorophores. Here we show that Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling is suitable for fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins that spend at least part of their membrane trafficking cycle at the cell surface. In this study, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was fused to peptide carrier protein (PCP), and the TfR1-PCP fusion protein was specifically labeled with fluorophore Alexa 488 by Sfp. The trafficking of transferrin-TfR1-PCP complex during the process of transferrin-mediated iron uptake was imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescently labeled transferrin ligand and TfR1 receptor. We thus demonstrated that Sfp-catalyzed small molecule labeling of the PCP tag represents a practical and efficient tool for molecular imaging studies in living cells.	0
Title: Characterization of inthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealing new insights into carboxamide formation Abstract: Inthomycins are polyketide antibiotics which contain a terminal carboxamide group and a triene chain. Inthomycin B (1) and its two new analogues 2 and 3 were isolated from the crude extract of Streptomyces pactum L8. Identification of the gene cluster for inthomycin biosynthesis as well as the 15N-labeled glycine incorporation into inthomycins are described. Combined with the gene deletion of the rare P450 domain in the NRPS module, a formation mechanism of carboxamide moiety in inthomycins was proposed via an oxidative release of the assembly chain assisted by the P450 domain.	1
Title: Finding differentially expressed sRNA-Seq regions with srnadiff Abstract: Small RNAs (sRNAs) encompass a great variety of molecules of different kinds, such as microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, Piwi-associated RNA, among others. These sRNAs have a wide range of activities, which include gene regulation, protection against virus, transposable element silencing, and have been identified as a key actor in determining the development of the cell. Small RNA sequencing is thus routinely used to assess the expression of the diversity of sRNAs, usually in the context of differentially expression, where two conditions are compared. Tools that detect differentially expressed microRNAs are numerous, because microRNAs are well documented, and the associated genes are well defined. However, tools are lacking to detect other types of sRNAs, which are less studied, and whose precursor RNA is not well characterized. We present here a new method, called srnadiff, which finds all kinds of differentially expressed sRNAs. To the extent of our knowledge, srnadiff is the first tool that detects differentially expressed sRNAs without the use of external information, such as genomic annotation or additional sequences of sRNAs.	0
Title: Genetics of biosynthesis and structure of the K53 capsular polysaccharide of Acinetobacter baumannii D23 made up of a disaccharide K unit Abstract: The KL53 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) gene cluster of Acinetobacter baumannii D23 was sequenced, and includes a single gtr gene encoding the glycosyltransferase Gtr2, and the itrA1 gene for ItrA1 that is known to initiate CPS biosynthesis with d-QuiNAc4NAc. The K53 CPS was isolated and studied by one- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy before and after O-deacetylation. The disaccharide K unit of the CPS was established as →3)-α-d-GalpNAcA4Ac-(1→3)-β-d-QuipNAc4NAc-(1→, where GalNAcA and QuiNAc4NAc indicate 2-acetamido-2-deoxygalacturonic acid and 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyglucose, respectively. This established the linkage formed by Gtr2. The degree of 4-O-acetylation of d-GalNAcA by Atr18, encoded at the KL53 locus, is ~55 %.	1
Title: Putative sigma factor SigI (YkoZ) of Bacillus subtilis is induced by heat shock Abstract: A Bacillus subtilis disruption mutant with a mutation in sigI (formerly ykoZ) shows a temperature-sensitive growth on agar plates. The transcription of the sigI gene is heat shock induced in rich medium but not in minimal medium. Proteome studies revealed a reduced amount of GsiB protein in the sigI mutant under heat shock conditions.	0
Title: Identification of the Polyketide Biosynthetic Machinery for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Cyclizidine Abstract: The cyclizidine biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from Streptomyces NCIB 11649, which revealed the polyketide biosynthetic machinery for cyclizidine alkaloid biosynthesis. Both in vivo mutagenesis study and in vitro biochemical analysis provided insight into the timing and mechanism of the biosynthetic enzymes that produce cyclizidine-type indolizidine alkaloids.	1
Title: Distinct Mechanisms for Processing Autophagy Protein LC3-PE by RavZ and ATG4B Abstract: Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens in eukaryotic cells. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4-mediated deconjugation of LC3-PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the Legionella effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3-PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3-PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semisynthetic LC3-PE proteins containing C-terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C-terminal structure of LC3-PE with ATG4/RavZ-mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln116, Phe119 and Gly120 of LC3-PE are required for cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, whereas Glu117(LC3) is specific to cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B, but not in RavZ. Met63 and Gln64 at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C-terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of the LC3 C-terminal motif (116-120) with ATG4 and RavZ might determine the specificity of cleavage site.	0
Title: RNA-guided nucleotide modification of ribosomal and non-ribosomal RNAs in Archaea Abstract: Archaea use ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machines similar to those found in the eukaryotic nucleolus to methylate ribose residues in nascent ribosomal RNA. The archaeal complex required for this 2'-O-ribose-methylation consists of the C/D box sRNA guide and three proteins, the core RNA-binding aL7a protein, the aNop56 protein and the methyltransferase aFib protein. These RNP machines were reconstituted in vitro from purified recombinant components, and shown to have methylation activity when provided with a simple target oligonucleotide, complementary to the sRNA guide sequence. To obtain a better understanding of the versatility and specificity of this reaction, the activity of reconstituted particles on more complex target substrates, including 5S RNA, tRNA(Gln) and 'double target' oligonucleotides that exhibit either direct or reverse complementarity to both the D' and D box guides, has been examined. The natural 5S and tRNA(Gln) substrates were efficiently methylated in vitro, as long as the complementarity between guide and target was about 10 base pairs in length, and lacked mismatches. Maximal activity of double guide sRNAs required that both methylation sites be present in cis on the target RNA.	0
Title: Structure, Function, and Biosynthetic Origin of Octapeptin Antibiotics Active against Extensively Drug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria Abstract: Resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin is now widespread and new therapeutics are urgently required. We report the first in toto chemical synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of octapeptins, a class of lipopeptides structurally related to colistin. The octapeptin biosynthetic cluster consisted of three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (OctA, OctB, and OctC) that produced an amphiphilic antibiotic, octapeptin C4, which was shown to bind to and depolarize membranes. While active against multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains in vitro, octapeptin C4 displayed poor in vivo efficacy, most likely due to high plasma protein binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance solution structures, empirical structure-activity and structure-toxicity models were used to design synthetic octapeptins active against MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. The scaffold was then subtly altered to reduce plasma protein binding, while maintaining activity against MDR and XDR bacteria. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine bacteremia model with a colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolate.	1
Title: Lrp binds to two regions in the dadAX promoter region of Escherichia coli to repress and activate transcription directly Abstract: The dadAX operon is expressed by multiple promoters that are repressed by leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and activated by cyclic AMP-CRP. In previous work, we found that alanine or leucine acted as inducers to antagonize Lrp repression of the three major promoters directly. Here, we identify 11 Lrp binding sites located within 350 bp of dad DNA. A mutational analysis, coupled with in vivo and in vitro transcription experiments, indicated that Lrp sites that overlap the dad promoters were involved in repression. In contrast, sites upstream of the promoters did not appear to be necessary for repression, but were required for activation by Lrp plus alanine or leucine of one of the major dad promoters, P2. This activation by alanine or leucine was not simply relief of repression, as P2 transcription from a constitutive template was increased fivefold compared with the basal level of transcription found in the absence of Lrp and the co-activator cyclic AMP-CRP. Alanine or leucine decreased the affinity of Lrp to repressor sites, while having little or no effect on the binding of Lrp to activator sites. This differential effect of alanine and leucine on Lrp binding helps to explain how these modifiers influence both repression and activation of the dad operon.	0
Title: Identification of the viridicatumtoxin and griseofulvin gene clusters from Penicillium aethiopicum Abstract: Penicillium aethiopicum produces two structurally interesting and biologically active polyketides: the tetracycline-like viridicatumtoxin 1 and the classic antifungal agent griseofulvin 2. Here, we report the concurrent discovery of the two corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (vrt and gsf) by 454 shotgun sequencing. Gene deletions confirmed that two nonreducing PKSs (NRPKSs), vrtA and gsfA, are required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, respectively. Both PKSs share similar domain architectures and lack a C-terminal thioesterase domain. We identified gsfI as the chlorinase involved in the biosynthesis of 2, because deletion of gsfI resulted in the accumulation of decholorogriseofulvin 3. Comparative analysis with the P. chrysogenum genome revealed that both clusters are embedded within conserved syntenic regions of P. aethiopicum chromosomes. Discovery of the vrt and gsf clusters provided the basis for genetic and biochemical studies of the pathways.	1
Title: A Comprehensive Study of the Interaction between Peptidoglycan Fragments and the Extracellular Domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr Kinase PknB Abstract: The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr kinase PknB is implicated in the regulation of bacterial cell growth and cell division. The intracellular kinase function of PknB is thought to be triggered by peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments that are recognized by the extracytoplasmic domain of PknB. The PGN in the cell wall of M. tuberculosis has several unusual modifications, including the presence of N-glycolyl groups (in addition to N-acetyl groups) in the muramic acid residues and amidation of d-Glu in the peptide chains. Using synthetic PGN fragments incorporating these diverse PGN structures, we analyzed their binding characters through biolayer interferometry (BLI), NMR spectroscopy, and native mass spectrometry (nMS) techniques. The results of BLI showed that muropeptides containing 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc and longer glycan chains exhibited higher binding potency and that the fourth amino acid of the peptide stem, d-Ala, was crucial for protein recognition. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy indicated the major involvement of the stem peptide region in the PASTA-PGN fragment binding. nMS suggested that the binding stoichiometry was 1:1. The data provide the first molecular basis for the specific interaction of PGN with PknB and firmly establish PGNs as the effective ligands of PknB.	0
Title: Benzo-Fused Periacenes or Double Helicenes? Different Cyclodehydrogenation Pathways on Surface and in Solution Abstract: Controlling the regioselectivity of C-H activation in unimolecular reactions is of great significance for the rational synthesis of functional graphene nanostructures, which are called nanographenes. Here, we demonstrate that the adsorption of tetranaphthyl- p-terphenyl precursors on metal surfaces can completely change the cyclodehydrogenation route and lead to obtaining planar benzo-fused perihexacenes rather than double [7]helicenes during solution synthesis. The course of the on-surface planarization reactions is monitored using scanning probe microscopy, which unambiguously reveals the formation of dibenzoperihexacenes and the structures of reaction intermediates. The regioselective planarization can be attributed to the flattened adsorption geometries and the reduced flexibility of the precursors on the surfaces, in addition to the different mechanism of the on-surface cyclodehydrogenation from that of the solution counterpart. We have further achieved the on-surface synthesis of dibenzoperioctacene by employing a tetra-anthryl- p-terphenyl precursor. The energy gaps of the new nanographenes are measured to be approximately 2.1 eV (dibenzoperihexacene) and 1.3 eV (dibenzoperioctacene) on a Au(111) surface. Our findings shed new light on the regioselectivity in cyclodehydrogenation reactions, which will be important for exploring the synthesis of unprecedented nanographenes.	0
Title: Characterization of a cobalt-specific P(1B)-ATPase Abstract: The P(1B)-type ATPases are a ubiquitous family of P-type ATPases involved in the transport of transition metal ions. Divided into subclasses based on sequence characteristics and substrate specificity, these integral membrane transporters play key roles in metal homeostasis, metal tolerance, and the biosynthesis of metalloproteins. The P(1B-4)-ATPases have the simplest architecture of the five P(1B)-ATPase families and have been suggested to play a role in Co(2+) transport. A P(1B-4)-ATPase from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-14.1, designated sCoaT, has been cloned, expressed, and purified. Activity assays indicate that sCoaT is specific for Co(2+). A single Co(2+) binding site is present, and optical, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption spectroscopic data are consistent with tetrahedral coordination by oxygen and nitrogen ligands, including a histidine and likely a water. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for coordination by sulfur. Mutation of a conserved cysteine residue, Cys 327, in the signature transmembrane Ser-Pro-Cys metal binding motif does not abolish the ATP hydrolysis activity or affect the spectroscopic analysis, establishing that this residue is not involved in the initial Co(2+) binding by sCoaT. In contrast, replacements of conserved transmembrane residues Ser 325, His 657, Glu 658, and Thr 661 with alanine abolish ATP hydrolysis activity and Co(2+) binding, indicating that these residues are necessary for Co(2+) transport. These data represent the first in vitro characterization of a P(1B-4)-ATPase and its Co(2+) binding site.	0
Title: Bioinformatic Expansion and Discovery of Thiopeptide Antibiotics Abstract: Thiopeptides are members of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide family of natural products. Most characterized thiopeptides display nanomolar potency toward Gram-positive bacteria by blocking protein translation with several being produced at the industrial scale for veterinary and livestock applications. Employing our custom bioinformatics program, RODEO, we expand the thiopeptide family of natural products by a factor of four. This effort revealed many new thiopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters with products predicted to be distinct from characterized thiopeptides and identified gene clusters for previously characterized molecules of unknown biosynthetic origin. To further validate our data set of predicted thiopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters, we isolated and characterized a structurally unique thiopeptide featuring a central piperidine and rare thioamide moiety. Termed saalfelduracin, this thiopeptide displayed potent antibiotic activity toward several drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. A combination of whole-genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and heterologous expression experiments confirmed that the thioamide moiety of saalfelduracin is installed post-translationally by the joint action of two proteins, TfuA and YcaO. These results reconcile the previously unknown origin of the thioamide in two long-known thiopeptides, thiopeptin and Sch 18640. Armed with these new insights into thiopeptide chemical-genomic space, we provide a roadmap for the discovery of additional members of this natural product family.	1
Title: Recent Applications of Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases in Asymmetric Synthesis of Noncanonical Amino Acids and Heterocyclic Compounds Abstract: Carbon-nitrogen (C-N) lyases are enzymes that normally catalyze the cleavage of C-N bonds. Reversing this reaction towards carbon-nitrogen bond formation can be a powerful approach to prepare valuable compounds that could find applications in everyday life. This review focuses on recent (last five years) applications of native and engineered C-N lyases, either as stand-alone biocatalysts or as part of multienzymatic and chemoenzymatic cascades, in enantioselective synthesis of noncanonical amino acids and dinitrogen-fused heterocycles, which are useful tools for neurobiological research and important synthetic precursors to pharmaceuticals and food additives.	0
Title: Isolation, structure elucidation, and iron-binding properties of lystabactins, siderophores isolated from a marine Pseudoalteromonas sp Abstract: The marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. S2B, isolated from the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was found to produce lystabactins A, B, and C (1-3), three new siderophores. The structures were elucidated through mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and NMR. The lystabactins are composed of serine (Ser), asparagine (Asn), two formylated/hydroxylated ornithines (FOHOrn), dihydroxy benzoic acid (Dhb), and a very unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid, 4,8-diamino-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (LySta). The iron-binding properties of the compounds were investigated through a spectrophotometric competition.	0
Title: Multi-Homologous Recombination-Based Gene Manipulation in the Rice Pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Gene disruption by homologous recombination is widely used to investigate and analyze the function of genes in Fusarium fujikuroi, a fungus that causes bakanae disease and root rot symptoms in rice. To generate gene deletion constructs, the use of conventional cloning methods, which rely on restriction enzymes and ligases, has had limited success due to a lack of unique restriction enzyme sites. Although strategies that avoid the use of restriction enzymes have been employed to overcome this issue, these methods require complicated PCR steps or are frequently inefficient. Here, we introduce a cloning system that utilizes multi-fragment assembly by In-Fusion to generate a gene disruption construct. This method utilizes DNA fragment fusion and requires only one PCR step and one reaction for construction. Using this strategy, a gene disruption construct for Fusarium cyclin C1 (FCC1 ), which is associated with fumonisin B1 biosynthesis, was successfully created and used for fungal transformation. In vivo and in vitro experiments using confirmed fcc1 mutants suggest that fumonisin production is closely related to disease symptoms exhibited by F. fujikuroi strain B14. Taken together, this multi-fragment assembly method represents a simpler and a more convenient process for targeted gene disruption in fungi.	1
Title: Impact of mammalian cell culture conditions on monoclonal antibody charge heterogeneity: an accessory monitoring tool for process development Abstract: Recombinant monoclonal antibodies are predominantly produced in mammalian cell culture bioprocesses. Post-translational modifications affect the micro-heterogeneity of the product and thereby influence important quality attributes, such as stability, solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The analysis of the surface charge distribution of monoclonal antibodies provides aggregated information about these modifications. In this work, we established a direct injection pH gradient cation exchange chromatography method, which determines charge heterogeneity from cell culture supernatant without any purification steps. This tool was further applied to monitor processes that were performed under certain process conditions. Concretely, we were able to provide insights into charge variant formation during a fed-batch process of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, in turn producing a monoclonal antibody under varying temperatures and glucose feed strategies. Glucose concentration impacted the total emergence of acidic variants, whereas the variation of basic species was mainly dependent on process temperature. The formation rates of acidic species were described with a second-order reaction, where a temperature increase favored the conversion. This platform method will aid as a sophisticated optimization tool for mammalian cell culture processes. It provides a quality fingerprint for the produced mAb, which can be tested, compared to the desired target and confirmed early in the process chain.	0
Title: Nucleophilic 1,4-additions for natural product discovery Abstract: Natural products remain an important source of drug candidates, but the difficulties inherent to traditional isolation, coupled with unacceptably high rates of compound rediscovery, limit the pace of natural product detection. Here we describe a reactivity-based screening method to rapidly identify exported bacterial metabolites that contain dehydrated amino acids (i.e., carbonyl- or imine-activated alkenes), a common motif in several classes of natural products. Our strategy entails the use of a commercially available thiol, dithiothreitol, for the covalent labeling of activated alkenes by nucleophilic 1,4-addition. Modification is easily discerned by comparing mass spectra of reacted and unreacted cell surface extracts. When combined with bioinformatic analysis of putative natural product gene clusters, targeted screening and isolation can be performed on a prioritized list of strains. Moreover, known compounds are easily dereplicated, effectively eliminating superfluous isolation and characterization. As a proof of principle, this labeling method was used to identify known natural products belonging to the thiopeptide, lanthipeptide, and linaridin classes. Further, upon screening a panel of only 23 actinomycetes, we discovered and characterized a novel thiopeptide antibiotic, cyclothiazomycin C.	1
Title: Targeting folded RNA: a branched peptide boronic acid that binds to a large surface area of HIV-1 RRE RNA Abstract: On-bead high-throughput screening of a medium-sized (1000-2000 Da) branched peptide boronic acid (BPBA) library consisting of 46,656 unique sequences against HIV-1 RRE RNA generated peptides with binding affinities in the low micromolar range. In particular, BPBA1 had a K(d) of 1.4 μM with RRE IIB, preference for RNA over DNA (27 fold), and selectivity of up to >75 fold against a panel of RRE IIB variants. Structure-activity studies suggest that the boronic acid moiety and "branching" in peptides are key structural features for efficient binding and selectivity for the folded RNA target. BPBA1 was efficiently taken up by HeLa and A2780 cells. RNA-footprinting studies revealed that the BPBA1 binding site encompasses a large surface area that spans both the upper stem as well as the internal loop regions of RRE IIB.	0
Title: Metabolomics-Driven Discovery of a Prenylated Isatin Antibiotic Produced by Streptomyces Species MBT28 Abstract: Actinomycetes are a major source of antimicrobials, anticancer compounds, and other medically important products, and their genomes harbor extensive biosynthetic potential. Major challenges in the screening of these microorganisms are to activate the expression of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters and the development of technologies for efficient dereplication of known molecules. Here we report the identification of a previously unidentified isatin-type antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp. MBT28, following a strategy based on NMR-based metabolomics combined with the introduction of streptomycin resistance in the producer strain. NMR-guided isolation by tracking the target proton signal resulted in the characterization of 7-prenylisatin (1) with antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis. The metabolite-guided genome mining of Streptomyces sp. MBT28 combined with proteomics identified a gene cluster with an indole prenyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into 7-prenylisatin. This study underlines the applicability of NMR-based metabolomics in facilitating the discovery of novel antibiotics.	1
Title: Identification of the Formycin A Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces kaniharaensis Illustrates the Interplay between Biological Pyrazolopyrimidine Formation and de Novo Purine Biosynthesis Abstract: Formycin A is a potent purine nucleoside antibiotic with a C-glycosidic linkage between the ribosyl moiety and the pyrazolopyrimidine base. Herein, a cosmid is identified from the Streptomyces kaniharaensis genome library that contains the for gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of formycin. Subsequent gene deletion experiments and in vitro characterization of the forBCH gene products established their catalytic functions in formycin biosynthesis. Results also demonstrated that PurH from de novo purine biosynthesis plays a key role in pyrazolopyrimidine formation during biosynthesis of formycin A. The participation of PurH in both pathways represents a good example of how primary and secondary metabolism are interlinked.	1
Title: Conformational switching in the fungal light sensor Vivid Abstract: The Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid tunes blue-light responses and modulates gating of the circadian clock. Crystal structures of dark-state and light-state Vivid reveal a light, oxygen, or voltage Per-Arnt-Sim domain with an unusual N-terminal cap region and a loop insertion that accommodates the flavin cofactor. Photoinduced formation of a cystein-flavin adduct drives flavin protonation to induce an N-terminal conformational change. A cysteine-to-serine substitution remote from the flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site decouples conformational switching from the flavin photocycle and prevents Vivid from sending signals in Neurospora. Key elements of this activation mechanism are conserved by other photosensors such as White Collar-1, ZEITLUPE, ENVOY, and flavin-binding, kelch repeat, F-BOX 1 (FKF1).	0
Title: Characterization of the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces vinaceusdrappus NRRL 2363 implicates two alternative strategies for amide bond formation Abstract: Amicetin, an antibacterial and antiviral agent, belongs to a group of disaccharide nucleoside antibiotics featuring an α-(1→4)-glycoside bond in the disaccharide moiety. In this study, the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster was cloned from Streptomyces vinaceusdrappus NRRL 2363 and localized on a 37-kb contiguous DNA region. Heterologous expression of the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces lividans TK64 resulted in the production of amicetin and its analogues, thereby confirming the identity of the ami gene cluster. In silico sequence analysis revealed that 21 genes were putatively involved in amicetin biosynthesis, including 3 for regulation and transportation, 10 for disaccharide biosynthesis, and 8 for the formation of the amicetin skeleton by the linkage of cytosine, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and the terminal (+)-α-methylserine moieties. The inactivation of the benzoate coenzyme A (benzoate-CoA) ligase gene amiL and the N-acetyltransferase gene amiF led to two mutants that accumulated the same two compounds, cytosamine and 4-acetamido-3-hydroxybenzoic acid. These data indicated that AmiF functioned as an amide synthethase to link cytosine and PABA. The inactivation of amiR, encoding an acyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, resulted in the production of plicacetin and norplicacetin, indicating AmiR to be responsible for attachment of the terminal methylserine moiety to form another amide bond. These findings implicated two alternative strategies for amide bond formation in amicetin biosynthesis.	1
Title: GLUE that sticks to HIV: a helix-grafted GLUE protein that selectively binds the HIV gp41 N-terminal helical region Abstract: Methods for the stabilization of well-defined helical peptide drugs and basic research tools have received considerable attention in the last decade. Here, we report the stable and functional display of an HIV gp41 C-peptide helix mimic on a GRAM-Like Ubiquitin-binding in EAP45 (GLUE) protein. C-peptide helix-grafted GLUE selectively binds a mimic of the N-terminal helical region of gp41, a well-established HIV drug target, in a complex cellular environment. Additionally, the helix-grafted GLUE is folded in solution, stable in human serum, and soluble in aqueous solutions, and thus overcomes challenges faced by a multitude of peptide drugs, including those derived from HIV gp41 C-peptide.	0
Title: Proteomics-based discovery of koranimine, a cyclic imine natural product Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of medically and ecologically important secondary metabolites. In a previous report, we described a proteomics approach to screen for expressed NRPSs or PKSs from bacteria with or without sequenced genomes. Here we used this proteome mining approach to discover a novel natural product arising from rare adenylation (A) and reductase (Red) domains in its biosynthetic machinery. We also cloned the entire gene cluster and elucidated the biosynthesis of the new compound, which is produced by an unsequenced Bacillus sp. isolated from soil collected in Koran, Louisiana.	1
Title: In situ transformation of TON silica zeolite into the less dense ITW: structure-direction overcoming framework instability in the synthesis of SiO2 zeolites Abstract: Under specific synthesis conditions the crystallization of a dense silica zeolite (TON) is followed by its in situ transformation into a less dense and, in the absence of occluded species, less stable zeolite (ITW). Periodic ab initio calculations including energy corrections for van der Waals interactions as well as zero-point and thermal effects are used first to assess the relative stability of both SiO(2) (calcined) phases and then to investigate host-guest interactions in the as-made zeolites, as well as their relative stability. The less dense SiO(2)-ITW is less stable than SiO(2)-TON, with an energy difference that is significantly larger than expected from their difference in molar volume. This extra destabilization is ascribed to the strained double 4-ring units of silica tetrahedra (D4R). Regarding the as-made materials, the organic cation fills in more efficiently the zeolitic voids in ITW than in TON, bringing about a larger stabilization in the former owing to the extension of the long-range addition of dispersion force contributions. On the other hand, fluoride induces a polarization of the silica framework that is highly localized in TON (showing pentacoordinated [SiO(4/2)F](-) units) but has a large global character in ITW (where fluoride is encapsulated into D4R units). We argue that the structure-directing role toward D4R materials that has been proposed for fluoride consists fundamentally in the ability to induce a global polarization of the silica framework that allows relaxation of the strain associated with these units. In this sense, fluoride stabilizes the otherwise strained D4R-SiO(2) frameworks making them reachable for crystallization. This work documents a case in which the structure directing agents "choose" a structure not kinetically but through stabilization.	0
Title: Characteristics and activity analysis of epothilone operon promoters from Sorangium cellulosum strains in Escherichia coli Abstract: The epothilones, compounds with anticancer mechanisms similar to that of paclitaxel (Taxol), are produced by strains of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, and the gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis is organised as a large operon. In this work, we showed that the 440-bp promoter regions of the operons from eight S. cellulosum strains have 94.27 % DNA sequence identity and 50 % variability in promoter activity in Escherichia coli. A primer extension analysis revealed two transcriptional start sites (TSSs) at 246 (TSS1) and 193 bp (TSS2) upstream of the translation start site (TLS), respectively. Promoter truncation determined that the basal promoter from the So0157-2 strain is located within a 264-bp region containing weak promoter activity; whereas in the 38-bp region upstream, the 264-bp promoter was required for the strong promoter activity, which was dramatically increased by 11-fold in average. There was a conserved stem-loop structure between TSS2 and the TLS, which was identified in E. coli as a negative regulatory element. In addition, the upstream non-conserved 357-bp non-coding region contributes to the promoter activity, increasing it by 1.5-fold. In conclusion, the expression of the epothilone operon non-coding region in E. coli is regulated by a double promoter (with -35 and -10 regions and two distinct TSSs), a stem-loop structure, and a distal non-coding region.	1
Title: Iron Acquisition by Bacterial Pathogens: Beyond Tris-Catecholate Complexes Abstract: Sequestration of the essential nutrient iron from bacterial invaders that colonize the vertebrate host is a central feature of nutritional immunity and the "fight over transition metals" at the host-pathogen interface. The iron quota for many bacterial pathogens is large, as iron enzymes often make up a significant share of the metalloproteome. Iron enzymes play critical roles in respiration, energy metabolism, and other cellular processes by catalyzing a wide range of oxidation-reduction, electron transfer, and oxygen activation reactions. In this Concept article, we discuss recent insights into the diverse ways that bacterial pathogens acquire this essential nutrient, beyond the well-characterized tris-catecholate FeIII complexes, in competition and cooperation with significant host efforts to cripple these processes. We also discuss pathogen strategies to adapt their metabolism to less-than-optimal iron concentrations, and briefly speculate on what might be an integrated adaptive response to the concurrent limitation of both iron and zinc in the infected host.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of crocacin involves an unusual hydrolytic release domain showing similarity to condensation domains Abstract: The crocacins are potent antifungal and cytotoxic natural compounds from myxobacteria of the genus Chondromyces. Although total synthesis approaches have been reported, the molecular and biochemical basis guiding the formation of the linear crocacin scaffold has remained unknown. Along with the identification and functional analysis of the crocacin biosynthetic gene cluster from Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, we here present the identification and biochemical characterization of an unusual chain termination domain homologous to condensation domains responsible for hydrolytic release of the product from the assembly line. In particular, gene inactivation studies and in vitro experiments using the heterologously produced domain CroK-C2 confirm this surprising role giving rise to the linear carboxylic acid. Additionally, we determined the kinetic parameters of CroK-C2 by monitoring hydrolytic cleavage of the substrate mimic N-acetylcysteaminyl-crocacin B using an innovative high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based assay.	1
Title: Bacterial MbtH-like Proteins Stimulate Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase-Derived Secondary Metabolism in Filamentous Fungi Abstract: Filamentous fungi are known producers of bioactive natural products, low molecular weight molecules that arise from secondary metabolism. MbtH-like proteins (MLPs) are small (∼10 kDa) proteins, which associate noncovalently with adenylation domains of some bacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). MLPs promote the folding, stability, and activity of NRPS enzymes. MLPs are highly conserved among a wide range of bacteria; however, they are absent from all fungal species sequenced to date. We analyzed the interaction potential of bacterial MLPs with eukaryotic NRPS enzymes first using crystal structures, with results suggesting a conservation of the interaction surface. Subsequently, we transformed five MLPs into Penicillium chrysogenum strains and analyzed changes in NRPS-derived metabolite profiles. Three of the five transformed MLPs increased the rate of nonribosomal peptide formation and elevated the concentrations of intermediate and final products of the penicillin, roquefortine, chrysogine, and fungisporin biosynthetic pathways. Our results suggest that even though MLPs are not found in the fungal domain of life, they can be used in fungal hosts as a tool for natural product discovery and biotechnological production.	0
Title: In vitro reconstitution of the first steps of anatoxin-a biosynthesis in Oscillatoria PCC 6506: from free L-proline to acyl carrier protein bound dehydroproline Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins. We recently reported the identification of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins in cyanobacteria and proposed a biosynthetic scheme starting from L-proline and involving three polyketide synthases for which the starter would be (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate bound to an acyl carrier protein, AnaD. We now report the in vitro reconstitution of the first steps of this biosynthesis in Oscillatoria PCC 6506. We identified in PCC 6506 the gene coding for an Sfp-like phosphopantetheinyl transferase and purified the gene product, OsPPT, that catalyzed the transfer of the phosphopantetheinyl arm to the serine 41 of AnaD. The pure adenylation protein AnaC loaded L-proline on holo-AnaD and was specific for L-proline (K(m) = 0.97 mM, k(cat) = 68 min(-1)) among the 20 natural amino acids. Among six close structural analogues of L-proline, including (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, we only found 3,4-dehydro-L-proline to be an alternate substrate for AnaC (K(m) = 1.5 mM, k(cat) = 29 min(-1)). The putative prolyl-AnaD dehydrogenase, AnaB, purified to homogeneity as a histidine-tagged protein, showed an absorption spectrum characteristic of FAD-containing proteins. It oxidized prolyl-AnaD to dehydroprolyl-AnaD as shown by tryptic digestion of the protein followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of this dehydrogenase with related enzymes showed that AnaB belongs to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily and thus probably catalyzes an alpha-beta-dehydrogenation of the thioester-bound proline followed by an aza-allylic isomerization to yield (S)-pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD, the proposed starter for the subsequent polyketide synthase, AnaE.	1
Title: Furobenzotropolones A, B and 3-Hydroxyepicoccone B with Antioxidative Activity from Mangrove Endophytic Fungus Epicoccum nigrum MLY-3 Abstract: Three new metabolites, furobenzotropolones A, B (1-2) with unusual benzene and dihydrofuran moieties and 3-hydroxyepicoccone B (3), together with seven known compounds (4-10) were obtained from the endophytic fungus Epicoccum nigrum MLY-3 isolated from the fresh leaf of mangrove plant Bruguiear gymnorrhiza collected from Zhuhai. Their structures were assigned by the analysis of UV, IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopic data. Compound 1 was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment using Cu Kα radiation. In antioxidant activities in vitro, compounds 2, 3, 5, and 8 showed promising DPPH· scavenging activity with IC50 values ranging from 14.7 to 29.3 µM. Compounds 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 exhibited promising potent activity in scavenging ABTS· with IC50 values in the range of 18-29.2 µM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ascorbic acid (IC50 = 33.6 ± 0.8 µM).	0
Title: Ubericin K, a New Pore-Forming Bacteriocin Targeting mannose-PTS Abstract: Bovine mastitis infection in dairy cattle is a significant economic burden for the dairy industry globally. To reduce the use of antibiotics in treatment of clinical mastitis, new alternative treatment options are needed. Antimicrobial peptides from bacteria, also known as bacteriocins, are potential alternatives for combating mastitis pathogens. In search of novel bacteriocins against mastitis pathogens, we screened samples of Norwegian bovine raw milk and found a Streptococcus uberis strain with potent antimicrobial activity toward Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Listeria, and Lactococcus. Whole-genome sequencing of the strain revealed a multibacteriocin gene cluster encoding one class IIb bacteriocin, two class IId bacteriocins, in addition to a three-component regulatory system and a dedicated ABC transporter. Isolation and purification of the antimicrobial activity from culture supernatants resulted in the detection of a 6.3-kDa mass peak by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a mass corresponding to the predicted size of one of the class IId bacteriocins. The identification of this bacteriocin, called ubericin K, was further confirmed by in vitro protein synthesis, which showed the same inhibitory spectrum as the purified antimicrobial compound. Ubericin K shows highest sequence similarity to the class IId bacteriocins bovicin 255, lactococcin A, and garvieacin Q. We found that ubericin K uses the sugar transporter mannose phosphotransferase (PTS) as a target receptor. Further, by using the pHlourin sensor system to detect intracellular pH changes due to leakage across the membrane, ubericin K was shown to be a pore former, killing target cells by membrane disruption. IMPORTANCE Bacterial infections in dairy cows are a major burden to farmers worldwide because infected cows require expensive treatments and produce less milk. Today, infected cows are treated with antibiotics, a practice that is becoming less effective due to antibiotic resistance. Compounds other than antibiotics also exist that kill bacteria causing infections in cows; these compounds, known as bacteriocins, are natural products produced by other bacteria in the environment. In this work, we discover a new bacteriocin that we call ubericin K, which kills several species of bacteria known to cause infections in dairy cows. We also use in vitro synthesis as a novel method for rapidly characterizing bacteriocins directly from genomic data, which could be useful for other researchers. We believe that ubericin K and the methods described in this work will aid in the transition away from antibiotics in the dairy industry.	1
Title: A PCR method to identify ochratoxin A-producing Aspergillus westerdijkiae strains on dried and aged foods Abstract: Ochratoxins are a group of mycotoxins that frequently occur as contaminants in agricultural commodities and foods, including dry-cured meats and cheeses. The fungus Aspergillus westerdijkiae is frequently isolated from aged foods and can produce ochratoxin A (OTA). However, individual strains of the fungus can have one of two OTA production phenotypes (chemotypes): OTA production and OTA nonproduction. Monitoring and early detection of OTA-producing fungi in food are the most effective strategies to manage OTA contamination. Therefore, we examined genome sequence data from five A. westerdijkiae strains isolated from the surface of cheese from southern Italy to identify genetic markers indicative of the twoOTA chemotypes. This analysis revealed a naturally occurring deletion of the OTA regulatory gene, otaR, in an OTA-nonproducing isolate.We used this information to design a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that could identify A. westerdijkiae and distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes. In this method, the PCR primers were complementary to conserved sequences flanking otaR and yielded different-sized amplicons from strains with the different chemotypes. The primers did not yield ota-region-specific amplicons from other OTA-producing species. Because the method is specific to A. westerdijkiae and can distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes, it has potential to significantly improve OTA monitoring programs.	1
Title: Repression of promoter activity by CNOT2, a subunit of the transcription regulatory Ccr4-not complex Abstract: The evolutionary conserved Ccr4-Not complex controls mRNA metabolism at multiple levels in eukaryotic cells. Genetic analysis of not mutants in yeast identifies a negative role in transcription, which is dependent on core promoter structure. To obtain direct support for this we targeted individual core subunits of the human Ccr4-Not complex to promoters in transient transfections of human cells. In this experimental setup we found that the CNOT2 and CNOT9(hRcd1/hCaf40) subunits act as repressors of reporter gene activity. Interestingly, recruitment of other Ccr4-Not subunits did not affect the reporter gene. The major repression function of CNOT2 is localized in a specialized protein motif, the Not-Box. This conserved motif is present in all CNOT2 orthologs and surprisingly also in CNOT3 orthologs. Repression by the Not-Box was sensitive to treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. In addition, mutation of a canonical TATA-box enhanced repression. Our experiments show for the first time direct regulation of promoter activity by components of the Ccr4-Not complex.	0
Title: Validating fragment-based drug discovery for biological RNAs: lead fragments bind and remodel the TPP riboswitch specifically Abstract: Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitches regulate essential genes in bacteria by changing conformation upon binding intracellular TPP. Previous studies using fragment-based approaches identified small molecule "fragments" that bind this gene-regulatory mRNA domain. Crystallographic studies now show that, despite having micromolar Kds, four different fragments bind the TPP riboswitch site-specifically, occupying the pocket that recognizes the aminopyrimidine of TPP. Unexpectedly, the unoccupied site that would recognize the pyrophosphate of TPP rearranges into a structure distinct from that of the cognate complex. This idiosyncratic fragment-induced conformation, also characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering and chemical probing, represents a possible mechanism for adventitious ligand discrimination by the riboswitch, and suggests that off-pathway conformations of RNAs can be targeted for drug development. Our structures, together with previous screening studies, demonstrate the feasibility of fragment-based drug discovery against RNA targets.	0
Title: Genome-wide association of functional traits linked with Campylobacter jejuni survival from farm to fork Abstract: Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, primarily associated with the consumption of contaminated poultry. C. jejuni lineages vary in host range and prevalence in human infection, suggesting differences in survival throughout the poultry processing chain. From 7343 MLST-characterised isolates, we sequenced 600 C. jejuni and C. coli isolates from various stages of poultry processing and clinical cases. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in C. jejuni ST-21 and ST-45 complexes identified genetic elements over-represented in clinical isolates that increased in frequency throughout the poultry processing chain. Disease-associated SNPs were distinct in these complexes, sometimes organised in haplotype blocks. The function of genes containing associated elements was investigated, demonstrating roles for cj1377c in formate metabolism, nuoK in aerobic survival and oxidative respiration, and cj1368-70 in nucleotide salvage. This work demonstrates the utility of GWAS for investigating transmission in natural zoonotic pathogen populations and provides evidence that major C. jejuni lineages have distinct genotypes associated with survival, within the host specific niche, from farm to fork.	0
Title: Transcriptional organization of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The transcriptional organization of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene (ery) cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea has been examined by a variety of methods, including S1 nuclease protection assays, Northern blotting, Western blotting, and bioconversion analysis of erythromycin intermediates. The analysis was facilitated by the construction of novel mutants containing a S. erythraea transcriptional terminator within the eryAI, eryAIII, eryBIII, eryBIV, eryBV, eryBVI, eryCIV, and eryCVI genes and additionally by an eryAI -10 promoter mutant. All mutant strains demonstrated polar effects on the transcription of downstream ery biosynthetic genes. Our results demonstrate that the ery gene cluster contains four major polycistronic transcriptional units, the largest one extending approximately 35 kb from eryAI to eryG. Two overlapping polycistronic transcripts extending from eryBIV to eryBVII were identified. In addition, seven ery cluster promoter transcription start sites, one each beginning at eryAI, eryBI, eryBIII, eryBVI, and eryK and two beginning at eryBIV, were determined.	1
Title: Identification of lysophospholipase protein from Spiroplasma eriocheiris and verification of its function Abstract: Spiroplasma eriocheiris is known to cause tremor disease in the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis; however, the molecular characterization of this pathogen is still unclear. S. eriocheiris has the ability to invade and survive within mouse 3T6 cells. The invasion process may require causing damage to the host cell membrane by chemical, physical or enzymatic means. In this study, we systematically characterized a novel lysophospholipase (lysoPL) of S. eriocheiris TDA-040725-5T. The gene that encodes lysoPL in S. eriocheiris (SE-LysoPL) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Enzymatic assays revealed that the purified recombinant SE-LysoPL hydrolysed long-chain acyl esterases at pH 7 and 30 °C. SE-LysoPL was detected in the membrane and cytoplasmic protein fractions using the SE-LysoPL antibody in Western blot. The virulence ability of S. eriocheiris was effectively reduced at the early stage of infection (m.o.i.=100) by the SE-LysoPL antibody neutralization test. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and characterize a gene from S. eriocheiris encoding a protein exhibiting lysoPL and esterase activities. Our findings indicate that SE-LysoPL plays important roles in the pathogenicity of S. eriocheiris.	0
Title: Unlocking Cryptic Metabolites with Mass Spectrometry-Guided Transposon Mutant Selection Abstract: The products of most secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have yet to be discovered, in part due to low expression levels in laboratory cultures. Reporter-guided mutant selection (RGMS) has recently been developed for this purpose: a mutant library is generated and screened, using genetic reporters to a chosen BGC, to select transcriptionally active mutants that then enable the characterization of the "cryptic" metabolite. The requirement for genetic reporters limits the approach to a single pathway within genetically tractable microorganisms. Herein, we utilize untargeted metabolomics in conjunction with transposon mutagenesis to provide a global read-out of secondary metabolism across large numbers of mutants. We employ self-organizing map analytics and imaging mass spectrometry to identify and characterize seven cryptic metabolites from mutant libraries of two different Burkholderia species. Applications of the methodologies reported can expand our understanding of the products and regulation of cryptic BGCs across phylogenetically diverse bacteria.	0
Title: Genome-Mining-Based Discovery of the Cyclic Peptide Tolypamide and TolF, a Ser/Thr Forward O-Prenyltransferase Abstract: Cyanobactins comprise a widespread group of peptide metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that are often diversified by post-translational prenylation. Several enzymes have been identified in cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways that carry out chemically diverse prenylation reactions, representing a resource for the discovery of post-translational alkylating agents. Here, genome mining was used to identify orphan cyanobactin prenyltransferases, leading to the isolation of tolypamide from the freshwater cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. The structure of tolypamide was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, degradation, and enzymatic total synthesis. Tolypamide is forward-prenylated on a threonine residue, representing an unprecedented post-translational modification. Biochemical characterization of the cognate enzyme TolF revealed a prenyltransferase with strict selectivity for forward O-prenylation of serine or threonine but with relaxed substrate selectivity for flanking peptide sequences. Since cyanobactin pathways often exhibit exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, these enzymes represent robust tools for synthetic biology.	1
Title: Functional analysis and subcellular localization of two geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases from Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The filamentous fungus Penicillium paxilli contains two distinct geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthases, GgsA and GgsB (PaxG). PaxG and its homologues in Neotyphodium lolii and Fusarium fujikuroi are associated with diterpene secondary metabolite gene clusters. The genomes of other filamentous fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae and Fusarium graminearum also contain two or more copies of GGPP synthase genes, although the diterpene metabolite capability of these fungi is not known. The objective of this study was to understand the biological significance of the presence of two copies of GGPP synthases in P. paxilli by investigating their subcellular localization. Using a carotenoid complementation assay and gene deletion analysis, we show that P. paxilli GgsA and PaxG have GGPP synthase activities and that paxG is required for paxilline biosynthesis, respectively. In the DeltapaxG mutant background ggsA was unable to complement paxilline biosynthesis. A GgsA-EGFP fusion protein was localized to punctuate organelles and the EGFP-GRV fusion protein, containing the C-terminus tripeptide GRV of PaxG, was localized to peroxisomes. A truncated PaxG mutant lacking the C-terminus tripeptide GRV was unable to complement a DeltapaxG mutant demonstrating that the tripeptide is functionally important for paxilline biosynthesis.	1
Title: Probing the regiospecificity of enzyme-catalyzed steroid glycosylation Abstract: The potential of a uniquely permissive engineered glycosyltransferase (OleD ASP) as a catalyst for steroid glycosylation is highlighted. The ability of OleD ASP to glucosylate a range of cardenolides and bufadienolides was assessed using a rapid LC-UV/MS-SPE-NMR analytical platform. While a bias toward OleD-catalyzed C3 monoglucosylation was observed, subtle alterations of the steroidal architecture, in some cases, invoked diglucosylation or, in one case (digoxigenin), C12 glucosylation. This latter case represents the first, and highly efficient, synthesis of digoxigenin 12-O-β-D-glucoside.	0
Title: An Aspergillus flavus secondary metabolic gene cluster containing a hybrid PKS-NRPS is necessary for synthesis of the 2-pyridones, leporins Abstract: The genome of the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus flavus, has been shown to harbor as many as 56 putative secondary metabolic gene clusters including the one responsible for production of the toxic and carcinogenic, polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived aflatoxins. Except for the production of aflatoxins, cyclopiazonic acid and several other metabolites the capability for metabolite production of most of these putative clusters is unknown. We investigated the regulation of expression of the PKS-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) containing cluster 23 and determined that it produces homologs of the known 2-pyridone leporin A. Inactivation and overexpression of a cluster 23 gene encoding a putative Zn(2)-Cys(6) transcription factor (AFLA_066900, lepE) resulted in downregulation of nine and up-regulation of 8, respectively, of the fifteen SMURF-predicted cluster 23 genes thus allowing delineation of the cluster. Overexpression of lepE (OE::lepE) resulted in transformants displaying orange-red pigmented hyphae. Mass spectral analysis of A. flavus OE::lepE extracts identified the known 2-pyridone metabolite, leporin B, as well as the previously unreported dehydroxy-precursor, leporin C. We provide strong evidence that leporin B forms a unique trimeric complex with iron, not found previously for other 2-pyridones. This iron complex demonstrated antiinsectan and antifeedant properties similar to those previously found for leporin A. The OE::lepE strain showed reduced levels of conidia and sclerotia suggesting that unscheduled leporin production affects fungal developmental programs.	1
Title: Insertional inactivation of mtrX and mtrY genes from the mithramycin gene cluster affects production and growth of the producer organism Streptomyces argillaceus Abstract: Mithramycin is an antitumor aromatic polyketide synthesized by Streptomyces argillaceus. Two genes (mtrX and mtrY) of the mithramycin gene cluster were inactivated by gene replacement. Inactivation of mtrX, that encodes an ABC excision nuclease system for DNA repair, produced a mutant that was affected in the normal rate of growth. Expression of mtrX in Streptomyces albus in a multicopy plasmid vector conferred a low increase in resistance to mithramycin. Inactivation of mtrY, that encodes a protein of unknown function, produced a 50% decrease in mithramycin biosynthesis. When mtrY was expressed in the wild-type S. argillaceus in a multicopy plasmid, this caused about 47% increase in the levels of mithramycin production. It is proposed that mtrX and mtrY could code for a secondary defense mechanism and a mithramycin regulatory element, respectively.	1
Title: Characterization of two glycosyltransferases involved in early glycosylation steps during biosynthesis of the antitumor polyketide mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus Abstract: A 2,580-bp region of the chromosome of Streptomyces argillaceus, the producer of the antitumor polyketide mithramycin, was sequenced. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of two genes (mtmGIII and mtmGIV) encoding proteins that showed a high degree of similarity to glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of various antibiotics and antitumor drugs. Independent insertional inactivation of both genes produced mutants that did not synthesize mithramycin but accumulated several mithramycin intermediates. Both mutants accumulated premithramycinone, a non-glycosylated intermediate in mithramycin biosynthesis. The mutant affected in the mtmGIII gene also accumulated premithramycin A1, which contains premithramycinone as the aglycon unit and a D-olivose attached at C-12a-O. These experiments demonstrate that the glycosyltransferases MtmGIV and MtmGIII catalyze the first two glycosylation steps in mithramycin biosynthesis. A model is proposed for the glycosylation steps in mithramycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of the Phenalamide Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Myxococcus stipitatus DSM 14675 Abstract: Phenalamide is a bioactive secondary metabolite produced by Myxococcus stipitatus. We identified a 56 kb phenalamide biosynthetic gene cluster from M. stipitatus DSM 14675 by genomic sequence analysis and mutational analysis. The cluster is comprised of 12 genes (MYSTI_04318-MYSTI_04329) encoding three pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits, eight polyketide synthase modules, a non-ribosomal peptide synthase module, a hypothetical protein, and a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding protein. Disruption of the MYSTI_04324 or MYSTI_04325 genes by plasmid insertion resulted in a defect in phenalamide production. The organization of the phenalamide biosynthetic modules encoded by the fifth to tenth genes (MYSTI_04320-MYSTI_04325) was very similar to that of the myxalamid biosynthetic gene cluster from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15, as expected from similar backbone structures of the two substances. However, the loading module and the first extension module of the phenalamide synthase encoded by the first to fourth genes (MYSTI_04326-MYSTI_04329) were found only in the phenalamide biosynthetic gene cluster from M. stipitatus DSM 14675.	1
Title: Nematode Signaling Molecules Are Extensively Metabolized by Animals, Plants, and Microorganisms Abstract: Many bacterivorous and parasitic nematodes secrete signaling molecules called ascarosides that play a central role regulating their behavior and development. Combining stable-isotope labeling and mass spectrometry-based comparative metabolomics, here we show that ascarosides are taken up from the environment and metabolized by a wide range of phyla, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and mammals, as well as nematodes. In most tested eukaryotes and some bacteria, ascarosides are metabolized into derivatives with shortened fatty acid side chains, analogous to ascaroside biosynthesis in nematodes. In plants and C. elegans, labeled ascarosides were additionally integrated into larger, modular metabolites, and use of different ascaroside stereoisomers revealed the stereospecificity of their biosynthesis. The finding that nematodes extensively metabolize ascarosides taken up from the environment suggests that pheromone editing may play a role in conspecific and interspecific interactions. Moreover, our results indicate that plants, animals, and microorganisms may interact with associated nematodes via manipulation of ascaroside signaling.	0
Title: Long-Lived, Non-Geminate, Radiative Recombination of Photogenerated Charges in a Polymer/Small-Molecule Acceptor Photovoltaic Blend Abstract: Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency.	0
Title: In Vitro Biosynthesis of the Core Scaffold of the Thiopeptide Thiomuracin Abstract: Thiopeptides are potent antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. They are made by a remarkable post-translational modification process that transforms a linear peptide into a polycyclic structure. We present here the in vitro biosynthesis of the core scaffold of thiomuracin catalyzed by six proteins. We show that cyclodehydration precedes dehydration, and that dehydration is catalyzed by two proteins in a tRNA(Glu)-dependent manner. The enzyme that generates the pyridine core from two dehydroalanines ejects the leader peptide as a C-terminal carboxamide. Mutagenesis studies of the enzyme TbtD identified important residues for a formal [4+2] cycloaddition process. The core structure of thiomuracin exhibits similar antimicrobial activity to other known congeners, illustrating that in vitro biosynthesis is a viable route to potent antibiotics that can be explored for the rapid and renewable generation of analogues.	1
Title: New natural products identified by combined genomics-metabolomics profiling of marine Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 Abstract: Marine actinobacteria are drawing more and more attention as a promising source of new natural products. Here we report isolation, genome sequencing and metabolic profiling of new strain Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 isolated from marine sediment sample collected in the Trondheim Fjord, Norway. The 16S rRNA and multilocus phylogenetic analysis showed that MP131-18 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The genome of MP131-18 isolate was sequenced, and 36 gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of 18 different types of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain led to the identification of several new biologically active compounds. As a result, the family of bisindole pyrroles spiroindimicins was extended with two new members, spiroindimicins E and F. Furthermore, prediction of the biosynthetic pathway for unusual α-pyrone lagunapyrone isolated from MP131-18 resulted in foresight and identification of two new compounds of this family - lagunapyrones D and E. The diversity of identified and predicted compounds from Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 demonstrates that marine-derived actinomycetes are not only a promising source of new natural products, but also represent a valuable pool of genes for combinatorial biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Self-Assembling NanoLuc Luciferase Fragments as Probes for Protein Aggregation in Living Cells Abstract: Given the clear role of protein aggregation in human disease, there is a critical need for assays capable of quantifying protein aggregation in living systems. We hypothesized that the inherently low background and biocompatibility of luminescence signal readouts could provide a potential solution to this problem. Herein, we describe a set of self-assembling NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc) fragments that produce a tunable luminescence readout that is dependent upon the solubility of a target protein fused to the N-terminal Nluc fragment. To demonstrate this approach, we employed this assay in bacteria to assess mutations known to disrupt amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation as well as disease-relevant mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's diseases. The luminescence signal from these experiments correlates with the reported aggregation potential of these Aβ mutants and reinforces the increased aggregation potential of disease-relevant mutations in Aβ1-42. To further demonstrate the utility of this approach, we show that the effect of small molecule inhibitors on Aβ aggregation can be monitored using this system. In addition, we demonstrate that aggregation assays can be ported into mammalian cells. Taken together, these results indicate that this platform could be used to rapidly screen for mutations that influence protein aggregation as well as inhibitors of protein aggregation. This method offers a novel, genetically encodable luminescence readout of protein aggregation in living cells.	0
Title: Rapid screening of cellular stress responses in recombinant Pichia pastoris strains using metabolite profiling Abstract: Heterologous protein production in the yeast Pichia pastoris can be limited by biological responses to high expression levels; the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a key determinant of the success of protein production in this organism. Here, we used untargeted NMR metabolic profiling (metabolomics) of a number of different recombinant strains, carried out in a miniaturized format suitable for screening-level experiments. We identified a number of metabolites (from both cell extracts and supernatants) which correlated well with UPR-relevant gene transcripts, and so could be potential biomarkers for future high-throughput screening of large numbers of P. pastoris clones.	0
Title: Gold-catalyzed enantioselective ring-expanding cycloisomerization of cyclopropylidene bearing 1,5-enynes Abstract: An enantioselective ring-expanding cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes bearing a cyclopropylidene moiety has been developed. This methodology provides a new approach to bicyclo[4.2.0]octanes, a structural motif present in many biologically active natural products.	0
Title: Ligand-Enabled β-C(sp3)-H Olefination of Free Carboxylic Acids Abstract: An acetyl-protected aminoethyl phenyl thioether has been developed to promote C(sp3)-H activation. Significant ligand enhancement is demonstrated by the realization of the first Pd(II)-catalyzed olefination of C(sp3)-H bonds of free carboxylic acids without using an auxiliary. Subsequent lactonization of the olefinated product via 1,4 addition provided exclusively monoselectivity in the presence of multiple β-C-H bonds. The product γ-lactone can be readily opened to give either the highly valuable β-olefinated or γ-hydroxylated aliphatic acids. Considering the challenges in developing Heck couplings using alkyl halides, this reaction offers a useful alternative.	0
Title: Competition between a Lawn-Forming Cynodon dactylon and a Tufted Grass Species Hyparrhenia hirta on a South-African Dystrophic Savanna Abstract: South African savanna grasslands are often characterised by indigestible tufted grass species whereas lawn grasses are far more desirable in terms of herbivore sustenance. We aimed to investigate the role of nutrients and/or the disturbance (grazing, trampling) by herbivores on the formation of grazing lawns. We conducted a series of common garden experiments to test the effect of nutrients on interspecific competition between a typical lawn-forming grass species (Cynodon dactylon) and a species that is frequently found outside grazing lawns (Hyparrhenia hirta), and tested for the effect of herbivore disturbance in the form of trampling and clipping. We also performed a vegetation and herbivore survey to apply experimentally derived insights to field observations. Our results showed that interspecific competition was not affected by soil nutrient concentrations. C. dactylon did show much more resilience to disturbance than H. hirta, presumably due to the regenerative capacity of its rhizomes. Results from the field survey were in line with these findings, describing a correlation between herbivore pressure and C. dactylon abundance. We conclude that herbivore disturbance, and not soil nutrients, provide C. dactylon with a competitive advantage over H. hirta, due to vegetative regeneration from its rhizomes. This provides evidence for the importance of concentrated, high herbivore densities for the creation and maintenance of grazing lawns.	0
Title: Simplified Monopalmitoyl Toll-like Receptor 2 Ligand Mini-UPam for Self-Adjuvanting Neoantigen-Based Synthetic Cancer Vaccines Abstract: Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3 CysSK4 . A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini-UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T-cell therapy. Homogeneous mini-UPam-SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid-phase synthesis that employed a mini-UPam building block pre-prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc-amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini-UPam-SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T-cells.	0
Title: Novel LanT associated lantibiotic clusters identified by genome database mining Abstract: Background:                       Frequent use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. Nisin is the oldest and the most widely used lantibiotic, in food preservation, without having developed any significant resistance against it. Having their antimicrobial potential and a limited number, there is a need to identify novel lantibiotics.                  Methodology/findings:                       Identification of novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters from an ever increasing database of bacterial genomes, can provide a major lead in this direction. In order to achieve this, a strategy was adopted to identify novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters by screening the sequenced genomes for LanT homolog, which is a conserved lantibiotic transporter specific to type IB clusters. This strategy resulted in identification of 54 bacterial strains containing the LanT homologs, which are not the known lantibiotic producers. Of these, 24 strains were subjected to a detailed bioinformatic analysis to identify genes encoding for precursor peptides, modification enzyme, immunity and quorum sensing proteins. Eight clusters having two LanM determinants, similar to haloduracin and lichenicidin were identified, along with 13 clusters having a single LanM determinant as in mersacidin biosynthetic cluster. Besides these, orphan LanT homologs were also identified which might be associated with novel bacteriocins, encoded somewhere else in the genome. Three identified gene clusters had a C39 domain containing LanT transporter, associated with the LanBC proteins and double glycine type precursor peptides, the only known example of such a cluster is that of salivaricin.                  Conclusion:                       This study led to the identification of 8 novel putative two-component lantibiotic clusters along with 13 having a single LanM and 3 with LanBC genes. Putative lantibiotic clusters identified here hold the potential for the discovery of novel lantibiotic(s).	1
Title: A spectinomycin resistance determinant from the spectinomycin producer Streptomyces flavopersicus Abstract: The spectinomycin (sp) resistance determinant from Streptomyces flavopersicus was cloned into Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ699. A plasmid, pDGL15, with a 3.65 kb insert from S. flavopersicus conferring resistance to Sp was isolated. DNA sequence analysis of the 3651 1 bp DNA insert revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). The amino acid sequence deduced from one ORF (SpcN) showed a high degree of similarity to an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (StrN) and from a second one (SpcR) to a regulatory protein (StrR) of the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from S. griseus. The two other ORFs were incomplete and the deduced amino acid sequences showed similarities to an amidinotransferase encoded in the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of S. griseus and to the transposase of IS112, respectively. Expression of the spcN gene in E. coli under the control of tac promoter conferred Sp resistance to the cells. An enzymic assay confirmed that the gene product of spcN is an ATP-dependent aminoglycoside phosphotransferase which phosphorylates Sp and actinamine, the aminocyclitol moiety of Sp.	1
Title: Discovery and Biosynthesis of Tetrachlorizine Reveals Enzymatic Benzylic Dehydrogenation via an ortho-Quinone Methide Abstract: Ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs) are reactive intermediates in biosynthesis that give rise to a variety of intra- and intermolecular cyclization/addition products in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Herein, we report a new metabolic deviation of an o-QM intermediate in a benzylic dehydrogenation reaction that links the newly described marine bacterial natural products dihydrotetrachlorizine and tetrachlorizine. We discovered these novel dichloropyrrole-containing compounds from actinomycete strain AJS-327 that unexpectedly harbors in its genome a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of striking similarity to that of chlorizidine, another marine alkaloid bearing a different carbon skeleton. Heterologous expression of the homologous flavin-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes Tcz9 and Clz9 revealed their native functions in tetrachlorizine and chlorizidine biosynthesis, respectively, supporting divergent oxidative dehydrogenation and pyrrolizine-forming reactions. Swapping these berberine bridge enzyme-like oxidoreductases, we produced cyclized and dehydrogenated analogs of tetrachlorizine and chlorizidine, including a dearomatized chlorizidine analog that stabilizes an o-QM via conjugation with a 3H-pyrrolizine ring.	1
Title: Thymine DNA glycosylase specifically recognizes 5-carboxylcytosine-modified DNA Abstract: Human thymine DNA glycosylase (hTDG) efficiently excises 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), a key oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA, in a recently discovered cytosine demethylation pathway. We present here the crystal structures of the hTDG catalytic domain in complex with duplex DNA containing either 5caC or a fluorinated analog. These structures, together with biochemical and computational analyses, reveal that 5caC is specifically recognized in the active site of hTDG, supporting the role of TDG in mammalian 5-methylcytosine demethylation.	0
Title: Chrysogine Biosynthesis Is Mediated by a Two-Module Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Abstract: Production of chrysogine has been reported from several fungal genera including Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium. Anthranilic acid and pyruvic acid, which are expected precursors of chrysogine, enhance production of this compound. A possible route for the biosynthesis using these substrates is via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Through comparative analysis of the NRPSs from genome-sequenced producers of chrysogine we identified a candidate NRPS cluster comprising five additional genes named chry2-6. Deletion of the two-module NRPS (NRPS14 = chry1) abolished chrysogine production in Fusarium graminearum, indicating that the gene cluster is responsible for chrysogine biosynthesis. Overexpression of NRPS14 enhanced chrysogine production, suggesting that the NRPS is the bottleneck in the biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Activity of the quorum-sensing regulator TraR of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is inhibited by a truncated, dominant defective TraR-like protein Abstract: Horizontal transfer of Agrobacterium tumefaciens tumour-inducing plasmids requires opines, which are released from plant tumours as nutrients for the bacteria. The opine octopine causes synthesis of the quorum-sensing TraR protein, which activates several tra promoters in the presence of a pheromone called Agrobacterium autoinducer (AAI). A gene, traS, was previously found on the same Ti plasmid in an operon that directs the uptake of mannopine, another opine. TraS strongly resembles TraR but lacks a DNA-binding module. TraS did not activate a TraR-dependent promoter and blocked TraR function, probably by forming inactive heteromultimers. Expression of traS was induced by mannopine, although this induction was strongly inhibited by the favoured catabolites succinate, glutamine and tryptone. Mannopine inhibited conjugation in a TraS-dependent fashion, and artificial overexpression of TraS also inhibited conjugation. Favoured catabolites restored tra gene expression in wild-type strains but not in strains that overexpress TraS. Downstream of traS is a gene encoding a truncated, defective chemoreceptor whose expression abolished chemotaxis.	0
Title: Structural insights into enzymatic [4+2] aza-cycloaddition in thiopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is an enabling transformation in modern synthetic organic chemistry, but there are only limited examples of dedicated natural enzymes that can catalyze this transformation. Thiopeptides (or more formally thiazolyl peptides) are a class of thiazole-containing, highly modified, macrocyclic secondary metabolites made from ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides. The characteristic feature of these natural products is a six-membered nitrogenous heterocycle that is assembled via a formal [4+2] cycloaddition between two dehydroalanine (Dha) residues. This heteroannulation is entirely contingent on enzyme activity, although the mechanism of the requisite pyridine/dehydropiperidine synthase remains to be elucidated. The unusual aza-cylic product is distinct from the more common carbocyclic products of synthetic and biosynthetic [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. To elucidate the mechanism of cycloaddition, we have determined atomic resolution structures of the pyridine synthases involved in the biosynthesis of the thiopeptides thiomuracin (TbtD) and GE2270A (PbtD), in complex with substrates and product analogs. Structure-guided biochemical, mutational, computational, and binding studies elucidate active-site features that explain how orthologs can generate rigid macrocyclic scaffolds of different sizes. Notably, the pyridine synthases show structural similarity to the elimination domain of lanthipeptide dehydratases, wherein insertions of secondary structural elements result in the formation of a distinct active site that catalyzes different chemistry. Comparative analysis identifies other catalysts that contain a shared core protein fold but whose active sites are located in entirely different regions, illustrating a principle predicted from efforts in de novo protein design.	1
Title: Elucidation of the concise biosynthetic pathway of the communesin indole alkaloids Abstract: The communesins are a prominent class of indole alkaloids isolated from Penicillium species. Owing to their daunting structural framework and potential as pharmaceuticals, communesins have inspired numerous synthetic studies. However, the genetic and biochemical basis of communesin biosynthesis has remained unexplored. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of the communesin (cns) biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium expansum. We confirmed that communesin is biosynthesized by the coupling of tryptamine and aurantioclavine, two building blocks derived from L-tryptophan. The postmodification steps were mapped by targeted-gene-deletion experiments and the structural elucidation of intermediates and new analogues. Our studies set the stage for the biochemical characterization of communesin biosynthesis. This knowledge will aid our understanding of how nature generates remarkable structural complexity from simple precursors.	1
Title: New insights into paulomycin biosynthesis pathway in Streptomyces albus J1074 and generation of novel derivatives by combinatorial biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces albus J1074 produces glycosylated antibiotics paulomycin A, B and E that derive from chorismate and contain an isothiocyanate residue in form of paulic acid. Paulomycins biosynthesis pathway involves two glycosyltransferases, three acyltransferases, enzymes required for paulic acid biosynthesis (in particular an aminotransferase and a sulfotransferase), and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of two deoxysugar moieties: D-allose and L-paulomycose.                  Results:                       Inactivation of genes encoding enzymes involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis, paulic acid biosynthesis, deoxysugar transfer, and acyl moieties transfer has allowed the identification of several biosynthetic intermediates and shunt products, derived from paulomycin intermediates, and to propose a refined version of the paulomycin biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, several novel bioactive derivatives of paulomycins carrying modifications in the L-paulomycose moiety have been generated by combinatorial biosynthesis using different plasmids that direct the biosynthesis of alternative deoxyhexoses.                  Conclusions:                       The paulomycins biosynthesis pathway has been defined by inactivation of genes encoding glycosyltransferases, acyltransferases and enzymes involved in paulic acid and L-paulomycose biosynthesis. These experiments have allowed the assignment of each of these genes to specific paulomycin biosynthesis steps based on characterization of products accumulated by the corresponding mutant strains. In addition, novel derivatives of paulomycin A and B containing L-paulomycose modified moieties were generated by combinatorial biosynthesis. The production of such derivatives shows that L-paulomycosyl glycosyltransferase Plm12 possesses a certain degree of flexibility for the transfer of different deoxysugars. In addition, the pyruvate dehydrogenase system form by Plm8 and Plm9 is also flexible to catalyze the attachment of a two-carbon side chain, derived from pyruvate, into both 2,6-dideoxyhexoses and 2,3,6-trideoxyhexoses. The activity of the novel paulomycin derivatives carrying modifications in the L-paulomycose moiety is lower than the original compounds pointing to some interesting structure-activity relationships.	1
Title: Full-Length Nucleotide Sequences of mcr-1-Harboring Plasmids Isolated from Extended-Spectrum-β-Lactamase-Producing Escherichia coli Isolates of Different Origins Abstract: Here, we present the full sequences of three mcr-1-carrying plasmids isolated from extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli The plasmids belong to three different replicon types and are 34,640 bp, 209,401 bp, and 247,885 bp in size. We describe for the first time a composite transposon containing mcr-1 localized on a multidrug-resistant (MDR) IncHI2 plasmid harboring additional determinants of resistance to six different classes of antibiotics, including the ESBL gene blaCTX-M-1, and heavy metal resistance.	0
Title: Controllable hydrogen sulfide donors and their activity against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), known as an important cellular signaling molecule, plays critical roles in many physiological and/or pathological processes. Modulation of H2S levels could have tremendous therapeutic value. However, the study on H2S has been hindered due to the lack of controllable H2S releasing agents that could mimic the slow and moderate H2S release in vivo. In this work we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a new class of controllable H2S donors. Twenty-five donors were prepared and tested. Their structures were based on a perthiol template, which was suggested to be involved in H2S biosynthesis. H2S release mechanism from these donors was studied and proved to be thiol-dependent. We also developed a series of cell-based assays to access their H2S-related activities. H9c2 cardiac myocytes were used in these experiments. We tested lead donors' cytotoxicity and confirmed their H2S production in cells. Finally we demonstrated that selected donors showed potent protective effects in an in vivo murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, through a H2S-related mechanism.	0
Title: 2-Alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acids, antibiotic production inducers discovered by Streptomyces coelicolor genome mining Abstract: All of the genetic elements necessary for the production of the antibiotic methylenomycin (Mm) and its regulation are contained within the 22-kb mmy-mmf gene cluster, which is located on the 356-kb linear plasmid SCP1 of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). A putative operon of 3 genes within this gene cluster, mmfLHP, was proposed to direct the biosynthesis of an A-factor-like signaling molecule, which could play a role in the regulation of Mm biosynthesis. The mmfLHP operon was expressed under the control of its native promoter in S. coelicolor M512, a host lacking the SCP1 plasmid, and the ability to produce prodiginine and actinorhodin antibiotics. Comparative metabolic profiling led to the identification and structure elucidation of a family of 5 new 2-alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acids (AHFCAs), collectively termed Mm furans (MMFs), as the products of the mmfLHP genes. MMFs specifically induce the production of the Mm antibiotics in S. coelicolor. Comparative genomics analyses and searches of the natural product chemistry literature indicated that other streptomycetes may produce AHFCAs, suggesting that they could form a general class of antibiotic biosynthesis inducers in Streptomyces species, with analogous functions to the better known gamma-butyrolactone regulatory molecules.	1
Title: Identification of a set of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the aminonucleoside moiety of antibiotic A201A from Streptomyces capreolus Abstract: A novel cosmid (pABC6.5) whose DNA insert from Streptomyces capreolus, the A201A antibiotic producer, overlaps the inserts of the previously reported pCAR11 and pCAR13 cosmids, has been isolated. These two latter cosmids were known to contain the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A resistance determinants ard2 and ard1, respectively. Together, these three cosmids have permitted the identification of a DNA stretch of 19 kb between ard1 and ard2, which should comprise a large region of a putative A201A biosynthetic (ata) gene cluster. The sequence of the 7 kb upstream of ard1 towards ard2 reveals seven consecutive open reading frames: ataP3, ataP5, ataP4, ataP10, ataP7, ata12 and ataPKS1. Except for the last two, their deduced products present high similarities to an identical number of counterparts from the pur cluster of Streptomyces alboniger that were either known or proposed to be implicated in the biosynthesis of the N6,N6-dimethyl-3'-amino-3'-deoxyadenosine moiety of puromycin. Because A201A contains this chemical moiety, these ataP genes are most likely implicated in its biosynthesis. Accordingly, the ataP4, ataP5 and ataP10 genes complemented specific puromycin nonproducing Deltapur4, Deltapur5 and Deltapur10 mutants of S. alboniger, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that ata12 and ataPKS1 could be implicated in the biosynthesis of the d-rhamnose and alpha-p-coumaric acid moieties of A201A. Further sequencing of 2 kb of DNA downstream of ard1 has disclosed a region which might contain one end of the ata cluster.	1
Title: Involvement of the Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase IfnQ in the Biosynthesis of Isofuranonaphthoquinone Scaffold of JBIR-76 and -77 Abstract: JBIR-76 and -77 are isofuranonaphthoquinones (IFNQs) isolated from Streptomyces sp. RI-77. Draft genome sequencing and gene disruption analysis of Streptomyces sp. RI-77 showed that a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster (ifn cluster) was responsible for the biosynthesis of JBIR-76 and -77. It was envisaged that an octaketide intermediate (C16 ) could be synthesized by the minimal PKS (IfnANO) and that formation of the IFNQ scaffold (C13 ) would therefore require a C-C bond cleavage reaction. An ifnQ disruptant accumulated some shunt products (C15 ), which were presumably produced by spontaneous cyclization of the decarboxylated octaketide intermediate. Recombinant IfnQ catalyzed the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 1-(2-naphthyl)acetone, an analogue of the bicyclic octaketide intermediate. Based on these results, we propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of JBIR-76 and -77, involving IfnQ-catalyzed C-C bond cleavage as a key step in the formation of the IFNQ scaffold.	1
Title: Genome mining of a prenylated and immunosuppressive polyketide from pathogenic fungi Abstract: Activation of the polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferase (pcPTase)-containing silent clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri led to isolation of a new metabolite neosartoricin (3). The structure of 3 was solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR to be a prenylated anthracenone. 3 exhibits T-cell antiproliferative activity with an IC(50) of 3 μM, suggestive of a physiological role as an immunosuppressive agent.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the pyrrolomycin biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum ATCC 31673 and Streptomyces sp. strain UC 11065 Abstract: The pyrrolomycins are a family of polyketide antibiotics, some of which contain a nitro group. To gain insight into the nitration mechanism associated with the formation of these antibiotics, the pyrrolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum was cloned. Sequencing of ca. 56 kb of A. vitaminophilum DNA revealed 35 open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence analysis revealed a clear relationship between some of these ORFs and the biosynthetic gene cluster for pyoluteorin, a structurally related antibiotic. Since a gene transfer system could not be devised for A. vitaminophilum, additional proof for the identity of the cloned gene cluster was sought by cloning the pyrrolomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. strain UC 11065, a transformable pyrrolomycin producer. Sequencing of ca. 26 kb of UC 11065 DNA revealed the presence of 17 ORFs, 15 of which exhibit strong similarity to ORFs in the A. vitaminophilum cluster as well as a nearly identical organization. Single-crossover disruption of two genes in the UC 11065 cluster abolished pyrrolomycin production in both cases. These results confirm that the genetic locus cloned from UC 11065 is essential for pyrrolomycin production, and they also confirm that the highly similar locus in A. vitaminophilum encodes pyrrolomycin biosynthetic genes. Sequence analysis revealed that both clusters contain genes encoding the two components of an assimilatory nitrate reductase. This finding suggests that nitrite is required for the formation of the nitrated pyrrolomycins. However, sequence analysis did not provide additional insights into the nitration process, suggesting the operation of a novel nitration mechanism.	1
Title: A Candida albicans cell wall-linked protein promotes invasive filamentation into semi-solid medium Abstract: Growth of cells in contact with an abiotic or biological surface profoundly affects cellular physiology. In the opportunistic human pathogen, Candida albicans, growth on a semi-solid matrix such as agar results in invasive filamentation, a process in which cells change their morphology to highly elongated filamentous hyphae that grow into the matrix. We hypothesized that a plasma membrane receptor-type protein would sense the presence of matrix and activate a signal transduction cascade, thus promoting invasive filamentation. In this communication, we demonstrate that during growth in contact with a semi-solid surface, activation of a MAP kinase, Cek1p, is promoted, in part, by a plasma membrane protein termed Dfi1p and results in invasive filamentation. A C. albicans mutant lacking Dfi1p showed reduced virulence in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. Dfi1p is a relatively small, integral membrane protein that localizes to the plasma membrane. Some Dfi1p molecules become cross-linked to the carbohydrate polymers of the cell wall. Thus, Dfi1p is capable of linking the cell wall to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm.	0
Title: The last three consecutive epidermal growth factor-like structures of human thrombomodulin comprise the minimum functional domain for protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity Abstract: We have identified a minimum functional domain of human thrombomodulin for anticoagulant activity using deletion analysis. Four mutants were constructed by site-directed deletion mutagenesis to delete one or more epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures from the domain of human thrombomodulin containing six repeated EGF-like structures. These deletion mutants were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and their protein C-activating cofactor activities in the culture medium were examined. One mutant protein, E456, which contains the fourth, fifth, and sixth EGF-like structures expresses apparent cofactor activity. However, neither E456-N24 (24 NH2-terminal-residue deletion) nor E456-C16 (16 COOH-terminal-residue deletion) have cofactor activity. E456 was partially purified and its anticoagulant effects on plasma clotting time and platelet aggregation examined. E456 expressed almost the same anticoagulant activities as D123 which contains six consecutive EGF-like structures of thrombomodulin. It was concluded that E456 is the minimum functional domain for both protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity.	0
Title: Identification of the Fluvirucin B2 (Sch 38518) Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Actinomadura fulva subsp. indica ATCC 53714: substrate Specificity of the β-Amino Acid Selective Adenylating Enzyme FlvN Abstract: Fluvirucins are 14-membered macrolactam polyketides that show antifungal and antivirus activities. Fluvirucins have the β-alanine starter unit at their polyketide skeletons. To understand the construction mechanism of the β-alanine moiety in fluvirucin biosyntheses, we have identified the biosynthetic cluster of fluvirucin B2 produced from Actinomadura fulva subsp. indica ATCC 53714. The identified gene cluster contains three polyketide synthases, four characteristic β-amino acid-carrying enzymes, one decarboxylase, and one amidohydrolase. We next investigated the activity of the adenylation enzyme FlvN, which is a key enzyme for the selective incorporation of a β-amino acid substrate. FlvN showed strong preference for l-aspartate over other amino acids such as β-alanine. Based on these results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for fluvirucin B2.	1
Title: Direct prenylation of aromatic and alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxamides via iridium-catalyzed C-H oxidative addition-allene insertion Abstract: Exposure of aromatic carboxamides 1e-1m, heteroaromatic carboxamides 1n-1p, and alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxamides 1q-1s to 1,1-dimethylallene in the presence of the a cationic iridium complex derived from [Ir(cod)(2)]BAr(F)(4) and rac-BINAP results in direct C-H prenylation to furnish adducts 2e-2m, 2n-2p, and 2q-2s, respectively, in good isolated yields as single isomers.	0
Title: Nucleotide polymorphism assay for the identification of west African group Bacillus anthracis: a lineage lacking anthrose Abstract: Background:                       The exosporium of the anthrax-causing Bacillus anthracis endospores display a tetrasaccharide composed of three rhamnose residues and an unusual sugar termed anthrose. Anthrose is a proposed potential target for immunotherapy and for specific detection of B. anthracis. Although originally thought to be ubiquitous in B. anthracis, previous work identified an anthrose negative strain from a West African lineage isolated from cattle that could represent a vaccine escape mutant. These strains carry genes required for expression of the anthrose operon but premature stop codons resulting from an 8-bp insertion in BAS3320 (an amino-transferase) and a C/T substitution at position 892 of the BAS3321 (a glycosyltransferase) gene prevent anthrose expression. Various other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified throughout the operon and could be the basis for detection of anthrose-deficient strains.                  Results:                       In this study, we evaluated rhAmp genotypic assays based on SNPs at positions 892 and 1352 of BAS3321 for detection and differentiation of anthrose negative (Ant-) West African strains. Discrimination of anthrose negative West African isolates was achieved with as low as 100 fg of DNA, whereas consistent genotyping of Sterne necessitated at least 1 pg of DNA.                  Conclusions:                       Screening of a global panel of B. anthracis isolates showed anthrose-expressing alleles are prevalent worldwide whereas the anthrose-deficient phenotype is to date limited to West Africa. Our work also revealed a third, previously unreported anthrose genotype in which the operon is altogether missing from a Polish B. anthracis isolate.	0
Title: Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Kendomycin B Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399 Abstract: Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399, a rare marine-derived actinomycete, produces a set of ansamycin-like polyketides kendomycin B-D (1-3) which possess potent antibacterial activities and moderate tumor cytotoxicity. Structurally, kendomycin B-D contain a unique aliphatic macrocyclic ansa scaffold in which the highly substituted pyran ring is connected to the quinone moiety. In this work, a type I/type III polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster coding for assembly of kendomycin B (kmy), and covering 33 open reading frames, was identified from Verrucosispora sp. SCSIO 07399. The kmy cluster was found to be essential for kendomycin B biosynthesis as verified by gene disruption and heterologous expression. Correspondingly, a biosynthetic pathway was proposed based on bioinformatics, cluster alignments, and previous research. Additionally, the role of type III PKS for generating the precursor unit 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) was demonstrated by chemical complementation, and type I PKS executed the polyketide chain elongation. The kmy cluster was found to contain a positive regulatory gene kmy4 whose regulatory effect was identified using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). These advances shed important new insights into kendomycin B biosynthesis and help to set the foundation for further research aimed at understanding and exploiting the carbacylic ansa scaffold.	1
Title: IL-8 and IP-10 expression from human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B are promoted by Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) Abstract: Background:                       The bronchial epithelium serves as the first defendant line of host against respiratory inhaled pathogens, mainly through releasing chemokines (e.g. interleukin-8 (IL-8), interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) etc.) responsible for neutrophil or lymphocyte recruitment to promote the clearance of inhaled pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). Previous studies have shown that IL-8 expression is induced by pneumococcal virulence factors (e.g. pneumolysin, peptidoglycan-polysaccharides, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) etc.), which contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Whether other pneumococcal virulence factors are involved in inducing chemokines expression in epithelium is still unknown.                  Results:                       We studied the effect of PepO, a widely expressed and newly discovered pneumococcal virulence protein, on the release of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and IP-10, from human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and identified the relevant signaling pathways. Incubation of BEAS-2B with PepO resulted in increased synthesis and release of IL-8 and IP-10 in a dose and time independent manner. We also detected the increased and sustained expression of TLR2 and TLR4 transcripts in BEAS-2B stimulated by PepO. PepO activation leaded to the phosphorylation of MAPKs, Akt and p65. Pharmacologic inhibitors of MAPKs, PI3K and IκB-α phosphorylation attenuated IL-8 release, while IP-10 production was just suppressed by inhibitors of IκB-α phosphorylation, PI3K and P38 MAPK.                  Conclusion:                       These results suggest that PepO enhances IL-8 and IP-10 production in BEAS-2B in a MAPKs-PI3K/Akt-p65 dependent manner, which may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.	0
Title: Terrein biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus and its impact on phytotoxicity Abstract: Terrein is a fungal metabolite with ecological, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and antioxidative activities. Although it is produced by Aspergillus terreus as one of its major secondary metabolites, not much is known about its biosynthetic pathway. Here, we describe an unexpected discovery of the terrein biosynthesis gene locus made while we were looking for a PKS gene involved in production of conidia coloration pigments common for Aspergilli. The gene, ATEG_00145, here named terA, is essential for terrein biosynthesis and heterologous production of TerA in Aspergillus niger revealed an unusual plasticity in the products formed, yielding a mixture of 4-hydroxy-6-methylpyranone, orsellinic acid, and 6,7-dihydroxymellein. Biochemical and molecular genetic analyses indicate a low extension cycle specificity of TerA. Furthermore, 6-hydroxymellein was identified as a key intermediate in terrein biosynthesis. We find that terrein production is highly induced on plant-derived media, that terrein has phytotoxic activity on plant growth, and induces lesions on fruit surfaces.	1
Title: Structural analysis of Notch-regulating Rumi reveals basis for pathogenic mutations Abstract: Rumi O-glucosylates the EGF repeats of a growing list of proteins essential in metazoan development, including Notch. Rumi is essential for Notch signaling, and Rumi dysregulation is linked to several human diseases. Despite Rumi's critical roles, it is unknown how Rumi glucosylates a serine of many but not all EGF repeats. Here we report crystal structures of Drosophila Rumi as binary and ternary complexes with a folded EGF repeat and/or donor substrates. These structures provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and show that Rumi recognizes structural signatures of the EGF motif, the U-shaped consensus sequence, C-X-S-X-(P/A)-C and a conserved hydrophobic region. We found that five Rumi mutations identified in cancers and Dowling-Degos disease are clustered around the enzyme active site and adversely affect its activity. Our study suggests that loss of Rumi activity may underlie these diseases, and the mechanistic insights may facilitate the development of modulators of Notch signaling.	0
Title: Indexing the Pseudomonas specialized metabolome enabled the discovery of poaeamide B and the bananamides Abstract: Pseudomonads are cosmopolitan microorganisms able to produce a wide array of specialized metabolites. These molecules allow Pseudomonas to scavenge nutrients, sense population density and enhance or inhibit growth of competing microorganisms. However, these valuable metabolites are typically characterized one-molecule-one-microbe at a time, instead of being inventoried in large numbers. To index and map the diversity of molecules detected from these organisms, 260 strains of ecologically diverse origins were subjected to mass-spectrometry-based molecular networking. Molecular networking not only enables dereplication of molecules, but also sheds light on their structural relationships. Moreover, it accelerates the discovery of new molecules. Here, by indexing the Pseudomonas specialized metabolome, we report the molecular-networking-based discovery of four molecules and their evolutionary relationships: a poaeamide analogue and a molecular subfamily of cyclic lipopeptides, bananamides 1, 2 and 3. Analysis of their biosynthetic gene cluster shows that it constitutes a distinct evolutionary branch of the Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides. Through analysis of an additional 370 extracts of wheat-associated Pseudomonas, we demonstrate how the detailed knowledge from our reference index can be efficiently propagated to annotate complex metabolomic data from other studies, akin to the way in which newly generated genomic information can be compared to data from public databases.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003, the producer of the hybrid peptide-polyketide antitumor drug bleomycin Abstract: Background:                       Phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) catalyze the posttranslational modification of carrier proteins by the covalent attachment of the 4'-phosphopantetheine (P-pant) moiety of coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue, a reaction absolutely required for the biosynthesis of natural products including fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides. PPTases have been classified according to their carrier protein specificity. In organisms containing multiple P-pant-requiring pathways, each pathway has been suggested to have its own PPTase activity. However, sequence analysis of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 failed to reveal an associated PPTase gene.                  Results:                       A general approach for cloning PPTase genes by PCR was developed and applied to the cloning of the svp gene from S. verticillus. The svp gene is mapped to an independent locus not clustered with any of the known NRPS or PKS clusters. The Svp protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and shown to be a monomer in solution. Svp is a PPTase capable of modifying both type I and type II acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs) from either S. verticillus or other Streptomyces species. As compared to Sfp, the only 'promiscuous' PPTase known previously, Svp displays a similar catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for the BlmI PCP but a 346-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for the TcmM ACP.                  Conclusions:                       PPTases have recently been re-classified on a structural basis into two subfamilies: ACPS-type and Sfp-type. The development of a PCR method for cloning Sfp-type PPTases from actinomycetes, the recognition of the Sfp-type PPTases to be associated with secondary metabolism with a relaxed carrier protein specificity, and the availability of Svp, in addition to Sfp, should facilitate future endeavors in engineered biosynthesis of peptide, polyketide, and, in particular, hybrid peptide-polyketide natural products.	1
Title: Transcriptome Analysis of Aspergillus flavus Reveals veA-Dependent Regulation of Secondary Metabolite Gene Clusters, Including the Novel Aflavarin Cluster Abstract: The global regulatory veA gene governs development and secondary metabolism in numerous fungal species, including Aspergillus flavus. This is especially relevant since A. flavus infects crops of agricultural importance worldwide, contaminating them with potent mycotoxins. The most well-known are aflatoxins, which are cytotoxic and carcinogenic polyketide compounds. The production of aflatoxins and the expression of genes implicated in the production of these mycotoxins are veA dependent. The genes responsible for the synthesis of aflatoxins are clustered, a signature common for genes involved in fungal secondary metabolism. Studies of the A. flavus genome revealed many gene clusters possibly connected to the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Many of these metabolites are still unknown, or the association between a known metabolite and a particular gene cluster has not yet been established. In the present transcriptome study, we show that veA is necessary for the expression of a large number of genes. Twenty-eight out of the predicted 56 secondary metabolite gene clusters include at least one gene that is differentially expressed depending on presence or absence of veA. One of the clusters under the influence of veA is cluster 39. The absence of veA results in a downregulation of the five genes found within this cluster. Interestingly, our results indicate that the cluster is expressed mainly in sclerotia. Chemical analysis of sclerotial extracts revealed that cluster 39 is responsible for the production of aflavarin.	1
Title: Isolation, structure elucidation, and synergistic antibacterial activity of a novel two-component lantibiotic lichenicidin from Bacillus licheniformis VK21 Abstract: A novel synergetic lantibiotic pair, Lchalpha (3249.51 Da) and Lchbeta (3019.36 Da), termed lichenicidin VK21, was isolated from the producer strain Bacillus licheniformis VK21. Chemical and spatial structures of Lchalpha and Lchbeta were determined. Each peptide contains 31 amino acid residues linked by 4 intramolecular thioether bridges and the N-terminal 2-oxobutyryl group. Spatial structures of Lchalpha and Lchbeta were studied by NMR spectroscopy in methanol solution. The Lchalpha peptide displays structural homology with mersacidin-like lantibiotics and involves relatively well-structured N- and C-terminal domains connected by a flexible loop stabilized by a thioether bridge Ala11-S-Ala21. In contrast, the Lchbeta peptide represents a prolonged hydrophobic alpha-helix flanked with more flexible N- and C-terminal domains. A lantibiotic cluster of the Bacillus licheniformis VK21 genome which comprises the structural genes, lchA1 and lchA2, encoding the lantibiotics precursors, as well as the gene of a modifying enzyme lchM1, was amplified and sequenced. The mature peptides, Lchalpha and Lchbeta, interact synergistically to possess antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria within a nanomolar concentration range, though the individual peptides were shown to be active at micromolar concentrations. Our results afford molecular insight into the mechanism of lichenicidin VK21 action.	1
Title: An Unprecedented Cyclization Mechanism in the Biosynthesis of Carbazole Alkaloids in Streptomyces Abstract: Carquinostatin A (CQS), a potent neuroprotective substance, is a unique carbazole alkaloid with both an ortho-quinone function and an isoprenoid moiety. We identified the entire gene cluster responsible for CQS biosynthesis in Streptomyces exfoliatus through heterologous production of CQS and gene deletion. Biochemical characterization of seven CQS biosynthetic gene products (CqsB1-7) established the total biosynthetic pathway of CQS. Reconstitution of CqsB1 and CqsB2 showed that the synthesis of the carbazole skeleton involves CqsB1-catalyzed decarboxylative condensation of an α-hydroxyl-β-keto acid intermediate with 3-hydroxybutyryl-ACP followed by CqsB2-catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Based on crystal structures and mutagenesis-based biochemical assays, a detailed mechanism for the unique deprotonation-initiated cyclization catalyzed by CqsB2 is proposed. Finally, analysis of the substrate specificity of the biosynthetic enzymes led to the production of novel carbazoles.	1
Title: Lasso Peptide Benenodin-1 Is a Thermally Actuated [1]Rotaxane Switch Abstract: Mechanically interlocked molecules that change their conformation in response to stimuli have been developed by synthetic chemists as building blocks for molecular machines. Here we describe a natural product, the lasso peptide benenodin-1, which exhibits conformational switching between two distinct threaded conformers upon actuation by heat. We have determined the structures of both conformers and have characterized the kinetics and energetics of the conformational switch. Single amino acid substitutions to benenodin-1 generate peptides that are biased to a single conformer, showing that the switching behavior is potentially an evolvable trait in these peptides. Lasso peptides such as benenodin-1 can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes called lasso peptide isopeptidases. We show that only the native conformer of benenodin-1 is cleaved by its cognate isopeptidase. Thus, thermally induced conformational switching of benenodin-1 may also be relevant to the biological function of these molecules.	0
Title: Staphylococcus aureus extracellular adherence protein contributes to biofilm formation in the presence of serum Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus extracellular adherence protein (EAP) is secreted, but it can redock on the bacterial cell surface via neutral phosphatase (Nptase). EAP binds to certain blood proteins and to itself, and through these affinities, it contributes to adherence and aggregation. It has been demonstrated previously that EAP expression is iron regulated and it contributes to biofilm formation under iron-deplete conditions. In this study, we found that EAP and Nptase also play a role in biofilm formation under iron-replete conditions in the presence of human serum.	0
Title: A cold oceanographic regime with high exploitation rates in the Northeast Pacific forecasts a collapse of the sardine stock Abstract: The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.	0
Title: Identification and Biological Activity of NFAT-133 Congeners from Streptomyces pactum Abstract: The soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456 produces a number of polyketide natural products. Among them is NFAT-133, an inhibitor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) that suppresses interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression and T cell proliferation. Biosynthetic gene inactivation in the ATCC 27456 strain revealed the ability of this strain to produce other polyketide compounds including analogues of NFAT-133. Consequently, seven new derivatives of NFAT-133, TM-129-TM-135, together with a known compound, panowamycin A, were isolated from the culture broth of S. pactum ATCC 27456 ΔptmTDQ. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of their HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and ECD calculation and spectral data. NFAT-133, TM-132, TM-135, and panowamycin A showed no antibacterial activity or cytotoxicity, but weakly reduced the production of LPS-induced nitric oxide in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A revised chemical structure of panowamycin A and proposed modes of formation of the new NFAT-133 analogues are also presented.	0
Title: Biosynthetic studies of allosamidin. 2. Isolation of didemethylallosamidin, and conversion experiments of 14C-labeled demethylallosamidin, didemethylallosamidin and their related compounds Abstract: A new allosamidin analog, termed didemethylallosamidin (3), was isolated from the mycelia of Streptomyces sp. AJ 9463 which is a producer of allosamidin (1) and demethylallosamidin (2). 14C-Labeled 1, 2 and 3 as well as their related compounds, 4, 5, and 6, were prepared to investigate the biosynthesis of 1. Conversion experiments with the labeled allosamidins revealed that 2 was a precursor of 1, but 3 was not incorporated. This suggests that the first N-methyl group is introduced before the cyclization of the aminooxazoline ring during the biosynthesis of 1. Although none of the compounds 4, 5, and 6 were converted to 1, the production of 1 was inhibited by the addition of 4.	0
Title: Insights into the reaction mechanism of the prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase involved in anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a biosynthesis Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins. We recently reported the identification of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins as well as the in-vitro reconstitution of the first steps of this biosynthesis. We now report experimental evidence supporting the proposed reaction mechanism of AnaB, a flavoprotein homologous to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. AnaB catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of prolyl-AnaD, which is proline linked to the acyl carrier protein holo-AnaD, to dehydroprolyl-AnaD using oxygen as the second substrate. AnaB is thus an oxidase. By using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we have identified and characterized dehydroprolyl-AnaD, the AnaB product. We estimated an apparent catalytic constant of 1 min(-1) for AnaB catalysis. We synthesized several deuterium-labeled prolines and enzymatically transformed them into their corresponding prolyl-AnaD. These deuterium-labeled prolyl-AnaDs were oxidized in the presence of AnaB, and the deuterium labeling in the remaining substrate and in the product was determined by LC-MS/MS. The data supported a reaction mechanism starting with a rapid enolization followed by a slow oxidation to give the conjugated imine, which in turn was isomerized to pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD. We also showed that cis- and trans-4-fluoro-L-prolyl-AnaD and 3,4-dehydro-L-prolyl-AnaD were transformed into pyrrole-2-carboxyl-AnaD by AnaB. Thus, the 4-fluoro-analogues experienced a β-elimination supporting the AnaB-catalyzed aza-allylic isomerization. We identified by sequence alignment the AnaB active site base, Glu244. We produced, purified, and characterized the E244A AnaB mutant, which is inactive, supporting the catalytic role of E244 as a base.	1
Title: An acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in the formation of the Delta cis3 double bond in the acyl residue of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin in Actinoplanes friuliensis Abstract: The lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, produced by Actinoplanes friuliensis, is an effective drug against Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus strains. Friulimicin consists of a cyclic peptide core of ten amino acids and an acyl residue linked to an exocyclic amino acid. The acyl residue is essential for antibiotic activity, varies in length from C13 to C15, and carries a characteristic double bond at position Delta cis3. Sequencing of a DNA fragment adjacent to a previously described fragment encoding some of the friulimicin biosynthetic genes revealed several genes whose gene products resemble enzymes of lipid metabolism. One of these genes, lipB, encodes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase homologue. To elucidate the function of the LipB protein, a lipB insertion mutant was generated and the friulimicin derivative (FR242) produced by the mutant was purified. FR242 had antibiotic activity lower than friulimicin in a bioassay. Gas chromatography showed that the acyl residue of wild-type friulimicin contains a double bond, whereas a saturated bond was present in FR242. These results were confirmed by the heterologous expression of lipB in Streptomyces lividans T7, which led to the production of unsaturated fatty acids not found in the S. lividans T7 parent strain. These results indicate that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase LipB is involved in the introduction of the unusual Delta cis3 double bond into the acyl residue of friulimicin.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Peptide Antibiotic Feglymycin by a Linear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Mechanism Abstract: Feglymycin, a peptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp. DSM 11171, consists mostly of nonproteinogenic phenylglycine-type amino acids. It possesses antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and antiviral activity against HIV. Inhibition of the early steps of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis indicated a mode of action different from those of other peptide antibiotics. Here we describe the identification and assignment of the feglymycin (feg) biosynthesis gene cluster, which codes for a 13-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system. Inactivation of an NRPS gene and supplementation of a hydroxymandelate oxidase mutant with the amino acid l-Hpg proved the identity of the feg cluster. Feeding of Hpg-related unnatural amino acids was not successful. This characterization of the feg cluster is an important step to understanding the biosynthesis of this potent antibacterial peptide.	1
Title: Genome Mining of Marine-Derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 Leads to Cytotoxic New Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactams Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) biosynthetic gene cluster are widely distributed in different bacterial types, especially in Streptomyces species. The mining of the genomic data of marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 reveals the presence of a putative PTM-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster (ptm' BGC) that features a genetic organization for potentially producing 5/5/6 type of carbocyclic ring-containing PTMs. A fermentation of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 led to the isolation and characterization of six new PTMs 1-6. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis assigned their planar structures and relative configurations, and their absolute configurations were deduced by comparing the experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with the reported spectra of the known PTMs. Intriguingly, compounds 1-6 were determined to have a trans-orientation of H-10/H-11 at the first 5-membered ring, being distinct from the cis-orientation in their known PTM congeners. PTMs 1-5 displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines, with IC50 values that ranged from 2.47 to 17.68 µM.	1
Title: Short, enantioselective total synthesis of chatancin Abstract: An enantioselective total synthesis of the polycyclic diterpene (+)-chatancin, a potent PAF antagonist, is reported. Proceeding in seven steps from dihydrofarnesal, this synthetic route was designed to circumvent macrocyclization-based strategies to complex, cyclized cembranoids. The described synthesis requires only six chromatographic purifications, is high yielding, and avoids protecting-group manipulations. An X-ray crystal structure of this fragile marine natural product was obtained.	0
Title: Controlling the Reactivity of the [P8 W48 O184 ]40- Inorganic Ring and Its Assembly into POMZite Inorganic Frameworks with Silver Ions Abstract: The construction of pure-inorganic framework materials with well-defined design rules and building blocks is challenging. In this work, we show how a polyoxometalate cluster with an integrated pore, based on [P8 W48 O184 ]40- (abbreviated as {P8 W48 }), can be self-assembled into inorganic frameworks using silver ions, which both enable reactions on the cluster as well as link them together. The {P8 W48 } was found to be highly reactive with silver ions resulting in the in situ generation of fragments, forming {P9 W63 O235 } and {P10 W66 O251 } in compound (1) where these two clusters co-crystallize and are connected into a POMZite framework with 11 Ag+ ions as linkers located inside clusters and 10 Ag+ linking ions situated between clusters. Decreasing both the concentration of Ag+ ions, and the reaction temperature compared to the synthesis of compound (1), leads to {P8 W51 O196 } in compound 2 where the {P8 W48 } clusters are linked to form a new POMZite framework with 9 Ag+ ions per formula unit. Further tuning of the reaction conditions yields a cubic porous network compound (3) where {P8 W48 } clusters as cubic sides are joined by 4 Ag+ ions to give a cubic array and no Ag+ ions were found inside the clusters.	0
Title: Characterization of a Carbapenem-Hydrolyzing Enzyme, PoxB, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen often associated with severe and life-threatening infections that are highly impervious to treatment. This microbe readily exhibits intrinsic and acquired resistance to varied antimicrobial drugs. Resistance to penicillin-like compounds is commonplace and provided by the chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase. A second, chromosomally encoded β-lactamase, PoxB, has previously been reported in P. aeruginosa. In the present work, the contribution of this class D enzyme was investigated using a series of clean in-frame ampC, poxB, and oprD deletions, as well as complementation by expression under the control of an inducible promoter. While poxB deletions failed to alter β-lactam sensitivities, expression of poxB in ampC-deficient backgrounds decreased susceptibility to both meropenem and doripenem but had no effect on imipenem, penicillin, and cephalosporin MICs. However, when expressed in an ampCpoxB-deficient background, that additionally lacked the outer membrane porin-encoding gene oprD, PoxB significantly increased the imipenem as well as the meropenem and doripenem MICs. Like other class D carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamases, PoxB was only poorly inhibited by class A enzyme inhibitors, but a novel non-β-lactam compound, avibactam, was a slightly better inhibitor of PoxB activity. In vitro susceptibility testing with a clinical concentration of avibactam, however, failed to reduce PoxB activity against the carbapenems. In addition, poxB was found to be cotranscribed with an upstream open reading frame, poxA, which itself was shown to encode a 32-kDa protein of yet unknown function.	0
Title: In vivo investigation of the roles of FdmM and FdmM1 in fredericamycin biosynthesis unveiling a new family of oxygenases Abstract: Fredericamycin (FDM) A, a highly oxidized aromatic pentadecaketide natural product, exhibits potent cytotoxicity and has been studied as a new anticancer drug lead. The FDM biosynthetic gene cluster has been previously cloned from Streptomyces griseus ATCC 49344 and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus J1074. The fdmM and fdmM1 genes code for two proteins with high sequence homology to each other but unknown function. In-frame deletion of each of the genes from the fdm cluster was accomplished in the S. albus host. Each mutant failed to produce FDM A and the key biosynthetic intermediate FDM E but produced various new metabolites, the titers of which were dramatically increased via overexpression of an fdm pathway-specific activator fdmR1. The DeltafdmM mutant strain accumulated three new compounds FDM M-1, FDM M-2, and FDM M-3, whereas the DeltafdmM1 mutant strain produced one new compound FDM M1-1. Isolation and structural characterization of these compounds enable us to propose that FdmM and FdmM1 catalyze the C-6 and C-8 hydroxylations for FDM biosynthesis, respectively. Homologs of FdmM and FdmM1 can be found in biosynthetic gene clusters of many other aromatic polyketides, ranging from dodecaketides to pentadecaketides, but to date all of them were annotated as proteins of unknown function. Based on the findings reported here for FdmM and FdmM1, we now propose similar functions for those proteins, and FdmM and FdmM1 therefore represent an emerging family of novel oxygenases responsible for hydroxylation of aromatic polyketide natural products.	1
Title: Cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from Bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by Gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the Bacillus group. In the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in Bacillus cereus strain As 1.1846 through genomic mining and PCR screening. The designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class II lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cerA genes, one modification gene (cerM), two processing genes (cerT and cerP), one orphan regulator gene (cerR), and two immunity genes (cerF and cerE). In addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comQXPA, was inserted between cerM and cerR. The expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of B. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerM. We constitutively coexpressed cerA genes and cerM in Escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase GluC and a truncated version of putative serine protease CerP. Thus, two natural variants of cerecidins A1 and A7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. Both cerecidins A1 and A7 were active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Cerecidin A7, especially its mutant Dhb13A, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and even Streptomyces.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Pharmaceutically Important Fungal Ergot Alkaloid Dihydrolysergic Acid Requires a Specialized Allele of cloA Abstract: Ergot alkaloids are specialized fungal metabolites that are important as the bases of several pharmaceuticals. Many ergot alkaloids are derivatives of lysergic acid (LA) and have vasoconstrictive activity, whereas several dihydrolysergic acid (DHLA) derivatives are vasorelaxant. The pathway to LA is established, with the P450 monooxygenase CloA playing a key role in oxidizing its substrate agroclavine to LA. We analyzed the activities of products of cloA alleles from different fungi relative to DHLA biosynthesis by expressing them in a mutant of the fungus Neosartorya fumigata that accumulates festuclavine, the precursor to DHLA. Transformants expressing CloA from Epichloë typhina × Epichloë festucae, which oxidizes agroclavine to LA, failed to oxidize festuclavine to DHLA. In substrate feeding experiments, these same transformants oxidized exogenously supplied agroclavine to LA, indicating that a functional CloA was produced. A genomic clone of cloA from Claviceps africana, a sorghum ergot fungus that produces a DHLA derivative, was cloned and expressed in the festuclavine-accumulating mutant of N. fumigata, but several introns in this genomic clone were not processed properly. Expression of a synthetic intron-free version of C. africanacloA resulted in the accumulation of DHLA as assessed by fluorescence high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In substrate feeding experiments, the C. africana CloA also accepted agroclavine as the substrate, oxidizing it to LA. The data indicate that a specialized allele of cloA is required for DHLA biosynthesis and that the pharmaceutically important compound DHLA can be produced in engineered N. fumigataIMPORTANCE Ergot alkaloids are fungal metabolites that have impacted humankind historically as poisons and more recently as pharmaceuticals used to treat dementia, migraines, and other disorders. Much is known about the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids that are derived from lysergic acid (LA), but important questions remain about a parallel pathway to ergot alkaloids derived from dihydrolysergic acid (DHLA). DHLA-derived alkaloids have minor structural differences compared to LA-derived alkaloids but can have very different activities. To understand how DHLA is made, we analyzed activities of a key enzyme in the DHLA pathway and found that it differed from its counterpart in the LA pathway. Our data indicate a critical difference between the two pathways and provide a strategy for producing DHLA by modifying a model fungus. The ability to produce DHLA in a model fungus may facilitate synthesis of DHLA-derived pharmaceuticals.	1
Title: Coherent multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy of biomolecules: concepts, simulations, and challenges Abstract: The response of complex molecules to sequences of femtosecond infrared pulses provides a unique window into their structure, dynamics, and fluctuating environments. Herein we survey the basic principles of modern two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, which analogous to those of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The perturbative approach for computing the nonlinear optical response of coupled localized chromophores is introduced and applied to the amide backbone transitions of proteins, liquid water, membrane lipids, and amyloid fibrils. The signals are analyzed using classical molecular dynamics simulations combined with an effective fluctuating Hamiltonian for coupled localized anharmonic vibrations whose dependence on the local electrostatic environment is parameterized by an ab initio map. Several simulation methods, (cumulant expansion of Gaussian fluctuation, quasiparticle scattering, the stochastic Liouville equations, direct numerical propagation) are surveyed. Chirality-induced techniques which dramatically enhance the resolution are demonstrated. Signatures of conformational and hydrogen-bonding fluctuations, protein folding, and chemical-exchange processes are discussed.	0
Title: Biological dinitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) associated with Florida mangroves Abstract: Biological dinitrogen fixation in mangrove communities of the Tampa Bay region of South Florida was investigated using the acetylene reduction technique. Low rates of acetylene reduction (0.01 to 1.84 nmol of C(2)H(4)/g [wet weight] per h) were associated with plant-free sediments, while plant-associated sediments gave rise to slightly higher rates. Activity in sediments increased greatly upon the addition of various carbon sources, indicating an energy limitation for nitrogenase (C(2)H(2)) activity. In situ determinations of dinitrogen fixation in sediments also indicated low rates and exhibited a similar response to glucose amendment. Litter from the green macroalga, Ulva spp., mangrove leaves, and sea grass also gave rise to significant rates of acetylene reduction. Higher rates of nitrogenase activity (15 to 53 nmol of C(2)H(4)/g [wet weight] per h were associated with washed excised roots of three Florida mangrove species [Rhizophora mangle L., Avicennia germinans (L) Stern, and Laguncularia racemosa Gaertn.] as well as with isolated root systems of intact plants (11 to 58 mug of N/g [dry weight] per h). Following a short lag period, root-associated activity was linear and did not exhibit a marked response to glucose amendment. It appears that dinitrogen-fixing bacteria in the mangrove rhizoplane are able to use root exudates and/or sloughed cell debris as energy sources for dinitrogen fixation.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16: Discovery of Atratumycin and Identification of Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Genome mining of the deep sea-derived Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16 enabled the activation of a cyclodepsipeptide gene cluster and isolation of its cinnamic acid-bearing product, atratumycin (1). Atratumycin's structure was elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic experiments, X-ray data, and Marfey's method; a plausible biosynthesis and tailoring modification of 1 are also proposed and investigated. Additionally, atratumycin is active against Mycobacteria tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv with MICs of 3.8 and 14.6 μM, respectively.	1
Title: S-3578, a new broad spectrum parenteral cephalosporin exhibiting potent activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships Abstract: A series of 7-aminothiadiazolylcephalosporins having a 1-(substituted)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium group at the C-3' position of the cephem nucleus were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. Among the cephalosporins prepared in this study, 7beta-[2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-ethoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[1-(3-methylaminopropyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium-4-yl]methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate sulfate (S-3578) showed extremely potent broad spectrum activity against both gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and good water solubility.	0
Title: A γ-butyrolactone autoregulator-receptor system involved in the regulation of auricin production in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: The γ-butyrolactone (GBL) autoregulator-receptor systems play a role in controlling secondary metabolism and/or morphological differentiation in many Streptomyces species. We previously identified the aur1 gene cluster, located on the Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 large linear plasmid pSA3239, which is responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin. Here, we describe the characterisation of two genes, sagA and sagR, encoding GBL autoregulatory signalling homologues, which lie in the upstream part of the aur1 cluster. SagA was similar to GBL synthases and SagR to GBL receptors. The expression of each gene is directed by its own promoter, sagAp for sagA and sagRp for sagR. Both genes were active mainly during the exponential phase, and their transcription was interdependent. The disruption of sagA abolished auricin production, while the disruption of sagR resulted in precocious but dramatically reduced auricin production. Transcription from the aur1Pp and aur1Rp promoters, which direct the expression of auricin-specific cluster-situated regulators (CSRs), was also precocious and increased in the sagR mutant strain. In addition, SagR was also shown to specifically bind both promoters in vitro. These results indicated that the SagA-SagR GBL system regulates auricin production. Unlike many other GBL receptors, SagR does not bind its own promoter, but Aur1R, an auricin-specific repressor from the family of pseudo GBL receptors, does bind both sagAp and sagRp promoters. Moreover, the expression of both promoters was deregulated in an aur1R mutant, indicating that the SagA-SagR GBL system is regulated by a feedback mechanism involving the auricin-specific CSR Aur1R, which regulates downstream.	1
Title: Differentiation of Lactobacillus Species by Molecular Typing Abstract: A total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic Lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women, namely, Lactobacillus jensenii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum. Six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. This technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. In the case of the ribotype A grouping for L. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). Many isolates did not possess plasmids. Six L. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to L. rhamnosus ATCC 21052. The molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating Lactobacillus isolates. Studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.	0
Title: Structure revision of cryptosporioptides and determination of the genetic basis for dimeric xanthone biosynthesis in fungi Abstract: Three novel dimeric xanthones, cryptosporioptides A-C were isolated from Cryptosporiopsis sp. 8999 and their structures elucidated. Methylation of cryptosporioptide A gave a methyl ester with identical NMR data to cryptosporioptide, a compound previously reported to have been isolated from the same fungus. However, HRMS analysis revealed that cryptosporioptide is a symmetrical dimer, not a monomer as previously proposed, and the revised structure was elucidated by extensive NMR analysis. The genome of Cryptosporiopsis sp. 8999 was sequenced and the dimeric xanthone (dmx) biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of the cryptosporioptides was identified. Gene disruption experiments identified a gene (dmxR5) encoding a cytochrome P450 oxygenase as being responsible for the dimerisation step late in the biosynthetic pathway. Disruption of dmxR5 led to the isolation of novel monomeric xanthones. Cryptosporioptide B and C feature an unusual ethylmalonate subunit: a hrPKS and acyl CoA carboxylase are responsible for its formation. Bioinformatic analysis of the genomes of several fungi producing related xanthones, e.g. the widely occurring ergochromes, and related metabolites allows detailed annotation of the biosynthetic genes, and a rational overall biosynthetic scheme for the production of fungal dimeric xanthones to be proposed.	1
Title: Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and tailoring enzymes in the biosynthesis of the tetracyclic quinone glycoside antibiotic polyketomycin Abstract: Polyketomycin is a tetracyclic quinone glycoside produced by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü6028. It shows cytotoxic and antibiotic activity, in particular against Gram-positive multi-drug-resistant strains (for example, MRSA). The polyketomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and characterised. Its identity was proven by inactivation of a alpha-ketoacyl synthase gene (pokP1) of the "minimal polyketide synthase II" system. In order to obtain valuable information about tailoring steps, we performed further gene-inactivation experiments. The generation of mutants with deletions in oxygenase genes (pokO1, pokO2, both in parallel and pokO4) and methyltransferase genes (pokMT1, pokMT2 and pokMT3) resulted in new polyketomycin derivatives, and provided information about the organisation of the biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: A Thioacetal Photocage Designed for Dual Release: Application in the Quantitation of Therapeutic Release by Synchronous Reporter Decaging Abstract: Despite the immense potential of existing photocaging technology, its application is limited by the paucity of advanced caging tools. Here, we report on the design of a novel thioacetal ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde (TNB) dual arm photocage that enabled control of the simultaneous release of two payloads linked to a single TNB unit. By using this cage, which was prepared in a single step from commercial 6-nitroverataldehyde, three drug-fluorophore conjugates were synthesized: Taxol-TNB-fluorescein, Taxol-TNB-coumarin, and doxorubicin-TNB-coumarin, and long-wavelength UVA light-triggered release experiments demonstrated that dual payload release occurred with rapid decay kinetics for each conjugate. In cell-based assays performed in vitro, dual release could also be controlled by UV exposure, resulting in increased cellular fluorescence and cytotoxicity with potency equal to that of unmodified drug towards the KB carcinoma cell line. The extent of such dual release was quantifiable by reporter fluorescence measured in situ and was found to correlate with the extent of cytotoxicity. Thus, this novel dual arm cage strategy provides a valuable tool that enables both active control and real-time monitoring of drug activation at the delivery site.	0
Title: Quantitative trait locus analysis of circulating adhesion molecules in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice Abstract: Circulating soluble adhesion molecules have been suggested as useful markers to predict several clinical conditions such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. To determine genetic factors influencing plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and P-selectin, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on an intercross between C57BL/6J (B6) and C3H/HeJ (C3H) mouse strains deficient in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-). Female F2 mice were fed a western diet for 12 weeks. One significant QTL, named sVcam1 (71 cM, LOD 3.9), on chromosome 9 and three suggestive QTLs on chromosomes 5, 13 and 15 were identified to affect soluble VCAM-1 levels. Soluble P-selectin levels were controlled by one significant QTL, named sSelp1 (8.5 cM, LOD 3.4), on chromosome 16 and two suggestive QTLs on chromosomes 10 and 13. Both adhesion molecules showed significant or an apparent trend of correlations with body weight, total cholesterol, and LDL/VLDL cholesterol levels in the F2 population. These results indicate that plasma VCAM-1 and P-selectin levels are complex traits regulated by multiple genes, and this regulation is conferred, at least partially, by acting on body weight and lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic apoE-/- mice.	0
Title: A newly described cellulosomal cellobiohydrolase, CelO, from Clostridium thermocellum: investigation of the exo-mode of hydrolysis, and binding capacity to crystalline cellulose Abstract: The sequence of the celO gene from Clostridium thermocellum F7 was determined. The gene product, cellulase CelO (Ct-Cel5F), had a modular structure consisting of a carbohydrate-binding module of the CBM3 family and a catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The presence of the dockerin module indicated that the enzyme was a component of the cellulosome complex. The thermostable recombinant gene product was active on cellodextrins, barley beta-glucan, carboxymethylcellulose and insoluble cellulose. Cellobiose was the only product released from amorphic and crystalline cellulose, cellotetraose and higher cello-oligosaccharides, identifying CelO as a cellobiohydrolase. The cleavage pattern of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotetraoside, blockage of the hydrolysis of NaBH(4)-reduced cellopentaose and the reduction in substrate viscosity suggested activity from the reducing end in a processive mode after making random cuts. Binding to insoluble, i.e. amorphous, and crystalline cellulose was mediated by the carbohydrate-binding module CBM3b, with a preference for the crystalline substrate.	0
Title: Investigation of terpene diversification across multiple sequenced plant genomes Abstract: Plants produce an array of specialized metabolites, including chemicals that are important as medicines, flavors, fragrances, pigments and insecticides. The vast majority of this metabolic diversity is untapped. Here we take a systematic approach toward dissecting genetic components of plant specialized metabolism. Focusing on the terpenes, the largest class of plant natural products, we investigate the basis of terpene diversity through analysis of multiple sequenced plant genomes. The primary drivers of terpene diversification are terpenoid synthase (TS) "signature" enzymes (which generate scaffold diversity), and cytochromes P450 (CYPs), which modify and further diversify these scaffolds, so paving the way for further downstream modifications. Our systematic search of sequenced plant genomes for all TS and CYP genes reveals that distinct TS/CYP gene pairs are found together far more commonly than would be expected by chance, and that certain TS/CYP pairings predominate, providing signals for key events that are likely to have shaped terpene diversity. We recover TS/CYP gene pairs for previously characterized terpene metabolic gene clusters and demonstrate new functional pairing of TSs and CYPs within previously uncharacterized clusters. Unexpectedly, we find evidence for different mechanisms of pathway assembly in eudicots and monocots; in the former, microsyntenic blocks of TS/CYP gene pairs duplicate and provide templates for the evolution of new pathways, whereas in the latter, new pathways arise by mixing and matching of individual TS and CYP genes through dynamic genome rearrangements. This is, to our knowledge, the first documented observation of the unique pattern of TS and CYP assembly in eudicots and monocots.	1
Title: Mitogenomics of recombinant mitochondrial genomes of Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels Abstract: Recombination in the control region (CR) of Mytilus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was originally reported based on the relatively short, sequenced fragments of mitochondrial genomes. Recombination outside the CR has been reported recently with the suggestion that such processes are common in Mytilus. We have fully sequenced a set of 11 different mitochondrial haplotypes representing the high diversity of paternally inherited mitochondrial genomes of Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels, including the haplotype close to the native Mytilus trossulus mitochondrial genome, which was thought to have been entirely eliminated from this population. Phylogenetic and comparative analysis showed that the recombination is limited to the vicinity of the CR in all sequenced genomes. Coding sequence comparison indicated that all paternally inherited genomes showed increased accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions, including the genomes which switched their transmission route very recently. The acquisition of certain CR sequences through recombination with highly divergent paternally inherited genomes seems to precede and favor the switch, but it is not a prerequisite for this process. Interspecies hybridization in the Baltic Sea during the recent 10,000 years created conditions for both structural and evolutionary mitochondrial instability which resulted in the observed variation and dynamics of mtDNA in Baltic Sea Mytilus mussels. In conclusion, the data shows that the effects of mitochondrial recombination are limited to the CR of few phylogenetic lineages.	0
Title: Aptamers can discriminate alkaline proteins with high specificity Abstract: Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids that fold into stable three-dimensional structures with ligand binding sites that are complementary in shape and charge to a desired target. Aptamers are generated by an iterative process known as in vitro selection, which permits their isolation from pools of random sequences. While aptamers have been selected to bind a wide range of targets, it is generally thought that these molecules are incapable of discriminating strongly alkaline proteins due to the attractive forces that govern oppositely charged polymers (e.g., polyelectrolyte effect). Histones, eukaryotic proteins that make up the core structure of nucleosomes are attractive targets for exploring the binding properties of aptamers because these proteins have positively charged surfaces that bind DNA through noncovalent sequence-independent interactions. Previous selections by our lab and others have yielded DNA aptamers with high affinity but low specificity to individual histone proteins. Whether this is a general limitation of aptamers is an interesting question with important practical implications in the future development of protein affinity reagents. Here we report the in vitro selection of a DNA aptamer that binds to histone H4 with a K(d) of 13 nM and distinguishes other core histone proteins with 100 to 480-fold selectivity, which corresponds to a ΔΔG of up to 3.4 kcal mol(-1) . This result extends our fundamental understanding of aptamers and their ability to fold into shapes that selectively bind alkaline proteins.	0
Title: Estimation of the available free energy in a LOV2-J alpha photoswitch Abstract: Protein photosensors are versatile tools for studying ligand-regulated allostery and signaling. Fundamental to these processes is the amount of energy that can be provided by a photosensor to control downstream signaling events. Such regulation is exemplified by the phototropins--plant serine/threonine kinases that are activated by blue light via conserved LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domains. The core photosensor of oat phototropin 1 is a LOV domain that interacts in a light-dependent fashion with an adjacent alpha-helix (J alpha) to control kinase activity. We used solution NMR measurements to quantify the free energy of the LOV domain-J alpha-helix binding equilibrium in the dark and lit states. These data indicate that light shifts this equilibrium by approximately 3.8 kcal mol(-1), thus quantifying the energy available through LOV-J alpha for light-driven allosteric regulation. This study provides insight into the energetics of light sensing by phototropins and benchmark values for engineering photoswitchable systems based on the LOV-J alpha interaction.	0
Title: Rational design of modular polyketide synthases: morphing the aureothin pathway into a luteoreticulin assembly line Abstract: The unusual nitro-substituted polyketides aureothin, neoaureothin (spectinabilin), and luteoreticulin, which are produced by diverse Streptomyces species, point to a joint evolution. Through rational genetic recombination and domain exchanges we have successfully reprogrammed the modular (type I) aur polyketide synthase (PKS) into a synthase that generates luteoreticulin. This is the first rational transformation of a modular PKS to produce a complex polyketide that was initially isolated from a different bacterium. A unique aspect of this synthetic biology approach is that we exclusively used genes from a single biosynthesis gene cluster to design the artificial pathway, an avenue that likely emulates natural evolutionary processes. Furthermore, an unexpected, context-dependent switch in the regiospecificity of a pyrone methyl transferase was observed. We also describe an unprecedented scenario where an AT domain iteratively loads an extender unit onto the cognate ACP and the downstream ACP. This aberrant function is a novel case of non-colinear behavior of PKS domains.	1
Title: Elucidation of oxygenation steps during oviedomycin biosynthesis and generation of derivatives with increased antitumor activity Abstract: Eight different angucyclinones have been produced in Streptomyces albus by combining three oxygenase genes together with the polyketide synthase and cyclases genes from the oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891. Four of these compounds were fully characterized for the first time. Three of these angucyclinones-prejadomycin-2-carboxylate (2), 4a,12b-dehydro-UWM6 (5), and prejadomycin (3)-show a significant increase in their in vitro antitumor activity relative to oviedomycin (1). A hypothesis for the sequence of tailoring events catalyzed by these three oxygenases during oviedomycin biosynthesis is proposed. In this hypothesis OvmOII acts as a bifunctional oxygenase/dehydratase.	1
Title: Surface-layer glycoproteins: an example for the diversity of bacterial glycosylation with promising impacts on nanobiotechnology Abstract: Bacterial cell surface layers, referred to simply as S-layers, have been described for all major phylogenetic groups of bacteria, which may indicate their pivotal role for a bacterium in its natural habitat. They have the unique ability to assemble into two-dimensional crystalline arrays that completely cover the bacterial cells. Glycosylation represents the most frequent modification of S-layer proteins. S-layer glycoproteins constitute a class of glycoconjugates first isolated in the mid-1970s, but S-layer glycoprotein research is still being regarded as an "exotic field of glycobiology," possibly because of its "noneukaryotic" character. Extensive work over the past 30 years provided evidence of an enormous diversity of S-layer glycoproteins that have been created in nature over 3 billion years of prokaryotic evolution. These glycoconjugates are substantially different from eukaryotic glycoproteins, with regard to both composition and structure; nevertheless, some general structural concepts may be deduced. The awareness of the high application potential of S-layer glycoproteins, especially in combination with their intrinsic cell surface display feature, in the field of modern nanobiotechnology as a base for glycoengineering has recently led to the investigation of the S-layer protein glycosylation process at the molecular level, which has lagged behind the structural studies due to the lack of suitable molecular tools. From that work an even more interesting picture of this class of glycoconjugates is emerging. The availability of purified enzymes from S-layer glycan biosynthesis pathways exhibiting increased stabilities and/or rare sugar specificities in conjunction with preliminary genomic data on S-layer glycan biosynthesis clusters will pave the way for the rational design of S-layer neoglycoproteins.	1
Title: A new highly selective fluorescent K+ sensor Abstract: We describe the synthesis, properties, and application of a new fluorescent potassium chemosensor, KS2, for K(+) sensing and imaging in live cells. By virtue of a strong electron-withdrawing group, 2-dicyanomethylene-3-cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran (TCF), with a triazacryptand ligand, the new sensor can respond to K(+) up to 1.6 M. This is the first highly selective intracellular sensor suitable for sensing K(+) over a broad and high concentration range. Confocal fluorescence microscopy has established the utility of KS2 for live-cell K(+) detection. The application of KS2 combined with other sensors will be of great benefit for investigating cellular metabolism, detecting and diagnosing diseases including cancer, and monitoring responses to therapy.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the neurotoxin domoic acid in a bloom-forming diatom Abstract: Oceanic harmful algal blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms produce the potent mammalian neurotoxin domoic acid (DA). Despite decades of research, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis is not known. By using growth conditions known to induce DA production in Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, we implemented transcriptome sequencing in order to identify DA biosynthesis genes that colocalize in a genomic four-gene cluster. We biochemically investigated the recombinant DA biosynthetic enzymes and linked their mechanisms to the construction of DA's diagnostic pyrrolidine skeleton, establishing a model for DA biosynthesis. Knowledge of the genetic basis for toxin production provides an orthogonal approach to bloom monitoring and enables study of environmental factors that drive oceanic DA production.	1
Title: Closely related viruses of the marine picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus exhibit different ecological strategies Abstract: In marine ecosystems, viruses are major disrupters of the direct flow of carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Although the genetic diversity of several eukaryotic phytoplankton virus groups has been characterized, their infection dynamics are less understood, such that the physiological and ecological implications of their diversity remain unclear. We compared genomes and infection phenotypes of the two most closely related cultured phycodnaviruses infecting the widespread picoprasinophyte Ostreococcus lucimarinus under standard- (1.3 divisions per day) and limited-light (0.41 divisions per day) nutrient replete conditions. OlV7 infection caused early arrest of the host cell cycle, coinciding with a significantly higher proportion of infected cells than OlV1-amended treatments, regardless of host growth rate. OlV7 treatments showed a near-50-fold increase of progeny virions at the higher host growth rate, contrasting with OlV1's 16-fold increase. However, production of OlV7 virions was more sensitive than OlV1 production to reduced host growth rate, suggesting fitness trade-offs between infection efficiency and resilience to host physiology. Moreover, although organic matter released from OlV1- and OlV7-infected hosts had broadly similar chemical composition, some distinct molecular signatures were observed. Collectively, these results suggest that current views on viral relatedness through marker and core gene analyses underplay operational divergence and consequences for host ecology.	0
Title: Pseudomonas sp. COW3 Produces New Bananamide-Type Cyclic Lipopeptides with Antimicrobial Activity against Pythium myriotylum and Pyricularia oryzae Abstract: Pseudomonas species are metabolically robust, with capacity to produce secondary metabolites including cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs). Herein we conducted a chemical analysis of a crude CLP extract from the cocoyam rhizosphere-derived biocontrol strain Pseudomonas sp. COW3. We performed in silico analyses on its whole genome, and conducted in vitro antagonistic assay using the strain and purified CLPs. Via LC-MS and NMR, we elucidated the structures of four novel members of the bananamide group, named bananamides D-G. Besides variability in fatty acid length, bananamides D-G differ from previously described bananamides A-C and MD-0066 by the presence of a serine and aspartic acid at position 6 and 2, respectively. In addition, bananamide G has valine instead of isoleucine at position 8. Kendrick mass defect (KMD) allowed the assignment of molecular formulae to bananamides D and E. We unraveled a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase cluster banA, banB and banC which encodes the novel bananamide derivatives. Furthermore, COW3 displayed antagonistic activity and mycophagy against Pythium myriotylum, while it mainly showed mycophagy on Pyricularia oryzae. Purified bananamides D-G inhibited the growth of P. myriotylum and P. oryzae and caused hyphal distortion. Our study shows the complementarity of chemical analyses and genome mining in the discovery and elucidation of novel CLPs. In addition, structurally diverse bananamides differ in their antimicrobial activity.	1
Title: Targeted Inhibition of Snail Activity in Breast Cancer Cells by Using a Co(III) -Ebox Conjugate Abstract: The transition from a non-invasive to an invasive phenotype is an essential step in tumor metastasis. The Snail family of transcription factors (TFs) is known to play a significant role in this transition. These TFs are zinc fingers that bind to the CAGGTG Ebox consensus sequence. Co(III) -Ebox is a cobalt(III) complex attached to an Ebox oligonucleotide that confers specificity towards Snail TFs. Co(III) -Ebox has been shown to inhibit Snail-mediated embryonic neural crest development in Xenopus laevis, but its efficacy in inhibiting Snail-induced cancer cell invasiveness has not been explored. Here, we describe the efficacy of Co(III) -Ebox in inhibiting the invasive aspects of heregulin-β1(HRG)-treated breast cancer cells. Co(III) -Ebox was found to inhibit the capacity of Snail to repress target genes after HRG induction. Snail inhibition by Co(III) -Ebox reduced the invasive propensity of cells in 2D and 3D, thereby demonstrating promise in inhibiting metastasis.	0
Title: Analysis of the exochelin locus in Mycobacterium smegmatis: biosynthesis genes have homology with genes of the peptide synthetase family Abstract: Mycobacteria secrete the siderophore exochelin when grown under iron-limiting conditions. In order to understand iron uptake mechanisms in mycobacteria, we have taken a genetic approach to identify those genes involved in exochelin biosynthesis and transport in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Of the 6,000 chemically mutagenized clones of M. smegmatis mc2155 screened on agar plates containing chrome azural S, 19 mutants that had lost the ability to produce or secrete exochelin were identified. Thirteen of these mutants were complemented by a single M. smegmatis cosmid. Sequence analysis of this cosmid revealed nine open reading frames, three of which are homologous to genes encoding transporter proteins, which are likely involved in exochelin transport. Complementation and Tn10 mutagenesis analysis identified two new genes, fxbB and fxbC, which are required for exochelin biosynthesis. The fxbB and fxbC genes encode large proteins of 257 and 497 kDa, respectively, which are highly homologous to peptide synthetases, indicating that exochelin biosynthesis occurs by a nonribosomal mechanism.	1
Title: Charting an Unexplored Streptococcal Biosynthetic Landscape Reveals a Unique Peptide Cyclization Motif Abstract: Peptide natural products are often used as signals or antibiotics and contain unusual structural modifications, thus providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of Nature's therapeutic and biosynthetic repertoires. Herein, we have investigated the under-explored biosynthetic potential of Streptococci, prevalent bacteria in mammalian microbiomes that include mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic members. Using a new bioinformatic search strategy, in which we linked the versatile radical S-adenosylmethionine (RaS) enzyme superfamily to an emerging class of natural products in the context of quorum sensing control, we identified numerous, uncharted biosynthetic loci. Focusing on one such locus, we identified an unprecedented post-translational modification, consisting of a tetrahydro[5,6]benzindole cyclization motif in which four unactivated positions are linked by two C-C bonds in a regio- and stereospecific manner by a single RaS enzyme. Our results expand the scope of reactions that microbes have at their disposal in concocting complex ribosomal peptides.	1
Title: Synthesis of the originally proposed structure of palmerolide C Abstract: A stereoselective synthesis of the proposed structure of palmerolide C (1), a cytotoxic marine macrolide isolated from the Antarctic tunicate Synoicum adareanum, utilizes a convergent carbonyl-based coupling strategy to construct the C1-C24 carbon skeleton (see scheme). Compound 1 was shown to be a diastereomer of palmerolide C, and the structural revision of the natural product is proposed.	1
Title: Evidence and characterization of a gene cluster required for the production of viscosin, a lipopeptide biosurfactant, by a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens Abstract: The genetic control of viscosin production was examined in a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfA7B) that causes broccoli head rot. Viscosin is a potent lipopeptide biosurfactant that enables the bacteria to come into intimate contact with the difficult-to-wet waxy heads of broccoli. Tn5 mutagenesis completely disrupted viscosin production as shown by HPLC analysis of the mutagenized cell lysates. The Vis- mutants retained their pectolytic capability and were able to decay potato slices. On broccoli, however, the Vis- mutants caused decay of wounded florets, but the decay failed to spread to adjacent nonwounded florets as had occurred with the wild-type PfA7B. Triparental matings of the Vis- mutants with their corresponding wild-type clones and the helper Escherichia coli HB101 carrying the mobilization plasmid pPK2013 resulted in three stable viscosin-producing transconjugants that caused typical decay of broccoli tissue. Linkage maps of clones and protein profiles showed that a 25-kb chromosomal DNA region of PfA7B affected the production of three high molecular mass proteins required for viscosin synthesis. These proteins, approximately 218, 215, and 137 kDa in size, likely compose a synthetase complex that assembles the nine amino acid peptide of viscosin and subsequently attaches this to the hydrophobic fatty acid component of the molecule. A probe made from this DNA region hybridized with DNA fragments of other phytopathogenic pseudomonads to varying degrees.	1
Title: Discovery of ammosesters by mining the Streptomyces uncialis DCA2648 genome revealing new insight into ammosamide biosynthesis Abstract: The ammosamides (AMMs) are a family of pyrroloquinoline alkaloids that exhibits a wide variety of bioactivities. A biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that is highly homologous in both gene content and genetic organization to the amm BGC was identified by mining the Streptomyces uncialis DCA2648 genome, leading to the discovery of a sub-family of new AMM congeners, named ammosesters (AMEs). The AMEs feature a C-4a methyl ester, differing from the C-4a amide functional group characteristic to AMMs, and exhibit modest cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines, expanding the structure-activity relationship for the pyrroloquinoline family of natural products. Comparative analysis of the ame and amm BGCs supports the use of a scaffold peptide as an emerging paradigm for the biosynthesis of the pyrroloquinoline family of natural products. AME and AMM biosynthesis diverges from a common intermediate by evolving the pathway-specific Ame24 O-methyltransferase and Amm20 amide synthetase, respectively. These findings will surely inspire future efforts to mimic Nature's combinatorial biosynthetic strategies for natural product structural diversity.	1
Title: Structures of darunavir-resistant HIV-1 protease mutant reveal atypical binding of darunavir to wide open flaps Abstract: The molecular basis for high resistance to clinical inhibitors of HIV-1 protease (PR) was examined for the variant designated PRP51 that was selected for resistance to darunavir (DRV). High resolution crystal structures of PRP51 with the active site D25N mutation revealed a ligand-free form and an inhibitor-bound form showing a unique binding site and orientation for DRV. This inactivating mutation is known to increase the dimer dissociation constant and decrease DRV affinity of PR. The PRP51-D25N dimers were in the open conformation with widely separated flaps, as reported for other highly resistant variants. PRP51-D25N dimer bound two DRV molecules and showed larger separation of 8.7 Å between the closest atoms of the two flaps compared with 4.4 Å for the ligand-free structure of this mutant. The ligand-free structure, however, lacked van der Waals contacts between Ile50 and Pro81' from the other subunit in the dimer, unlike the majority of PR structures. DRV is bound inside the active site cavity; however, the inhibitor is oriented almost perpendicular to its typical position and exhibits only 2 direct hydrogen bond and two water-mediated interactions with atoms of PRP51-D25N compared with 11 hydrogen bond interactions seen for DRV bound in the typical position in wild-type enzyme. The atypical location of DRV may provide opportunities for design of novel inhibitors targeting the open conformation of PR drug-resistant mutants.	0
Title: The antiviral protein cyanovirin-N: the current state of its production and applications Abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS continues to spread worldwide, and most of the HIV-infected people living in developing countries have little or no access to highly active antiretroviral therapy. The development of efficient and low-cost microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV should be given high priority because there is no vaccine available yet. Cyanovirin-N (CVN) is an entry inhibitor of HIV and many other viruses, and it represents a new generation of microbicide that has specific and potent activity, a different mechanism of action, and unusual chemicophysical stability. In vitro and in vivo antiviral tests suggested that the anti-HIV effect of CVN is stronger than a well-known gp120-targeted antibody (2G12) and another microbicide candidate, PRO2000. CVN is a cyanobacteria-derived protein that has special structural features, making the artificial production of this protein very difficult. In order to develop an efficient and relatively low-cost approach for large-scale production of recombinant CVN to satisfy medical use, this protein has been expressed in many systems by trial and error. Here, to summarize the potential and remaining challenges for the development of this protein into an HIV prevention agent, the progress in the structural mechanism determination, heterologous production and pharmacological evaluation of CVN is reviewed.	0
Title: Bombyxamycins A and B, Cytotoxic Macrocyclic Lactams from an Intestinal Bacterium of the Silkworm Bombyx mori Abstract: Bombyxamycins A and B (1 and 2) were discovered from a silkworm gut Streptomyces bacterium. Spectroscopic analysis and multiple-step chemical derivatization identified them as 26-membered cyclic lactams with polyene features. Bombyxamycin A showed significant antibacterial and antiproliferative effects. The bombyxamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by genetic analysis. Gene deletion experiments confirmed that the cytochrome P450 BomK is responsible for the generation of 2, which unprecedentedly bears tetrahydrofuran in its macrocyclic ring.	1
Title: The length of the bound fatty acid influences the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein and the stability of the thioester bond Abstract: Acyl carrier proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis have been shown to exhibit a high degree of conformational flexibility, in that they are able to sequester fatty acid intermediates between 4 and 18 carbons in length. This flexibility has been observed in X-ray and NMR structures of acyl carrier proteins attached to different fatty acids. NMR studies comparing decanoyl-ACP and stearoyl-ACP indicated that ACP exhibits more dynamic motions when bound to longer fatty acids. We have used complementary chemical and NMR methods as an approach to improving our understanding of the effect of fatty acid length on the dynamics of acyl carrier protein. A chemical assay of the accessibility of the acyl thioester to solvent revealed a positive correlation between chain length and rate of hydrolysis. Surprisingly, this linear correlation was biphasic, with accelerated hydrolysis observed for fatty acids longer than 15 carbons. To further understand the motions associated with this acceleration, we collected (15)N relaxation dispersion data for 14:0-, 15:0-, and 16:0-ACP. The greatest dispersions were exhibited by residues that form the entrance to the fatty acid binding pocket. In addition, these dispersions were observed to increase with the length of the fatty acid. Because the exchange rates derived from fitting the data to a two-state model varied from residue to residue, a more complex motional model appears to be required to adequately explain the dynamics. Thus, acyl-ACP offers an interesting system for future investigations of complex protein motions on the micro- and millisecond time scales.	0
Title: Engineering bacterial transcription regulation to create a synthetic in vitro two-hybrid system for protein interaction assays Abstract: Transcriptional activation of σ(54)-RNA polymerase holoenzyme (σ(54)-RNAP) in bacteria is dependent on a cis-acting DNA element (bacterial enhancer), which recruits the bacterial enhancer-binding protein to contact the holoenzyme via DNA looping. Using a constructive synthetic biology approach, we recapitulated such process of transcriptional activation by recruitment in a reconstituted cell-free system, assembled entirely from a defined number of purified components. We further engineered the bacterial enhancer-binding protein PspF to create an in vitro two-hybrid system (IVT2H), capable of carrying out gene regulation in response to expressed protein interactions. Compared with genetic systems and other in vitro methods, IVT2H not only allows detection of different types of protein interactions in just a few hours without involving cells but also provides a general correlation of the relative binding strength of the protein interaction with the IVT2H signal. Due to its reconstituted nature, IVT2H provides a biochemical assay platform with a clean and defined background. We demonstrated the proof-of-concept of using IVT2H as an alternative assay for high throughput screening of small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interaction.	0
Title: Genome-based cluster deletion reveals an endocrocin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Endocrocin is a simple anthraquinone frequently identified in extracts of numerous fungi. Several biosynthetic schemes for endocrocin synthesis have been hypothesized, but to date, no dedicated secondary metabolite gene cluster that produces this polyketide as its major metabolite has been identified. Here we describe our biosynthetic and regulatory characterization of the endocrocin gene cluster in Aspergillus fumigatus. This is the first report of this anthraquinone in this species. The biosynthetic genes required for endocrocin production are regulated by the global regulator of secondary metabolism, LaeA, and encode an iterative nonreducing polyketide synthase (encA), a physically discrete metallo-β-lactamase type thioesterase (encB), and a monooxygenase (encC). Interestingly, the deletion of a gene immediately adjacent to encC, termed encD and encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-Fe(II) type oxidoreductase, resulted in higher levels of endocrocin production than in the wild-type strain, whereas overexpression of encD eliminated endocrocin accumulation. We found that overexpression of the encA transcript resulted in higher transcript levels of encA-D and higher production of endocrocin. We discuss a model of the enc cluster as one evolutionary origin of fungal anthraquinones derived from a nonreducing polyketide synthase and a discrete metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase.	1
Title: Functional Analysis of Cytochrome P450s Involved in Streptovaricin Biosynthesis and Generation of Anti-MRSA Analogues Abstract: The streptovaricins, chemically related to the rifamycins, are highly effective antibacterial agents, particularly against mycobacteria. Herein, a bioassay-guided investigation of Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 has led to the characterization of streptovaricins as potent compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We identified the streptovaricin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 based on genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Targeted in-frame deletion of five cytochrome P450 genes (stvP1-P5) resulted in the identification of four new streptovaricin analogues and revealed the functions of these genes as follows: stvP1, stvP4, and stvP5 are responsible for the hydroxylation of C-20, Me-24, and C-28, respectively. stvP2 is possibly involved in formation of the methylenedioxy bridge, and stvP3, a conserved gene found in the biosynthetic cluster for naphthalenic ansamycins, might be related to the formation of a naphthalene ring. Biochemical verification of the hydroxylase activity of StvP1, StvP4, and StvP5 was performed, and StvP1 showed unexpected biocatalytic specificity and promiscuity. More importantly, anti-MRSA studies of streptovaricins and derivatives revealed significant structure-activity relationships (SARs): The hydroxyl group at C-28 plays a vital role in antibacterial activity. The hydroxyl group at C-20 substantially enhances activity in the absence of the methoxycarbonyl side chain at C-24, which can increase the activity regardless of the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-20. The inner lactone ring between C-21 and C-24 shows a positive effect on activity. This work provides meaningful information on the SARs of streptovaricins and demonstrates the utility of the engineering of streptovaricins to yield novel anti-MRSA molecules.	1
Title: Sequence analysis and functional characterization of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Violacein is a purple-colored, broad-spectrum antibacterial pigment that has a dimeric structure composed of 5-hydroxyindole, oxindole and 2-pyyrolidone subunits formed by the condensation of two modified tryptophan molecules. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster from Chromobacterium violaceum was characterized by DNA sequencing, transposon mutagenesis, and chemical analysis of the pathway intermediates produced heterologously in Escherichia. coli. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster spans eight kilobases and is comprised of the four genes, vioABCD, that are necessary for violacein production. Sequence analysis suggests that the products of vioA, vioC and vioD are nucleotide-dependent monooxygenases. Disruption of vioA or vioB completely abrogates the biosynthesis of violacein intermediates, while disruption of the vioC or vioD genes results in the production of violacein precursors.	1
Title: Aspcandine: A Pyrrolobenzazepine Alkaloid Synthesized by a Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase-Polyketide Synthase Hybrid Abstract: Characterization of an orphan biosynthetic gene cluster found in the fungus Aspergillus candidus CBS 102.13 resulted in the discovery of a pyrrolobenzazepine alkaloid, aspcandine (1). The unique molecular scaffold of 1 is synthesized by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase hybrid AcdB, which unusually incorporates 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine as a building block. AcdB subsequently performs one round of chain elongation using malonyl-CoA, which is followed by the chain release to furnish the tricyclic system of 1.	1
Title: The highly attenuated oncolytic recombinant vaccinia virus GLV-1h68: comparative genomic features and the contribution of F14.5L inactivation Abstract: As a new anticancer treatment option, vaccinia virus (VACV) has shown remarkable antitumor activities (oncolysis) in preclinical studies, but potential infection of other organs remains a safety concern. We present here genome comparisons between the de novo sequence of GLV-1h68, a recombinant VACV, and other VACVs. The identified differences in open reading frames (ORFs) include genes encoding host-range selection, virulence and immune modulation proteins, e.g., ankyrin-like proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor SPI-2/CrmA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor homolog CrmC, semaphorin-like and interleukin-1 receptor homolog proteins. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that GLV-1h68 is closest to Lister strains but has lost several ORFs present in its parental LIVP strain, including genes encoding CrmE and a viral Golgi anti-apoptotic protein, v-GAAP. The reduced pathogenicity of GLV-1h68 is confirmed in male mice bearing C6 rat glioma and in immunocompetent mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The contribution of foreign gene expression cassettes in the F14.5L, J2R and A56R loci is analyzed, in particular the contribution of F14.5L inactivation to the reduced virulence is demonstrated by comparing the virulence of GLV-1h68 with its F14.5L-null and revertant viruses. GLV-1h68 is a promising engineered VACV variant for anticancer therapy with tumor-specific replication, reduced pathogenicity and benign tissue tropism.	0
Title: Quorum-Sensing Signals from Epibiont Mediate the Induction of Novel Microviridins in the Mat-Forming Cyanobacterial Genus Nostoc Abstract: The regulation of the production of oligopeptides is essential in understanding their ecological role in complex microbial communities, including harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The role of chemical communication between the cyanobacterium and the microbial community harbored as epibionts within its phycosphere is at an initial stage of research, and little is understood about its specificity. Here, we present insight into the role of a bacterial epibiont in regulating the production of novel microviridins isolated from Nostoc, an ecologically important cyanobacterial genus. Microviridins are well-known elastase inhibitors with presumed antigrazing effects. Heterologous expression and identification of specific signal molecules from the epibiont suggest the role of a quorum-sensing-based interaction. Furthermore, physiological experiments show an increase in microviridin production without affecting cyanobacterial growth and photosynthetic activity. Simultaneously, oligopeptides presenting a selective inhibition pattern provide support for their specific function in response to the presence of cohabitant epibionts. Thus, the chemical interaction revealed in our study provides an example of an interspecies signaling pathway monitoring the bacterial flora around the cyanobacterial filaments and the induction of intrinsic species-specific metabolic responses. IMPORTANCE The regulation of the production of cyanopeptides beyond microcystin is essential to understand their ecological role in complex microbial communities, e.g., harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The role of chemical communication between the cyanobacterium and the epibionts within its phycosphere is at an initial stage of research, and little is understood about its specificity. The frequency of cyanopeptide occurrence also demonstrates the need to understand the contribution of cyanobacterial peptides to the overall biological impact of cyanopeptides on aquatic organisms and vertebrates, including humans. Our results shed light on the epibiont control of microviridin production via quorum-sensing mechanisms, and we posit that such mechanisms may be widespread in natural cyanobacterial bloom community regulation.	1
Title: Zerumbone Alleviates Neuropathic Pain through the Involvement of l-Arginine-Nitric Oxide-cGMP-K⁺ ATP Channel Pathways in Chronic Constriction Injury in Mice Model Abstract: The present study investigates the involvement of the l-arginine-Nitric Oxide-cGMP-K⁺ ATP pathways responsible for the action of anti-allodynic and antihyperalgesic activities of zerumbone in chronic constriction injury (CCI) induced neuropathic pain in mice. The role of l-arginine-NO-cGMP-K⁺ was assessed by the von Frey and the Randall-Selitto tests. Both allodynia and hyperalgesia assessments were carried out on the 14th day post CCI, 30 min after treatments were given for each respective pathway. Anti-allodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of zerumbone (10 mg/kg, i.p) were significantly reversed by the pre-treatment of l-arginine (10 mg/kg), 1H [1,2,4]Oxadiazole[4,3a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a soluble guanosyl cyclase blocker (2 mg/kg i.p.) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker) (10 mg/kg i.p.) (p < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that systemic administration of zerumbone produces significant anti-allodynic and antihyperalgesic activities in neuropathic pain in mice possibly due to involvement of the l-arginine-NO-cGMP-PKG-K⁺ ATP channel pathways in CCI model.	0
Title: Physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T chromosome Abstract: A combined physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T genome was constructed by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and DNA blot hybridizations. The S. hyodysenteriae genome is a single circular chromosome about 3.2 Mb in size. The physical map of the chromosome was constructed with the restriction enzymes BssHII, EclXI, NotI, SalI, and SmaI. The physical map was used to constructed a linkage map for genes encoding rRNA, flagellum subunit proteins, DNA gyrase, NADH oxidase, and three distinct hemolysins. Several flaB2-related loci, encoding core flagellum subunit proteins, were detected and are dispersed around the chromosome. The rRNA gene organization in S. hyodysenteriae is unusual. S. hyodysenteriae has one gene each for 5S (rrf), 16S (rrs), and 23S (rrl) rRNAs. The rrf and rrl genes are closely linked (within 5 kb), while the rrs gene is about 860 kb from the other two rRNA genes. Using a probe for the S. hyodysenteriae gyrA gene, we identified a possible location for the chromosomal replication origin. The size and genetic organization of the S. hyodysenteriae chromosome are different from those of previously characterized spirochetes.	0
Title: The ribostamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces ribosidificus: comparison with butirosin biosynthesis Abstract: A cluster of genes for ribostamycin (Rbm) biosynthesis was isolated from Streptomyces ribosidificus ATCC 21294. Sequencing of 31.892 kb of the genomic DNA of S. ribosidificus revealed 26 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative Rbm biosynthetic genes as well as resistance and other genes. One of ten putative Rbm biosynthetic genes, rbmA, was expressed in S. lividans TK24, and shown to encode 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase. Acetylation of various aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol (AmAcs) by RbmI confirmed it to be an aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase. Comparison of the genetic control of ribostamycin and butirosin biosynthesis pointed to a common biosynthetic route for these compounds, despite the considerable differences between them in genetic organization.	1
Title: Genome sequence of the bacterium Streptomyces davawensis JCM 4913 and heterologous production of the unique antibiotic roseoflavin Abstract: Streptomyces davawensis JCM 4913 synthesizes the antibiotic roseoflavin, a structural riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) analog. Here, we report the 9,466,619-bp linear chromosome of S. davawensis JCM 4913 and a 89,331-bp linear plasmid. The sequence has an average G+C content of 70.58% and contains six rRNA operons (16S-23S-5S) and 69 tRNA genes. The 8,616 predicted protein-coding sequences include 32 clusters coding for secondary metabolites, several of which are unique to S. davawensis. The chromosome contains long terminal inverted repeats of 33,255 bp each and atypical telomeres. Sequence analysis with regard to riboflavin biosynthesis revealed three different patterns of gene organization in Streptomyces species. Heterologous expression of a set of genes present on a subgenomic fragment of S. davawensis resulted in the production of roseoflavin by the host Streptomyces coelicolor M1152. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that S. davawensis is a close relative of Streptomyces cinnabarinus, and much to our surprise, we found that the latter bacterium is a roseoflavin producer as well.	1
Title: Enhanced Cleavage at Abasic Sites within Clustered Lesions in Nucleosome Core Particles Abstract: Clustered lesions are a hallmark of γ-radiolysis, but are produced by other damaging agents as well. Bistranded clustered lesions are precursors to double-strand breaks and are challenging to repair, thus making them an especially deleterious form of DNA damage. An abasic site (AP) is an alkaline-labile lesion frequently present in clustered lesions. Strand scission at an AP site is accelerated ≈100-fold in nucleosome core particles (NCPs). We examined how AP reactivity was affected within clustered lesions in NCPs. The rate constant of strand scission is increased as much as 2.5-fold in the presence of a proximal abasic site or thymidine glycol in the complementary strand. A proximal mispair has a similar effect on AP reactivity. Increased AP reactivity within a clustered lesion correlates with decreased UV melting temperatures of the corresponding duplexes compared to one containing an isolated abasic site. However, the thermodynamics of duplex melting do not correlate with AP reactivity within different clustered lesions. Overall, increased AP reactivity within clustered lesions is attributed to greater access of histone proteins to the lesion due to decreased duplex stability.	0
Title: Design and synthesis of C6-C8 bridged epothilone A Abstract: A conformationally restrained epothilone A analogue (3) with a short bridge between methyl groups at C6 and C8 was designed and synthesized. Preliminary biological evaluation indicates 3 to be only weakly active (IC50 = 8.5 microM) against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of the gene associated with geosmin production in cyanobacteria Abstract: Geosmin is a secondary metabolite responsible for earthy tastes and odors in potable water supplies. Geosmin continues to be a challenge to water utility management regimes and remains one of the most common causes of consumer complaints, as the taste of "dirty" water may suggest a failed disinfection regime and that the water may be unsafe to drink. Although cyanobacteria have been reported to be largely responsible for these taste and odor events, the answer as to how or why geosmin is produced has eluded researchers. We describe here for the first time the mechanism by which geosmin is produced in a model cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (ATCC 29133), which we demonstrate utilizes a single enzyme to catalyze the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin. Using this information, we have developed a PCR-based assay that allows the rapid detection of geosmin-producing cyanobacteria. This test may be utilized to confirm and track the emergence of taste and odor-producing cyanobacteria in any given water body and thus can be used as an early warning system by managers of water bodies that may suffer from adverse taste and odor episodes.	1
Title: Calculations predict that carbon tunneling allows the degenerate cope rearrangement of semibullvalene to occur rapidly at cryogenic temperatures Abstract: Calculations on the role of tunneling in the degenerate Cope rearrangements of semibullvalene (1) and barbaralane (3) predict that, at temperatures below 40 K, tunneling from the lowest vibrational level should make the temperature-independent rate constants k = 1.43 x 10(-3) s(-1) and k = 7.28 x 10(-9) s(-1), respectively. An experiment, using semibullvalene-2(4)-d(1), is proposed to test the prediction of rapid tunneling by 1 at cryogenic temperatures.	0
Title: Using ¹⁵N-ammonium to characterise and map potassium binding sites in proteins by NMR spectroscopy Abstract: A variety of enzymes are activated by the binding of potassium ions. The potassium binding sites of these enzymes are very specific, but ammonium ions can often replace potassium ions in vitro because of their similar ionic radii. In these cases, ammonium can be used as a proxy for potassium to characterise potassium binding sites in enzymes: the (1) H,(15) N spin-pair of enzyme-bound (15) NH4 (+) can be probed by (15) N-edited heteronuclear NMR experiments. Here, we demonstrate the use of NMR spectroscopy to characterise binding of ammonium ions to two different enzymes: human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), which is activated allosterically by potassium, and the bacterial Hsp70 homologue DnaK, for which potassium is an integral part of the active site. Ammonium activates both enzymes in a similar way to potassium, thus supporting this non-invasive approach. Furthermore, we present an approach to map the observed binding site onto the structure of HDAC8. Our method for mapping the binding site is general and does not require chemical shift assignment of the enzyme resonances.	0
Title: Analogy Powered by Prediction and Structural Invariants: Computationally Led Discovery of a Mesoporous Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Cage Crystal Abstract: Mesoporous molecular crystals have potential applications in separation and catalysis, but they are rare and hard to design because many weak interactions compete during crystallization, and most molecules have an energetic preference for close packing. Here, we combine crystal structure prediction (CSP) with structural invariants to continuously qualify the similarity between predicted crystal structures for related molecules. This allows isomorphous substitution strategies, which can be unreliable for molecular crystals, to be augmented by a priori prediction, thus leveraging the power of both approaches. We used this combined approach to discover a rare example of a low-density (0.54 g cm-3) mesoporous hydrogen-bonded framework (HOF), 3D-CageHOF-1. This structure comprises an organic cage (Cage-3-NH2) that was predicted to form kinetically trapped, low-density polymorphs via CSP. Pointwise distance distribution structural invariants revealed five predicted forms of Cage-3-NH2 that are analogous to experimentally realized porous crystals of a chemically different but geometrically similar molecule, T2. More broadly, this approach overcomes the difficulties in comparing predicted molecular crystals with varying lattice parameters, thus allowing for the systematic comparison of energy-structure landscapes for chemically dissimilar molecules.	0
Title: Redundant synthesis of a conidial polyketide by two distinct secondary metabolite clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Filamentous fungi are renowned for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Typically, one distinct metabolite is generated from a specific secondary metabolite cluster. Here, we characterize the newly described trypacidin (tpc) cluster in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that this cluster as well as the previously characterized endocrocin (enc) cluster both contribute to the production of the spore metabolite endocrocin. Whereas trypacidin is eliminated when only tpc cluster genes are deleted, endocrocin production is only eliminated when both the tpc and enc non-reducing polyketide synthase-encoding genes, tpcC and encA, respectively, are deleted. EncC, an anthrone oxidase, converts the product released from EncA to endocrocin as a final product. In contrast, endocrocin synthesis by the tpc cluster likely results from incomplete catalysis by TpcK (a putative decarboxylase), as its deletion results in a nearly 10-fold increase in endocrocin production. We suggest endocrocin is likely a shunt product in all related non-reducing polyketide synthase clusters containing homologues of TpcK and TpcL (a putative anthrone oxidase), e.g. geodin and monodictyphenone. This finding represents an unusual example of two physically discrete secondary metabolite clusters generating the same natural product in one fungal species by distinct routes.	1
Title: Drug repurposing strategies in the development of potential antifungal agents Abstract: The morbidity and mortality caused by invasive fungal infections are increasing across the globe due to developments in transplant surgery, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains, which has led to a challenge in terms of treatment due to the limitations of three classes of drugs. Hence, it is imperative to establish effective strategies to identify and design new antifungal drugs. Drug repurposing is a potential way of expanding the application of existing drugs. Recently, various existing drugs have been shown to be useful in the prevention and treatment of invasive fungi. In this review, we summarize the currently used antifungal agents. In addition, the most up-to-date information on the effectiveness of existing drugs with antifungal activity is discussed. Moreover, the antifungal mechanisms of existing drugs are highlighted. These data will provide valuable knowledge to stimulate further investigation and clinical application in this field. KEY POINTS: • Conventional antifungal agents have limitations due to the occurrence of drug-resistant strains. • Non-antifungal drugs act as antifungal agents in various ways toward different targets. • Non-antifungal drugs with antifungal activity are demonstrated as effective antifungal strategies.	0
Title: In vitro synergism of FR-31564, a new phosphonic acid antibiotic Abstract: Against most test strains of Gram-negative bacilli, the in vitro effect of FR-31564 together with beta-lactam antibiotics or trimethoprim was strongly synergistic; with tetracycline and nalidixic acid the effect was additive; and with gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole the effect was additive or antagonistic. FR-31564 was markedly synergistic with beta-lactam antibiotics against beta-lactam antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The combination of FR-31564 with beta-lactam antibiotics effected a reduction of MICs against most of the test strains to clinically achievable concentrations in human serum.	0
Title: Functions required for extracellular quinolone signaling by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: A set of 30 mutants exhibiting reduced production of the phenazine poison pyocyanin were isolated following transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The mutants could be subdivided into those with defects in the primary phenazine biosynthetic pathway and those with more pleiotropic defects. The largest set of pleiotropic mutations blocked the production of the extracellular Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a molecule required for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes. Most of these pqs mutations affected genes which appear to encode PQS biosynthetic functions, although a transcriptional regulator and an apparent response effector were also represented. Two of the genes required for PQS synthesis (phnA and phnB) had previously been assumed to encode phenazine biosynthetic functions. The transcription of one of the genes required for PQS synthesis (PA2587/pqsH) was regulated by the LasI/R quorum-sensing system, thereby linking quorum sensing and PQS regulation. Others of the pleiotropic phenazine-minus mutations appear to inactivate novel components of the quorum-sensing regulatory network, including one regulator (np20) previously shown to be required for virulence in neutropenic mice.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster afford a diterpene cyclase and two p450 hydroxylases Abstract: Cyclooctatin, a diterpene characterized by a 5-8-5 fused ring system, is a potent inhibitor of lysophospholipase. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces melanosporofaciens MI614-43F2 and heterologous production of cyclooctatin in S. albus. Sequence analysis coupled with subcloning and gene deletion revealed that the minimal cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster consists of four genes, cotB1 to cotB4, encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthase, terpene cyclase (CotB2), and two cytochromes P450, respectively. Incubation of the recombinant CotB2 with GGDP resulted in the formation of cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol, an unprecedented tricyclic diterpene alcohol. The present study establishes the complete biosynthetic pathway of cyclooctatin and provides insights into both the stereospecific diterpene cyclization mechanism of the GGDP cyclase and the molecular bases for the stereospecific and regiospecific hydroxylation.	1
Title: Nutrient-dependent structural changes in S. aureus peptidoglycan revealed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy Abstract: The bacterial cell wall is essential to cell survival and is a major target of antibiotics. The main component of the bacterial cell wall is peptidoglycan, a cage-like macromolecule that preserves cellular integrity and maintains cell shape. The insolubility and heterogeneity of peptidoglycan pose a challenge to conventional structural analyses. Here we use solid-state NMR combined with specific isotopic labeling to probe a key structural feature of the Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan quantitatively and nondestructively. We observed that both the cell-wall morphology and the peptidoglycan structure are functions of growth stage in S. aureus synthetic medium (SASM). Specifically, S. aureus cells at stationary phase have thicker cell walls with nonuniformly thickened septa compared to cells in exponential phase, and remarkably, 12% (±2%) of the stems in their peptidoglycan do not have pentaglycine bridges attached. Mechanistically, we determined that these observations are triggered by the depletion of glycine in the nutrient medium, which is coincident with the start of the stationary phase, and that the production of the structurally altered peptidoglycan can be prevented by the addition of excess glycine. We also demonstrated that the structural changes primarily arise within newly synthesized peptidoglycan rather than through the modification of previously synthesized peptidoglycan. Collectively, our observations emphasize the plasticity in bacterial cell-wall assembly and the possibility to manipulate peptidoglycan structure with external stimuli.	0
Title: Genome mining for natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in the Subsection V cyanobacteria Abstract: Background:                       Cyanobacteria are well known for the production of a range of secondary metabolites. Whilst recent genome sequencing projects has led to an increase in the number of publically available cyanobacterial genomes, the secondary metabolite potential of many of these organisms remains elusive. Our study focused on the 11 publically available Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, together with the draft genomes of Westiella intricata UH strain HT-29-1 and Hapalosiphon welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3, for their genetic potential to produce secondary metabolites. The Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes analysed in this study are reported to produce a diverse range of natural products, including the hapalindole-family of compounds, microcystin, hapalosin, mycosporine-like amino acids and hydrocarbons.                  Results:                       A putative gene cluster for the cyclic depsipeptide hapalosin, known to reverse P-glycoprotein multiple drug resistance, was identified within three Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, including the producing cyanobacterium H. welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3. A number of orphan NRPS/PKS gene clusters and ribosomally-synthesised and post translationally-modified peptide gene clusters (including cyanobactin, microviridin and bacteriocin gene clusters) were identified. Furthermore, gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, scytonemin, hydrocarbons and terpenes were also identified and compared.                  Conclusions:                       Genome mining has revealed the diversity, abundance and complex nature of the secondary metabolite potential of the Subsection V cyanobacteria. This bioinformatic study has identified novel biosynthetic enzymes which have not been associated with gene clusters of known classes of natural products, suggesting that these cyanobacteria potentially produce structurally novel secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Higher Acenes by On-Surface Dehydrogenation: From Heptacene to Undecacene Abstract: A unified approach to the synthesis of the series of higher acenes up to previously unreported undecacene has been developed through the on-surface dehydrogenation of partially saturated precursors. These molecules could be converted into the parent acenes by both atomic manipulation with the tip of a scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope (STM/AFM) as well as by on-surface annealing. The structure of the generated acenes has been visualized by high-resolution non-contact AFM imaging and the evolution of the transport gap with the increase of the number of fused benzene rings has been determined on the basis of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements.	0
Title: The Natural Product Elegaphenone Potentiates Antibiotic Effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Natural products represent a rich source of antibiotics that address versatile cellular targets. The deconvolution of their targets via chemical proteomics is often challenged by the introduction of large photocrosslinkers. Here we applied elegaphenone, a largely uncharacterized natural product antibiotic bearing a native benzophenone core scaffold, for affinity-based protein profiling (AfBPP) in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This study utilizes the alkynylated natural product scaffold as a probe to uncover intriguing biological interactions with the transcriptional regulator AlgP. Furthermore, proteome profiling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlgP transposon mutant provided unique insights into the mode of action. Elegaphenone enhanced the elimination of intracellular P. aeruginosa in macrophages exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic norfloxacin.	0
Title: In vitro reconstruction of tetronate RK-682 biosynthesis Abstract: The protein phosphatase inhibitor RK-682 is one of a number of potentially valuable tetronate polyketide natural products. Understanding how the tetronate ring is formed has been frustrated by the inaccessibility of the putative substrates. We report the heterologous expression of rk genes in Saccharopolyspora erythraea and reconstitution of the RK-682 pathway using recombinant enzymes, and we show that RkD is the enzyme required for RK-682 formation from acyl carrier protein-bound substrates.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of violacein: a genuine intermediate, protoviolaceinic acid, produced by VioABDE, and insight into VioC function Abstract: A biosynthetic intermediate of violacein produced by the mixed enzymes of VioABDE was elucidated to be 5-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, named protoviolaceinic acid, indicating that VioC, responsible for the final biosynthetic step, works to oxygenate at the 2-position of the right side indole ring, and that the oxygenation reaction to form the central pyrrolidone core proceeds in a non-enzymatic fashion.	1
Title: Amino acid precursor supply in the biosynthesis of the RNA polymerase inhibitor streptolydigin by Streptomyces lydicus Abstract: Biosynthesis of the hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide antibiotic streptolydigin, 3-methylaspartate, is utilized as precursor of the tetramic acid moiety. The three genes from the Streptomyces lydicus streptolydigin gene cluster slgE1-slgE2-slgE3 are involved in 3-methylaspartate supply. SlgE3, a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, is responsible for the biosynthesis of glutamate from glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate. In addition to slgE3, housekeeping NADPH- and ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase genes have been identified in S. lydicus. The expression of slgE3 is increased up to 9-fold at the onset of streptolydigin biosynthesis and later decreases to ∼2-fold over the basal level. In contrast, the expression of housekeeping glutamate synthases decreases when streptolydigin begins to be synthesized. SlgE1 and SlgE2 are the two subunits of a glutamate mutase that would convert glutamate into 3-methylaspartate. Deletion of slgE1-slgE2 led to the production of two compounds containing a lateral side chain derived from glutamate instead of 3-methylaspartate. Expression of this glutamate mutase also reaches a peak increase of up to 5.5-fold coinciding with the onset of antibiotic production. Overexpression of either slgE3 or slgE1-slgE2 in S. lydicus led to an increase in the yield of streptolydigin.	1
Title: Novobiocin biosynthesis: inactivation of the putative regulatory gene novE and heterologous expression of genes involved in aminocoumarin ring formation Abstract: The left ends of the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin ( nov), clorobiocin ( clo) and coumermycin A(1) ( cou) from Streptomyces spheroides (syn. S. caeruleus) NCIMB 11891, S. roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976 and S. rishiriensis DSM 40489 were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison suggested that novE, cloE and couE, respectively, represent the borders of these three clusters. Inactivation of novE proved that novE does not have an essential catalytic role in novobiocin biosynthesis, but is likely to have a regulatory function. The gene products of novF and cloF show sequence similarity to prephenate dehydrogenase and may produce 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) as a precursor of the substituted benzoate moiety of novobiocin and clorobiocin. Coumermycin A(1) does not contain this benzoate moiety, and correspondingly the coumermycin cluster was found not to contain a functional novF homologue. The coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster apparently evolved from an ancestral cluster similar to those of novobiocin and clorobiocin, and parts of the ancestral novF homologue have been deleted in this process. No homologue to novC was identified in the gene clusters of clorobiocin and coumermycin, questioning the postulated involvement of novC in aminocoumarin biosynthesis. Heterologous expression of novDEFGHIJK in Streptomyces lividans resulted in the formation of 2,4-dihydroxy-alpha-oxy-phenylacetic acid, suggesting that at least one of the proteins encoded by these genes may participate in a hydroxylation reaction.	1
Title: Thiostrepton Variants Containing a Contracted Quinaldic Acid Macrocycle Result from Mutagenesis of the Second Residue Abstract: The thiopeptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide metabolites, and the vast majority of thiopeptides characterized to date possess one highly modified macrocycle. A few members, including thiostrepton A, harbor a second macrocycle that incorporates a quinaldic acid moiety and the four N-terminal residues of the peptide. The antibacterial properties of thiostrepton A are well established, and its recently discovered ability to inhibit the proteasome has additional implications for the development of antimalarial and anticancer therapeutics. We have conducted the saturation mutagenesis of Ala2 in the precursor peptide, TsrA, to examine which variants can be transformed into a mature thiostrepton analogue. Although the thiostrepton biosynthetic system is somewhat restrictive toward substitutions at the second residue, eight thiostrepton Ala2 analogues were isolated. The TsrA Ala2Ile and Ala2Val variants were largely channeled through an alternate processing pathway wherein the first residue of the core peptide, Ile1, is removed, and the resulting thiostrepton analogues bear quinaldic acid macrocycles abridged by one residue. This is the first report revealing that quinaldic acid loop size is amenable to alteration during the course of thiostrepton biosynthesis. Both the antibacterial and proteasome inhibitory properties of the thiostrepton Ala2 analogues were examined. While the identity of the residue at the second position of the core peptide influences thiostrepton biosynthesis, our report suggests it may not be crucial for antibacterial and proteasome inhibitory properties of the full-length variants. In contrast, the contracted quinaldic acid loop can, to differing degrees, affect both types of biological activity.	0
Title: A Fasciclin Protein Is Essential for Laccase-Mediated Selective Phenol Coupling in Sporandol Biosynthesis Abstract: The biaryl scaffold, often showing axial chirality, is a common feature of various fungal natural products. Their biosynthesis requires an oxidative phenol-coupling reaction usually catalyzed by laccases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, or peroxidases. The combination of a laccase and a fasciclin domain-containing (fas) protein is encoded in many biosynthetic gene clusters of biaryls from ascomycetes. However, such phenol-coupling systems including their regio- and stereoselectivity have not been characterized so far. Elucidating the biosynthesis of the antiparasitic binaphthalene sporandol from Chrysosporium merdarium, we demonstrate the combination of a laccase and a fas protein to be crucial for the dimerization reaction. Only the heterologous coproduction of the laccase and the fas protein led to a functional phenol-coupling system, whereas the laccase alone showed no coupling activity. Thus, the laccase/fas protein combination forms an independent group of phenol-coupling enzymes that determines the coupling activity and selectivity of the reaction concurrently and applies to the biosynthesis of many fungal natural products with a biaryl scaffold.	1
Title: Genome mining reveals a minimum gene set for the biosynthesis of 32-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides lactazoles Abstract: Although >100 thiopeptides have been discovered, the number of validated gene clusters involved in their biosynthesis is lagging. We use genome mining to identify a silent thiopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of lactazoles. Lactazoles are structurally unique thiopeptides with a 32-membered macrocycle and a 2-oxazolyl-6-thiazolyl pyridine core. We demonstrate that lactazoles originate from the simplest cluster, containing only six unidirectional genes (lazA to lazF). We show that lazC is involved in the macrocyclization process, leading to central pyridine moiety formation. Substitution of the endogenous promoter with a strong promoter results in an approximately 30-fold increase in lactazole A production and mutagenesis of lazC precursor gene in production of two analogs. Lactazoles do not exhibit antimicrobial activity but may modulate signaling cascades triggered by bone morphogenetic protein. Our approach facilitates the production of a more diverse set of thiopeptide structures, increasing the semisynthetic repertoire for use in drug development.	1
Title: A 3.3 Å-Resolution Structure of Hyperthermophilic Respiratory Complex III Reveals the Mechanism of Its Thermal Stability Abstract: Respiratory chain complexes convert energy by coupling electron flow to transmembrane proton translocation. Owing to a lack of atomic structures of cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III) from thermophilic bacteria, little is known about the adaptations of this macromolecular machine to hyperthermophilic environments. In this study, we purified the cytochrome bc1 complex of Aquifex aeolicus, one of the most extreme thermophilic bacteria known, and determined its structure with and without an inhibitor at 3.3 Å resolution. Several residues unique for thermophilic bacteria were detected that provide additional stabilization for the structure. An extra transmembrane helix at the N-terminus of cyt. c1 was found to greatly enhance the interaction between cyt. b and cyt. c1 , and to bind a phospholipid molecule to stabilize the complex in the membrane. These results provide the structural basis for the hyperstability of the cytochrome bc1 complex in an extreme thermal environment.	0
Title: Metabolically Active, Fully Hydrolysable Polymersomes Abstract: The synthesis and aqueous self-assembly of a new class of amphiphilic aliphatic polyesters are presented. These AB block polyesters comprise polycaprolactone (hydrophobe) and an alternating polyester from succinic acid and an ether-substituted epoxide (hydrophile). They self-assemble into biodegradable polymersomes capable of entering cells. Their degradation products are bioactive, giving rise to differentiated cellular responses inducing stromal cell proliferation and macrophage apoptosis. Both effects emerge only when the copolymers enter cells as polymersomes and their magnitudes are size dependent.	0
Title: Exogenous isoleucine and fatty acid shortening ensure the high content of anteiso-C15:0 fatty acid required for low-temperature growth of Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that the branched-chain fatty acid anteiso-C15:0 plays a critical role in the growth of Listeria monocytogenes at low temperatures by ensuring sufficient membrane fluidity. Studies utilizing a chemically defined minimal medium revealed that the anteiso fatty acid precursor isoleucine largely determined the fatty acid profile and fatty acid response of the organism to lowered growth temperature. When isoleucine was sufficient, the fatty acid profile was very uniform, with anteiso fatty acids comprising up to 95% of total fatty acid, and the major fatty acid adjustment to low temperature was fatty acid chain shortening, which resulted in an increase of anteiso-C15:0 solely at the expense of anteiso-C17:0. When isoleucine was not supplied, the fatty acid profile became more complex and was readily modified by leucine, which resulted in a significant increase of corresponding iso fatty acids and an inability to grow at 10 degrees C. Under this condition, the increase of anteiso-C15:0 at low temperature resulted from the combined effect of increasing the anteiso:iso ratio and chain shortening. A branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase-defective strain largely lost the ability to increase the anteiso:iso ratio. Cerulenin, an inhibitor of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (FabF), induced a similar fatty acid chain shortening as low temperature did. We propose that the anteiso precursor preferences of enzymes in the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ensure a high production of anteiso fatty acids, and cold-regulated chain shortening results in a further increase of anteiso-C15:0 at the expense of anteiso-C17:0.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the antitumor chromomycin A3 in Streptomyces griseus: analysis of the gene cluster and rational design of novel chromomycin analogs Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aureolic acid type antitumor drug chromomycin A3 from S. griseus subsp. griseus has been identified and characterized. It spans 43 kb and contains 36 genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis and modification, deoxysugar biosynthesis and sugar transfer, pathway regulation and resistance. The organization of the cluster clearly differs from that of the closely related mithramycin. Involvement of the cluster in chromomycin A3 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the cmmWI gene encoding a polyketide reductase involved in side chain reduction. Three novel chromomycin derivatives were obtained, named chromomycin SK, chromomycin SA, and chromomycin SDK, which show antitumor activity and differ with respect to their 3-side chains. A pathway for the biosynthesis of chromomycin A3 and its deoxysugars is proposed.	1
Title: Nucleotide Binding Modes in a Motor Protein Revealed by 31 P- and 1 H-Detected MAS Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: Protein-nucleic acid interactions play important roles not only in energy-providing reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis, but also in reading, extending, packaging, or repairing genomes. Although they can often be analyzed in detail with X-ray crystallography, complementary methods are needed to visualize them in complexes, which are not crystalline. Here, we show how solid-state NMR spectroscopy can detect and classify protein-nucleic interactions through site-specific 1 H- and 31 P-detected spectroscopic methods. The sensitivity of 1 H chemical-shift values on noncovalent interactions involved in these molecular recognition processes is exploited allowing us to probe directly the chemical bonding state, an information, which is not directly accessible from an X-ray structure. We show that these methods can characterize interactions in easy-to-prepare sediments of the 708 kDa dodecameric DnaB helicase in complex with ADP:AlF4- :DNA, and this despite the very challenging size of the complex.	0
Title: Identification of a methyl-specific restriction system mediated by a conjugative element from Streptomyces bambergiensis Abstract: pBL2 was identified genetically but not physically in Streptomyces lividans after its mating with S. bambergiensis. During conjugation, pBL2 was transferred at high frequency to S. lividans and S. coelicolor. pBL2.1 DNA isolated from S. coelicolor exconjugants as a circular plasmid was shown to derive from the genome of S. bambergiensis. S. lividans carrying pBL2 or pBL2.1 acquired a methyl-specific restriction (MsrA+) phenotype. The corresponding enzyme was partially purified and shown to resemble a class II endonuclease which cleaves Dam-methylated DNA preferentially.	0
Title: Structural basis for stabilization of the tau pre-mRNA splicing regulatory element by novantrone (mitoxantrone) Abstract: Some familial neurodegenerative diseases are associated with mutations that destabilize a putative stem-loop structure within an intronic region of the tau pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) and alter the production of tau protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Because stabilization of the stem loop reverses the splicing pattern associated with neurodegeneration, small molecules that stabilize this stem loop would provide new ways to dissect the mechanism of neurodegeneration and treat tauopathies. The anticancer drug mitoxantrone was recently identified in a high throughput screen to stabilize the tau pre-mRNA stem loop. Here we report the solution structure of the tau mRNA-mitoxantrone complex, validated by the structure-activity relationship of existing mitoxantrone analogs. The structure describes the molecular basis for their interaction with RNA and provides a rational basis to optimize the activity of this new class of RNA-binding molecules.	0
Title: Real-time imaging of surface chemical reactions by electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscopy Abstract: Traditional electrochemical measurements based on either current or potential responses only present the average contribution of an entire electrode's surface. Here, we present an electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscope (EPRM) in which a potential-dependent nonlinear photothermal signal is exploited to map an electrochemical process with sub-micron spatial resolution. By using EPRM, we are able to monitor the photothermal signal of a Pt electrode during the electrochemical reaction at an imaging speed of 0.3 s per frame. The potential-dependent photothermal signal, which is sensitive to the free electron density, clearly revealed the evolution of surface species on the Pt surface. Our results agreed well with the reported spectroelectrochemical techniques under similar conditions but with a much faster imaging speed. We further mapped the potential oscillation during the oxidation of formic acid on the Pt surface. The photothermal images from the Pt electrode well matched the potential change. This technique opens new prospects for real-time imaging of surface chemical reaction to reveal the heterogeneity of electrochemical reactivity, which enables broad applications to the study of catalysis, energy storage, and light harvest systems.	0
Title: Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Chaxamycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster from Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii Abstract: Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii, isolated from the hyperarid Atacama Desert, produces the new ansamycin-like compounds chaxamycins A to D, which possess potent antibacterial activity and moderate antiproliferative activity. We report the development of genetic tools to manipulate S. leeuwenhoekii and the identification and partial characterization of the 80.2-kb chaxamycin biosynthesis gene cluster, which was achieved by both mutational analysis in the natural producer and heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) strain M1152. Restoration of chaxamycin production in a nonproducing ΔcxmK mutant (cxmK encodes 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid [AHBA] synthase) was achieved by supplementing the growth medium with AHBA, suggesting that mutasynthesis may be a viable approach for the generation of novel chaxamycin derivatives.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of a marine-derived bacterium Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1 and characterization of its siderophore through antiSMASH analysis and with mass spectroscopic method Abstract: Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1, isolated from coastal sea water of Xiamen Bay, could produce extracellular pyoverdine. Here, we present the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1, which will facilitate the genome mining of the pyoverdine synthetase coding gene cluster. The sequenced genome, a circular chromosome, is 7,226,716 bp in length, which contains 60.78% of GC bases, 6549 proteins, 67 tRNAs, and 16 rRNA encoding genes. The structure of pyoverdine produced by Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1 was predicted by using the antiSMASH 5.1.2 tool and further characterized with mass spectroscopic method.	1
Title: Identification of the Amipurimycin Gene Cluster Yields Insight into the Biosynthesis of C9 Sugar Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Feeding studies indicate a possible synthetic pattern for the N-terminal cis-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (ACPC) and suggest an unusual source of the high-carbon sugar skeleton of amipurimycin (APM). The biosynthetic gene cluster of APM was identified and confirmed by in vivo experiments. A C9 core intermediate was discovered from null mutants of ACPC pathway, and an ATP-grasp enzyme (ApmA8) was reconstituted in vitro for ACPC loading. Our observations allow a first proposal of the APM biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Study of matrix additives for sensitive analysis of lipid A by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry Abstract: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been widely used for structural characterization of bacterial endotoxins (lipid A). However, the mass spectrometric behavior of the lipid A molecule is highly dependent on the matrix. Furthermore, this dependence is strongly linked to phosphorylation patterns. Using lipid A from Escherichia coli O116 as a model system, we have investigated the effects of different matrices and comatrix compounds on the analysis of lipid A. In this paper, we report a highly sensitive matrix system for lipid A analysis, which consists of 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole matrix and EDTA ammonium salt comatrix. This matrix system enhances the sensitivity of the analysis of diphosphorylated lipid A species by more than 100-fold and in addition provides tolerance to high concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and tolerance to sodium chloride and calcium chloride at 10 muM, 100 muM, and 10 muM concentrations. The method was further evaluated for analysis of lipid A species with different phosphorylation patterns and from different bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica serovar Riogrande, and Francisella novicida.	0
Title: Specific 5-hydroxylation of piperlongumine by Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159 Abstract: A new hydroxylated derivative was efficiently prepared by transforming the natural anti-cancer product, piperlongumine, with Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159. Its structure was determined to be 5-hydroxylpiperlongumine on the basis of the spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration at C-5 was established as R by Mosher's method.	0
Title: Vms1p is a release factor for the ribosome-associated quality control complex Abstract: Eukaryotic cells employ the ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) to maintain homeostasis despite defects that cause ribosomes to stall. The RQC comprises the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p, the ATPase Cdc48p, Rqc1p, and Rqc2p. Upon ribosome stalling and splitting, the RQC assembles on the 60S species containing unreleased peptidyl-tRNA (60S:peptidyl-tRNA). Ltn1p and Rqc1p facilitate ubiquitination of the incomplete nascent chain, marking it for degradation. Rqc2p stabilizes Ltn1p on the 60S and recruits charged tRNAs to the 60S to catalyze elongation of the nascent protein with carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine extensions (CAT tails). By mobilizing the nascent chain, CAT tailing can expose lysine residues that are hidden in the exit tunnel, thereby supporting efficient ubiquitination. If the ubiquitin-proteasome system is overwhelmed or unavailable, CAT-tailed nascent chains can aggregate in the cytosol or within organelles like mitochondria. Here we identify Vms1p as a tRNA hydrolase that releases stalled polypeptides engaged by the RQC.	0
Title: Evidence for an iterative module in chain elongation on the azalomycin polyketide synthase Abstract: The assembly-line synthases that produce bacterial polyketide natural products follow a modular paradigm in which each round of chain extension is catalysed by a different set or module of enzymes. Examples of deviation from this paradigm, in which a module catalyses either multiple extensions or none are of interest from both a mechanistic and an evolutionary viewpoint. We present evidence that in the biosynthesis of the 36-membered macrocyclic aminopolyol lactones (marginolactones) azalomycin and kanchanamycin, isolated respectively from Streptomyces malaysiensis DSM4137 and Streptomyces olivaceus Tü4018, the first extension module catalyses both the first and second cycles of polyketide chain extension. To confirm the integrity of the azl gene cluster, it was cloned intact on a bacterial artificial chromosome and transplanted into the heterologous host strain Streptomyces lividans, which does not possess the genes for marginolactone production. When furnished with 4-guanidinobutyramide, a specific precursor of the azalomycin starter unit, the recombinant S. lividans produced azalomycin, showing that the polyketide synthase genes in the sequenced cluster are sufficient to accomplish formation of the full-length polyketide chain. This provides strong support for module iteration in the azalomycin and kanchanamycin biosynthetic pathways. In contrast, re-sequencing of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of the polyketide β-lactone ebelactone in Streptomyces aburaviensis has shown that, contrary to a recently-published proposal, the ebelactone polyketide synthase faithfully follows the colinear modular paradigm.	1
Title: Polyphyly of non-bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri sharing a lux-locus deletion Abstract: This study reports the first description and molecular characterization of naturally occurring, non-bioluminescent strains of Vibrio fischeri. These 'dark' V. fischeri strains remained non-bioluminescent even after treatment with both autoinducer and aldehyde, substrate additions that typically maximize light production in dim strains of luminous bacteria. Surprisingly, the entire lux locus (eight genes) was absent in over 97% of these dark V. fischeri strains. Although these strains were all collected from a Massachusetts (USA) estuary in 2007, phylogenetic reconstructions allowed us to reject the hypothesis that these newly described non-bioluminescent strains exhibit monophyly within the V. fischeri clade. These dark strains exhibited a competitive disadvantage against native bioluminescent strains when colonizing the light organ of the model V. fischeri host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. Significantly, we believe that the data collected in this study may suggest the first observation of a functional, parallel locus-deletion event among independent lineages of a non-pathogenic bacterial species.	0
Title: Total synthesis of (±)-7-epi-nemorosone Abstract: A concise total synthesis of (±)-7-epi-nemorosone is reported. Our synthetic approach establishes a viable route to polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol natural products (PPAP's) bearing a C-7 endo prenyl side chain. Key steps include retro-aldol-vinyl cerium addition to a hydroxy adamantane core scaffold and palladium-mediated deoxygenation.	0
Title: The regulation and activation of ciliary neurotrophic factor signaling proteins in adipocytes Abstract: Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is primarily known for its roles as a lesion factor released by the ruptured glial cells that prevent neuronal degeneration. However, CNTF has also been shown to cause weight loss in a variety of rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes, whereas a modified form also causes weight loss in humans. CNTF administration can correct or improve hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and hyperlipidemia associated with these models of obesity. In order to investigate the effects of CNTF on fat cells, we examined the expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins (LIFR, gp130, and CNTFRalpha) during adipocyte differentiation and the effects of CNTF on STAT, Akt, and MAPK activation. We also examined the ability of CNTF to regulate the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipogenic proteins. Our studies clearly demonstrate that the expression of two of the three CNTF receptor complex components, CNTFRalpha and LIFR, decreases during adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, gp130 expression is relatively unaffected by differentiation. In addition, preadipocytes are more sensitive to CNTF treatment than adipocytes, as judged by both STAT 3 and Akt activation. Despite decreased levels of CNTFRalpha expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, CNTF treatment of these cells resulted in a time-dependent activation of STAT 3. Chronic treatment of adipocytes resulted in a substantial decrease in fatty-acid synthase and a notable decline in SREBP-1 levels but had no effect on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acrp30, adipocyte-expressed STAT proteins, or C/EBPalpha. However, CNTF resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1 expression. CNTFRalpha receptor expression was substantially induced in the fat pads of four rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes as compared with lean littermates. Moreover, we demonstrated that CNTF can activate STAT 3 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in vivo. In summary, CNTF affects adipocyte gene expression, and the specific receptor for this cytokine is induced in rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes.	0
Title: CuH-Catalyzed Asymmetric Reduction of α,β-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to β-Chiral Aldehydes Abstract: The copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed enantioselective reduction of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids to saturated aldehydes is reported. This protocol provides a new method to access a variety of β-chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high levels of enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. A reaction pathway involving a ketene intermediate is proposed based on preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations.	0
Title: Activation of human phospholipase C-eta2 by Gbetagamma Abstract: Phospholipase C-eta2 (PLC-eta2) was recently identified as a novel broadly expressed phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing isozyme [Zhou, Y., et al. (2005) Biochem. J. 391, 667-676; Nakahara, M., et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 29128-29134]. In this study, we investigated the direct regulation of PLC-eta2 by Gbetagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Coexpression of PLC-eta2 with Gbeta 1gamma 2, as well as with certain other Gbetagamma dimers, in COS-7 cells resulted in increases in inositol phosphate accumulation. Gbeta 1gamma 2-dependent increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis also were observed with a truncation mutant of PLC-eta2 that lacks the long alternatively spliced carboxy-terminal domain of the isozyme. To begin to define the enzymatic properties of PLC-eta2 and its potential direct activation by Gbetagamma, a construct of PLC-eta2 encompassing the canonical domains conserved in all PLCs (PH domain through C2 domain) was purified to homogeneity after expression from a baculovirus in insect cells. Enzyme activity of purified PLC-eta2 was quantified after reconstitution with PtdIns(4,5)P 2-containing phospholipid vesicles, and values for K m (14.4 microM) and V max [12.6 micromol min (-1) (mg of protein) (-1)] were similar to activities previously observed with purified PLC-beta or PLC-epsilon isozymes. Moreover, purified Gbeta 1gamma 2 stimulated the activity of purified PLC-eta2 in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that observed with purified PLC-beta2. Activation was dependent on the presence of free Gbeta 1gamma 2 since its sequestration in the presence of Galpha i1 or GRK2-ct reversed Gbeta 1gamma 2-promoted activation. The PH domain of PLC-eta2 is not required for Gbeta 1gamma 2-mediated regulation since a purified fragment encompassing the EF-hand through C2 domains but lacking the PH domain nonetheless was activated by Gbeta 1gamma 2. Taken together, these studies illustrate that PLC-eta2 is a direct downstream effector of Gbetagamma and, therefore, of receptor-activated heterotrimeric G proteins.	0
Title: Ipomoeassin F Binds Sec61α to Inhibit Protein Translocation Abstract: Ipomoeassin F is a potent natural cytotoxin that inhibits growth of many tumor cell lines with single-digit nanomolar potency. However, its biological and pharmacological properties have remained largely unexplored. Building upon our earlier achievements in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry, we used chemical proteomics to identify Sec61α (protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 1), the pore-forming subunit of the Sec61 protein translocon, as a direct binding partner of ipomoeassin F in living cells. The interaction is specific and strong enough to survive lysis conditions, enabling a biotin analogue of ipomoeassin F to pull down Sec61α from live cells, yet it is also reversible, as judged by several experiments including fluorescent streptavidin staining, delayed competition in affinity pulldown, and inhibition of TNF biogenesis after washout. Sec61α forms the central subunit of the ER protein translocation complex, and the binding of ipomoeassin F results in a substantial, yet selective, inhibition of protein translocation in vitro and a broad ranging inhibition of protein secretion in live cells. Lastly, the unique resistance profile demonstrated by specific amino acid single-point mutations in Sec61α provides compelling evidence that Sec61α is the primary molecular target of ipomoeassin F and strongly suggests that the binding of this natural product to Sec61α is distinctive. Therefore, ipomoeassin F represents the first plant-derived, carbohydrate-based member of a novel structural class that offers new opportunities to explore Sec61α function and to further investigate its potential as a therapeutic target for drug discovery.	0
Title: Unveiling the CoA mediated salicylate catabolic mechanism in Rhizobium sp. X9 Abstract: Salicylate is a typical aromatic compound widely distributed in nature. Microbial degradation of salicylate has been well studied and salicylate hydroxylases play essential roles in linking the peripheral and ring-cleavage catabolic pathways. The direct hydroxylation of salicylate catalyzed by salicylate-1-hydroxylase or salicylate-5-hydroxylase has been well studied. However, the CoA mediated salicylate 5-hydroxylation pathway has not been characterized in detail. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of the reaction in the conversion of salicylate to gentisate in the carbaryl-degrading strain Rhizobium sp. X9. Three enzymes (salicylyl-CoA ligase CehG, salicylyl-CoA hydroxylase CehH and gentisyl-CoA thioesterase CehI) catalyzed the conversion of salicylate to gentisate via a route, including CoA thioester formation, hydroxylation and thioester hydrolysis. Further analysis indicated that genes cehGHI are also distributed in other bacteria from terrestrial environment and marine sediments. These genomic evidences highlight the role of this salicylate degradation pathway in the carbon cycle of soil organic compounds and marine sediments. Our findings of this three-step strategy enhanced the current understanding of CoA mediated degradation of salicylate.	0
Title: Regulation of lifespan by neural excitation and REST Abstract: The mechanisms that extend lifespan in humans are poorly understood. Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3, SPR-4 and reduced excitation activate the longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and worms, respectively. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of ageing that is mediated by neural circuit activity and regulated by REST.	0
Title: The Product of arcR, the sixth gene of the arc operon of Lactobacillus sakei, is essential for expression of the arginine deiminase pathway Abstract: Lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacterium commonly used as a starter culture for dry sausage production and can utilize arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway. The arcABCTD cluster of L. sakei has been characterized, and transcriptional studies have shown that its expression is subject to carbon catabolite repression and induction by arginine. Downstream of arcD an additional gene has been found; this gene, arcR, codes for a putative regulatory protein of the Crp/Fnr family. Transcriptional studies have shown that arcR is coordinately transcribed with the remaining arc genes, and therefore, these genes constitute the arcABCTDR operon. Northern analysis also showed a complex pattern of transcripts, suggesting that processing and partial termination may play a role in regulation of the expression of individual genes of the operon. Inactivation of arcR led to arrest of transcription of the operon, indicating that the ArcR protein is essential for expression of the arc genes. The availability of this mutant made it possible to study whether the ability to utilize arginine affects the growth of L. sakei in meat fermentations. Under our experimental conditions, expression of arginine deiminase does not confer an obvious advantage to L. sakei, since the wild type and an arcR mutant strain displayed similar dynamics of growth.	0
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Anti-infective Desotamides and Production of a New Analogue in a Heterologous Host Abstract: The desotamides (DSAs) are potent antibacterial cyclohexapeptides produced by Streptomyces scopuliridis SCSIO ZJ46. We have identified the 39-kb dsa biosynthetic gene cluster by whole-genome scanning. Composed of 17 open reading frames, the cluster codes for four nonribosomal peptide synthetases and associated resistance, transport, regulatory, and precursor biosynthesis proteins. Heterologous expression of the dsa gene cluster in S. coelicolor M1152 afforded desotamides A and B and the new desotamide G. Cluster identification and its demonstrated amenability to heterologous expression provide the foundation for future mechanistic studies as well as the generation of new and potentially clinically significant DSA analogues.	1
Title: Function of lanI in regulation of landomycin A biosynthesis in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 and cross-complementation studies with Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins encoding genes Abstract: The transcriptional regulator of landomycin A biosynthesis encoded by lanI gene has been inactivated within the chromosome of Streptomyces cyanogenus S136. The obtained mutant strain did not produce landomycin A and its known intermediates. Loss of landomycin A production caused significant changes in morphology of the lanI deficient strain. RT-PCR analysis confirmed complete cessation of transcription of certain lan genes, including lanJ (encoding putative proton dependent transporter) and lanK (presumably involved in lanJ expression regulation). Introduction of either lanI or lndI [lanI homologue controlling landomycin E biosynthesis in Streptomyces globisporus 1912, both encoding Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs)] restored landomycin A production in the mutant strain. Chimeric constructs ladI and ladR were generated by exchanging the DNA sequences corresponding to N- and C-terminal parts of LndI and LanI. None of these genes were able to activate the production of landomycins in regulatory mutants of S. cyanogenus and S. globisporus. Nevertheless, the production of novel unidentified compound was observed in the case of S. cyanogenus harboring ladI gene. Various genes encoding SARPs have been expressed in S. globisporus and S. cyanogenus regulatory mutants and the results of these complementation experiments are discussed.	1
Title: Identification of a system required for the functional surface localization of sugar binding proteins with class III signal peptides in Sulfolobus solfataricus Abstract: The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus contains an unusual large number of sugar binding proteins that are synthesized as precursors with a class III signal peptide. Such signal peptides are commonly used to direct archaeal flagellin subunits or bacterial (pseudo)pilins into extracellular macromolecular surface appendages. Likewise, S. solfataricus binding proteins have been suggested to assemble in higher ordered surface structures as well, tentatively termed the bindosome. Here we show that S. solfataricus contains a specific system that is needed for the functional surface localization of sugar binding proteins. This system, encoded by the bas (bindosome assembly system) operon, is composed of five proteins: basABC, three homologues of so-called bacterial (pseudo)pilins; BasE, a cytoplasmic ATPase; and BasF, an integral membrane protein. Deletion of either the three (pseudo)pilin genes or the basEF genes resulted in a severe defect of the cells to grow on substrates which are transported by sugar binding proteins containing class III signal peptides, while growth on glucose and maltose was restored when the corresponding genes were reintroduced in these cells. Concomitantly, DeltabasABC and DeltabasEF cells were severely impaired in glucose uptake even though the sugar binding proteins were normally secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane. These data underline the hypothesis that the bas operon is involved in the functional localization of sugar binding proteins at the cell surface of S. solfataricus. In contrast to surface structure assembly systems of Gram-negative bacteria, the bas operon seems to resemble an ancestral simplified form of these machineries.	0
Title: PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF STAPHYLOCOAGULASE Abstract: Zolli, Zeno, Jr. (Michigan State University, East Lansing), and Charles L. San Clemente. Purification and characterization of staphylocoagulase. J. Bacteriol. 86:527-535. 1963.-Separation and extreme purification of coagulase from Staphylococcus aureus strain 70 was achieved by using three cycles of dialysis in ethanol-water mixtures under controlled conditions, followed by molecular sieving through a column of Sephadex G-200. By manipulation of five variables (pH, ionic strength, temperature, protein, and ethanol concentration), the final preparation showed an approximate 3700-fold increase in activity per mg of protein. The successfully isolated coagulase containing 15.0% nitrogen was characterized serologically and chemically. By use of agar diffusion techniques, one zone of precipitation was obtained with the highly purified material. Additional confirmation of purity was evidenced by the appearance of a single peak with cellulose acetate paper electrophoresis with a barbital buffer at pH 8.6. Progressive and eventual elimination of carbohydrate, deoxyribonuclease, lipase, and phosphatase was observed through the four stages of purification. Temperature studies showed that the stability of each fraction was inversely related to its purity.	0
Title: bryA: an unusual modular polyketide synthase gene from the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina Abstract: "Candidatus Endobugula sertula," the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of Bugula neritina, is the proposed source of the bryostatin family of anticancer compounds. We cloned a large modular polyketide synthase (PKS) gene complex from "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" and characterized one gene, bryA, which we propose is responsible for the initial steps of bryostatin biosynthesis. Typical PKS domains are present. However, acyltransferase domains are lacking in bryA, and beta-ketoacyl synthase domains of bryA cluster with those of PKSs with discrete, rather than integral, acyltransferases. We propose a model for biosynthesis of the bryostatin D-lactate starter unit by the bryA loading module, utilizing atypical domains homologous to FkbH, KR, and DH. The bryA gene product is proposed to synthesize a portion of the pharmacologically active part of bryostatin and may be useful in semisynthesis of clinically useful bryostatin analogs.	1
Title: Identification and Characterization of the Streptazone E Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 Abstract: Streptazone derivatives isolated from Streptomyces species are piperidine alkaloids with a cyclopenta[b]pyridine scaffold. Previous studies indicated that these compounds are polyketides, but the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for their synthesis are unknown. Here, we have identified the streptazone E biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08, which encodes a modular type I PKS and tailoring enzymes that include an aminotransferase, three oxidoreductases, and two putative cyclases. The functions of the six tailoring enzymes were analyzed by gene disruption, and two putative biosynthetic intermediates that accumulated in particular mutants were structurally elucidated. On the basis of these results, we propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of streptazone E in which the two putative cyclases of the nuclear transport factor 2-like superfamily are responsible for C-C bond formation coupled with epoxide ring opening to give the five-membered ring of streptazone E.	1
Title: Cloning, overexpression, and purification of novobiocic acid synthetase from Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891 Abstract: Novobiocic acid synthetase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic novobiocin, was cloned from the novobiocin producer Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891. The enzyme is encoded by the gene novL, which codes for a protein of 527 amino acids with a calculated mass of 56,885 Da. The protein was overexpressed as a His(6) fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and gel chromatography. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of an amide bond between 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (ring A of novobiocin) and 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl coumarin (ring B of novobiocin) in an ATP-dependent reaction. NovL shows homology to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, and indeed the formation of an acyl adenylate from ring A and ATP was demonstrated by an ATP-PP(i) exchange assay. The purified enzyme exhibited both activation and transferase activity, i.e. it catalyzed both the activation of ring A as acyl adenylate and the subsequent transfer of the acyl group to the amino group of ring B. It is active as a monomer as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The reaction was specific for ATP as nucleotide triphosphate and dependent on the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). Apparent K(m) values for ring A and ring B were determined as 19 and 131 micrometer respectively. Of several analogues of ring A, only 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and to a lesser extent 3-methyl-4-aminobenzoate were accepted as substrates.	1
Title: Cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of Streptomyces rubellomurinus genes required for biosynthesis of antimalarial compound FR900098 Abstract: The antibiotics fosmidomycin and FR900098 are members of a unique class of phosphonic acid natural products that inhibit the nonmevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are potent antibacterial and antimalarial compounds, but despite their efficacy, little is known regarding their biosynthesis. Here we report the identification of the Streptomyces rubellomurinus genes required for the biosynthesis of FR900098. Expression of these genes in Streptomyces lividans results in production of FR900098, demonstrating their role in synthesis of the antibiotic. Analysis of the putative gene products suggests that FR900098 is synthesized by metabolic reactions analogous to portions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These data greatly expand our knowledge of phosphonate biosynthesis and enable efforts to overproduce this highly useful therapeutic agent.	1
Title: Genome mining of the hitachimycin biosynthetic gene cluster: involvement of a phenylalanine-2,3-aminomutase in biosynthesis Abstract: Hitachimycin is a macrolactam antibiotic with (S)-β-phenylalanine (β-Phe) at the starter position of its polyketide skeleton. To understand the incorporation mechanism of β-Phe and the modification mechanism of the unique polyketide skeleton, the biosynthetic gene cluster for hitachimycin in Streptomyces scabrisporus was identified by genome mining. The identified gene cluster contains a putative phenylalanine-2,3-aminomutase (PAM), five polyketide synthases, four β-amino-acid-carrying enzymes, and a characteristic amidohydrolase. A hitA knockout mutant showed no hitachimycin production, but antibiotic production was restored by feeding with (S)-β-Phe. We also confirmed the enzymatic activity of the HitA PAM. The results suggest that the identified gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of hitachimycin. A plausible biosynthetic pathway for hitachimycin, including a unique polyketide skeletal transformation mechanism, is proposed.	1
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Pathway for the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin Abstract: Diketopiperazines (DKPs) make up a large group of natural products with diverse structures and biological activities. Bicyclomycin is a broad-spectrum DKP antibiotic with unique structure and function: it contains a highly oxidized bicyclic [4.2.2] ring and is the only known selective inhibitor of the bacterial transcription termination factor, Rho. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster for bicyclomycin containing six iron-dependent oxidases. We demonstrate that the DKP core is made by a tRNA-dependent cyclodipeptide synthase, and hydroxylations on two unactivated sp3 carbons are performed by two mononuclear iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. Using bioinformatics, we also identify a homologous gene cluster prevalent in a human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We detect bicyclomycin by overexpressing this gene cluster and establish P. aeruginosa as a new producer of bicyclomycin. Our work uncovers the biosynthetic pathway for bicyclomycin and sheds light on the intriguing oxidation chemistry that converts a simple DKP into a powerful antibiotic.	1
Title: Predictive model for epoxide hydrolase-generated stereochemistry in the biosynthesis of nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics Abstract: Nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics C-1027, neocarzinostatin (NCS), and kedarcidin (KED) possess enediyne cores to which activity-modulating peripheral moieties are attached via (R)- or (S)-vicinal diols. We have previously shown that this stereochemical difference arises from hydrolysis of epoxide precursors by epoxide hydrolases (EHs) with different regioselectivities. The inverting EHs, such as SgcF, hydrolyze an (S)-epoxide substrate to yield an (R)-diol in C-1027 biosynthesis, whereas the retaining EHs, such as NcsF2 and KedF, hydrolyze an (S)-epoxide substrate to yield an (S)-diol in NCS and KED biosynthesis. We now report the characterization of a series of EH mutants and provide a predictive model for EH regioselectivity in the biosynthesis of the nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotics. A W236Y mutation in SgcF increased the retaining activity toward (S)-styrene oxide by 3-fold, and a W236Y/Q237M double mutation in SgcF, mimicking NcsF2 and KedF, resulted in a 20-fold increase in the retaining activity. To test the predictive utility of these mutations, two putative enediyne biosynthesis-associated EHs were identified by genome mining and confirmed as inverting enzymes, SpoF from Salinospora tropica CNB-440 and SgrF (SGR_625) from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of EHs revealed a familial classification according to inverting versus retaining activity. Taken together, these results provide a predictive model for vicinal diol stereochemistry in enediyne biosynthesis and set the stage for further elucidating the origins of EH regioselectivity.	1
Title: Functional characterization of the ferroxidase, permease high-affinity iron transport complex from Candida albicans Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two proteins that together support high-affinity Fe-uptake. These are a multicopper oxidase, Fet3p, with specificity towards Fe²⁺ and a ferric iron permease, Ftr1p, which supports Fe-accumulation. Homologues of the genes encoding these two proteins are found in all fungal genomes including those for the pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. At least one of these loci represents a virulence factor for each pathogen suggesting that this complex would be an appropriate pharmacologic target. However, the mechanism by which this protein pair supports Fe-uptake in any fungal pathogen has not been elucidated. Taking advantage of the robust molecular genetics available in S. cerevisiae, we identify the two of five candidate ferroxidases likely involved in high-affinity Fe-uptake in C. albicans, Fet31 and Fet34. Both localize to the yeast plasma membrane and both support Fe-uptake along with an Ftr1 protein, either from C. albicans or from S. cerevisiae. We express and characterize Fet34, demonstrating that it is functionally homologous to ScFet3p. Using S. cerevisiae as host for the functional expression of the C. albicans Fe-uptake proteins, we demonstrate that they support a mechanism of Fe-trafficking that involves channelling of the CaFet34-generated Fe³⁺ directly to CaFtr1 for transport into the cytoplasm.	0
Title: Identification of new antileishmanial leads from hits obtained by high-throughput screening Abstract: A previous screen of ~200,000 compounds from the PubChem database identified 70 compounds possessing 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) below 1 μM against Leishmania major promastigotes that were not toxic to mammalian epithelial cancer cells at this concentration (E. Sharlow et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 3:e540, 2009). Based on availability and chemical exclusion criteria, 31 of these compounds were purchased from commercial suppliers and evaluated for in vitro activity against intracellular L. donovani and L. amazonensis parasites. Benzothiazole cyanine compounds (PubChem 16196319 and 16196223) displayed potent activity against intracellular amastigotes, prompting a search for commercially available compounds that were structurally related. Pubchem 123859 (the cyanine dye thiazole orange) showed exceptionally potent activity against intracellular L. donovani in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 21 ± 12 nM) and low cytotoxicity against Vero cells (IC(50) = 7,800 ± 200 nM). Administration of 123859 and 16196319 at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 5 days resulted in 44% ± 4% and 42% ± 3% suppression of liver parasitemia in L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice, respectively, compared to the untreated control group (the reductions in liver parasitemia were 30% ± 5% and 27% ± 4%, respectively, compared to the (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin solution (HPβCD) vehicle control, which itself displayed some antileishmanial activity). Benzothiazole-containing cyanine dyes are thus potential lead compounds for the discovery of novel antileishmanial agents.	0
Title: The LuxR family members GdmRI and GdmRII are positive regulators of geldanamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 17997 Abstract: The recent sequencing of the DNA region of the geldanamycin post-polyketide synthase (PKS) modification gene clusters revealed the presence of two regulatory genes: gdmRI (2,907 bp) and gdmRII (2,766 bp). The deduced products of gdmRI and gdmRII (968 and 921 amino acid residues, respectively) were identified as homologues of the LuxR transcriptional regulatory proteins. Inactivation by gene replacement of gdmRI or gdmRII in the Streptomyces hygroscopicus 17997 genome resulted in a complete loss of geldanamycin production. Complementation by a plasmid carrying gdmRI or gdmRII restored geldanamycin production, suggesting that the products of these two regulatory genes are positive regulators that are required for geldanamycin biosynthesis. The gdmRI transcript was detected in the DeltagdmRII mutant, and the gdmRII was detected in the DeltagdmRI mutant, indicating that the two genes are transcribed independently and do not regulate each other. Time course of gene expression analysis by RT-PCR of the geldanamycin biosynthetic genes showed that the transcription of gdmRI and gdmRII correlates with that of genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis, but not with the post-PKS modification gene gdmN, whose transcription is initiated earlier. gdmRI or gdmRII gene disruptants did not transcribe the polyketide biosynthetic related genes pks, gdmF, and gdnA-O-P, but did trancribe gdmN. These results demonstrated that gdmRI and gdmRII are pathway-specific positive regulators that control the polyketide biosynthetic genes in geldanamycin biosynthesis, but not the post-PKS modification gene, gdmN.	1
Title: Aqueous Platinum(II)-Cage-Based Light-Harvesting System for Photocatalytic Cross-Coupling Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Abstract: Photosynthesis is a process wherein the chromophores in plants and bacteria absorb light and convert it into chemical energy. To mimic this process, an emissive poly(ethylene glycol)-decorated tetragonal prismatic platinum(II) cage was prepared and used as the donor molecule to construct a light-harvesting system in water. Eosin Y was chosen as the acceptor because of its good spectral overlap with that of the metallacage, which is essential for the preparation of light-harvesting systems. Such a combination showed enhanced catalytic activity in catalyzing the cross-coupling hydrogen evolution reaction, as compared with eosin Y alone. This study offers a pathway for using the output energy from the light-harvesting system to mimic the whole photosynthetic process.	0
Title: Effects of Halide Ions on the Carbamidocyclophane Biosynthesis in Nostoc sp. CAVN2 Abstract: In this study, the influence of halide ions on [7.7]paracyclophane biosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. CAVN2 was investigated. In contrast to KI and KF, supplementation of the culture medium with KCl or KBr resulted not only in an increase of growth but also in an up-regulation of carbamidocyclophane production. LC-MS analysis indicated the presence of chlorinated, brominated, but also non-halogenated derivatives. In addition to 22 known cylindrocyclophanes and carbamidocyclophanes, 27 putative congeners have been detected. Nine compounds, carbamidocyclophanes M-U, were isolated, and their structural elucidation by 1D and 2D NMR experiments in combination with HRMS and ECD analysis revealed that they are brominated analogues of chlorinated carbamidocyclophanes. Quantification of the carbamidocyclophanes showed that chloride is the preferably utilized halide, but incorporation is reduced in the presence of bromide. Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of 30 [7.7]paracyclophanes and related derivatives against selected pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria exhibited remarkable effects especially against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For deeper insights into the mechanisms of biosynthesis, the carbamidocyclophane biosynthetic gene cluster in Nostoc sp. CAVN2 was studied. The gene putatively coding for the carbamoyltransferase has been identified. Based on bioinformatic analyses, a possible biosynthetic assembly is discussed.	1
Title: Cell elongation and branching are regulated by differential phosphorylation states of the nuclear Dbf2-related kinase COT1 in Neurospora crassa Abstract: Dysfunction of the Neurospora crassa nuclear Dbf2-related kinase COT1 leads to cessation of tip extension and massive induction of new sites of growth. To determine the role phosphorylation plays in COT1 function, we mutated COT1 residues corresponding to positions of highly conserved nuclear Dbf2-related phosphorylation sites. Analyses of the point-mutation cot-1 strains (mimicking non- and constitutively phosphorylated states) indicate the involvement of COT1 phosphorylation in the regulation of hyphal elongation and branching as well as asexual development by altering cell wall integrity and actin organization. Phosphorylation of COT1's activation segment (at Ser417) is required for proper in vitro kinase activity, but has only a limited effect on hyphal growth. In marked contrast, even though phosphorylation of the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (at Thr589) is crucial for all COT1 functions in vivo, the lack of Thr589 phosphorylation did not significantly affect in vitro COT1 kinase activity. Nevertheless, its regulatory role has been made evident by the significant increase observed in COT1 kinase activity when this residue was substituted in a manner mimicking constitutive phosphorylation. We conclude that COT1 regulates elongation and branching in an independent manner, which is determined by its phosphorylation state.	0
Title: Different scales of gene duplications occurring at different times have jointly shaped the NBS-LRR genes in Prunus species Abstract: In this study, genome-wide identification, phylogenetic relationships, duplication time and selective pressure of the NBS-LRR genes, an important group of plant disease-resistance genes (R genes), were performed to uncover their genetic evolutionary patterns in the six Prunus species. A total of 1946 NBS-LRR genes were identified; specifically, 589, 361, 284, 281, 318, and 113 were identified in Prunus yedoensis, P. domestica, P. avium, P. dulcis, P. persica and P. yedoensis var. nudiflora, respectively. Two NBS-LRR gene subclasses, TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) and non-TIR-NBS-LRR (non-TNL), were also discovered. In total, 435 TNL and 1511 non-TNL genes were identified and could be classified into 30/55/75 and 103/158/191 multi-gene families, respectively, according to three different criteria. Higher Ks and Ka/Ks values were detected in TNL gene families than in non-TNL gene families. These results indicated that the TNL genes had more members involved in relatively ancient duplications and were affected by stronger selection pressure than the non-TNL genes. In general, the NBS-LRR genes were shaped by species-specific duplications, and lineage-specific duplications occurred at recent and relatively ancient periods among the six Prunus species. Therefore, different duplicated copies of NBS-LRRs can resist specific pathogens and will provide an R-gene library for resistance breeding in Prunus species.	0
Title: The PH domain of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 exhibits a novel, phospho-regulated monomer-dimer equilibrium with important implications for kinase domain activation: single-molecule and ensemble studies Abstract: Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is an essential master kinase recruited to the plasma membrane by the binding of its C-terminal PH domain to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Membrane binding leads to PDK1 phospho-activation, but despite the central role of PDK1 in signaling and cancer biology, this activation mechanism remains poorly understood. PDK1 has been shown to exist as a dimer in cells, and one crystal structure of its isolated PH domain exhibits a putative dimer interface. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of PH domain residue T513 (or the phospho-mimetic T513E mutation) may regulate a novel PH domain dimer-monomer equilibrium, thereby converting an inactive PDK1 dimer to an active monomer. However, the oligomeric states of the PH domain on the membrane have not yet been determined, nor whether a negative charge at position 513 is sufficient to regulate its oligomeric state. This study investigates the binding of purified wild-type (WT) and T513E PDK1 PH domains to lipid bilayers containing the PIP3 target lipid, using both single-molecule and ensemble measurements. Single-molecule analysis of the brightness of the fluorescent PH domain shows that the PIP3-bound WT PH domain on membranes is predominantly dimeric while the PIP3-bound T513E PH domain is monomeric, demonstrating that negative charge at the T513 position is sufficient to dissociate the PH domain dimer and is thus likely to play a central role in PDK1 monomerization and activation. Single-molecule analysis of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion of PH domain-PIP3 complexes reveals that the dimeric WT PH domain diffuses at the same rate as a single lipid molecule, indicating that only one of its two PIP3 binding sites is occupied and there is little penetration of the protein into the bilayer as observed for other PH domains. The 2D diffusion of T513E PH domain is slower, suggesting the negative charge disrupts local structure in a way that allows deeper insertion of the protein into the viscous bilayer, thereby increasing the diffusional friction. Ensemble measurements of PH domain affinity for PIP3 on plasma membrane-like bilayers reveal that the dimeric WT PH domain possesses a one order of magnitude higher target membrane affinity than the previously characterized monomeric PH domains, consistent with a dimerization-triggered, allosterically enhanced affinity for one PIP3 molecule (a much larger affinity enhancement would be expected for dimerization-triggered binding to two PIP3 molecules). The monomeric T513E PDK1 PH domain, like other monomeric PH domains, exhibits a PIP3 affinity and bound state lifetime that are each 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the dimeric WT PH domain, which is predicted to facilitate release of activated, monomeric PDK1 to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study yields the first molecular picture of PH domain regulation via electrostatic control of dimer-monomer conversion.	0
Title: Tunable soft structure in charged fluids confined by dielectric interfaces Abstract: Fluids of charged particles act as the supporting medium for chemical reactions and physical, dynamical, and biological processes. The local structure in an electrolytic background is deformed by micro- and nanoscopic polarizable objects. Vice versa, the forces between the objects are regulated by the cohesive properties of the background. We study here the range and strength of these forces and the microscopic origin from which they emerge. We find the forces to be sensitively dependent on the material properties of the charged fluid and the immersed solutes. The induced interactions can be varied over decades, offering high tunability and aided by accurate theory, control in experiments and applications. To distinguish correlational effects from simple ionic screening, we describe electrolyte-induced forces between neutral objects. The interplay of thermal motion, short-range repulsions, and electrostatic forces is responsible for a soft structure in the fluid. This structure changes near polarizable interfaces and causes diverse attractions between confining walls that seem well-exploited by microbiological systems. For parameters that correspond to monovalent electrolytes in biologically and technologically relevant aqueous environments, we find induced forces between nanoscopic areas of the order of piconewtons over a few nanometers.	0
Title: Simplified synthetic TMC-95A/B analogues retain the potency of proteasome inhibitory activity Abstract: The proteasome regulates diverse intracellular processes, including cell-cycle progression, antigen presentation, and inflammatory response. Selective inhibitors of the proteasome have great therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders. Natural cyclic peptides TMC-95A and B represent a new class of noncovalent, selective proteasome inhibitors. To explore the structure-activity relationship of this class of proteasome inhibitors, a series of TMC-95A/B analogues were prepared and analyzed. We found that the unique enamide functionality at the C8 position of TMC-95s can be replaced with a simple allylamide. The asymmetric center at C36 that distinguishes TMC-95A from TMC-95B but which necessitates a complicated separation of the two compounds can be eliminated. Therefore, these findings could lead to the development of more accessible simple analogues as potential therapeutic agents.	0
Title: Genome mining reveals uncommon alkylpyrones as type III PKS products from myxobacteria Abstract: Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are comparatively small homodimeric enzymes affording natural products with diverse structures and functions. While type III PKS biosynthetic pathways have been studied thoroughly in plants, their counterparts from bacteria and fungi are to date scarcely characterized. This gap is exemplified by myxobacteria from which no type III PKS-derived small molecule has previously been isolated. In this study, we conducted a genomic survey of myxobacterial type III PKSs and report the identification of uncommon alkylpyrones as the products of type III PKS biosynthesis from the myxobacterial model strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 through a self-resistance-guided screening approach focusing on genes encoding pentapetide repeat proteins, proficient to confer resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. Using promoter-induced gene expression in the native host as well as heterologous expression of biosynthetic type III PKS genes, sufficient amounts of material could be obtained for structural elucidation and bioactivity testing, revealing potent topoisomerase activity in vitro.	1
Title: Oxidative cyclizations in orthosomycin biosynthesis expand the known chemistry of an oxygenase superfamily Abstract: Orthosomycins are oligosaccharide antibiotics that include avilamycin, everninomicin, and hygromycin B and are hallmarked by a rigidifying interglycosidic spirocyclic ortho-δ-lactone (orthoester) linkage between at least one pair of carbohydrates. A subset of orthosomycins additionally contain a carbohydrate capped by a methylenedioxy bridge. The orthoester linkage is necessary for antibiotic activity but rarely observed in natural products. Orthoester linkage and methylenedioxy bridge biosynthesis require similar oxidative cyclizations adjacent to a sugar ring. We have identified a conserved group of nonheme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases likely responsible for this chemistry. High-resolution crystal structures of the EvdO1 and EvdO2 oxygenases of everninomicin biosynthesis, the AviO1 oxygenase of avilamycin biosynthesis, and HygX of hygromycin B biosynthesis show how these enzymes accommodate large substrates, a challenge that requires a variation in metal coordination in HygX. Excitingly, the ternary complex of HygX with cosubstrate α-ketoglutarate and putative product hygromycin B identified an orientation of one glycosidic linkage of hygromycin B consistent with metal-catalyzed hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate. These structural results are complemented by gene disruption of the oxygenases evdO1 and evdMO1 from the everninomicin biosynthetic cluster, which demonstrate that functional oxygenase activity is critical for antibiotic production. Our data therefore support a role for these enzymes in the production of key features of the orthosomycin antibiotics.	1
Title: Tethering of vesicles to the Golgi by GMAP210 controls LAT delivery to the immune synapse Abstract: The T cell immune synapse is a site of intense vesicular trafficking. Here we show that the golgin GMAP210, known to capture vesicles and organize membrane traffic at the Golgi, is involved in the vesicular transport of LAT to the immune synapse. Upon activation, more GMAP210 interact with LAT-containing vesicles and go together with LAT to the immune synapse. Regulating LAT recruitment and LAT-dependent signaling, GMAP210 controls T cell activation. Using a rerouting and capture assay, we show that GMAP210 captures VAMP7-decorated vesicles. Overexpressing different domains of GMAP210, we also show that GMAP210 allows their specific delivery to the immune synapse by tethering LAT-vesicles to the Golgi. Finally, in a model of ectopic expression of LAT in ciliated cells, we show that GMAP210 tethering activity controls the delivery of LAT to the cilium. Hence, our results reveal a function for the golgin GMAP210 conveying specific vesicles to the immune synapse.	0
Title: Heparin antagonism by polyvalent display of cationic motifs on virus-like particles Abstract: Particles to the rescue! The construction of cationic amino acid motifs on the surface of bacteriophage Qbeta by genetic engineering or chemical conjugation gives particles that are potent inhibitors of the anticoagulant action of heparin, which is a common anticlotting agent subject to clinical overdose.Polyvalent interactions allow biological structures to exploit low-affinity ligand-receptor binding events to affect physiological responses. We describe here the use of bacteriophage Qbeta as a multivalent platform for the display of polycationic motifs that act as heparin antagonists. Point mutations to the coat protein allowed us to generate capsids bearing the K16M, T18R, N10R, or D14R mutations; because 180 coat proteins form the capsid, the mutants provide a spectrum of particles differing in surface charge by as much as +540 units (K16M vs. D14R). Whereas larger poly-Arg insertions (for example, C-terminal Arg(8)) did not yield intact virions, it was possible to append chemically synthesized oligo-Arg peptides to stable wild-type (WT) and K16M platforms. Heparin antagonism by the particles was evaluated by using the activated partial thrombin time (aPTT) clotting assay; this revealed that T18R, D14R, and WT-(R(8)G(2))(95) were the most effective at disrupting heparin-mediated anticoagulation (>95 % inhibition). This activity agreed with measurements of zeta potential (ZP) and retention time on cation exchange chromatography for the genetic constructs, which distribute their added positive charge over the capsid surface (+180 and +360 for T18R and D14R relative to WT). The potent activity of WT-(R(8)G(2))(95), despite its relatively diminished overall surface charge is likely a consequence of the particle's presentation of locally concentrated regions with high positive charge density that interact with heparin's extensively sulfated domains. The engineered cationic capsids retained their ability to inhibit heparin at high concentrations and showed no anticlotting activity of the kind that limits the utility of antiheparin polycationic agents that are currently in clinical use.	0
Title: Genetic basis for mycophenolic acid production and strain-dependent production variability in Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Penicillium species including Penicillium roqueforti. The MPA biosynthetic pathway was recently described in Penicillium brevicompactum. In this study, an in silico analysis of the P. roqueforti FM164 genome sequence localized a 23.5-kb putative MPA gene cluster. The cluster contains seven genes putatively coding seven proteins (MpaA, MpaB, MpaC, MpaDE, MpaF, MpaG, MpaH) and is highly similar (i.e. gene synteny, sequence homology) to the P. brevicompactum cluster. To confirm the involvement of this gene cluster in MPA biosynthesis, gene silencing using RNA interference targeting mpaC, encoding a putative polyketide synthase, was performed in a high MPA-producing P. roqueforti strain (F43-1). In the obtained transformants, decreased MPA production (measured by LC-Q-TOF/MS) was correlated to reduced mpaC gene expression by Q-RT-PCR. In parallel, mycotoxin quantification on multiple P. roqueforti strains suggested strain-dependent MPA-production. Thus, the entire MPA cluster was sequenced for P. roqueforti strains with contrasted MPA production and a 174bp deletion in mpaC was observed in low MPA-producers. PCRs directed towards the deleted region among 55 strains showed an excellent correlation with MPA quantification. Our results indicated the clear involvement of mpaC gene as well as surrounding cluster in P. roqueforti MPA biosynthesis.	1
Title: Streamlined chemoenzymatic total synthesis of prioritized ganglioside cancer antigens Abstract: A highly efficient streamlined chemoenzymatic strategy for total synthesis of four prioritized ganglioside cancer antigens GD2, GD3, fucosyl GM1, and GM3 from commercially available lactose and phytosphingosine is demonstrated. Lactosyl sphingosine (LacβSph) was chemically synthesized (on a 13 g scale), subjected to sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) glycosylation reactions with facile C18-cartridge purification, followed by improved acylation conditions to form target gangliosides, including fucosyl GM1 which has never been synthesized before.	0
Title: Characterization of a complex context containing mecA but lacking genes encoding cassette chromosome recombinases in Staphylococcus haemolyticus Abstract: Background:                       Methicillin resistance determinant mecA is generally transferred by SCCmec elements. However, the mecA gene might not be carried by a SCCmec in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical isolate, WCH1, as no cassette chromosome recombinase genes were detected. Therefore, the genetic context of mecA in WCH1 was investigated.                  Results:                       A 40-kb region containing mecA was obtained from WCH1, bounded by orfX at one end and several orfs of S. haemolyticus core chromosome at the other. This 40-kb region was very complex in structure with multiple genetic components that appeared to have different origins. For instance, the 3.7-kb structure adjacent to orfX was almost identical to that on the chromosome of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62a but was absent from S. haemolyticus JCSC1435. Terminal inverted repeats of SCC were found but no ccr genes could be detected. mecA was bracketed by two copies of IS431, which was flanked by 8-bp direct target repeat sequence (DR).                  Conclusions:                       The presence of 8-bp DR suggests that the two copies of IS431 might have formed a composite transposon for mobilizing mecA. This finding is of significance as multiple copies of IS431 are commonly present in the contexts of mecA, which might have the potential to form various composite transposons that could mediate the mobilization of mecA. This study also provides an explanation for the absence of ccr in some staphylococci isolates carrying mecA.	0
Title: Heterologous pathway assembly reveals molecular steps of fungal terreic acid biosynthesis Abstract: Terreic acid is a potential anticancer drug as it inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase; however, its biosynthetic molecular steps remain unclear. In this work, the individual reactions of terreic acid biosynthesis were determined by stepwise pathway assembly in a heterologous host, Pichia pastoris, on the basis of previous knockout studies in a native host, Aspergillus terreus. Polyketide synthase AtX was found to catalyze the formation of partially reduced polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid, followed by 3-methylcatechol synthesis by salicylate 1-monooxygenase AtA-mediated decarboxylative hydroxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid. Our results show that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase AtE hydroxylates 3-methylcatechol, thus producing the next product, 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol. A smaller putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, AtG, assists with this step. Then, AtD causes epoxidation and hydroxyl oxidation of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol and produces a compound terremutin, via which the previously unknown function of AtD was identified as cyclooxygenation. The final step involves an oxidation reaction of a hydroxyl group by a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase, AtC, which leads to the final product: terreic acid. Functions of AtD and AtG were determined for the first time. All the genes were reanalyzed and all intermediates and final products were isolated and identified. Our model fully defines the molecular steps and corrects previous results from the literature.	1
Title: The Serratia gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of the red antibiotic, prodigiosin, shows species- and strain-dependent genome context variation Abstract: The prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster (pig cluster) from two strains of Serratia (S. marcescens ATCC 274 and Serratia sp. ATCC 39006) has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in heterologous hosts. Sequence analysis of the respective pig clusters revealed 14 ORFs in S. marcescens ATCC 274 and 15 ORFs in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. In each Serratia species, predicted gene products showed similarity to polyketide synthases (PKSs), non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) and the Red proteins of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Comparisons between the two Serratia pig clusters and the red cluster from Str. coelicolor A3(2) revealed some important differences. A modified scheme for the biosynthesis of prodigiosin, based on the pathway recently suggested for the synthesis of undecylprodigiosin, is proposed. The distribution of the pig cluster within several Serratia sp. isolates is demonstrated and the presence of cryptic clusters in some strains shown. The pig cluster of Serratia marcescens ATCC 274 is flanked by cueR and copA homologues and this configuration is demonstrated in several S. marcescens strains, whilst these genes are contiguous in strains lacking the pig cluster.	1
Title: Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster and the six associated lipopeptides involved in swarming motility of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 Abstract: Pseudomonas species are known to be prolific producers of secondary metabolites that are synthesized wholly or in part by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In an effort to identify additional nonribosomal peptides produced by these bacteria, a bioinformatics approach was used to "mine" the genome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 for the metabolic potential to biosynthesize previously unknown nonribosomal peptides. Herein we describe the identification of a nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster that codes for proteins involved in the production of six structurally related linear lipopeptides. Structures for each of these lipopeptides were proposed based on amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry analyses. Mutations in this cluster resulted in the loss of swarming motility of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 on medium containing a low percentage of agar. This phenotype is consistent with the loss of the ability to produce a lipopeptide that functions as a biosurfactant. This work gives additional evidence that mining the genomes of microorganisms followed by metabolite and phenotypic analyses leads to the identification of previously unknown secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Characterization of the microbiota in long- and short-term natural indigo fermentation Abstract: The duration for which the indigo-reducing state maintenance in indigo natural fermentation in batch dependent. The microbiota was analyzed in two batches of sukumo fermentation fluids that lasted for different durations (Batch 1: less than 2 months; Batch 2: nearly 1 year) to understand the mechanisms underlying the sustainability and deterioration of this natural fermentation process. The transformation of the microbiota suggested that the deterioration of the fermentation fluid is associated with the relative abundance of Alcaligenaceae. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the microbial community maintained a very stable state in only the long-term Batch 2. Therefore, entry of the microbiota into a stable state under alkaline anaerobic condition is an important factor for maintenance of indigo fermentation for long duration. This is the first report on the total transformation of the microbiota for investigation of long-term maintenance mechanisms and to address the problem of deterioration in indigo fermentation.	0
Title: Histone tails: ideal motifs for probing epigenetics through chemical biology approaches Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone proteins have emerged as a central theme in the regulation of gene expression and other chromatin-associated processes. The discovery that certain protein domains can recognize acetylated and methylated lysine residues of histones has spurred efforts to uncover and characterize histone PTM-binding proteins. In this task, chromatin biology has strongly benefited from synthetic approaches stemming from chemical biology. Peptide-based techniques have been instrumental in identifying histone mark-binding proteins and analyzing their binding specificities. To explore how histone PTMs carry out their function in the context of chromatin, reconstituted systems based on recombinant histones carrying defined modifications are increasingly being used. They constitute promising tools to analyze mechanistic aspects of histone PTMs, including their role in transcription and their transmission in replication. In this review, we present strategies that have been used successfully to investigate the role of histone modifications, concepts that have emerged from their application, and their potential to contribute to current developments in the field.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: Construction of deletion derivative plasmids and cloning of restriction fragments from plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of replication (ori) were used to locate the functional origin to within a DNA fragment of 296 base pairs between the genes uncB and asn. The nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium ori region was determined and compared with the Escherichia coli ori sequence. In the 296-base pair fragment, 85.8% of the bases are conserved between the two species. A nearly equal number of transition and transversion type differences, with no insertions or deletions, occurs between the two bacterial origins, such that the relatively high percentage (adenine plus thymine) of 59.5% is conserved. The 296-base pair fragment contains 14 GATC sequences, all of which are conserved. The high frequency of occurrence of GATC, which is the site of methylation under control of the dam gene, may explain in part why the bacterial ori region appears to be so highly conserved. A large number of secondary structures are possible. One such structure, with a "cloverleaf," is favored by ori nucleotide sequence comparisons and leads to potential novel macromolecular interactions.	0
Title: Molecular analysis of the Enterobacter sakazakii O-antigen gene locus Abstract: Nucleotide polymorphism associated with the O-antigen-encoding locus, rfb, in Enterobacter sakazakii was determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Based on the analysis of these DNA profiles, 12 unique banding patterns were detected among a collection of 62 strains from diverse origins. Two common profiles were identified and were designated serotypes O:1 and O:2. DNA sequencing of the 12,500-bp region flanked by galF and gnd identified 11 open reading frames, all with the same transcriptional direction. Analysis of the proximal region of both sequences demonstrated remarkable heterogeneity. A PCR assay targeting genes specific for the two prominent serotypes was developed and applied for the identification of these strains recovered from food, environmental, and clinical samples.	1
Title: A nonapoptotic role for BAX and BAK in eicosanoid metabolism Abstract: BCL-2 proteins are key regulators of programmed cell death. The interplay between pro and antiapoptotic BCL-2 members has important roles in many cancers. In addition to their apoptotic function, recent evidence supports key nonapoptotic roles for several BCL-2 proteins. We used an unbiased lipidomics strategy to reveal that the proapoptotic proteins BAX, and to a lesser extent BAK, regulate the cellular inflammatory response by mediating COX-2 expression and prostaglandin biosynthesis. COX-2 upregulation in response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide is blunted in the absence of BAX, and Bax(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts display altered kinetics of NFκB and MAPK signaling following endotoxin treatment. Our approach uncovers a novel, nonapoptotic function for BAX in regulation of the cellular inflammatory response and suggests that inflammation and apoptosis are more tightly connected than previously anticipated.	0
Title: Integrated Approach to Identify Heparan Sulfate Ligand Requirements of Robo1 Abstract: An integrated methodology is described to establish ligand requirements for heparan sulfate (HS) binding proteins based on a workflow in which HS octasaccharides are produced by partial enzymatic degradation of natural HS followed by size exclusion purification, affinity enrichment using an immobilized HS-binding protein of interest, putative structure determination of isolated compounds by a hydrophilic interaction chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry platform, and chemical synthesis of well-defined HS oligosaccharides for structure-activity relationship studies. The methodology was used to establish the ligand requirements of human Roundabout receptor 1 (Robo1), which is involved in a number of developmental processes. Mass spectrometric analysis of the starting octasaccharide mixture and the Robo1-bound fraction indicated that Robo1 has a preference for a specific set of structures. Further analysis was performed by sequential permethylation, desulfation, and pertrideuteroacetylation followed by online separation and structural analysis by MS/MS. Sequences of tetrasaccharides could be deduced from the data, and by combining the compositional and sequence data, a putative octasaccharide ligand could be proposed (GlA-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNAc6S). A modular synthetic approach was employed to prepare the target compound, and binding studies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed it to be a high affinity ligand for Robo1. Further studies with a number of tetrasaccharides confirmed that sulfate esters at C-6 are critical for binding, whereas such functionalities at C-2 substantially reduce binding. High affinity ligands were able to reverse a reduction in endothelial cell migration induced by Slit2-Robo1 signaling.	0
Title: Detection and identification of fungi intimately associated with the brown seaweed Fucus serratus Abstract: The filamentous fungi associated with healthy and decaying Fucus serratus thalli were studied over a 1-year period using isolation methods and molecular techniques such as 28S rRNA gene PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phylogenetic and real-time PCR analyses. The predominant DGGE bands obtained from healthy algal thalli belonged to the Lindra, Lulworthia, Engyodontium, Sigmoidea/Corollospora complex, and Emericellopsis/Acremonium-like ribotypes. In the culture-based analysis the incidence of recovery was highest for Sigmoidea marina isolates. In general, the environmental sequences retrieved could be matched unambiguously to isolates recovered from the seaweed except for the Emericellopsis/Acremonium-like ribotype, which showed 99% homology with the sequences of four different isolates, including that of Acremonium fuci. To estimate the extent of colonization of A. fuci, we used a TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR assay for intron 3 of the beta-tubulin gene, the probe for which proved to be species specific even when it was used in amplifications with high background concentrations of other eukaryotic DNAs. The A. fuci sequence was detected with both healthy and decaying thalli, but the signal was stronger for the latter. Additional sequence types, representing members from the Dothideomycetes, were recovered from the decaying thallus DNA, which suggested that a change in fungal community structure had occurred. Phylogenetic analysis of these environmental sequences and the sequences of isolates and type species indicated that the environmental sequences were novel in the Dothideomycetes.	0
Title: Elucidating the Sugar Tailoring Steps in the Cytorhodin Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Anthracycline antitumor cytorhodins X and Y feature a rare 9α-glycoside and 7-dexoy-aglycone. Characterization of the cytorhodin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 through gene inactivations and metabolite analyses reveals three glycosyltransferases (GTs) involved in the sugar tailoring steps. The duo of CytG1 and CytL effects C-7 glycosylation with l-rhodosamine whereas the iterative GT CytG3 and CytW similarly modifies both C-9 and C-10 positions. CytG2 also acts iteratively by incorporating the second and third sugar moiety into the trisaccharide chains at the C-7 or C-10 position.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of a bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing the 3-nitration of tyrosine in rufomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Rufomycin is a circular heptapeptide with anti-mycobacterial activity and is produced by Streptomyces atratus ATCC 14046. Its structure contains three non-proteinogenic amino acids, N-dimethylallyltryptophan, trans-2-crotylglycine, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NTyr). Although the rufomycin structure was already reported in the 1960s, its biosynthesis, including 3NTyr generation, remains unclear. To elucidate the rufomycin biosynthetic pathway, we assembled a draft genome sequence of S. atratus and identified the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ruf cluster), consisting of 20 ORFs (rufA-rufT). We found a putative heptamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by rufT, a putative tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase encoded by rufP, and a putative trimodular type I polyketide synthase encoded by rufEF Moreover, the ruf cluster contains an apparent operon harboring putative cytochrome P450 (rufO) and nitric oxide synthase (rufN) genes. A similar operon, txtDE, is responsible for the formation of 4-nitrotryptophan in thaxtomin biosynthesis; the cytochrome P450 TxtE catalyzes the 4-nitration of Trp. Therefore, we hypothesized that RufO should catalyze the Tyr 3-nitration. Disruption of rufO abolished rufomycin production by S. atratus, which was restored when 3NTyr was added to the culture medium of the disruptant. Recombinant RufO protein exhibited Tyr 3-nitration activity both in vitro and in vivo Spectroscopic analysis further revealed that RufO recognizes Tyr as the substrate with a dissociation constant of ∼0.1 μm These results indicate that RufO is an unprecedented cytochrome P450 that catalyzes Tyr nitration. Taken together with the results of an in silico analysis of the ruf cluster, we propose a rufomycin biosynthetic pathway in S. atratus.	1
Title: Sculpting the maturation, softening and ethylene pathway: the influences of microRNAs on tomato fruits Abstract: Background:                       MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous class of short RNAs, play vital roles in physiological and biochemical processes in plants by mediating gene silencing at post-transcriptional (PTGS) level. Tomato is a model system to study molecular basis of fleshy fruit ripening and senescence, ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction owing to its genetic and molecular tractability. To study the functions of miRNAs in tomato fruit ripening and senescence, and their possible roles in ethylene response, the next generation sequencing method was employed to identify miRNAs in tomato fruit. Bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches were combined to profile the miRNAs expression patterns at three different fruit ripening stages and by exogenous ethylene treatment.                  Results:                       In addition to 7 novel miRNA families, 103 conserved miRNAs belonging to 24 families and 10 non-conserved miRNAs matching 9 families were identified in our libraries. The targets of many these miRNAs were predicted to be transcriptional factors. Other targets are known to play roles in the regulation of metabolic processes. Interestingly, some targets were predicted to be involved in fruit ripening and softening, such as Pectate Lyase, beta-galactosidase, while a few others were predicted to be involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway, such as ACS, EIN2 and CTR1. The expression patterns of a number of such miRNAs at three ripening stages were confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR, which showed a strong negative correlation with that of their targets. The regulation of exogenous ethylene on miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed simultaneously, and 3 down-regulated, 5 up-regulated miRNAs were found in this study.                  Conclusions:                       A combination of high throughput sequencing and molecular biology approaches was used to explore the involvement of miRNAs during fruit ripening. Several miRNAs showed differential expression profiles during fruit ripening, and a number of miRNAs were influenced by ethylene treatment. The results suggest the importance of miRNAs in fruit ripening and ethylene response.	0
Title: Glycopeptide carboxamides active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci Abstract: Glycopeptide antibiotics were synthesized via the PyBOP mediated condensation of aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines with the C-terminus of vancomycin, LY264826 (A82846B) and semi-synthetic derivatives of these natural products. Amides of LY264826 and vancomycin demonstrated excellent activity against staphylococci and streptococci as compared to the parent natural product. However, the amides of N-alkylated LY264826 and N-alkylated vancomycin were active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci as well as other gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.	0
Title: Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family Abstract: The Mas-related genes (Mrgs) comprise a family of >50 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), many of which are expressed in specific subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons in mice. In contrast, humans contain a related but nonorthologous family of genes, called MrgXs or sensory neuron-specific receptors, of which many fewer appear to be expressed in sensory neurons. To determine whether the diversity of murine Mrgs is generic to rodents or is an atypical feature of mice, we characterized MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD subfamilies in rat and gerbil. Surprisingly, although mice have approximately 22 MrgA and approximately 14 MrgC genes, rats and gerbils have just a single MrgA and MrgC gene. This murine-specific expansion likely reflects recent retrotransposon-mediated unequal crossover events. The expression of Mrgs in rat sensory ganglia suggests that the extensive cellular diversity in mice can be simplified to a core subset of approximately four different genes (MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD), defining a similar number of neuronal subpopulations. Our results suggest more generally that mouse-human genomic comparisons may sometimes reveal differences atypical of rodents.	0
Title: Identification of the kinanthraquinone biosynthetic gene cluster by expression of an atypical response regulator Abstract: Recent advances in genome sequencing have revealed a variety of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in actinomycetes. Understanding the biosynthetic mechanism controlling secondary metabolite production is important for utilizing these gene clusters. In this study, we focused on the kinanthraquinone biosynthetic gene cluster, which has not been identified yet in Streptomyces sp. SN-593. Based on chemical structure, 5 type II polyketide synthase gene clusters were listed from the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. SN-593. Among them, a candidate gene cluster was selected by comparing the gene organization with grincamycin, which is synthesized through an intermediate similar to kinanthraquinone. We initially utilized a BAC library for subcloning the kiq gene cluster, performed heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK23, and identified the production of kinanthraquinone and kinanthraquinone B. We also found that heterologous expression of kiqA, which belongs to the DNA-binding response regulator OmpR family, dramatically enhanced the production of kinanthraquinones.	1
Title: The TβR-I pre-helix extension is structurally ordered in the unbound form and its flanking prolines are essential for binding Abstract: Transforming growth factor β isoforms (TGF-β) are among the most recently evolved members of a signaling superfamily with more than 30 members. TGF-β play vital roles in regulating cellular growth and differentiation, and they signal through a highly restricted subset of receptors known as TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II). TGF-β's specificity for TβR-I has been proposed to arise from its pre-helix extension, a five-residue loop that binds in the cleft between TGF-β and TβR-II. The structure and backbone dynamics of the unbound form of the TβR-I extracellular domain were determined using NMR to investigate the extension's role in binding. This showed that the unbound form is highly similar to the bound form in terms of both the β-strand framework that defines the three-finger toxin fold and the extension and its characteristic cis-Ile54-Pro55 peptide bond. The NMR data further showed that the extension and two flanking 3(10) helices are rigid on the nanosecond-to-picosecond timescale. The functional significance of several residues within the extension was investigated by binding studies and reporter gene assays in cultured epithelial cells. These demonstrated that the pre-helix extension is essential for binding, with Pro55 and Pro59 each playing a major role. These findings suggest that the pre-helix extension and its flanking prolines evolved to endow the TGF-β signaling complex with its unique specificity, departing from the ancestral promiscuity of the bone morphogenetic protein subfamily, where the binding interface of the type I receptor is highly flexible.	0
Title: Elucidating hydroxylation and methylation steps tailoring piericidin A1 biosynthesis Abstract: The piericidin A1 (1) gene cluster was identified from the deep-sea derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments verified PieE as a 4'-hydroxylase and PieB2 as a 4'-O-methyltransferase, allowing the elucidation of the post-PKS modification steps involved in 1 biosynthesis. In addition, the shunt metabolite piericidin E1 (7) was identified as a novel analogue featuring a C-2/C-3 epoxy ring.	1
Title: A new Myxococcus xanthus gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic saframycin Mx1 encoding a peptide synthetase Abstract: The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the heterocyclic quinone antibiotic saframycin Mx1 of Myxococcus xanthus DM504/15 was inactivated and tagged by Tn5 insertions. The tagged genes were cloned in Escherichia coli and used to select overlapping cosmid clones spanning 58 kb of the M. xanthus genome. Gene disruption experiments defined a > or = 18 kb contiguous DNA region involved in saframycin biosynthesis. Sequencing of part of this region revealed a large ORF containing two 600-amino-acid domains with similarity to peptide synthetase amino-acid-activating sequences, suggesting that saframycin Mx1 is synthesized by a nonribosomal multienzyme complex, similar to other bioactive peptides.	1
Title: Solution structures of spinach acyl carrier protein with decanoate and stearate Abstract: Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a cofactor in a variety of biosynthetic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism. Thus, it is of interest to determine structures of physiologically relevant ACP-fatty acid complexes. We report here the NMR solution structures of spinach ACP with decanoate (10:0-ACP) and stearate (18:0-ACP) attached to the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. The protein in the fatty acid complexes adopts a single conformer, unlike apo- and holo-ACP, which interconvert in solution between two major conformers. The protein component of both 10:0- and 18:0-ACP adopts the four-helix bundle topology characteristic of ACP, and a fatty acid binding cavity was identified in both structures. Portions of the protein close in space to the fatty acid and the 4'-phosphopantetheine were identified using filtered/edited NOESY experiments. A docking protocol was used to generate protein structures containing bound fatty acid for 10:0- and 18:0-ACP. In both cases, the predominant structure contained fatty acid bound down the center of the helical bundle, in agreement with the location of the fatty acid binding pockets. These structures demonstrate the conformational flexibility of spinach ACP and suggest how the protein changes to accommodate its myriad binding partners.	0
Title: Potent in vitro antimalarial activity of metacycloprodigiosin isolated from Streptomyces spectabilis BCC 4785 Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces spectabilis BCC 4785 led to the isolation of three principle antimalarial agents, metacycloprodigiosin, bafilomycin A(1), and spectinabilin. Metacycloprodigiosin exhibited potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum K1, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.0050 +/- 0.0010 microg/ml, while its cytotoxicity was much weaker.	1
Title: Biomimetic enterobactin analogue mediates iron-uptake and cargo transport into E. coli and P. aeruginosa Abstract: The design, synthesis and biological evaluation of the artificial enterobactin analogue EntKL and several fluorophore-conjugates thereof are described. EntKL provides an attachment point for cargos such as fluorophores or antimicrobial payloads. Corresponding conjugates are recognized by outer membrane siderophore receptors of Gram-negative pathogens and retain the natural hydrolyzability of the tris-lactone backbone. Initial density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of the free energies of solvation (ΔG(sol)) and relaxed Fe-O force constants of the corresponding [Fe-EntKL]3- complexes indicated a similar iron binding constant compared to natural enterobactin (Ent). The synthesis of EntKL was achieved via an iterative assembly based on a 3-hydroxylysine building block over 14 steps with an overall yield of 3%. A series of growth recovery assays under iron-limiting conditions with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant strains that are defective in natural siderophore synthesis revealed a potent concentration-dependent growth promoting effect of EntKL similar to natural Ent. Additionally, four cargo-conjugates differing in molecular size were able to restore growth of E. coli indicating an uptake into the cytosol. P. aeruginosa displayed a stronger uptake promiscuity as six different cargo-conjugates were found to restore growth under iron-limiting conditions. Imaging studies utilizing BODIPYFL-conjugates, demonstrated the ability of EntKL to overcome the Gram-negative outer membrane permeability barrier and thus deliver molecular cargos via the bacterial iron transport machinery of E. coli and P. aeruginosa.	0
Title: Bioindustrial manufacturing readiness levels (BioMRLs) as a shared framework for measuring and communicating the maturity of bioproduct manufacturing processes Abstract: Readiness level (RL) frameworks such as technology readiness levels and manufacturing readiness levels describe the status of a technology/manufacturing process on its journey from initial conception to commercial deployment. More importantly, they provide a roadmap to guide technology development and scale-up from a ''totality of system'' approach. Commercialization risks associated with too narrowly focused R&D efforts are mitigated. RLs are defined abstractly so that they can apply to diverse industries and technology sectors. However, differences between technology sectors make necessary the definition of sector specific RL frameworks. Here, we describe bioindustrial manufacturing readiness levels (BioMRLs), a classification system specific to bioindustrial manufacturing. BioMRLs will give program managers, investors, scientists, and engineers a shared vocabulary for prioritizing goals and assessing risks in the development and commercialization of a bioindustrial manufacturing process.	0
Title: A polyketide synthase-peptide synthetase gene cluster from an uncultured bacterial symbiont of Paederus beetles Abstract: Many drug candidates from marine and terrestrial invertebrates are suspected metabolites of uncultured bacterial symbionts. The antitumor polyketides of the pederin family, isolated from beetles and sponges, are an example. Drug development from such sources is commonly hampered by low yields and the difficulty of sustaining invertebrate cultures. To obtain insight into the true producer and find alternative supplies of these rare drug candidates, the putative pederin biosynthesis genes were cloned from total DNA of Paederus fuscipes beetles, which use this compound for chemical defense. Sequence analysis of the gene cluster and adjacent regions revealed the presence of ORFs with typical bacterial architecture and homologies. The ped cluster, which is present only in beetle specimens with high pederin content, is located on a 54-kb region bordered by transposase pseudogenes and encodes a mixed modular polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Notably, none of the modules contains regions with homology to acyltransferase domains, but two copies of isolated monodomain acyltransferase genes were found at the upstream end of the cluster. In line with an involvement in pederin biosynthesis, the upstream cluster region perfectly mirrors pederin structure. The unexpected presence of additional polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules reveals surprising insights into the evolutionary relationship between pederin-type pathways in beetles and sponges.	1
Title: Cytotoxic clerodane diterpenoids and their hydrolysis products from Casearia nigrescens from the rainforest of Madagascar Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of the cytotoxic leaf and flower extract of Casearia nigrescens led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, designated caseanigrescens A-D (1-4). These compounds were subject to hydrolysis to dialdehydes when stored in CDCl3. The structures of compounds 1-4 were determined using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. All four compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity to the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line, with an IC50 range of 0.83-1.4 microM.	0
Title: Cohesin and CTCF differentially affect chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells Abstract: Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.	0
Title: Mechanical Properties of Human Dura Mater in Tension - An Analysis at an Age Range of 2 to 94 Years Abstract: Realistic human head models are of great interest in traumatic brain injury research and in the forensic pathology courtroom and teaching. Due to a lack of biomechanical data, the human dura mater is underrepresented in head models. This study provides tensile data of 73 fresh human cranial dura mater samples retrieved from an area between the anterior middle and the posterior middle meningeal artery. Tissues were adapted to their native water content using the osmotic stress technique. Tensile tests were conducted under quasi-static uniaxial testing conditions with simultaneous digital image correlation. Human temporal dura mater is mechanically highly variable with regards to its elastic modulus of 70 ± 44 MPa, tensile strength of 7 ± 4 MPa, and maximum strain of 11 ± 3 percent. Mechanical properties of the dura mater did not vary significantly between side nor sex and decreased with the age of the cadaver. Both elastic modulus and tensile strength appear to have constant mechanical parameters within the first 139 hours post mortem. The mechanical properties provided by this study can help to improve computational and physical human head models. These properties under quasi-static conditions do not require adjustments for side nor sex, whereas adjustments of tensile properties accompanied with normal aging may be of interest.	0
Title: A gene (pks2) encoding a putative 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase from Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: A gene that encodes for a polyketide synthase (PKS) was cloned from the fungus Glarea lozoyensis and characterized. The gene (pks2) consists of four exons interrupted by three introns of 51, 59, and 65 bp, which are clustered at the 5' end. Its predicted product is a 1791-amino-acid protein containing five catalytic motifs typical of fungal PKSs, including a beta-ketosynthase, an acyltransferase, a dehydratase, a beta-ketoacyl reductase, and an acyl carrier region. The gene is transcribed from an initiation site located 375 bp upstream of the translational start codon and extends to a transcriptional termination site 244 bp downstream of the translational stop codon. The gene function is not required for either vegetative growth of G. lozoyensis or for production of pneumocandin, as shown by Agrobacterium-mediated pks2 gene disruption. Previously reported cluster analysis of ketosynthase motifs from 37 fungal polyketide synthases had grouped the Pks2p from G. lozoyensis with PKSs involved in the biosynthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid. To verify the function of the gene, it was transferred into Aspergillus nidulans under the control of the trpC promoter. 5'-and 3'-RACE experiments confirmed that it was transcribed in the heterologous host, and was associated with the synthesis of a compound identified as 6-methylsalicylic acid by NMR and mass spectrometry. In G. lozoyensis, pks2 is flanked by a gene that encodes a putative drug resistance efflux pump. The Aspergillus pks2 transformants, which were arginine prototrophs, also exhibited precocious pigmentation and accumulated a benzophenone that appeared to be a precursor of emericellin (variecoxanthone B), a known product of A. nidulans. The buildup of the benzophenone may be related to the use of an alternative splice site for the removal of intron 1 of the pks2 transcript in the heterologous host.	1
Title: Guide Strand 3'-End Modifications Regulate siRNA Specificity Abstract: Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-triggered gene knockdown through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is widely used to study gene function, and siRNA-based therapeutics are in development. However, as the guide strand of an siRNA can function like a natural microRNA (miRNA), siRNAs often repress hundreds of off-target transcripts with complementarity only to the seed region (nucleotides 2-8) of the guide strand. Here, we describe novel guide strand 3'-end modifications derived from 1-ethynylribose (1-ER) and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions and evaluate their impact on target versus miRNA-like off-target knockdown. Surprisingly, when positioned at the guide strand 3'-end, the parent 1-ER modification substantially reduced off-target knockdown while having no measurable effect on on-target knockdown potency. In addition, these modifications were shown to modulate siRNA affinity for the hAgo2 PAZ domain. However, the change in PAZ domain binding affinity was not sufficient to predict the modification's effect on miRNA-like off targeting.	0
Title: Characterization of moeB--part of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis gene cluster in Staphylococcus carnosus Abstract: Transposon mutagenesis of Staphylococcus carnosus led to the identification of a gene cluster comprising nine genes that are important for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Two nitrate-reductase-negative Tn917-insertion mutants were defective in MoeB. In cell-free extracts of an moeB mutant, the molybdenum-cofactor-deficient nitrate reductase could be reconstituted with a low-molecular-mass component (most likely free molybdenum cofactor) from an S. carnosus mutant that is defective in the nitrate reductase structural genes. The expression of moeB was studied in response to oxygen and nitrate. Primer-extension studies indicated that anaerobiosis and nitrate each enhance transcription of moeB.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the asperthecin gene cluster of Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: The sequencing of Aspergillus genomes has revealed that the products of a large number of secondary metabolism pathways have not yet been identified. This is probably because many secondary metabolite gene clusters are not expressed under normal laboratory culture conditions. It is, therefore, important to discover conditions or regulatory factors that can induce the expression of these genes. We report that the deletion of sumO, the gene that encodes the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO in A. nidulans, caused a dramatic increase in the production of the secondary metabolite asperthecin and a decrease in the synthesis of austinol/dehydroaustinol and sterigmatocystin. The overproduction of asperthecin in the sumO deletion mutant has allowed us, through a series of targeted deletions, to identify the genes required for asperthecin synthesis. The asperthecin biosynthesis genes are clustered and include genes encoding an iterative type I polyketide synthase, a hydrolase, and a monooxygenase. The identification of these genes allows us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for asperthecin.	1
Title: Snf2 controls pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis and antifungal activity of the biocontrol yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima Abstract: Metschnikowia pulcherrima synthesises the pigment pulcherrimin, from cyclodileucine (cyclo(Leu-Leu)) as a precursor, and exhibits strong antifungal activity against notorious plant pathogenic fungi. This yeast therefore has great potential for biocontrol applications against fungal diseases; particularly in the phyllosphere where this species is frequently found. To elucidate the molecular basis of the antifungal activity of M. pulcherrima, we compared a wild-type strain with a spontaneously occurring, pigmentless, weakly antagonistic mutant derivative. Whole genome sequencing of the wild-type and mutant strains identified a point mutation that creates a premature stop codon in the transcriptional regulator gene SNF2 in the mutant. Complementation of the mutant strain with the wild-type SNF2 gene restored pigmentation and recovered the strong antifungal activity. Mass spectrometry (UPLC HR HESI-MS) proved the presence of the pulcherrimin precursors cyclo(Leu-Leu) and pulcherriminic acid and identified new precursor and degradation products of pulcherriminic acid and/or pulcherrimin. All of these compounds were identified in the wild-type and complemented strain, but were undetectable in the pigmentless snf2 mutant strain. These results thus identify Snf2 as a regulator of antifungal activity and pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis in M. pulcherrima and provide a starting point for deciphering the molecular functions underlying the antagonistic activity of this yeast.	1
Title: Identification and molecular characterization of the chromosomal exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris SMQ-461 Abstract: The exopolysaccharide (EPS) capsule-forming strain SMQ-461 of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, isolated from raw milk, produces EPS with an apparent molecular mass of >1.6 x 10(6) Da. The EPS biosynthetic genes are located on the chromosome in a 13.2-kb region consisting of 15 open reading frames. This region is flanked by three IS1077-related tnp genes (L. lactis) at the 5' end and orfY, along with an IS981-related tnp gene, at the 3' end. The eps genes are organized in specific regions involved in regulation, chain length determination, biosynthesis of the repeat unit, polymerization, and export. Three (epsGIK) of the six predicted glycosyltransferase gene products showed low amino acid similarity with known glycosyltransferases. The structure of the repeat unit could thus be different from those known to date for Lactococcus. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the eps locus is transcribed as a single mRNA. The function of the eps gene cluster was confirmed by disrupting the priming glycosyltransferase gene (epsD) in Lactococcus cremoris SMQ-461, generating non-EPS-producing reversible mutants. This is the first report of a chromosomal location for EPS genetic elements in Lactococcus cremoris, with novel glycosyltransferases not encountered before in lactic acid bacteria.	1
Title: Synthesis and collagenase inhibition of new glycosides of aranciamycinone: the aglycon of the naturally occurring antibiotic aranciamycin Abstract: Glycosides of aranciamycinone were prepared by glycosylation with sugar acetates and trimethylsilyl triflate in dichloromethane. Glycosides of the following sugars were prepared: alpha-L-rhamnopyranose, beta-D-glucopyranose, beta-D-ribopyranose, beta-D-xylopyranose, alpha-L-fucopyranose, 2-azido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranose, 2,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-arabino-hexopyranose, 3,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-arabino-hexopyranose, and 4,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-lyxo-hexopyranose. The new glycosides were tested for inhibition of Clostridium histolyticum collagenase and Yoshida Sarcoma tumor cells.	1
Title: Chemoenzymatic formation of novel aminocoumarin antibiotics by the enzymes CouN1 and CouN7 Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1 are highly potent inhibitors of the bacterial type II topoisomerase DNA gyrase. The key pharmacophore of both clorobiocin and coumermycin A1, the 5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl moiety, targets the ATP-binding site of GyrB. The 5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl group is transferred by the acyltransferases Clo/CouN7 from the carrier proteins Clo/CouN1 to the 3'-hydroxyl of the l-noviosyl scaffold during the late steps of clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 biosynthesis. We first examined the substrate specificity of the purified thiolation domain protein CouN1 in becoming primed by the phosphopantetheinyltransferase Sfp using a variety of synthetic CoA analogues of the 5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl moiety. The acyl-S-CouN1 thioesters were then assayed as donors to the 3'-OH group of descarbamoylnovobiocin by the acyltransferase CouN7, resulting in 21 novel variants with heterocyclic acyl groups installed on the noviosyl moiety of the aminocoumarin scaffold. Scaleup of a 5-methylthiophene derivative yielded a compound with activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration found for the Gram-positive bacteria was comparable to that of novobiocin.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the insecticidal xenocyloins in Xenorhabdus bovienii Abstract: The biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of xenocyloins was identified in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004, and their biosynthesis was elucidated by heterologous expression and in vitro characterization of the enzymes. XclA is an S-selective ThDP-dependent acyloin-like condensation enzyme, and XclB and XclC are examples of the still-rare acylating ketosynthases that catalyze the acylation of the XclA-derived initial xenocyloins with acetyl-, propionyl-, or malonyl-CoA, thereby resulting in the formation of further xenocyloin derivatives. All xenocyloins were produced mainly by the more virulent primary variant of X. bovienii and showed activity against insect hemocytes thus contributing to the overall virulence of X. bovienii against insects.	1
Title: An indigoidine biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 contains an unusual IndB homologue Abstract: A putative indigoidine biosynthetic gene cluster was located in the genome of Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982. The silent 9.4-kb gene cluster consists of five open reading frames, named orf1, Sc-indC, Sc-indA, Sc-indB, and orf2, respectively. Sc-IndC was functionally characterized as an indigoidine synthase through heterologous expression of the enzyme in both Streptomyces coelicolor CH999 and Escherichia coli BAP1. The yield of indigoidine in E. coli BAP1 reached 2.78 g/l under the optimized conditions. The predicted protein product of Sc-indB is unusual and much larger than any other reported IndB-like protein. The N-terminal portion of this enzyme resembles IdgB and the C-terminal portion is a hypothetical protein. Sc-IndA and/or Sc-IndB were co-expressed with Sc-IndC in E. coli BAP1, which demonstrated the involvement of Sc-IndB, but not Sc-IndA, in the biosynthetic pathway of indigoidine. The yield of indigoidine was dramatically increased by 41.4 % (3.93 g/l) when Sc-IndB was co-expressed with Sc-IndC in E. coli BAP1. Indigoidine is more stable at low temperatures.	1
Title: Bioinformatics-Guided Expansion and Discovery of Graspetides Abstract: Graspetides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products featuring ATP-grasp ligase-dependent formation of macrolactones/macrolactams. These modifications arise from serine, threonine, or lysine donor residues linked to aspartate or glutamate acceptor residues. Characterized graspetides include serine protease inhibitors such as the microviridins and plesiocin. Here, we report an update to Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online (RODEO) for the automated detection of graspetides, which identified 3,923 high-confidence graspetide biosynthetic gene clusters. Sequence and co-occurrence analyses doubled the number of graspetide groups from 12 to 24, defined based on core consensus sequence and putative secondary modification. Bioinformatic analyses of the ATP-grasp ligase superfamily suggest that extant graspetide synthetases diverged once from an ancestral ATP-grasp ligase and later evolved to introduce a variety of ring connectivities. Furthermore, we characterized thatisin and iso-thatisin, two graspetides related by conformational stereoisomerism from Lysobacter antibioticus. Derived from a newly identified graspetide group, thatisin and iso-thatisin feature two interlocking macrolactones with identical ring connectivity, as determined by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), methanolytic, and mutational analyses. NMR spectroscopy of thatisin revealed a cis conformation for a key proline residue, while molecular dynamics simulations, solvent-accessible surface area calculations, and partial methanolytic analysis coupled with MS/MS support a trans conformation for iso-thatisin at the same position. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive overview of the graspetide landscape, and the improved RODEO algorithm will accelerate future graspetide discoveries by enabling open-access analysis of existing and emerging genomes.	1
Title: Functional analysis of mlcR, a regulatory gene for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The mlcR gene encodes a putative 50.2-kDa protein with a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA-binding domain, which may be involved in the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. The induction of ML-236B production appears to correlate with the expression of mlcR, and the ML-236B biosynthetic genes mlcA- mlcH, and occurs mostly during the stationary phase. The present study was designed to examine the effects of alterations in mlcR expression on ML-236B biosynthesis. We first set out to increase the mlcR copy number in the chromosome of P. citrinum. Transformants with additional copies of native mlcR showed increased transcription of mlcR and produced larger amounts of ML-236B than the parent strain. Altered mlcR expression was also achieved by introducing a construct, designated pgkA(P)::mlcR, that contained the mlcR coding region fused to the (constitutively active) promoter and terminator sequences of the Aspergillus nidulans 3-phospho-glycerate kinase (pgkA) gene. Transformants carrying the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct expressed mlcR constitutively, and produced ML-236B during the exponential growth phase, suggesting that the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct does affect the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis. Comparative expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that altering the expression profile of mlcR influenced the expression of some of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes. The evidence suggests that mlcR may indeed be involved in the transcriptional activation of some of the pathway-specific genes required for ML-236B biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of the highly immunogenic VP2 protrusion domain as a diagnostic antigen for members of Birnaviridae family Abstract: Birnaviridae is a family of viruses (birnaviruses) which consists of four genera, members of which cause diseases in fish, birds, mollusks, and insects. The genome of birnaviruses encodes the highly immunogenic VP2 capsid protein. In order to demonstrate that the VP2 protein can be exploited as a diagnostic antigen for birnaviruses, we developed a lateral flow assay based on the surface-exposed VP2 protrusion domain of a representative birnavirus, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) of serotype 1 which causes the highly devastating infectious bursal disease in chickens. The biophysical characterization of the purified domain reveals that the domain predominantly consists of β-sheets, exists in a trimeric form, and remains folded at high temperatures, making it suitable for diagnostic purposes. Owing to its highly immunogenic nature and excellent biophysical properties, we employed the VP2 protrusion domain in a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for rapid detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of infected chickens. Our results indicate that the domain binds anti-IBDV antibodies with high specificity during laboratory testing and on-site testing. The lateral flow assay reported here yields comparable results in a qualitative manner as obtained through a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As VP2 is a common capsid protein of birnaviruses, the lateral flow assay can be generalized for other birnaviruses, and members of Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae families which contain homologous VP2 capsid proteins.	0
Title: Dorsomorphin inhibits BMP signals required for embryogenesis and iron metabolism Abstract: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals coordinate developmental patterning and have essential physiological roles in mature organisms. Here we describe the first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling in iron-hepcidin homeostasis.	0
Title: Thuricin CD, a posttranslationally modified bacteriocin with a narrow spectrum of activity against Clostridium difficile Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous outbreaks of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD), which presented significant challenges for healthcare facilities worldwide. We have identified and purified thuricin CD, a two-component antimicrobial that shows activity against C. difficile in the nanomolar range. Thuricin CD is produced by Bacillus thuringiensis DPC 6431, a bacterial strain isolated from a human fecal sample, and it consists of two distinct peptides, Trn-alpha and Trn-beta, that act synergistically to kill a wide range of clinical C. difficile isolates, including ribotypes commonly associated with CDAD (e.g., ribotype 027). However, this bacteriocin thuricin CD has little impact on most other genera, including many gastrointestinal commensals. Complete amino acid sequencing using infusion tandem mass spectrometry indicated that each peptide is posttranslationally modified at its respective 21st, 25th, and 28th residues. Solution NMR studies on [(13)C,(15)N] Trn-alpha and [(13)C,(15)N]Trn-beta were used to characterize these modifications. Analysis of multidimensional NOESY data shows that specific cysteines are linked to the alpha-carbons of the modified residues, forming three sulfur to alpha-carbon bridges. Complete sequencing of the thuricin CD gene cluster revealed genes capable of encoding two S'-adenosylmethionine proteins that are characteristically associated with unusual posttranslational modifications. Thuricin CD is a two-component antimicrobial peptide system with sulfur to alpha-carbon linkages, and it may have potential as a targeted therapy in the treatment of CDAD while also reducing collateral impact on the commensal flora.	1
Title: Nucleic acid aptamers: an emerging frontier in cancer therapy Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of nucleic acid aptamers in a variety of fields, including target analysis, disease therapy, and molecular and cellular engineering. The efficient and widely applicable aptamer selection, reproducible chemical synthesis and modification, generally impressive target binding selectivity and affinity, relatively rapid tissue penetration, low immunogenicity, and rapid systemic clearance make aptamers ideal recognition elements for use as therapeutics or for in vivo delivery of therapeutics. In this feature article, we discuss the development and biomedical application of nucleic acid aptamers, with emphasis on cancer cell aptamer isolation, targeted cancer therapy, oncology biomarker identification and drug discovery.	0
Title: Adenosine deaminase-related growth factors stimulate cell proliferation in Drosophila by depleting extracellular adenosine Abstract: We describe a protein family in Drosophila containing six adenosine deaminase-related growth factors (ADGFs), which are homologous to a mitogenic growth factor discovered in conditioned medium from cells of a different fly species, Sarcophaga. Closely related proteins have been identified in other animals, and a human homolog is implicated in the genetic disease Cat-Eye Syndrome. The two most abundantly expressed ADGFs in Drosophila larvae are ADGF-A, which is strongly expressed in the gut and lymph glands, and ADGF-D, which is mainly expressed in the fat body and brain. Recombinant ADGF-A and ADGF-D are active adenosine deaminases (ADAs), and they cause polarization and serum-independent proliferation of imaginal disk and embryonic cells in vitro. The enzymatic activity of these proteins is required for their mitogenic function, making them unique among growth factors. A culture medium prepared without adenosine, or depleted of adenosine by using bovine ADA, also stimulates proliferation of imaginal disk cells, and addition of adenosine to this medium inhibits proliferation. Thus ADGFs secreted in vivo may control tissue growth by modulating the level of extracellular adenosine.	0
Title: Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. Discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. As a unique class II lantibiotic, bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. By using its precursor BovA as a drive sequence, 16 BovA-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. From them, three representative novel lan loci from Clostridium perfringens D str. JGS1721, Bacillus cereus As 1.348 and B. thuringiensis As 1.013 were identified by PCR screening. The corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. Further analysis indicated that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin HJ50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. This study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics.	1
Title: Feed-forward regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis in Microbispora corallina Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. Microbisporicin is a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina and contains unique chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin encodes several putative regulatory proteins, including, uniquely, an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor, σ(MibX), a likely cognate anti-σ factor, MibW, and a potential helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein, MibR. Here we examine the roles of these proteins in regulating microbisporicin biosynthesis. S1 nuclease protection assays were used to determine transcriptional start sites in the microbisporicin gene cluster and confirmed the presence of the likely ECF sigma factor -10 and -35 sequences in five out of six promoters. In contrast, the promoter of mibA, encoding the microbisporicin prepropeptide, has a typical Streptomyces vegetative sigma factor consensus sequence. The ECF sigma factor σ(MibX) was shown to interact with the putative anti-sigma factor MibW in Escherichia coli using bacterial two-hybrid analysis. σ(MibX) autoregulates its own expression but does not directly regulate expression of mibA. On the basis of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) data, we propose a model for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin in which MibR functions as an essential master regulator and the ECF sigma factor/anti-sigma factor pair, σ(MibX)/MibW, induces feed-forward biosynthesis of microbisporicin and producer immunity.	1
Title: Toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1. Nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes and their expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes which encode the first three enzymes in the catabolism of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1 was determined. The genes encode the three components of the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system: reductaseTOL (todA), ferredoxinTOL (todB), and the two subunits of the terminal dioxygenase (todC1C2); (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (todD); and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE). Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the tod genes was used to construct clones of Escherichia coli JM109 that overproduce toluene dioxygenase (JM109(pDT-601]; toluene dioxygenase and (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (JM109(pDTG602]; and toluene dioxygenase, (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase, and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (JM109(pDTG603]. The overexpression of the tod-C1C2BADE gene products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three E. coli JM109 strains harboring the plasmids pDTG601, pDTG602, and pDTG603, after induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, oxidized toluene to (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene, 3-methylcatechol, and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate, respectively. The tod-C1C2BAD genes show significant homology to the reported nucleotide sequence for benzene dioxygenase and cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase from P. putida 136R-3 (Irie, S., Doi, S., Yorifuji, T., Takagi, M., and Yano, K. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 5174-5179). In addition, significant homology was observed between the nucleotide sequences for the todDE genes and the sequences reported for cis-1,2-dihydroxy-6-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Furukawa, K., Arimura, N., and Miyazaki, T. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 427-429).	0
Title: Assembly and clustering of natural antibiotics guides target identification Abstract: Antibiotics are essential for numerous medical procedures, including the treatment of bacterial infections, but their widespread use has led to the accumulation of resistance, prompting calls for the discovery of antibacterial agents with new targets. A majority of clinically approved antibacterial scaffolds are derived from microbial natural products, but these valuable molecules are not well annotated or organized, limiting the efficacy of modern informatic analyses. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource defining the targets, chemical origins and families of the natural antibacterial collective through a retrobiosynthetic algorithm. From this we also detail the directed mining of biosynthetic scaffolds and resistance determinants to reveal structures with a high likelihood of having previously unknown modes of action. Implementing this pipeline led to investigations of the telomycin family of natural products from Streptomyces canus, revealing that these bactericidal molecules possess a new antibacterial mode of action dependent on the bacterial phospholipid cardiolipin.	1
Title: Biosynthetic studies on antibiotic A47934 Abstract: A47934, a peptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces toyocaensis, belongs to the glycopeptide class of compounds which includes ristocetin and vancomycin. Incorporation studies with radioisotope-labeled substrates indicated that tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylglycine, p-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate, acetate, and sulfate were efficiently incorporated into A47934. This is consistent with the reported biosynthesis of other glycopeptide antibiotics. Prototrophic mutants blocked in antibiotic biosynthesis were isolated at a low frequency (0.4%) after mutagenesis. Secretor-convertor pairings of the 36 mutants obtained demonstrated that they belonged to three classes: two groups of secretor-convertor pairs and a larger group of mutants that did not make antibiotic under any condition tested. Neither the secretor-convertor studies not supplementation of the cultures with putative biosynthetic intermediates was useful in identifying the location of the biosynthetic blocks. All studies to determine the timing of the sulfate addition step in the biosynthesis indicated that the sulfate is added prior to the formation of intermediates that possess antimicrobial activity.	0
Title: Regulatory Mechanism of Mycotoxin Tenuazonic Acid Production in Pyricularia oryzae Abstract: Tenuazonic acid (TeA) is a mycotoxin produced by the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae and some plant pathogenic fungi. We previously demonstrated that TeA is biosynthesized in P. oryzae by TeA synthetase 1 (TAS1) and that its production is induced by osmo-sensory MAPK-encoding gene (OSM1) deletion or the addition of 1% DMSO to cultures; however, the regulatory mechanisms of TeA production were unknown. Here, we identify a Zn(II)2-Cys6-type transcription factor in the upstream region of TAS1, which is encoded by TAS2 and regulates TeA production. We also find PoLAE1, which is a homologue of LaeA, a regulator of fungal secondary metabolism. Analysis of PoLAE1 deletion and overexpression strains indicate that PoLAE1 drives TeA production. We also demonstrate that two TeA-inducing signals, 1% DMSO addition and OSM1 deletion, were transmitted through PoLAE1. Our results indicate that TeA production is regulated by two specific regulators, TAS2 and PoLAE1, in P. oryzae.	1
Title: Novel sensitive high-throughput screening strategy for nitrilase-producing strains Abstract: Nitrilases have found wide use in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of fine chemicals, and it is important to have a method by which to screen libraries of isolated or engineered nitrilase variants (including bacteria and fungi). The conventional methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, or gas chromatography, are tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, a direct and sensitive readout of the nitrilase's activity has to be considered. In this paper, we report a novel time-resolved luminescent probe: o-hydroxybenzonitrile derivatives could be applied to detect the activity of the nitrilases. By the action of nitrilases, o-hydroxybenzonitrile derivatives can be transformed to the corresponding salicylic acid derivatives, which, upon binding Tb(3+), serve as a photon antenna and sensitize Tb(3+) luminescence. Because of the time-resolved property of the luminescence, the background from the other proteins (especially in the fermentation system) in the assay could be reduced and, therefore, the sensitivity was increased. Moreover, because the detection was performed on a 96- or 384-well plate, the activity of the nitrilases from microorganisms could be determined quickly. Based on this strategy, the best fermentation conditions for nitrilase-producing strains were obtained.	0
Title: Simplified AIP-II Peptidomimetics Are Potent Inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus AgrC Quorum Sensing Receptors Abstract: The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus controls many aspects of virulence by using the accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing (QS) system. The agr system is activated by a macrocyclic peptide signal known as an autoinducing peptide (AIP). We sought to develop structurally simplified mimetics of AIPs for use as chemical tools to study QS in S. aureus. Herein, we report new peptidomimetic AgrC receptor inhibitors based on a tail-truncated AIP-II peptide that have almost analogous inhibitory activities to the parent peptide. Structural comparison of one of these peptidomimetics to the parent peptide and a highly potent, all-peptide-derived, S. aureus agr inhibitor (AIP-III D4A) revealed a conserved hydrophobic motif and overall amphipathic nature. Our results suggest that the AIP scaffold is amenable to structural mimicry and minimization for the development of synthetic agr inhibitors.	0
Title: Neuronal store-operated calcium entry pathway as a novel therapeutic target for Huntington's disease treatment Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion within Huntingtin (Htt) protein. In the phenotypic screen we identified a class of quinazoline-derived compounds that delayed a progression of a motor phenotype in transgenic Drosophila HD flies. We found that the store-operated calcium (Ca(2+)) entry (SOC) pathway activity is enhanced in neuronal cells expressing mutant Htt and that the identified compounds inhibit SOC pathway in HD neurons. The same compounds exerted neuroprotective effects in glutamate-toxicity assays with YAC128 medium spiny neurons primary cultures. We demonstrated a key role of TRPC1 channels in supporting SOC pathway in HD neurons. We concluded that the TRPC1-mediated neuronal SOC pathway constitutes a novel target for HD treatment and that the identified compounds represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for treatment of HD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.	0
Title: Glycopeptide biosynthesis in Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM5908: function of a halogenase and a haloperoxidase/perhydrolase Abstract: Glycopeptides are important clinical emergency antibiotics consisting of a glycosylated and chlorinated heptapeptide backbone. The understanding of the biosynthesis is crucial for development of new glycopeptides. With balhimycin as a model system, this work focuses on the investigation of the putative halogenase gene (bhaA) and the putative haloperoxidase/perhydrolase gene (bhp) of the balhimycin biosynthesis gene cluster. An in-frame deletion mutant in the haloperoxidase/perhydrolase gene bhp (OP696) did not produce balhimycin. Feeding experiments revealed that bhp is involved in the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxytyrosine, a precursor of balhimycin. A bhaA in-frame deletion mutant (PH4) accumulated glycosylated but nonchlorinated balhimycin variants. The mutants indicated that only the halogenase BhaA is required for chlorination of balhimycin. Nonglycosylated and/or nonhalogenated metabolites can serve as starting points for combinatorial approaches for novel glycopeptides.	1
Title: Organohalogens Naturally Biosynthesized in Marine Environments and Produced as Disinfection Byproducts Alter Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Dynamics Abstract: Contemporary sources of organohalogens produced as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are receiving considerable attention as emerging pollutants because of their abundance, persistence, and potential to structurally mimic natural organohalogens produced by bacteria that serve signaling or toxicological functions in marine environments. Here, we tested 34 organohalogens from anthropogenic and marine sources to identify compounds active toward ryanodine receptor (RyR1), known toxicological targets of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). [3H]Ryanodine ([3H]Ry) binding screening (≤2 μM) identified 10 highly active organohalogens. Further analysis indicated that 2,3-dibromoindole (14), tetrabromopyrrole (31), and 2,3,5-tribromopyrrole (34) at 10 μM were the most efficacious at enhancing [3H]Ry binding. Interestingly, these congeners also inhibited microsomal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1a). Dual SERCA1a inhibition and RyR1 activation triggered Ca2+ efflux from microsomal vesicles with initial rates rank ordered 31 > 34 > 14. Hexabromobipyrroles (25) enhanced [3H]Ry binding moderately with strong SERCA1a inhibition, whereas pyrrole (24), 2,3,4-tribromopyrrole (26), and ethyl-4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate (27) were inactive. Of three PBDE derivatives of marine origin active in the [3H]Ry assay, 4'-hydroxy-2,3',4,5',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether (18) was also a highly potent SERCA1a inhibitor. Molecular targets of marine organohalogens that are also DBPs of emerging environmental concern are likely to contribute to their toxicity.	1
Title: NKT cell stimulation with α-galactosylceramide results in a block of Th17 differentiation after intranasal immunization in mice Abstract: In a previous study we demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) vaccination promotes a Th17 biased immune response. Here, we show that co-administration of a pegylated derivative of α-galactosylceramide (αGCPEG) with an antigen, even in the presence of Th17-polarizing compounds, results in a strong blocking of Th17 differentiation. Additional studies demonstrated that this phenomenon is specifically dependent on soluble factors, like IL-4 and IFNγ, which are produced by NKT cells. Even NK1.1 negative NKT cells, which by themselves produce IL-17A, are able to block Th17 differentiation. It follows that the use of αGCPEG as adjuvant would enable to tailor Th17 responses, according to the specific clinical needs. This knowledge expands our understanding of the role played by NKT cells in overall control of the cytokine microenvironment, as well as in the overall shaping of adaptive immune responses.	0
Title: Structural and kinetic analysis of prolyl-isomerization/phosphorylation cross-talk in the CTD code Abstract: The C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is an essential regulator for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. It is composed of multiple repeats of a consensus sequence Tyr(1)Ser(2)Pro(3)Thr(4)Ser(5)Pro(6)Ser(7). CTD regulation of transcription is mediated by both phosphorylation of the serines and prolyl isomerization of the two prolines. Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites are typically close to prolines, and thus the conformation of the adjacent proline could impact the specificity of the corresponding kinases and phosphatases. Experimental evidence of cross-talk between these two regulatory mechanisms has been elusive. Pin1 is a highly conserved phosphorylation-specific peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that recognizes the phospho-Ser/Thr (pSer/Thr)-Pro motif with CTD as one of its primary substrates in vivo. In the present study, we provide structural snapshots and kinetic evidence that support the concept of cross-talk between prolyl isomerization and phosphorylation. We determined the structures of Pin1 bound with two substrate isosteres that mimic peptides containing pSer/Thr-Pro motifs in cis or trans conformations. The results unequivocally demonstrate the utility of both cis- and trans-locked alkene isosteres as close geometric mimics of peptides bound to a protein target. Building on this result, we identified a specific case in which Pin1 differentially affects the rate of dephosphorylation catalyzed by two phosphatases (Scp1 and Ssu72) that target the same serine residue in the CTD heptad repeat but have different preferences for the isomerization state of the adjacent proline residue. These data exemplify for the first time how modulation of proline isomerization can kinetically impact signal transduction in transcription regulation.	0
Title: In vitro Plasmodium falciparum drug sensitivity assay: inhibition of parasite growth by incorporation of stomatocytogenic amphiphiles into the erythrocyte membrane Abstract: Lupeol, which shows in vitro inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.7 +/- 0.5 microM, was shown to cause a transformation of the human erythrocyte shape toward that of stomatocytes. Good correlation between the IC50 value and the membrane curvature changes caused by lupeol was observed. Preincubation of erythrocytes with lupeol, followed by extensive washing, made the cells unsuitable for parasite growth, suggesting that the compound incorporates into erythrocyte membrane irreversibly. On the other hand, lupeol-treated parasite culture continued to grow well in untreated erythrocytes. Thus, the antiplasmodial activity of lupeol appears to be indirect, being due to stomatocytic transformation of the host cell membrane and not to toxic effects via action on a drug target within the parasite. A number of amphiphiles that cause stomatocyte formation, but not those causing echinocyte formation, were shown to inhibit growth of the parasites, apparently via a mechanism similar to that of lupeol. Since antiplasmodial agents that inhibit parasite growth through erythrocyte membrane modifications must be regarded as unsuitable as leads for development of new antimalarial drugs, care must be exercised in the interpretation of results of screening of plant extracts and natural product libraries by an in vitro Plasmodium toxicity assay.	0
Title: In Situ Assembly of Platinum(II)-Metallopeptide Nanostructures Disrupts Energy Homeostasis and Cellular Metabolism Abstract: Nanostructure-based functions are omnipresent in nature and essential for the diversity of life. Unlike small molecules, which are often inhibitors of enzymes or biomimetics with established methods of elucidation, we show that functions of nanoscale structures in cells are complex and can implicate system-level effects such as the regulation of energy and redox homeostasis. Herein, we design a platinum(II)-containing tripeptide that assembles into intracellular fibrillar nanostructures upon molecular rearrangement in the presence of endogenous H2O2. The formed nanostructures blocked metabolic functions, including aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby shutting down ATP production. As a consequence, ATP-dependent actin formation and glucose metabolite-dependent histone deacetylase activity are downregulated. We demonstrate that assembly-driven nanomaterials offer a rich avenue to achieve broad-spectrum bioactivities that could provide new opportunities in drug discovery.	0
Title: Characterization of AntB, a promiscuous acyltransferase involved in antimycin biosynthesis Abstract: The in vivo and in vitro characterization of AntB, a dedicated acyltransferase encoded in the antimycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which catalyzes the C-8 acyloxy formation is reported. It is demonstrated that AntB has broad substrate specificity toward both the acyl substrate and the acyl carrier and produces more antimycin analogues with varying C-8 acyloxy moieties.	1
Title: Design and Characterization of Novel EphA2 Agonists for Targeted Delivery of Chemotherapy to Cancer Cells Abstract: The development of novel, targeted delivery agents for anti-cancer therapies requires the design and optimization of potent and selective tumor-targeting agents that are stable and amenable to conjugation with chemotherapeutic drugs. While short peptides represent potentially an excellent platform for these purposes, they often get degraded and are eliminated too rapidly in vivo. In this study, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance-guided structure-activity relationships along with biochemical and cellular studies to derive a novel tumor-homing agent, named 123B9, targeting the EphA2 tyrosine kinase receptor ligand-binding domain. Conjugating 123B9 to the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) via a stable linker results in an agent that is significantly more effective than the unconjugated drug in both a pancreatic cancer xenograft model and a melanoma lung colonization and metastases model. Hence, 123B9 could represent a promising strategy for the development of novel targeted therapies for cancer.	0
Title: New WS9326A congeners from Streptomyces sp. 9078 inhibiting Brugia malayi asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase Abstract: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the Brugia malayi parasite. Three new congeners of the depsipeptide WS9326A (1), WS9326C (2), WS9326D (3), and WS9326E (4), were isolated from Streptomyces sp. 9078 by using a B. malayi asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (BmAsnRS) inhibition assay. WS9326D specifically inhibits the BmAsnRS, kills the adult B. malayi parasite, and does not exhibit significant general cytotoxicity to human hepatic cells, representing a new lead scaffold for antifilarial drug discovery.	0
Title: Comparative transcriptomics as a guide to natural product discovery and biosynthetic gene cluster functionality Abstract: Bacterial natural products remain an important source of new medicines. DNA sequencing has revealed that a majority of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) maintained in bacterial genomes have yet to be linked to the small molecules whose biosynthesis they encode. Efforts to discover the products of these orphan BGCs are driving the development of genome mining techniques based on the premise that many are transcriptionally silent during normal laboratory cultivation. Here, we employ comparative transcriptomics to assess BGC expression among four closely related strains of marine bacteria belonging to the genus Salinispora The results reveal that slightly more than half of the BGCs are expressed at levels that should facilitate product detection. By comparing the expression profiles of similar gene clusters in different strains, we identified regulatory genes whose inactivation appears linked to cluster silencing. The significance of these subtle differences between expressed and silent BGCs could not have been predicted a priori and was only revealed by comparative transcriptomics. Evidence for the conservation of silent clusters among a larger number of strains for which genome sequences are available suggests they may be under different regulatory control from the expressed forms or that silencing may represent an underappreciated mechanism of gene cluster evolution. Coupling gene expression and metabolomics data established a bioinformatic link between the salinipostins and their associated BGC, while genetic manipulation established the genetic basis for this series of compounds, which were previously unknown from Salinispora pacifica.	1
Title: Molecular mechanism for loss of nodulation properties of Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: Of 18 Rhizobium trifolii strains tested, 12 showed a high frequency of loss of nodulation ability after incubation in cultures at elevated temperatures. A correlation between loss of nodulation ability and loss of a large plasmid was demonstrated for R. trifolii. In some nonnodulating (Nod-) mutants, deletions occurred instead of total elimination of the plasmid molecule. The maximum curing effect was observed in bacteria incubated at 35 degrees C. After 4 or more days of incubation at this temperature, the viability of bacteria decreased markedly, and the number of nonnodulating mutants increased significantly. At the elevated temperature DNA synthesis was stopped completely after 2 h, whereas protein synthesis proceeded for a few days. Microscopic observations showed that during the first 3 days of incubation at the elevated temperature, the bacterial cells increased markedly in size. These large irregular cells then divided and produced Nod- clones. Nonnodulating clones did not result from the selection of temperature-resistant mutants. The presence of P-group plasmids in Rhizobium strains strongly inhibited the loss of nodulation ability during incubation at 35 degrees C. The observed phenomenon did not result from integrative suppression. It is possible that a product(s) of the genes of R-plasmids acts as a stabilizing agent on the replication process of the indigenous Rhizobium plasmids.	0
Title: Cloning of separate meilingmycin biosynthesis gene clusters by use of acyltransferase-ketoreductase didomain PCR amplification Abstract: Five meilingmycins, A to E, with A as the major component, were isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization, meilingmycins A to E proved to be identical to reported milbemycins alpha11, alpha13, alpha14, beta1, and beta9, respectively. Sequencing of a previously cloned 103-kb region identified three modular type I polyketide synthase genes putatively encoding the last 11 elongation steps, three modification proteins, and one transcriptional regulatory protein for meilingmycin biosynthesis. However, the expected loading module and the first two elongation modules were missing. In meilingmycin, the presence of a methyl group at C-24 and a hydroxyl group at C-25 suggests that the elongation module 1 contains a methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-specific acyltransferase (ATp) domain and a ketoreductase (KR) domain. Based on the conserved motifs of the ATp and KR domains, a pair of primers was designed for PCR amplification, and a 1.40-kb expected fragment was amplified, whose sequence shows significant homology with the elongation module 1 of the aveA1-encoded enzyme AVES1. A polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one loading and two elongation modules, with a downstream C-5-O-methyltransferase gene, meiD, was subsequently localized 55 kb apart from the previously sequenced region, and its deletion abolishes meilingmycin production. A series of deletions within the 55-kb intercluster region rules out its involvement in meilingmycin biosynthesis. Furthermore, gene deletion of meiD eliminates meilingmycins D and E, with methyls at C-5. Our work provides a more specific strategy for the cloning of modular type I PKS gene clusters. The cloning of the meilingmycin gene clusters paves the way for its pathway engineering.	1
Title: Identification and DNA sequence of tdcR, a positive regulatory gene of the tdc operon of Escherichia coli Abstract: Efficient in vivo expression of the biodegradative threonine dehydratase (tdc) operon of Escherichia coli is dependent on a regulatory gene, tdcR. The tdcR gene is located 198 base pairs upstream of the tdc operon and is transcribed divergently from this operon. The nucleotide sequence of tdcR and two unrelated reading frames has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of TdcR indicates that it is a polypeptide of Mr 12,000 with 99 amino acid residues and contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. Deletion analysis and minicell expression of the tdcR gene suggest that TdcR may serve as a trans-acting positive activator for the tdc operon.	0
Title: Enzymatic production of (-)-indolactam V by LtxB, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Abstract: The P450 cytochrome monooxygenase gene, ltxB, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a 6xHis-tagged protein. The resulting recombinant LtxB was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and characterized biochemically. Purified LtxB demonstrated typical cytochrome P450 spectroscopic properties including substrate-induced transition from a low-spin (lambdamax=414 nm) to high-spin state (lambdamax=386 nm) upon incubation with N-methyl-L-valyl-L-tryptophanol. The catalytic activity of LtxB was verified by demonstrating the oxidation/cyclization of N-methyl-L-valyl-L-tryptophanol to (-)-indolactam V. LtxB shows a relaxed specificity for analogue substrates in which the valyl group is substituted for other aliphatic groups. The relaxed substrate specificity of LtxB, along with the relaxed specificity of the prenyltransferase, LtxC, allowed for the enzymatic production of a series of (-)-indolactam V and lyngbyatoxin analogues.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of albomycin δ(2) provides a template for assembling siderophore and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor conjugates Abstract: "Trojan horse" antibiotic albomycins are peptidyl nucleosides consisting of a highly modified 4'-thiofuranosyl cytosine moiety and a ferrichrome siderophore that are linked by a peptide bond via a serine residue. While the latter component serves to sequester iron from the environment, the seryl nucleoside portion is a potent inhibitor of bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetases, resulting in broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of albomycin δ(2). The isolation of albomycins has revealed this biological activity is optimized only following two unusual cytosine modifications, N4-carbamoylation and N3-methylation. We identified a genetic locus (named abm) for albomycin production in Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974. Gene deletion and complementation experiments along with bioinformatic analysis suggested 18 genes are responsible for albomycin biosynthesis and resistance, allowing us to propose a potential biosynthetic pathway for installing the novel chemical features. The gene abmI, encoding a putative methyltransferase, was functionally assigned in vitro and shown to modify the N3 of a variety of cytosine-containing nucleosides and antibiotics such as blasticidin S. Furthermore, a ΔabmI mutant was shown to produce the descarbamoyl-desmethyl albomycin analogue, supporting that the N3-methylation occurs before the N4-carbamoylation in the biosynthesis of albomycin δ(2). The combined genetic information was utilized to identify an abm-related locus (named ctj) from the draft genome of Streptomyces sp. C. Cross-complementation experiments and in vitro studies with CtjF, the AbmI homologue, suggest the production of a similar 4'-thiofuranosyl cytosine in this organism. In total, the genetic and biochemical data provide a biosynthetic template for assembling siderophore-inhibitor conjugates and modifying the albomycin scaffold to generate new derivatives.	1
Title: Structural and Biosynthetic Analysis of the Fabrubactins, Unusual Siderophores from Agrobacterium fabrum Strain C58 Abstract: Siderophores are iron-chelating molecules produced by microorganisms and plants to acquire exogenous iron. Siderophore biosynthetic enzymology often produces elaborate and unique molecules through unusual reactions to enable specific recognition by the producing organisms. Herein, we report the structure of two siderophore analogs from Agrobacterium fabrum strain C58, which we named fabrubactin (FBN) A and FBN B. Additionally, we characterized the substrate specificities of the NRPS and PKS components. The structures suggest unique Favorskii-like rearrangements of the molecular backbone that we propose are catalyzed by the flavin-dependent monooxygenase, FbnE. FBN A and B contain a 1,1-dimethyl-3-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-quinolin (Dmaq) moiety previously seen only in the anachelin cyanobacterial siderophores. We provide evidence that Dmaq is derived from l-DOPA and propose a mechanism for the formation of the mature Dmaq moiety. Our bioinformatic analyses suggest that FBN A and B and the anachelins belong to a large and diverse siderophore family widespread throughout the Rhizobium/Agrobacterium group, α-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Pin1 and Par14 peptidyl prolyl isomerase inhibitors block cell proliferation Abstract: Disruption of the parvulin family peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 gene delays reentry into the cell cycle when quiescent primary mouse embryo fibroblasts are stimulated with serum. Since Pin1 regulates cell cycle progression, a Pin1 inhibitor would be expected to block cell proliferation. To identify such inhibitors, we screened a chemical compound library for molecules that inhibited human Pin1 PPIase activity in vitro. We found a set of compounds that inhibited Pin1 PPIase activity in vitro with low microM IC50s and inhibited the growth of several cancer lines. Among the inhibitors, PiB, diethyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydro-1,3,6,8-tetraoxobenzo[lmn] phenanthroline-2,7-diacetate ethyl 1,3,6,8-tetrahydro-1,3,6,8-tetraoxo-benzo[lmn] phenanthroline-(2H,7H)-diacetate, had the least nonspecific toxicity. These results suggest that Pin1 inhibitors could be used as a novel type of anticancer drug that acts by blocking cell cycle progression.	0
Title: Panclicins, novel pancreatic lipase inhibitors. II. Structural elucidation Abstract: Panclicins A-E are novel and potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors produced by Streptomyces sp. NR 0619. Their structures have been elucidated based on NMR and FAB-MS experiments. The relative configurations have also been determined by NMR experiments. The absolute stereochemistry has been determined by the chiral HPLC analysis of the hydrolysates of panclicins A and B and by modified Mosher's method on a derivative of panclicin A. They are structurally related to beta-lactone esterase inhibitors of microbial origin, lipstatin, valilactone, ebelactones and esterastin. Panclicins also contain a beta-lactone structure with two alkyl chains, one of which has an N-formylalanyloxy or N-formylglycyloxy substituent.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling, filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. Here we report the 8,667,507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism, containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium. The 7,825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites. The genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes, predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses, and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development, a unique situation for a bacterium. An ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the RNA polymerase inhibitor streptolydigin in Streptomyces lydicus: tailoring modification of 3-methyl-aspartate Abstract: The asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase-like SlgZ and methyltransferase SlgM enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid streptolydigin in Streptomyces lydicus. Inactivation of slgZ led to a novel streptolydigin derivative. Overexpression of slgZ, slgM, or both in S. lydicus led to a considerable increase in streptolydigin production.	1
Title: The fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri produces holomycin and uses an RNA methyltransferase for self-resistance Abstract: Holomycin and its derivatives belong to a class of broad-spectrum antibacterial natural products containing a rare dithiolopyrrolone heterobicyclic scaffold. The antibacterial mechanism of dithiolopyrrolone compounds has been attributed to the inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase activities, although the exact mode of action has not been established in vitro. Some dithiopyrrolone derivatives display potent anticancer activities. Recently the biosynthetic gene cluster of holomycin has been identified and characterized in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Here we report that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri is a holomycin producer, as evidenced through genome mining, chemical isolation, and structural elucidation as well as genetic manipulation. We also identified a unique regulatory gene hom15 at one end of the gene cluster encoding a cold-shock-like protein that likely regulates the production of holomycin in low cultivation temperatures. Inactivation of hom15 resulted in a significant loss of holomycin production. Finally, gene disruption of an RNA methyltransferase gene hom12 resulted in the sensitivity of the mutant toward holomycin. A complementation experiment of hom12 restored the resistance against holomycin. Although the wild-type Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold is susceptible to holomycin, the mutant harboring hom12 showed tolerance toward holomycin. High resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-ESI/MS analysis of digested RNA fragments demonstrated that the wild-type Y. ruckeri and E. coli harboring hom12 contain a methylated RNA fragment, whereas the mutated Y. ruckeri and the wild-type E. coli only contain normal non-methylated RNA fragments. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that this putative RNA methyltransferase Hom12 is the self-resistance protein that methylates the RNA of Y. ruckeri to reduce the cytotoxic effect of holomycin during holomycin production.	1
Title: Functional analysis of genes involved in the synthesis of syringolin A by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301 D-R Abstract: Strains of the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae secrete a family of structurally closely related peptide derivatives dubbed syringolins, of which syringolin A is the major variant. The function of syringolins in the interaction of P. syringae pv. syringae with their host plants presently is unknown. It is hypothesized that they may constitute virulence factors. However, syringolins are determinants recognized and reacted to by nonhost plant species, and syringolin A has been shown to induce hypersensitive death of cells colonized by powdery mildew in wheat and, thus, to reprogram a compatible interaction into an incompatible one. Syringolin A is an unusual derivative of a tripeptide that contains a 12-membered ring consisting of the amino acids 5-methyl-4-amino-2-hexenoic acid and 3,4-dehydrolysine, two nonproteinogenic amino acids. Here we report the cloning, sequencing, and analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of syringolin A. The genes encode proteins consisting of modules typical for nonribosomal peptide synthetases and type I polyketide synthetases, as well as proteins likely involved in the transcriptional regulation of syringolin A biosynthesis and in syringolin A export. The structure and arrangement of the modules lead to the formulation of a model explaining the synthesis of the tripeptide, including the formation of the two nonproteinogenic amino acids in the ring structure of syringolin A.	1
Title: The structure of manumycin. I. Characterization, structure elucidation and biological activity Abstract: Manumycin (1), produced by Streptomyces parvulus (strain Tü 64), was isolated from the mycelium by extraction with acetone and could easily be purified chromatographically. Chemical degradation of 1 (C31H38N2O7) gave 2-acetamino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (2) by acetolysis, 2,4,6-trimethyl-2,4-decadienoic acid (3) by alkaline hydrolysis, and 2-(2,4,6-trimethyl-2,4-decadienoylamino)-5,6-epoxy-1,4-benzoquinon e (5) by chromic acid oxidation. In connection with a detailed spectroscopic analysis, the structure of 1 could be elucidated and the (E)-configuration of the double bonds in the triene and diene chain was established. Manumycin exhibits biological activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi and furthermore, an inhibition of the developmental processes of some insects.	0
Title: Biosynthesis, Synthesis, and Activities of Barnesin A, a NRPS-PKS Hybrid Produced by an Anaerobic Epsilonproteobacterium Abstract: Despite the wealth of physiological knowledge and plentiful genomes available, only few natural products of anaerobic bacteria have been identified until today and even less have been linked to their biosynthetic gene cluster. Here, we analyzed a unique NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from an anaerobic Epsilonproteobacterium ( Sulfurospirillum barnesii). Phylogenetic analysis of key biosynthetic genes, gene expression studies, and comparative metabolomics resulted in the identification of the first anoxically biosynthesized NRPS-PKS hybrid metabolite: a lipo-dipeptide with a vinylogous side chain, called barnesin A. The absolute structure was verified by a modular total synthesis, and barnesin and derivatives were found to have antimicrobial activity, as well as selective and nanomolar inhibitory activity, against pharmacological important cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B.	1
Title: Molecular analysis of a beta-lactam resistance gene encoded within the cephamycin gene cluster of Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A Streptomyces clavuligerus gene (designated pcbR) which is located immediately downstream from the gene encoding isopenicillin N synthase in the cephamycin gene cluster was characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis and database searching of PcbR identified a significant similarity between PcbR and proteins belonging to the family of high-molecular-weight group B penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Eight of nine boxes (motifs) conserved within this family of proteins are present in the PcbR protein sequence in the same order and with approximately the same spacing between them. When a mutant disrupted in pcbR was constructed by gene replacement, the resulting pcbR mutant exhibited a significant decrease in its resistance to benzylpenicillin and cephalosporins, indicating that pcbR is involved in beta-lactam resistance in this organism. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of S. clavuligerus cell membranes using PcbR-specific antibodies suggested that PcbR is a membrane protein. PcbR was also present in cell membranes when expressed in Escherichia coli and was able to bind radioactive penicillin in a PBP assay, suggesting that PcbR is a PBP. When genomic DNAs from several actinomycetes were probed with pcbR, hybridization was observed to some but not all beta-lactam-producing actinomycetes.	1
Title: Improvement of thermotolerance in Lachancea thermotolerans using a bacterial selection pressure Abstract: The use of thermotolerant yeast strains is an important attribute for a cost-effective high temperature biofermentation processes. However, the availability of thermotolerant yeast strains remains a major challenge. Isolation of temperature resistant strains from extreme environments or the improvements of current strains are two major strategies known to date. We hypothesised that bacteria are potential "hurdles" in the life cycle of yeasts, which could influence the evolution of extreme phenotypes, such as thermotolerance. We subjected a wild-type yeast, Lachancea thermotolerans to six species of bacteria sequentially for several generations. After coevolution, we observed that three replicate lines of yeasts grown in the presence of bacteria grew up to 37 °C whereas the controls run in parallel without bacteria could only grow poorly at 35 °C retaining the ancestral mesophilic trait. In addition to improvement of thermotolerance, our results show that the fermentative ability was also elevated, making the strains more ideal for the alcoholic fermentation process because the overall productivity and ethanol titers per unit volume of substrate consumed during the fermentation process was increased. Our unique method is attractive for the development of thermotolerant strains or to augment the available strain development approaches for high temperature industrial biofermentation.	0
Title: The type III protein secretion system contributes to Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri biofilm formation Abstract: Background:                       Several bacterial plant pathogens colonize their hosts through the secretion of effector proteins by a Type III protein secretion system (T3SS). The role of T3SS in bacterial pathogenesis is well established but whether this system is involved in multicellular processes, such as bacterial biofilm formation has not been elucidated. Here, the phytopathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) was used as a model to gain further insights about the role of the T3SS in biofilm formation.                  Results:                       The capacity of biofilm formation of different X. citri T3SS mutants was compared to the wild type strain and it was observed that this secretion system was necessary for this process. Moreover, the T3SS mutants adhered proficiently to leaf surfaces but were impaired in leaf-associated growth. A proteomic study of biofilm cells showed that the lack of the T3SS causes changes in the expression of proteins involved in metabolic processes, energy generation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production and bacterial motility as well as outer membrane proteins. Furthermore, EPS production and bacterial motility were also altered in the T3SS mutants.                  Conclusions:                       Our results indicate a novel role for T3SS in X. citri in the modulation of biofilm formation. Since this process increases X. citri virulence, this study reveals new functions of T3SS in pathogenesis.	0
Title: Expanding the binding envelope of CYP51 inhibitors targeting Trypanosoma cruzi with 4-aminopyridyl-based sulfonamide derivatives Abstract: Chagas disease is a chronic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, manifested in progressive cardiomyopathy and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therapeutic options to prevent or treat Chagas disease are limited. CYP51, the enzyme key to the biosynthesis of eukaryotic membrane sterols, is a validated drug target in both fungi and T. cruzi. Sulfonamide derivatives of 4-aminopyridyl-based inhibitors of T. cruzi CYP51 (TcCYP51), including the sub-nanomolar compound 3, have molecular structures distinct from other validated CYP51 inhibitors. They augment the biologically relevant chemical space of molecules targeting TcCYP51. In a 2.08 Å X-ray structure, TcCYP51 is in a conformation that has been influenced by compound 3 and is distinct from the previously characterized ground-state conformation of CYP51 drug-target complexes. That the binding site was modulated in response to an incoming inhibitor for the first time characterizes TcCYP51 as a flexible target rather than a rigid template.	0
Title: Metabologenomics: Correlation of Microbial Gene Clusters with Metabolites Drives Discovery of a Nonribosomal Peptide with an Unusual Amino Acid Monomer Abstract: For more than half a century the pharmaceutical industry has sifted through natural products produced by microbes, uncovering new scaffolds and fashioning them into a broad range of vital drugs. We sought a strategy to reinvigorate the discovery of natural products with distinctive structures using bacterial genome sequencing combined with metabolomics. By correlating genetic content from 178 actinomycete genomes with mass spectrometry-enabled analyses of their exported metabolomes, we paired new secondary metabolites with their biosynthetic gene clusters. We report the use of this new approach to isolate and characterize tambromycin, a new chlorinated natural product, composed of several nonstandard amino acid monomeric units, including a unique pyrrolidine-containing amino acid we name tambroline. Tambromycin shows antiproliferative activity against cancerous human B- and T-cell lines. The discovery of tambromycin via large-scale correlation of gene clusters with metabolites (a.k.a. metabologenomics) illuminates a path for structure-based discovery of natural products at a sharply increased rate.	1
Title: The trichothecene biosynthesis gene cluster of Fusarium graminearum F15 contains a limited number of essential pathway genes and expressed non-essential genes Abstract: We report for the first time the complete structure and sequence of the trichothecene biosynthesis gene cluster (i.e. Tri5-cluster) from Fusarium graminearum F15, a strain that produces 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON). A putative tyrosinase and polysaccharide deacetylase gene flank the Tri5-cluster: the number of pathway genes between them is less than half the total number of steps necessary for 3-ADON biosynthesis. In comparison with partial Tri5-cluster sequences of strains with 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol and 4-acetylnivalenol chemotypes, the Tri5-cluster from strain F15 contains three genes that are apparently unnecessary for the biosynthesis of 3-ADON (i.e. Tri8 and Tri3, which are expressed, and pseudo-Tri13, which is not expressed). In addition, the Tri7 gene was missing from the cluster. Recombinant TRI3 protein showed limited trichothecene C-15 acetylase activity. In contrast, recombinant TRI8 protein displayed no C-3 deacetylase activity, suggesting that the loss or alteration of function contribute directly to the chemotype difference.	1
Title: A peptide ligase and the ribosome cooperate to synthesize the peptide pheganomycin Abstract: Peptide antibiotics are typically biosynthesized by one of two distinct machineries in a ribosome-dependent or ribosome-independent manner. Pheganomycin (PGM (1)) and related analogs consist of the nonproteinogenic amino acid (S)-2-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl)phenyl-2-guanidinoacetic acid (2) and a proteinogenic core peptide, making their origin uncertain. We report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cirratus responsible for PGM production. Unexpectedly, the cluster contains a gene encoding multiple precursor peptides along with several genes plausibly encoding enzymes for the synthesis of amino acid 2. We identified PGM1, which has an ATP-grasp domain, as potentially capable of linking the precursor peptides with 2, and validate this hypothesis using deletion mutants and in vitro reconstitution. We document PGM1's substrate permissivity, which could be rationalized by a large binding pocket as confirmed via structural and mutagenesis experiments. This is to our knowledge the first example of cooperative peptide synthesis achieved by ribosomes and peptide ligases using a peptide nucleophile.	1
Title: Organization of the genes encoding the biosynthesis of actagardine and engineering of a variant generation system Abstract: The biosynthetic pathway of the type B lantibiotic actagardine (formerly gardimycin), produced by Actinoplanes garbadinensis ATCC31049, has been cloned, sequenced and annotated. The gene cluster contains the gene garA that encodes the actagardine prepropeptide, a modification gene garM, involved in the dehydration and cyclization of the prepeptide, several putative transporter and regulatory genes as well as a novel luciferase-like monooxygenase gene designated garO. Expression of these genes in Streptomyces lividans resulted in the production of ala(0)-actagardine while deletion of the garA gene from A. garbadinensis generated a strain incapable of producing actagardine. Actagardine production was successfully restored however, by the delivery of the plasmid pAGvarX. This plasmid contains an engineered cassette of the actagardine encoding gene garA and offers an alternative route to generating extensive libraries of actagardine variants. Using this plasmid, an alanine scanning library has been constructed and the mutants analysed. Further modifications include the removal of the novel garO gene from A. garbadinensis. Deletion of this gene resulted in the production of deoxy variants of actagardine, demonstrating that the formation of the sulfoxide group is enzyme catalysed and not a spontaneous chemical modification as previously believed.	1
Title: Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis Abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reproducibly associated ∼40 susceptibility loci with psoriasis. However, the missing heritability is evident and the contributions of coding variants have not yet been systematically evaluated. Here, we present a large-scale whole-exome array analysis for psoriasis consisting of 42,760 individuals. We discover 16 SNPs within 15 new genes/loci associated with psoriasis, including C1orf141, ZNF683, TMC6, AIM2, IL1RL1, CASR, SON, ZFYVE16, MTHFR, CCDC129, ZNF143, AP5B1, SYNE2, IFNGR2 and 3q26.2-q27 (P<5.00 × 10(-08)). In addition, we also replicate four known susceptibility loci TNIP1, NFKBIA, IL12B and LCE3D-LCE3E. These susceptibility variants identified in the current study collectively account for 1.9% of the psoriasis heritability. The variant within AIM2 is predicted to impact protein structure. Our findings increase the number of genetic risk factors for psoriasis and highlight new and plausible biological pathways in psoriasis.	0
Title: The neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233: characterisation of an aminotransferase involved in the formation of 2-deoxystreptamine Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin has been cloned for the first time by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233. Sequence analysis has identified 21 putative open reading frames (ORFs) in the neomycin gene cluster (neo) with significant protein sequence similarity to gene products involved in the biosynthesis of other DOS-containing aminoglycosides, namely butirosin (btr), gentamycin (gnt), tobramycin (tbm) and kanamycin (kan). Located at the 5'-end of the neo gene cluster is the previously-characterised neomycin phosphotransferase gene (apH). Three genes unique to the neo and btr clusters have been revealed by comparison of the neo cluster to btr, gnt, tbm and kan clusters. This suggests that these three genes may be involved in the transfer of a ribose moiety to the DOS ring during the antibiotic biosynthesis. The product of the neo-6 gene is characterised here as the L-glutamine : 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose aminotransferase responsible for the first transamination in DOS biosynthesis, which supports the assignment of the gene cluster.	1
Title: N-3 PUFA Deficiency Aggravates Streptozotocin-Induced Pancreatic Injury in Mice but Dietary Supplementation with DHA/EPA Protects the Pancreas via Suppressing Inflammation, Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis Abstract: It has been reported that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) exert therapeutic potential for the preservation of functional β-cell mass. However, the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency on pancreatic injury and whether the supplementation of n-3 PUFA could prevent the development of pancreatic injury are still not clear. In the present study, an n-3 PUFA deficiency mouse model was established by feeding them with n-3 PUFA deficiency diets for 30 days. Results showed that n-3 PUFA deficiency aggravated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced pancreas injury by reducing the insulin level by 18.21% and the HOMA β-cell indices by 31.13% and the area of islet by 52.58% compared with the STZ group. Moreover, pre-intervention with DHA and EPA for 15 days could alleviate STZ-induced pancreas damage by increasing the insulin level by 55.26% and 44.33%, the HOMA β-cell indices by 118.81% and 157.26% and reversed the area of islet by 196.75% and 205.57% compared to the n-3 Def group, and the effects were significant compared to γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) treatment. The possible underlying mechanisms indicated that EPA and DHA significantly reduced the ration of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA and then inhibited oxidative stress, inflammation and islet β-cell apoptosis levels in pancreas tissue. The results might provide insights into the prevention and alleviation of pancreas injury by dietary intervention with PUFAs and provide a theoretical basis for their application in functional foods.	0
Title: Identification of a gene cluster for biosynthesis of mannosylerythritol lipids in the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis Abstract: Many microorganisms produce surface-active substances that enhance the availability of water-insoluble substrates. Although many of these biosurfactants have interesting potential applications, very little is known about their biosynthesis. The basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis secretes large amounts of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) under conditions of nitrogen starvation. We recently described a putative glycosyltransferase, Emt1, which is essential for MEL biosynthesis and whose expression is strongly induced by nitrogen limitation. We used DNA microarray analysis to identify additional genes involved in MEL biosynthesis. Here we show that emt1 is part of a gene cluster which comprises five open reading frames. Three of the newly identified proteins, Mac1, Mac2, and Mat1, contain short sequence motifs characteristic for acyl- and acetyltransferases. Mutational analysis revealed that Mac1 and Mac2 are essential for MEL production, which suggests that they are involved in the acylation of mannosylerythritol. Deletion of mat1 resulted in the secretion of completely deacetylated MELs, as determined by mass spectrometry. We overexpressed Mat1 in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that this enzyme acts as an acetyl coenzyme A-dependent acetyltransferase. Remarkably, Mat1 displays relaxed regioselectivity and is able to acetylate mannosylerythritol at both the C-4 and C-6 hydroxyl groups. Based on these results, we propose a biosynthesis pathway for the generation of mannosylerythritol lipids in U. maydis.	1
Title: Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe thi4, a thiamine biosynthetic gene Abstract: thi4 mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe exhibit defective thiamine biosynthesis, and thi4 mutations define a gene which is believed to be involved in the phosphorylation of 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine or 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole and/or in the coupling of the two phosphorylated precursors to thiamine monophosphate (A. M. Schweingruber, J. Dlugonski, E. Edenharter, and M. E. Schweingruber, Curr. Genet. 19:249-254, 1991). The thi4 gene was cloned by functional complementation of a thi4 mutant and physically mapped on the left arm of chromosome I close to the genetic marker gln1. The thi4-carrying DNA fragment shows an open reading frame encoding a protein of 518 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 55.6 kDa. The appearance of thi4 mRNA is strongly repressed by thiamine and to a lesser extent by 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole. thi4 mRNA production is under the control of the thi1 gene-encoded transcription factor and of the negative regulators encoded by genes tnr1, tnr2, and tnr3. thi4 is expressed and regulated in manners similar to those of other S. pombe genes involved in thiamine metabolism, including thi2, thi3, and pho4.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T (DSM 10154) consists of d-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fucp3NAc). Thymidine diphosphate-activated d-Fucp3NAc serves as precursor for the assembly of structural polysaccharides in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-d-galactose (dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc) involves five enzymes. The first two steps of the reaction are catalyzed by enzymes that are part of the well studied dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, namely d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB). The enzymes catalyzing the last three synthesis reactions have not been characterized biochemically so far. These steps include an isomerase, a transaminase, and a transacetylase. We identified all five genes involved by chromosome walking in the Gram-positive organism A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T and overexpressed the three new enzymes heterologously in Escherichia coli. The activities of these enzymes were monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the intermediate products formed were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis. Alignment of the newly identified proteins with known sequences revealed that the elucidated pathway in this Gram-positive organism may also be valid in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative organisms. The key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc has been identified as an isomerase, which converts the 4-keto educt into the 3-keto product, with concomitant epimerization at C-4 to produce a 6-deoxy-d-xylo configuration. This is the first report of the functional characterization of the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc and description of a novel type of isomerase capable of synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-3-ulose from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose.	1
Title: In Situ Single-Cell Western Blot on Adherent Cell Culture Abstract: Integrating 2D culture of adherent mammalian cells with single-cell western blotting (in situ scWB) uses microfluidic design to eliminate the requirement for trypsin release of cells to suspension, prior to single-cell isolation and protein analysis. To assay HeLa cells from an attached starting state, we culture adherent cells in fibronectin-functionalized microwells formed in a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel. To integrate the culture, lysis, and assay workflow, we introduce a one-step copolymerization process that creates protein-decorated microwells. After single-cell culture, we lyse each cell in the microwell and perform western blotting on each resultant lysate. We observe cell spreading after overnight microwell-based culture. scWB reports increased phosphorylation of MAP kinases (ERK1/2, p38) under hypertonic conditions. We validate the in situ scWB with slab-gel western blot, while revealing cell-to-cell heterogeneity in stress responses.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and incorporation of an alkylproline-derivative (APD) precursor into complex natural products Abstract: Covering: up to 2017This review covers the biosynthetic and evolutionary aspects of lincosamide antibiotics, antitumour pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) and the quorum-sensing molecule hormaomycin. These structurally and functionally diverse groups of complex natural products all incorporate rarely occurring 4-alkyl-l-proline derivatives (APDs) biosynthesized from l-tyrosine through an unusual specialized pathway catalysed by a common set of six proteins named Apd1-Apd6. We give an overview of APD formation, which involves unusual enzyme activities, and its incorporation, which is based either on nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PBDs, hormaomycin) or a unique hybrid ergothioneine-dependent condensation system followed by mycothiol-dependent sulphur atom incorporation (lincosamides). Furthermore, within the public databases, we identified 36 novel unannotated biosynthetic gene clusters that putatively encode the biosynthesis of APD compounds. Their products presumably include novel PBDs, but also novel classes of APD compounds, indicating an unprecedented potential for the diversity enhancement of these functionally versatile complex metabolites. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of known and novel gene clusters for the biosynthesis of APD compounds allowed us to infer novel evolutionary hypotheses: Apd3 methyltransferase originates from a duplication event in a hormaomycin biosynthetic gene cluster ancestor, while putative Apd5 isomerase is evolutionarily linked to PhzF protein from the biosynthesis of phenazines. Lastly, we summarize the achievements in preparing hybrid APD compounds by directing their biosynthesis, and we propose that the number of nature-like APD compounds could by multiplied by replacing l-proline residues in various groups of complex metabolites with APD, i.e. by imitating the natural process that occurs with lincosamides and PBDs, in which the replacement of l-proline for APD has proved to be an evolutionary successful concept.	1
Title: Divergence of multimodular polyketide synthases revealed by a didomain structure Abstract: The enoylreductase (ER) is the final common enzyme from modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to be structurally characterized. The 3.0 Å-resolution structure of the didomain comprising the ketoreductase (KR) and ER from the second module of the spinosyn PKS reveals that ER shares an ∼600-Å(2) interface with KR distinct from that of the related mammalian fatty acid synthase (FAS). In contrast to the ER domains of the mammalian FAS, the ER domains of the second module of the spinosyn PKS do not make contact across the two-fold axis of the synthase. This monomeric organization may have been necessary in the evolution of multimodular PKSs to enable acyl carrier proteins to access each of their cognate enzymes. The isolated ER domain showed activity toward a substrate analog, enabling us to determine the contributions of its active site residues.	0
Title: Benadrostin, new inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, produced by actinomycetes. II. Structure determination Abstract: Benadrostin, a new inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, has been isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces flavovirens MH499-O'F1. The structure of benadrostin was defined as 8-hydroxy-2H-1,3-benzoxazine-2,4-dione by an analysis of spectral properties and chemical studies of benadrostin and its derivatives.	0

Title: Complete sequence of pJIE186-2, a plasmid carrying multiple virulence factors from a sequence type 131 Escherichia coli O25 strain Abstract: The complete sequence of a 137-kb plasmid, pJIE186-2, from a sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli strain was determined. pJIE186-2 contained IncF replicons (FIB, FIIA, and FIAΔ), an incomplete conjugative region, and multiple virulence factors (sitABCD, iucABCD-iutA, iroCDEN, etsABC, hlyF, iss, ompT, and vagCD) but no antimicrobial resistance genes. The host strain also had another plasmid, pJIE186-1, carrying multiple resistance genes. The two plasmids conferred selective advantages for the host strain, contributing to the recent emergence of ST131 E. coli.	0
Title: Chlorinated metabolites from Streptomyces sp. highlight the role of biosynthetic mosaics and superclusters in the evolution of chemical diversity Abstract: LCMS-guided screening of a library of biosynthetically talented bacteria and fungi identified Streptomyces sp. MST- as a prolific producer of chlorinated metabolites. We isolated and characterised six new and nine reported compounds from MST-, belonging to three discrete classes - the depsipeptide svetamycins, the indolocarbazole borregomycins and the aromatic polyketide anthrabenzoxocinones. Following genome sequencing of MST-, we describe, for the first time, the svetamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (sve), its mosaic structure and its relationship to several distantly related gene clusters. Our analysis of the sve cluster suggested that the reported stereostructures of the svetamycins may be incorrect. This was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, allowing us to formally revise the absolute configurations of svetamycins A-G. We also show that the borregomycins and anthrabenzoxocinones are encoded by a single supercluster (bab) implicating superclusters as potential nucleation points for the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters. These clusters highlight how individual enzymes and functional subclusters can be co-opted during the formation of biosynthetic gene clusters, providing a rare insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underpinning the evolution of chemical diversity.	1
Title: Tailoring modification of deoxysugars during biosynthesis of the antitumour drug chromomycin A by Streptomyces griseus ssp. griseus Abstract: Chromomycin A3 is a member of the aureolic acid group family of antitumour drugs. Three tailoring modification steps occur during its biosynthesis affecting the sugar moieties: two O-acetylations and one O-methylation. The 4-O-methylation in the 4-O-methyl-D-oliose moiety of the disaccharide chain is catalysed by the cmmMIII gene product. Inactivation of this gene generated a chromomycin-non-producing mutant that accumulated three unmethylated derivatives containing all sugars but differing in the acylation pattern. Two of these compounds were shown to be substrates of the methyltransferase as determined by their bioconversion into chromomycin A2 and A3 after feeding these compounds to a Streptomyces albus strain expressing the cmmMIII gene. The same single membrane-bound enzyme, encoded by the cmmA gene, is responsible for both acetyl transfer reactions, which convert a relatively inactive compound into the bioactive chromomycin A3. Insertional inactivation of this gene resulted in a mutant accumulating a dideacetylated chromomycin A3 derivative. This compound, lacking both acetyl groups, was converted in a two-step reaction via the 4E-monoacetylated intermediate into chromomycin A3 when fed to cultures of S. albus expressing the cmmA gene. This acetylation step would occur as the last step in chromomycin biosynthesis, being a very important event for self-protection of the producing organism. It would convert a molecule with low biological activity into an active one, in a reaction catalysed by an enzyme that is predicted to be located in the cell membrane.	1
Title: Kinetics of two-electron oxidations by the compound I derivative of chloroperoxidase, a model for cytochrome P450 oxidants Abstract: [structure: see text] Rate constants for two-electron oxidation reactions of Compound I from chloroperoxidase (CPO) with a variety of substrates were measured by stopped-flow kinetic techniques. The thiolate ligand of CPO Compound I activates the iron-oxo species with the result that oxidation reactions are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than oxidations by model iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin radical cations containing weaker binding counterions.	0
Title: Slow calcium-dependent inactivation of depletion-activated calcium current. Store-dependent and -independent mechanisms Abstract: Feedback regulation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels was studied in Jurkat leukemic T lymphocytes using whole cell recording and [Ca2+]i measurement techniques. CRAC channels were activated by passively depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under conditions of moderate intracellular Ca2+ buffering, elevating [Ca2+]o to 22 mM initiated an inward current through CRAC channels that declined slowly with a half-time of approximately 30 s. This slow inactivation was evoked by a rise in [Ca2+]i, as it was effectively suppressed by an elevated level of EFTA in the recording pipette that prevented increases in [Ca2+]i. Blockade of Ca2+ uptake into stores by thapsigargin with or without intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate reduced the extent of slow inactivation by approximately 50%, indicating that store refilling normally contributes significantly to this process. The store-independent (thapsigargin-insensitive) portion of slow inactivation was largely prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and by a structurally related compound, 1-norokadaone, but not by calyculin A nor by cyclosporin A and FK506 at concentrations that fully inhibit calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) in T cells. These results argue against the involvement of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B, or 3 in store-independent inactivation. We conclude that calcium acts through at least two slow negative feedback pathways to inhibit CRAC channels. Slow feedback inhibition of CRAC current is likely to play important roles in controlling the duration and dynamic behavior of receptor-generated Ca2+ signals.	0
Title: Nature's Combinatorial Biosynthesis Produces Vatiamides A-F Abstract: Hybrid type I PKS/NRPS biosynthetic pathways typically proceed in a collinear manner wherein one molecular building block is enzymatically incorporated in a sequence that corresponds to gene arrangement. In this work, genome mining combined with the use of a fluorogenic azide-based click probe led to the discovery and characterization of vatiamides A-F, three structurally diverse alkynylated lipopeptides, and their brominated analogues, from the cyanobacterium Moorea producens ASI16Jul14-2. These derive from a unique combinatorial non-collinear PKS/NRPS system encoded by a 90 kb gene cluster in which an upstream PKS cassette interacts with three separate cognate NRPS partners. This is facilitated by a series of promiscuous intermodule PKS-NRPS docking motifs possessing identical amino acid sequences. This interaction confers a new type of combinatorial capacity for creating molecular diversity in microbial systems.	1
Title: Aryl-aldehyde formation in fungal polyketides: discovery and characterization of a distinct biosynthetic mechanism Abstract: Aryl-aldehydes are a common feature in fungal polyketides, which are considered to be exclusively generated by the R domain of nonreducing polyketide synthases (NR-PKSs). However, by cloning and heterologous expression of both cryptic NR-PKS and nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-like genes from Aspergillus terreus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a distinct mechanism for aryl-aldehyde formation in which a NRPS-like protein activates and reduces an aryl-acid produced by the accompanying NR-PKS to an aryl-aldehyde. Bioinformatics study indicates that such a mechanism may be widely used throughout the fungi kingdom.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of thiolutin, a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor, in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137 Abstract: In this study, a new dithiolopyrrolone biosynthetic pathway was identified in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137, which was reported to produce a variety of dithiolopyrrolone natural products including thiolutin, a potential drug candidate for tumor angiogenesis inhibition. Bioinformatics analysis of the cluster revealed that it contains all the essential genes for holothin core biosynthesis and several other auxiliary genes. Interestingly, heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces albus only induced the production of holomycin, implying that the gene responsible for the N4-methylation and the gene(s) involved in the formation of various acylated chains on N7 position of the holothin may locate outside the gene cluster. Incubation of holomycin with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the cell-free extract of Sa. algeriensis resulted in the production of thiolutin, suggesting that the N4-methyl group of thiolutin is originated from SAM, and the N4-methylation could be in the late stage of biosynthesis of thiolutin type dithiolopyrrolones. An evolution-based model for biosynthesis of thiolutin and its analogs was further proposed based on these results.	1
Title: FACS-based selection of tandem tetracysteine peptides with improved ReAsH brightness in live cells Abstract: Non-perturbing and site-specific in vivo protein labeling methods are highly desired as they allow researchers to probe complex cellular functions. The biarsenical/tetracysteine labeling system allows in situ fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins which have been appended with small (12 amino acids) genetically encoded peptide tags. In this work we present the in vivo selection of semi-randomized tandem tetracysteine peptides with improved biarsenical (ReAsH) fluorescent brightness (~2-fold) relative to a single tetracysteine motif or rationally designed 3-fold tetracysteine repeat. We found that Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting by direct ReAsH excitation as opposed to FRET-mediated ReAsH excitation was optimal for selecting 3×Tetracysteine peptides with enhanced brightness. The selected multimer-tetracysteine peptides display enhanced properties due to higher order ReAsH/3×Tetracysteine dye stoichiometries as opposed to enhancement of the individual core tetracysteine photophysical properties. In summary, we have isolated new 3×Tetracysteine motifs with improved ReAsH brightness in live cells. These modular tags should provide enhanced contrast for live cell imaging applications where small tag size (~4.8 KDa) is a requisite for protein labeling.	0
Title: Identification of nocobactin NA biosynthetic gene clusters in Nocardia farcinica Abstract: We identified the biosynthetic gene clusters of the siderophore nocobactin NA. The nbt clusters, which were discovered as genes highly homologous to the mycobactin biosynthesis genes by the genomic sequencing of Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152, consist of 10 genes separately located at two genomic regions. The gene organization of the nbt clusters and the predicted functions of the nbt genes, particularly the cyclization and epimerization domains, were in good agreement with the chemical structure of nocobactin NA. Disruptions of the nbtA and nbtE genes, respectively, reduced and abolished the productivity of nocobactin NA. The heterologous expression of the nbtS gene revealed that this gene encoded a salicylate synthase. These results indicate that the nbt clusters are responsible for the biosynthesis of nocobactin NA. We also found putative IdeR-binding sequences upstream of the nbtA, -G, -H, -S, and -T genes, whose expression was more than 10-fold higher in the low-iron condition than in the high-iron condition. These results suggest that nbt genes are regulated coordinately by IdeR protein in an iron-dependent manner. The ΔnbtE mutant was found to be impaired in cytotoxicity against J774A.1 cells, suggesting that nocobactin NA production is required for virulence of N. farcinica.	1
Title: Cloning and identification of saprolmycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. TK08046 Abstract: Saprolmycins A-E are anti-Saprolegnia parasitica antibiotics. To identify the gene cluster for saprolmycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. TK08046, polymerase chain reaction using aromatase and cyclase gene-specific primers was performed; the spr gene cluster, which codes for angucycline biosynthesis, was obtained from the strain. The cluster consists of 36 open reading frames, including minimal polyketide synthase, ketoreductase, aromatase, cyclase, oxygenase, and deoxy sugar biosynthetic genes, as defined by homology to the corresponding genes of the urdamycin, Sch-47554, and grincamycin biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces fradiae, Streptomyces sp. SCC-2136, and Streptomyces lusitanus, respectively. To establish the function of the gene cluster, an expression cosmid vector containing all 36 open reading frames was introduced into Streptomyces lividans TK23. The transformant was confirmed to express the biosynthetic genes and produce saprolmycins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the extract.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of biosurfactant production in Ustilago maydis Abstract: The dimorphic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis produces large amounts of surface-active compounds under conditions of nitrogen starvation. These biosurfactants consist of derivatives of two classes of amphipathic glycolipids. Ustilagic acids are cellobiose lipids in which the disaccharide is O-glycosidically linked to 15,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid. Ustilipids are mannosylerythritol lipids derived from acylated beta-d-mannopyranosyl-d-erythritol. Whereas the chemical structure of these biosurfactants has been determined, the genetic basis for their biosynthesis and regulation is largely unknown. Here we report the first identification of two genes, emt1 and cyp1, that are essential for the production of fungal extracellular glycolipids. emt1 is required for mannosylerythritol lipid production and codes for a protein with similarity to prokaryotic glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of macrolide antibiotics. We suggest that Emt1 catalyzes the synthesis of mannosyl-d-erythritol by transfer of GDP-mannose. Deletion of the gene cyp1 resulted in complete loss of ustilagic acid production. Cyp1 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase which is highly related to a family of plant fatty acid hydroxylases. Therefore we assume that Cyp1 is directly involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual 15,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid. We could show that mannosylerythritol lipid production is responsible for hemolytic activity on blood agar, whereas ustilagic acid secretion is required for long-range pheromone recognition. The mutants described here allow for the first time a genetic analysis of glycolipid production in fungi.	1
Title: Enzymatic polyketide chain branching to give substituted lactone, lactam, and glutarimide heterocycles Abstract: Polyketides typically result from head-to-tail condensation of acyl thioesters to produce highly functionalized linear chains. The biosynthesis of the phytotoxin rhizoxin, however, involves a polyketide synthase (PKS) module that introduces a δ-lactone chain branch through Michael addition of a malonyl extender to an α,β-unsaturated intermediate unit. To evaluate the scope of the branching module, polyketide mimics were synthesized and their biotransformation by the reconstituted PKS module from the Rhizopus symbiont Burkholderia rhizoxinica was monitored in vitro. The impact of the type and configuration of the δ-substituents was probed and it was found that amino-substituted surrogates yield the corresponding lactams. A carboxamide analogue was transformed into a glutarimide unit, which can be found in many natural products. Our findings illuminate the biosynthesis of glutarimide-bearing polyketides and also demonstrate the utility of this branching module for synthetic biology.	1
Title: From genetic diversity to metabolic unity: studies on the biosynthesis of aurafurones and aurafuron-like structures in myxobacteria and streptomycetes Abstract: The myxobacterial polyketide secondary metabolites aurafuron A and B were identified by genome mining in the myxobacterial strain Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1. The compounds contain an unusual furanone moiety and resemble metabolites isolated from soil-dwelling and marine actinobacteria, a fungus and mollusks. We describe here the cloning and functional analysis of the aurafuron biosynthetic gene cluster, including site-directed mutagenesis and feeding studies using labeled precursors. The polyketide core of the aurafurones is assembled by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS). As with many such systems described from myxobacteria, the aurafuron PKS exhibits a number of unusual features, including the apparent iterative use of a module, redundant modules and domains, a trans acting dehydratase and the absence of a terminal thioesterase domain. Four oxidoreductases are encoded within the gene locus, some of which likely participate in formation of the furanone moiety via a Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation. Indeed, inactivation of a gene encoding a cytochrome P(450) monooxygenase completely abolished production of both compounds. We also compare the complete gene locus to biosynthetic gene clusters from two Streptomyces sp., which produce close structural analogues of the aurafurones. A portion of the post-PKS biosynthetic machinery is strikingly similar in all three cases, in contrast to the PKS genes, which are highly divergent. Phylogenetic analysis of the ketosynthase domains further indicates that the PKSs have developed independently (polyphyletically) during evolution. These findings point to a currently unknown but important biological function of aurafuron-like compounds for the producing organisms.	1
Title: The lantibiotic NAI-107 binds to bactoprenol-bound cell wall precursors and impairs membrane functions Abstract: The lantibiotic NAI-107 is active against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. To identify the molecular basis of its potency, we studied the mode of action in a series of whole cell and in vitro assays and analyzed structural features by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The lantibiotic efficiently interfered with late stages of cell wall biosynthesis and induced accumulation of the soluble peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) in the cytoplasm. Using membrane preparations and a complete cascade of purified, recombinant late stage peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes (MraY, MurG, FemX, PBP2) and their respective purified substrates, we showed that NAI-107 forms complexes with bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled precursors of the bacterial cell wall. Titration experiments indicate that first a 1:1 stoichiometric complex occurs, which then transforms into a 2:1 (peptide: lipid II) complex, when excess peptide is added. Furthermore, lipid II and related molecules obviously could not serve as anchor molecules for the formation of defined and stable nisin-like pores, however, slow membrane depolarization was observed after NAI-107 treatment, which could contribute to killing of the bacterial cell.	1
Title: Distribution and blood-to-milk transfer of labeled antibiotics Abstract: RADIOACTIVITY DISTRIBUTION WAS DETERMINED IN SERUM AND MILK OF LACTATING EWES AFTER PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION OF FIVE LABELED ANTIBIOTICS: (14)C-benzylpenicillin G, (3)H-dihydrostreptomycin, (3)H-tetracycline, (14)C-chloramphenicol, and (14)C-spiramycin. Antibiotic levels were measured simultaneously by microbiological assay. Radiochemical and microbiological assay procedures presented similar kinetic patterns for uptake in serum and penetration into milk, except for tetracycline. Small reductions in milk pH markedly increased the excretion of spiramycin and slightly influenced the milk passage of penicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, and tetracycline but did not alter the transfer of chloramphenicol into milk. Thus, it appears that the five antibiotics penetrate milk in accordance with the nonionic passive diffusion principle, and that good agreement is achieved between the calculated and observed milk/serum ultrafiltrate concentration ratios obtained during equilibrium.	0
Title: Isolation, structures, and antifungal activities of new aureobasidins Abstract: Aureobasidins are a group of cyclic depsipeptides with antifungal activity and are produced by Aureobasidium pullulans. Aureobasidins are composed of eight amino acids and one hydroxy acid such as 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid (Hmp), and highly lipophilic. Five new aureobasidins, S1, S2a, S2b, S3 and S4, which have higher hydrophilicity in reversed phase HPLC than the known aureobasidins A-R, were discovered in a fermentation broth of A. pullulans R106 by means of on-line liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. We identified the structures of the compounds and studied their antifungal activities. Three of the new aureobasidins, S2b, S3 and S4, which have hydroxylated Hmp as the hydroxy acid, were highly active against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans.	0
Title: Heterologous expression, purification, reconstitution and kinetic analysis of an extended type II polyketide synthase Abstract: Background:                       Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are bacterial multienzyme systems that synthesize a broad range of natural products. The 'minimal' PKS consists of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein and a malonyl transferase. Auxiliary components (ketoreductases, aromatases and cyclases are involved in controlling the oxidation level and cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain. We describe the heterologous expression and reconstitution of several auxiliary PKS components including the actinorhodin ketoreductase (act KR), the griseusin aromatase/cyclase (gris ARO/CYC), and the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase (tcm ARO/CYC).                  Results:                       The polyketide products of reconstituted act and tcm PKSs were identical to those identified in previous in vivo studies. Although stable protein-protein interactions were not detected between minimal and auxiliary PKS components, kinetic analysis revealed that the extended PKS comprised of the act minimal PKS, the act KR and the gris ARO/CYC had a higher turnover number than the act minimal PKS plus the act KR or the act minimal PKS alone. Adding the tcm ARO/CYC to the tcm minimal PKS also increased the overall rate.                  Conclusions:                       Until recently the principal strategy for functional analysis of PKS subunits was through heterologous expression of recombinant PKSs in Streptomyces. Our results corroborate the implicit assumption that the product isolated from whole-cell systems is the dominant product of the PKS. They also suggest that an intermediate is channeled between the various subunits, and pave the way for more detailed structural and mechanistic analysis of these multienzyme systems.	0
Title: Copper-catalyzed oxidative homo- and cross-coupling of Grignard reagents using diaziridinone Abstract: Transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are among the most powerful synthetic transformations. This paper describes an efficient copper-catalyzed homo- and cross-coupling of Grignard reagents with di-tert-butyldiaziridinone as oxidant under mild conditions, giving the coupling products in good to excellent yields. The reaction process has a broad substrate scope and is also effective for the C(sp)-C(sp(3)) coupling.	0
Title: Irregular transcriptome reprogramming probably causes thec developmental failure of embryos produced by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer between the Przewalski's gazelle and the bovine Abstract: Background:                       Interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) has been regarded as a potential alternative for rescuing highly endangered species and can be used as a model for studying nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. However, iSCNT embryos often fail to produce viable offspring. The alterations in normal molecular mechanisms contributing to extremely poor development are for the most part unknown.                  Results:                       Przewalski's gazelle-bovine iSCNT embryos (PBNT) were produced by transferring Przewalski's gazelle fibroblast nuclei into enucleated bovine oocytes. The percentages of PBNT embryos that developed to morula/blastocyst stages were extremely low even with the use of various treatments that included different SCNT protocols and treatment of embryos with small molecules. Transcriptional microarray analyses of the cloned embryos showed that the upregulation of reprogramming-associated genes in bovine-bovine SCNT (BBNT) embryos was significantly higher than those observed in PBNT embryos (1527:643). In all, 139 transcripts related to various transcription regulation factors (TFs) were unsuccessfully activated in the iSCNT embryos. Maternal degradation profiles showed that 1515 genes were uniquely downregulated in the BBNT embryos, while 343 genes were downregulated in the PBNT embryos. Incompatibilities between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA revealed that the TOMM (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane)/TIMM (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane) complex-associated genes in BBNT embryos had the highest expression levels, while the PBNT embryos exhibited much lower expression rates.                  Conclusions:                       Improper degradation of maternal transcripts, incomplete activation of TFs and abnormal expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function in PBNT embryos likely contributed to incomplete reprogramming of the donor cell nuclei and therefore led to the developmental failure of these cloned embryos.	0
Title: Small pectinolytic spirochetes from the rumen Abstract: Two strains of small spirochetes utilizing pectin as sole source of energy for growth were isolated from the rumen of cattle and partially characterized. The pectinolytic enzyme produced by one of the organisms was classified as a poly-1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide lyase (EC 4.2.2.2). A pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) was also produced.	0
Title: Enediyne polyketide synthases stereoselectively reduce the β-ketoacyl intermediates to β-D-hydroxyacyl intermediates in enediyne core biosynthesis Abstract: PKSE biosynthesizes an enediyne core precursor from decarboxylative condensation of eight malonyl-CoAs. The KR domain of PKSE is responsible for iterative β-ketoreduction in each round of polyketide chain elongation. KRs from selected PKSEs were investigated in vitro with β-ketoacyl-SNACs as substrate mimics. Each of the KRs reduced the β-ketoacyl-SNACs stereoselectively, all affording the corresponding β-D-hydroxyacyl-SNACs, and the catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(M)) of the KRs increased significantly as the chain length of the β-ketoacyl-SNAC substrate increases.	1
Title: The structure of a novel sugar component of polyene macrolide antibiotics: 2,6-dideoxy-L-ribohexopyranose Abstract: A novel carbohydrate has been isolated after acidic hydrolysis of nystatin A3, candidinin and polyfungin B and its structure established as 2,6-dideoxy-L-ribohexopyranose.	0
Title: Electrochemical Quantification of Neurotransmitters in Single Live Cell Vesicles Shows Exocytosis is Predominantly Partial Abstract: Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that partial release is the primary mechanism of release in multiple cell types.	0
Title: Fungal echinocandin resistance Abstract: The echinocandins are the newest class of antifungal agents in the clinical armory. These secondary metabolites are non-competitive inhibitors of the synthesis of beta-(1,3)-glucan, a major structural component of the fungal cell wall. Recent work has shown that spontaneous mutations can arise in two hot spot regions of Fks1 the target protein of echinocandins that reduce the enzyme's sensitivity to the drug. However, other strains have been isolated in which the sequence of FKS1 is unaltered yet the fungus has decreased sensitivity to echinocandins. In addition it has been shown that echinocandin-treatment can induce cell wall salvage mechanisms that result in the compensatory upregulation of chitin synthesis in the cell wall. This salvage mechanism strengthens cell walls damaged by exposure to echinocandins. Therefore, fungal resistance to echinocandins can arise due to the selection of either stable mutational or reversible physiological alterations that decrease susceptibility to these antifungal agents.	0
Title: Exploring the Functional Consequences of Protein Backbone Alteration in Ubiquitin through Native Chemical Ligation Abstract: Ubiquitin (Ub) plays critical roles in myriad protein degradation and signaling networks in the cell. We report herein Ub mimetics based on backbones that blend natural and artificial amino acid units. The variants were prepared by a modular route based on native chemical ligation. Biological assays show that some are enzymatically polymerized onto protein substrates, and that the resulting Ub tags are recognized for downstream pathways. These results advance the size and complexity of folded proteins mimicked by artificial backbones and expand the functional scope of such agents.	0
Title: Pleiotropic effects of alkaline phosphatase regulatory mutations phoB and phoT on anaerobic growth of and polyphosphate synthesis in Escherichia coli Abstract: The appearance during anaerobiosis of spontaneous phoT phoB double mutants in a phoT background is described. During both exponential growth and stationary phase, selection against the phoT mutants relative to the wild type was evident. This reduction in viability of phoT mutants was suppressed in phoT phoB double mutants. Sensitivity to anaerobiosis was shown to be correlated with polyphosphate overproduction. A possible pleiotropic function of phoT and phoB is suggested.	0
Title: TNF-induced structural joint damage is mediated by IL-1 Abstract: Blocking TNF effectively inhibits inflammation and structural damage in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, so far it is unclear whether the effect of TNF is a direct one or indirect on up-regulation of other mediators. IL-1 may be one of these candidates because it has a central role in animal models of arthritis, and inhibition of IL-1 is used as a therapy of human RA. We removed the effects of IL-1 from a TNF-mediated inflammatory joint disease by crossing IL-1alpha and beta-deficient mice (IL-1-/-) with arthritic human TNF-transgenic (hTNFtg) mice. Development of synovial inflammation was almost unaffected on IL-1 deficiency, but bone erosion and osteoclast formation were significantly reduced in IL-1-/-hTNFtg mice, compared with hTNFtg mice based on an intrinsic differentiation defect of IL-1-deficient monocytes. Most dramatically, however, cartilage damage was absent in IL-1-/-hTNFtg mice. Chimera studies revealed that protection of cartilage is based on the loss of IL-1 on hematopoietic, but not mesenchymal, cells, leading to decreased expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-3. These data show that TNF-mediated cartilage damage is completely and TNF-mediated bone damage is partially dependent on IL-1, suggesting that IL-1 is a crucial mediator for inflammatory cartilage and bone degradation.	0
Title: Uptake of amino acids by the parasitic, flagellated protist Trichomonas vaginalis Abstract: HPLC techniques have been applied to study amino acid uptake and release by Trichomonas vaginalis under a variety of conditions. Studies on the growth of T. vaginalis in complex media and the survival of the parasite in simple media, with and without amino acids and/or maltose, have shown that the growth or survival of T. vaginalis is better in the presence of maltose than when it is absent, and that greater amounts of amino acids are consumed by T. vaginalis in the absence of maltose. The results are consistent with several amino acids, notably arginine, threonine, leucine and methionine, being used by T. vaginalis as energy substrates. T. vaginalis released alanine and glycine into the culture media, the excretion being greater in the presence of maltose. These studies have provided new data on the uptake and release of amino acids by T. vaginalis and pave the way for detailed analysis of key enzymes and the regulation of the pathways involved.	0
Title: Wireless activation of neurons in brain slices using nanostructured semiconductor photoelectrodes Abstract: Light rather than electrical current: The inner or outer surfaces of glass micropipettes can be coated with nanoparticles of a narrow-band-gap semiconductor. When visible or near-infrared light is used for excitation, these micropipettes (labeled PE Stim in the image) can activate nearby neurons (labeled *) in brain tissue without the damage associated with electrical stimulation.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster of the non-ribosomally synthesized cyclodepsipeptide skyllamycin: deciphering unprecedented ways of unusual hydroxylation reactions Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptide skyllamycin A is a potent inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway by inhibiting binding of homodimeric PDGF BB to the PDGF β-receptor. Its structure contains a cinnamoyl side chain and shows a high amount of β-hydroxylated amino acids as well as an unusual α-hydroxyglycine moiety as a rare structural modification. The skyllamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces sp. Acta 2897. Its analysis revealed the presence of open reading frames encoding proteins for fatty acid precursor biosynthesis, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, regulators, and transporters along with other modifying enzymes. Specific in-frame mutagenesis of these tailoring enzymes resulted in the production of novel skyllamycin derivatives revealing that β-hydroxy groups in skyllamycin A are introduced by a promiscuous cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, whereas a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase is involved in α-hydroxylation.	1
Title: Characterization of the N-methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of toxoflavin, fervenulin and reumycin from Streptomyces hiroshimensis ATCC53615 Abstract: Toxoflavin (1), fervenulin (2), and reumycin (3), known to be produced by plant pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1, are structurally related 7-azapteridine antibiotics. Previous biosynthetic studies revealed that N-methyltransferase ToxA from B. glumae BGR1 catalyzed the sequential methylation at N6 and N1 in pyrimido[5,4-e]-as-triazine-5,7(6H,8H)-dione (4) to generate 1. However, the N8 methylation of 4 in the biosynthesis of fervenulin remains unclear. To explore the N-methyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, we identified and characterized the fervenulin and toxoflavin biosynthetic gene clusters in S. hiroshimensis ATCC53615. On the basis of the structures of intermediates accumulated from the four N-methyltransferase gene inactivation mutants and systematic enzymatic methylation reactions, the tailoring steps for the methylation order in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 were proposed. The N-methylation order and routes for the biosynthesis of fervenulin and toxoflavin in S. hiroshimensis are more complex and represent an obvious departure from those in B. glumae BGR1.	1
Title: 5-Stabilized phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate analogues bind Grp1 PH, inhibit phosphoinositide phosphatases, and block neutrophil migration Abstract: Metabolically stabilized analogues of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have shown long-lived agonist activity for cellular events and selective inhibition of lipid phosphatase activity. We describe an efficient asymmetric synthesis of two 5-phosphatase-resistant analogues of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the 5-methylene phosphonate (MP) and 5-phosphorothioate (PT). Furthermore, we illustrate the biochemical and biological activities of five stabilized PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 analogues in four contexts. First, the relative binding affinities of the 3-MP, 3-PT, 5-MP, 5-PT, and 3,4,5-PT3 analogues to the Grp1 PH domain are shown, as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Second, the enzymology of the five analogues is explored, showing the relative efficiency of inhibition of SHIP1, SHIP2, and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), as well as the greatly reduced ability of these phosphatases to process these analogues as substrates as compared to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Third, exogenously delivered analogues severely impair complement factor C5a-mediated polarization and migration of murine neutrophils. Finally, the new analogues show long-lived agonist activity in mimicking insulin action in sodium transport in A6 cells.	0
Title: Vibrio neptunius Produces Piscibactin and Amphibactin and Both Siderophores Contribute Significantly to Virulence for Clams Abstract: Vibrio neptunius is an inhabitant of mollusc microbiota and an opportunistic pathogen causing disease outbreaks in marine bivalve mollusc species including oysters and clams. Virulence of mollusc pathogenic vibrios is mainly associated with the production of extracellular products. However, siderophore production is a common feature in pathogenic marine bacteria but its role in fitness and virulence of mollusc pathogens remains unknown. We previously found that V. neptunius produces amphibactin, one of the most abundant siderophores in marine microbes. In this work, synthesis of the siderophore piscibactin was identified as the second siderophore produced by V. neptunius. Single and double mutants in biosynthetic genes of each siderophore system, piscibactin and amphibactin, were constructed in V. neptunius and their role in growth ability and virulence was characterized. Although the High Pathogenicity Island encoding piscibactin is a major virulence factor in vibrios pathogenic for fish, the V. neptunius wild type did not cause mortality in turbot. The results showed that amphibactin contributes more than piscibactin to bacterial fitness in vitro. However, infection challenges showed that each siderophore system contributes equally to virulence for molluscs. The V. neptunius strain unable to produce any siderophore was severely impaired to cause vibriosis in clams. Although the inactivation of one of the two siderophore systems (either amphibactin or piscibactin) significantly reduced virulence compared to the wild type strain, the ability to produce both siderophores simultaneously maximised the degree of virulence. Evaluation of the gene expression pattern of each siderophore system showed that they are simultaneously expressed when V. neptunius is cultivated under low iron availability in vitro and ex vivo. Finally, the analysis of the distribution of siderophore systems in genomes of Vibrio spp. pathogenic for molluscs showed that the gene clusters encoding amphibactin and piscibactin are widespread in the Coralliilyticus clade. Thus, siderophore production would constitute a key virulence factor for bivalve molluscs pathogenic vibrios.	1
Title: A Unique Tryptophan C-Prenyltransferase from the Kawaguchipeptin Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Cyanobactins are a rapidly growing family of linear and cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. Kawaguchipeptins A and B, two macrocyclic undecapeptides reported earlier from Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88, are shown to be products of the cyanobactin biosynthetic pathway. The 9 kb kawaguchipeptin (kgp) gene cluster was identified in a 5.26 Mb draft genome of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88. We verified that this gene cluster is responsible for the production of the kawaguchipeptins through heterologous expression of the kgp gene cluster in Escherichia coli. The KgpF prenyltransferase was overexpressed and was shown to prenylate C-3 of Trp residues in both linear and cyclic peptides in vitro. Our findings serve to further enhance the structural diversity of cyanobactins to include tryptophan-prenylated cyclic peptides.	1
Title: A little bit of lithium does a lot for hydrogen Abstract: From detailed assessments of electronic structure, we find that a combination of significantly quantal elements, six of seven atoms being hydrogen, becomes a stable metal at a pressure approximately 1/4 of that required to metalize pure hydrogen itself. The system, LiH(6) (and other LiH(n)), may well have extensions beyond the constituent lithium. These hypothetical materials demonstrate that nontraditional stoichiometries can considerably expand the view of chemical combination under moderate pressure.	0
Title: Chemoenzymatic synthesis of unmodified heparin oligosaccharides: cleavage of p-nitrophenyl glucuronide by alkaline and Smith degradation Abstract: A heparin oligosaccharide having a completely natural structure was successfully synthesized through a chemoenzymatic approach using an unnatural glycosyl acceptor, p-nitrophenyl glucuronide (GlcA-pNP). The use of an inexpensive and commercially available GlcA-pNP acceptor facilitates oligosaccharide recovery and purification on C-18 resin during chemoenzymatic synthesis. Oligosaccharide chain extension and modification afforded a heptasaccharide with gluconic acid residues at its reducing and non-reducing ends. Treatment with periodate oxidation followed by Smith degradation or alkaline elimination resulted in the selective cleavage of vicinal diol-containing glucuronic acid residues affording highly sulfated heparin pentasaccharides having a completely natural structure. This methodology should facilitate the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a family of highly sulfated heparin oligosaccharides with unmodified structures for biological evaluation.	0
Title: Discovery of Reactive Microbiota-Derived Metabolites that Inhibit Host Proteases Abstract: The gut microbiota modulate host biology in numerous ways, but little is known about the molecular mediators of these interactions. Previously, we found a widely distributed family of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in gut bacteria. Here, by expressing a subset of these clusters in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, we show that they encode pyrazinones and dihydropyrazinones. At least one of the 47 clusters is present in 88% of the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (NIH HMP) stool samples, and they are transcribed under conditions of host colonization. We present evidence that the active form of these molecules is the initially released peptide aldehyde, which bears potent protease inhibitory activity and selectively targets a subset of cathepsins in human cell proteomes. Our findings show that an approach combining bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and heterologous gene cluster expression can rapidly expand our knowledge of the metabolic potential of the microbiota while avoiding the challenges of cultivating fastidious commensals.	1
Title: Structure and action of the C-C bond-forming glycosyltransferase UrdGT2 involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic urdamycin Abstract: The glycosyltransferase UrdGT2 from Streptomyces fradiae catalyzes the formation of a glycosidic C-C bond between a polyketide aglycone and D-olivose. The enyzme was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Its structure was established by X-ray diffraction at 1.9 A resolution. It is the first structure of a C-glycosyltransferase. UrdGT2 belongs to the structural family GT-B of the glycosyltransferases and is likely to form a C(2)-symmetric dimer in solution. The binding structures of donor and acceptor substrates in five structurally homologous enzymes provided a clear and consistent guide for the substrate-binding structure in UrdGT2. The modeled substrate locations suggest the deeply buried Asp137 as the activator for C-C bond formation and explain the reaction. The putative model can be used to design mutations that change the substrate specificity. Such mutants are of great interest in overcoming the increasing danger of antibiotic resistance.	1
Title: Chemical knockout of pantothenate kinase reveals the metabolic and genetic program responsible for hepatic coenzyme A homeostasis Abstract: Coenzyme A (CoA) is the major acyl group carrier in intermediary metabolism. Hopantenate (HoPan), a competitive inhibitor of the pantothenate kinases, was used to chemically antagonize CoA biosynthesis. HoPan dramatically reduced liver CoA and mice developed severe hypoglycemia. Insulin was reduced, glucagon and corticosterone were elevated, and fasting accelerated hypoglycemia. Metabolic profiling revealed a large increase in acylcarnitines, illustrating the role of carnitine in buffering acyl groups to maintain the nonesterified CoASH level. HoPan triggered significant changes in hepatic gene expression that substantially increased the thioesterases, which liberate CoASH from acyl-CoA, and increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which prevents the conversion of CoASH to acetyl-CoA. These results identify the metabolic rearrangements that maintain the CoASH pool which is critical to mitochondrial functions, including gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles.	0
Title: Characterization of the two-component, FAD-dependent monooxygenase SgcC that requires carrier protein-tethered substrates for the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is a potent antitumor antibiotic composed of an apoprotein (CagA) and a reactive enediyne chromophore. The chromophore has four distinct chemical moieties, including an ( S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine moiety, the biosynthesis of which from l-alpha-tyrosine requires five proteins: SgcC, SgcC1, SgcC2, SgcC3, and SgcC4; a sixth protein, SgcC5, catalyzes the incorporation of this beta-amino acid moiety into C-1027. Biochemical characterization of SgcC has now revealed that (i) SgcC is a two-component, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase, (ii) SgcC is only active with SgcC2 (peptidyl carrier protein)-tethered substrates, (iii) SgcC-catalyzed hydroxylation requires O 2 and FADH 2, the latter supplied by the C-1027 pathway-specific flavin reductase SgcE6 or Escherichia coli flavin reductase Fre, and (iv) SgcC efficiently catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation of 3-substituted beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 analogues, including the chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, fluoro-, and methyl-substituted analogues, but does not accept 3-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 as a substrate. Together with the in vitro data for SgcC4, SgcC1, and SgcC3, the results establish that SgcC catalyzes the hydroxylation of ( S)-3-chloro-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 as the final step in the biosynthesis of the ( S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine moiety prior to incorporation into C-1027. SgcC now represents the first biochemically characterized two-component, FAD-dependent monooxygenase that acts on a carrier-protein-tethered aromatic substrate.	1
Title: The acbH gene of Actinoplanes sp. encodes a solute receptor with binding activities for acarbose and longer homologs Abstract: Acarbose, a pseudomaltotetraose, is produced by strains of the genus Actinoplanes and is a potent inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases, including those from the human intestine. Therefore, it is used in the treatment of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes. The benefits of acarbose for the producer are not known; however, besides acting as an inhibitor of alpha-amylases secreted by competitors, a role as a 'carbophor' has been proposed. This would require a transport system mediating its uptake into the cytoplasm of Actinoplanes sp. A putative sugar ATP binding cassette (ABC) transport system, the genes of which are included within the biosynthetic gene cluster for acarbose, was suggested to be a possible candidate. The genes acbHFG encode a possible sugar binding protein (AcbH) and two membrane integral subunits (AcbFG). A gene coding for an ATPase component is missing. Since Actinoplanes sp. cannot yet be genetically manipulated we performed experiments to identify the substrate(s) of the putative transporter by assessing the substrate specificity of AcbH. The protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli as His10-fusion protein, purified under denaturating conditions and renatured. Refolding was verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that AcbH binds acarbose and longer derivatives, but not maltodextrins, maltose or sucrose. Immunoblot analysis revealed the association of AcbH with the membrane fraction of Actinoplanes cells that were grown in the presence of maltose, maltodextrins or acarbose. Together, these findings suggest that the AcbHFG complex might be involved in the uptake of acarbose and are consistent with a role for acarbose as a 'carbophor'.	1
Title: Extracellular glycanases of Rhizobium leguminosarum are activated on the cell surface by an exopolysaccharide-related component Abstract: Rhizobium leguminosarum secretes two extracellular glycanases, PlyA and PlyB, that can degrade exopolysaccharide (EPS) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), which is used as a model substrate of plant cell wall cellulose polymers. When grown on agar medium, CMC degradation occurred only directly below colonies of R. leguminosarum, suggesting that the enzymes remain attached to the bacteria. Unexpectedly, when a PlyA-PlyB-secreting colony was grown in close proximity to mutants unable to produce or secrete PlyA and PlyB, CMC degradation occurred below that part of the mutant colonies closest to the wild type. There was no CMC degradation in the region between the colonies. By growing PlyB-secreting colonies on a lawn of CMC-nondegrading mutants, we could observe a halo of CMC degradation around the colony. Using various mutant strains, we demonstrate that PlyB diffuses beyond the edge of the colony but does not degrade CMC unless it is in contact with the appropriate colony surface. PlyA appears to remain attached to the cells since no such diffusion of PlyA activity was observed. EPS defective mutants could secrete both PlyA and PlyB, but these enzymes were inactive unless they came into contact with an EPS(+) strain, indicating that EPS is required for activation of PlyA and PlyB. However, we were unable to activate CMC degradation with a crude EPS fraction, indicating that activation of CMC degradation may require an intermediate in EPS biosynthesis. Transfer of PlyB to Agrobacterium tumefaciens enabled it to degrade CMC, but this was only observed if it was grown on a lawn of R. leguminosarum. This indicates that the surface of A. tumefaciens is inappropriate to activate CMC degradation by PlyB. Analysis of CMC degradation by other rhizobia suggests that activation of secreted glycanases by surface components may occur in other species.	0
Title: Auditory system: Peripheral nonlinearity and central additivity, as revealed in the human stapedius-muscle reflex Abstract: Human stapedius-muscle contractions in response to 3-kHz, 20-msec tone bursts were determined indirectly by measuring the associated acoustic-impedance changes at the tympanic membrane with an acoustic bridge. The measurement was possible because the bridge practically eliminates the effect of the ear-canal air volume interposed between the tympanic membrane and the tip of the measuring tube. By using burst pairs, temporal additivity of the muscle responses was demonstrated both when the stimulus bursts were presented contralaterally to the measured impedance changes and when the first burst was presented ipsilaterally. The summation time constant was on the order of 200 msec, much longer than the twitch time constant of the muscle fibers. Therefore, the summation had to take place in a nucleus preceding the stapedius muscle. The magnitude of the muscle response obeyed a compressive function paralleling the loudness function up to sound pressure levels of at least 120 dB.	0
Title: Fast and Effective Prediction of the Absolute Binding Free Energies of Covalent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease and 20S Proteasome Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a public health emergency with continuously evolving deadly variants around the globe. Among many preventive and therapeutic strategies, the design of covalent inhibitors targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 has been one of the hotly pursued areas. Currently, about 30% of marketed drugs that target enzymes are covalent inhibitors. Such inhibitors have been shown in recent years to have many advantages that counteract past reservation of their potential off-target activities, which can be minimized by modulation of the electrophilic warhead and simultaneous optimization of nearby noncovalent interactions. This process can be greatly accelerated by exploration of binding affinities using computational models, which are not well-established yet due to the requirement of capturing the chemical nature of covalent bond formation. Here, we present a robust computational method for effective prediction of absolute binding free energies (ABFEs) of covalent inhibitors. This is done by integrating the protein dipoles Langevin dipoles method (in the PDLD/S-LRA/β version) with quantum mechanical calculations of the energetics of the reaction of the warhead and its amino acid target, in water. This approach evaluates the combined effects of the covalent and noncovalent contributions. The applicability of the method is illustrated by predicting the ABFEs of covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the 20S proteasome. Our results are found to be reliable in predicting ABFEs for cases where the warheads are significantly different. This computational protocol might be a powerful tool for designing effective covalent inhibitors especially for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and for targeted protein degradation.	0
Title: Metabolic and evolutionary origin of actin-binding polyketides from diverse organisms Abstract: Actin-targeting macrolides comprise a large, structurally diverse group of cytotoxins isolated from remarkably dissimilar micro- and macroorganisms. In spite of their disparate origins and structures, many of these compounds bind actin at the same site and exhibit structural relationships reminiscent of modular, combinatorial drug libraries. Here we investigate biosynthesis and evolution of three compound groups: misakinolides, scytophycin-type compounds and luminaolides. For misakinolides from the sponge Theonella swinhoei WA, our data suggest production by an uncultivated 'Entotheonella' symbiont, further supporting the relevance of these bacteria as sources of bioactive polyketides and peptides in sponges. Insights into misakinolide biosynthesis permitted targeted genome mining for other members, providing a cyanobacterial luminaolide producer as the first cultivated source for this dimeric compound family. The data indicate that this polyketide family is bacteria-derived and that the unusual macrolide diversity is the result of combinatorial pathway modularity for some compounds and of convergent evolution for others.	1
Title: Proteins encoded by Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 rmlA and ugpG genes, involved in gellan gum biosynthesis, exhibit both dTDP- and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activities Abstract: The commercial gelling agent gellan is a heteropolysaccharide produced by Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461. In this work, we carried out the biochemical characterization of the enzyme encoded by the first gene (rmlA) of the rml 4-gene cluster present in the 18-gene cluster required for gellan biosynthesis (gel cluster). Based on sequence homology, the putative rml operon is presumably involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, the sugar necessary for the incorporation of rhamnose in the gellan repeating unit. Heterologous RmlA was purified as a fused His6-RmlA protein from extracts prepared from Escherichia coli IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside)-induced cells, and the protein was proven to exhibit dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Km of 12.0 microM for dTDP-glucose) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Km of 229.0 microM for UDP-glucose) activities in vitro. The N-terminal region of RmlA exhibits the motif G-X-G-T-R-X2-P-X-T, which is highly conserved among bacterial XDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases. The motif E-E-K-P, with the conserved lysine residue (K163) predicted to be essential for glucose-1-phosphate binding, was observed. The S. elodea ATCC 31461 UgpG protein, encoded by the ugpG gene which maps outside the gel cluster, was previously identified as the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in the formation of UDP-glucose, also required for gellan synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that UgpG also exhibits dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity in vitro and compare the kinetic parameters of the two proteins for both substrates. DNA sequencing of ugpG gene-adjacent regions and sequence similarity studies suggest that this gene maps with others involved in the formation of sugar nucleotides presumably required for the biosynthesis of another cell polysaccharide(s).	1
Title: Homologous Expression and Characterization of Gassericin T and Gassericin S, a Novel Class IIb Bacteriocin Produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA327 Abstract: Lactobacillus gasseri LA327, isolated from the large intestine tissue in humans, is a bacteriocinogenic strain with two kinds of class IIb bacteriocin structural genes, i.e., those for gassericin T (GT) and acidocin LF221A (Acd LF221A). In this study, DNA sequencing of the genes for GT and Acd LF221A from L. gasseri LA327 revealed that the amino acid sequences for GT corresponded with those for GT genes, except for GatK (histidine kinase). However, Acd LF221A genes had analogues which differed in at least one amino acid residue, to encode a class IIb bacteriocin designated gassericin S (GS). The LA327 strain retained antimicrobial activity after the deletion of the GT structural genes (gatAX); however, both GS and GT activities were lost by deletion of the putative ABC transporter gene (gatT). This indicates that the LA327 strain produces GS and GT and that GS secretion is performed via GT genes with the inclusion of gatT Homologous expression using deletion mutants of GS and GT, each containing a single peptide, elucidated that GS (GasAX) and GT (GatAX) showed synergistic activity as class IIb bacteriocins and that no synergistic activity was observed between GS and GT peptides. The molecular mass of GS was estimated to be theoretical ca. 5,400 Da by in situ activity assay after SDS-PAGE, clarifying that GS was actually expressed as an active class IIb bacteriocin. Furthermore, the stability of expressed GS to pH, heat, and protease was determined.IMPORTANCE Bacteriocins are regarded as potential alternatives for antibiotics in the absence of highly resistant bacteria. In particular, two-peptide (class IIb) bacteriocins exhibit the maximum activity through the synergy of two components, and their antimicrobial spectra are known to be relatively wide. However, there are few reports of synergistic activity of class IIb bacteriocins determined by isolation and purification of individual peptides. Our results clarified the interaction of each class IIb component peptide for GT and GS via the construction of homologous mutants, which were not dependent on the purification. These data may contribute to understanding the mechanisms of action by which class IIb bacteriocins exhibit wide antibacterial spectra.	1
Title: A Remarkable Difference That One Fluorine Atom Confers on the Mechanisms of Inactivation of Human Ornithine Aminotransferase by Two Cyclohexene Analogues of γ-Aminobutyric Acid Abstract: Human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological selective inhibition of hOAT has been shown to be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC. Inspired by the discovery of the nonselective aminotransferase inactivator (1R,3S,4S)-3-amino-4-fluoro cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (1), in this work, we rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel series of fluorine-substituted cyclohexene analogues, thereby identifying 8 and 9 as novel selective hOAT time-dependent inhibitors. Intact protein mass spectrometry and protein crystallography demonstrated 8 and 9 as covalent inhibitors of hOAT, which exhibit two distinct inactivation mechanisms resulting from the difference of a single fluorine atom. Interestingly, they share a similar turnover mechanism, according to the mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites and fluoride ion release experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrostatic potential (ESP) charge calculations were conducted, which elucidated the significant influence of the one-fluorine difference on the corresponding intermediates, leading to two totally different inactivation pathways. The novel addition-aromatization inactivation mechanism for 9 contributes to its significantly enhanced potency, along with excellent selectivity over other aminotransferases.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of a cathepsin L-like enzyme from the body wall of the sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus Abstract: Cathepsin L-like enzyme was purified from the body wall of the sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus by an integral method involving ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographies on DEAE Sepharose CL-6B, Sephadex G-75, and TSK-GEL. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 63 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme cleaved N-carbobenzoxy-phenylalanine-arginine7-amido-4-methylcoumarin with K(m) (69.92 microM) and k(cat) (12.80/S) hardly hydrolyzed N-carbobenzoxy-arginine-arginine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and L-arginine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. The optimum pH and temperature for the purified enzyme were found to be 5.0 and 50 degrees C. It showed thermal stability below 40 degrees C. The activity was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and activated by reducing agents. These results suggest that the purified enzyme was a cathepsin L-like enzyme and that it existed in the form of its enzyme-inhibitor complex or precursor.	0
Title: Induction of secondary metabolite production by hygromycin B and identification of the 1233A biosynthetic gene cluster with a self-resistance gene Abstract: We found that the protein synthesis inhibitor hygromycin B induced the production of secondary metabolites, including lucilactaene, NG-391, fusarubin, 1233A, and 1233B, in the filamentous fungus, Fusarium sp. RK97-94. We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1233A, an HMG-CoA synthase inhibitor. The biosynthetic gene cluster consisted of four genes, one of which was involved in conferring self-resistance to 1233A.	1
Title: Application of cotton straw biochar and compound Bacillus biofertilizer decrease the bioavailability of soil cd through impacting soil bacteria Abstract: Background:                       Cd seriously threatens soil environment, remedying Cd in farmland and clearing the response of soil environment to modifiers in Cd-contaminated soils is necessary. In this study, the effects of cotton straw biochar and compound Bacillus biofertilizer used as modifiers on the biochemical properties, enzyme activity, and microbial diversity in Cd-contaminated soils (1, 2, and 4 mg·kg-1) were investigated.                  Results:                       The results showed that both cotton straw biochar and compound Bacillus biofertilizer could improve the soil chemical characteristics, including the increase of soil C/N ratio, electrical conductance (EC) and pH, and the most important decrease of soil available Cd content by 60.24% and 74.34%, respectively (P < 0.05). On the other hand, adding cotton straw biochar and compound Bacillus biofertilizer in Cd stressed soil also improved soil biological characteristics. Among them, cotton straw biochar mainly through increasing soil alkaline phosphatase activity and improve bacteria abundance, compound Bacillus biofertilizer by increasing soil invertase, alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and urease activity increased bacterial community diversity. On the whole, the decrease of soil available Cd was mainly caused by the increase of soil pH, C/N, urease and alkaline phosphatase activities, and the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria.                  Conclusions:                       In summary, the applications of cotton straw biochar and compound Bacillus biofertilizer could decrease soil available Cd concentration, increase soil bacterial community diversity and functions metabolism, and reduce the damage of Cd stress, compared with cotton straw biochar, compound Bacillus biofertilizer was more effective in immobilizing Cd and improving soil environmental quality.	0
Title: Comparative activities of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae in an In vitro dynamic model Abstract: The activities of levofloxacin (500 mg every 24 h) and ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 h) against six pneumococcal isolates in an in vitro dynamic model were compared. For one strain, levofloxacin reduced the inoculum by over 4 log CFU/ml and ciprofloxacin reduced the inoculum by over 2 log CFU/ml. For four isolates, both drugs reduced inocula by 4 log CFU/ml within 6 h, suggesting that this dose of ciprofloxacin should be as effective as levofloxacin against these pneumococci.	0
Title: Synthesis, radio-synthesis and in vitro evaluation of terminally fluorinated derivatives of HU-210 and HU-211 as novel candidate PET tracers Abstract: We report the synthesis of terminally fluorinated HU-210 and HU-211 analogues (HU-210F and HU-211F, respectively) and their biological evaluation as ligands of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). [18F]-labelled HU-210F was radiosynthesised from the bromo-substituted precursor. In vitro assays showed that both HU-210F and HU-211F retain the potent pharmacological profile of HU-210 and HU-211, suggesting that [18F]-radiolabelled HU-210F and HU-211F could have potential as PET tracers for in vivo imaging.	0
Title: High-resolution NMR analysis of the conformations of native and base analog substituted retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon PPT primers Abstract: A purine-rich region of the plus-strand RNA genome of retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons, known as the polypurine tract (PPT), is resistant to hydrolysis by the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT) and ultimately serves as a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. The mechanisms underlying PPT resistance and selective processing remain largely unknown. Here, two RNA/DNA hybrids derived from the PPTs of HIV-1 and Ty3 were probed using high-resolution NMR for preexisting structural distortions in the absence of RT. The PPTs were selectively modified through base-pair changes or by incorporation of the thymine isostere, 2,4-difluoro-5-methylbenzene (dF), into the DNA strand. Although both wild-type (WT) and mutated hybrids adopted global A-form-like helical geometries, observed structural perturbations in the base-pair and dF-modified hybrids suggested that the PPT hybrids may function as structurally coupled domains.	0
Title: An E. coli biosensor for screening of cDNA libraries for isochorismate pyruvate lyase-encoding cDNAs Abstract: Salicylic acid (SA) is an essential hormone for development and induced defense against biotrophic pathogens in plants. The formation of SA mainly derives from chorismate via demonstrated isochorismate synthase (ICS) and presumed isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL)-mediated steps in Arabidopsis thaliana, but so far no plant enzyme displaying IPL activity has been identified. Here, we developed an E. coli SA biosensor to screen for IPL activity based on the SalR regulator/salA promoter combination from Acinetobacter sp ADP1, to control the expression of the reporter luxCDABE. The biosensor was responsive to micromolar concentrations of exogenous SA, and to endogenous SA produced after transformation with a plasmid permitting IPTG-inducible expression of bacterial IPL in this biosensor strain. After screening a cDNA library constructed from turnip crinkle virus (TCV)-infected Arabidopsis ecotype Di-17, we identified an enzyme, PRXR1, as a putative IPL that converts isochorismate into SA. Our results provide a new experimental approach to identify IPL and new insights into the SA biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis.	0
Title: Oxidative cleavage of premithramycin B is one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin is a member of the clinically important aureolic acid group of antitumor drugs that interact with GC-rich regions of DNA nonintercalatively. These drugs contain a chromophore aglycon that is derived from condensation of ten acetate units (catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase). The aglycones are glycosylated at two positions with different chain length deoxyoligosaccharides, which are essential for the antitumor activity. During the early stages of mithramycin biosynthesis, tetracyclic intermediates of the tetracycline-type occur, which must be converted at later stages into the tricyclic glycosylated molecule, presumably through oxidative breakage of the fourth ring.                  Results:                       Two intermediates in the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway, 4-demethyl-premithramycinone and premithramycin B, were identified in a mutant lacking the mithramycin glycosyltransferase and methyltransferase genes and in the same mutant complemented with the deleted genes, respectively. Premithramycin B contains five deoxysugars moieties (like mithramycin), but contains a tetracyclic aglycon moiety instead of a tricyclic aglycon. We hypothesized that transcription of mtmOIV (encoding an oxygenase) was impaired in this strain, preventing oxidative breakage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B. Inactivating mtmOIV generated a mithramycin nonproducing mutant that accumulated premithramycin B instead of mithramycin. In vitro assays demonstrated that MtmOIV converted premithramycin B into a tricyclic compound.                  Conclusions:                       In the late stages of mithramycin biosynthesis by Strepyomyces argillaceus, a fully glycosylated tetracyclic tetracycline-like intermediate (premithramycin B) is converted into a tricyclic compound by the oxygenase MtmOIV. This oxygenase inserts an oxygen (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) and opens the resulting lactone. The following decarboxylation and ketoreduction steps lead to mithramycin. Opening of the fourth ring represents one of the last steps in mithramycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Neutral loss fragmentation pattern based screening for arginine-rich natural products in Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus Abstract: Although sharing a certain degree of structural uniformity, natural product classes exhibit variable functionalities such as different amino acid or acyl residues. During collision induced dissociation, some natural products exhibit a conserved fragmentation pattern close to the precursor ion. The observed fragments result from a shared set of neutral losses, creating a unique fragmentation pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint for members of these natural product classes. The culture supernatants of 69 strains of the entomopathogenic bacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus were analyzed by MALDI-MS(2), and a database comprising MS(2) data from each strain was established. This database was scanned for concordant fragmentation patterns of different compounds using a customized software, focusing on relative mass differences of the fragment ions to their precursor ion. A novel group of related natural products comprising 25 different arginine-rich peptides from 16 different strains was identified due to its characteristic neutral loss fragmentation pattern, and the structures of eight compounds were elucidated. Two biosynthesis gene clusters encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases were identified, emphasizing the possibility to identify a group of structurally and biosynthetically related natural products based on their neutral loss fragmentation pattern.	1

Title: Accessing protein methyltransferase and demethylase enzymology using microfluidic capillary electrophoresis Abstract: The discovery of small molecules targeting the >80 enzymes that add (methyltransferases) or remove (demethylases) methyl marks from lysine and arginine residues, most notably present in histone tails, may yield unprecedented chemotherapeutic agents and facilitate regenerative medicine. To better enable chemical exploration of these proteins, we have developed a highly quantitative microfluidic capillary electrophoresis assay to enable full mechanistic studies of these enzymes and the kinetics of their inhibition. This technology separates small biomolecules, i.e., peptides, based on their charge-to-mass ratio. Methylation, however, does not alter the charge of peptide substrates. To overcome this limitation, we have employed a methylation-sensitive endoproteinase strategy to separate methylated from unmethylated peptides. The assay was validated on a lysine methyltransferase (G9a) and a lysine demethylase (LSD1) and was employed to investigate the inhibition of G9a by small molecules.	0
Title: Cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in an acidophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The cytoplasmic buffering capacity of Thiobacillus acidophilus (along with membrane properties) is responsible for the cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in metabolically compromised cells. When a large influx of H+ occurs, the cytoplasmic buffering capacity prevents drastic changes in pH; in addition, this influx, by increasing the positive membrane potential, eventually leads to a cessation of further H+ influx.	0
Title: Microbial conversion of epsilon-pyrromycinone and epsilon-isorhodomycinone to 1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomcyin and N-formyl-1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin and their bioactivities Abstract: New anthracycline antibiotics, 1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin and N-formyl-1-hydroxy-13-dihydrodaunomycin were biosynthesized by a blocked mutant of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus ME130-A4 from epsilon-pyrromycinone or epsilon-isorhodomycinone.	0
Title: Wide Distribution of Foxicin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Streptomyces Strains - An Unusual Secondary Metabolite with Various Properties Abstract: Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü6028 is known to produce the polyketide antibiotic polyketomycin. The deletion of the pokOIV oxygenase gene led to a non-polyketomycin-producing mutant. Instead, novel compounds were produced by the mutant, which have not been detected before in the wild type strain. Four different compounds were identified and named foxicins A-D. Foxicin A was isolated and its structure was elucidated as an unusual nitrogen-containing quinone derivative using various spectroscopic methods. Through genome mining, the foxicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the draft genome sequence of S. diastatochromogenes. The cluster spans 57 kb and encodes three PKS type I modules, one NRPS module and 41 additional enzymes. A foxBII gene-inactivated mutant of S. diastatochromogenes Tü6028 ΔpokOIV is unable to produce foxicins. Homologous fox biosynthetic gene clusters were found in more than 20 additional Streptomyces strains, overall in about 2.6% of all sequenced Streptomyces genomes. However, the production of foxicin-like compounds in these strains has never been described indicating that the clusters are expressed at a very low level or are silent under fermentation conditions. Foxicin A acts as a siderophore through interacting with ferric ions. Furthermore, it is a weak inhibitor of the Escherichia coli aerobic respiratory chain and shows moderate antibiotic activity. The wide distribution of the cluster and the various properties of the compound indicate a major role of foxicins in Streptomyces strains.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Novel Statins by Combining Heterologous Genes from Xylaria and Aspergillus Abstract: For many secondary metabolites, heterologous synthesis is the definitive step to determine their required biosynthetic genes. Using a multivector expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we reconstituted not only two natural statins from two fungal species, i.e., lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and FR901512 from Xylaria grammica, but also new statin structures by mixing their genes. Combinatorial gene exchange experiments revealed the functional promiscuity of two polyketide synthases in A. terreus, lovB, and lovF; they could synthesize FR901512 with Xylaria genes. Key structure determinants of statins are essential accessory genes that are irreplaceable across species.	1
Title: Conformational flexibility and strand arrangements of the membrane-associated HIV fusion peptide trimer probed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion peptide (HFP) is the N-terminal apolar region of the HIV gp41 fusion protein and interacts with target cell membranes and promotes membrane fusion. The free peptide catalyzes vesicle fusion at least to the lipid mixing stage and serves as a useful model fusion system. For gp41 constructs which lack the HFP, high-resolution structures show trimeric protein and suggest that at least three HFPs interact with the membrane with their C-termini in close proximity. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that HFPs which are cross-linked at their C-termini to form trimers (HFPtr) catalyze fusion at a rate which is 15-40 times greater than that of non-cross-linked HFP. In the present study, the structure of membrane-associated HFPtr was probed with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Chemical shift and intramolecular (13)CO-(15)N distance measurements show that the conformation of the Leu-7 to Phe-11 region of HFPtr has predominant helical conformation in membranes without cholesterol and beta strand conformation in membranes containing approximately 30 mol % cholesterol. Interstrand (13)CO-(13)CO and (13)CO-(15)N distance measurements were not consistent with an in-register parallel strand arrangement but were consistent with either (1) parallel arrangement with adjacent strands two residues out-of-register or (2) antiparallel arrangement with adjacent strand crossing between Phe-8 and Leu-9. Arrangement 1 could support the rapid fusion rate of HFPtr because of placement of the apolar N-terminal regions of all strands on the same side of the oligomer while arrangement 2 could support the assembly of multiple fusion protein trimers.	0
Title: Heparan Sulfate Microarray Reveals That Heparan Sulfate-Protein Binding Exhibits Different Ligand Requirements Abstract: Heparan sulfates (HS) are linear sulfated polysaccharides that modulate a wide range of physiological and disease-processes. Variations in HS epimerization and sulfation provide enormous structural diversity, which is believed to underpin protein binding and regulatory properties. The ligand requirements of HS-binding proteins have, however, been defined in only a few cases. We describe here a synthetic methodology that can rapidly provide a library of well-defined HS oligosaccharides. It is based on the use of modular disaccharides to assemble several selectively protected tetrasaccharides that were subjected to selective chemical modifications such as regioselective O- and N-sulfation and selective de-sulfation. A number of the resulting compounds were subjected to enzymatic modifications by 3-O-sulfotransferases-1 (3-OST1) to provide 3-O-sulfated derivatives. The various approaches for diversification allowed one tetrasaccharide to be converted into 12 differently sulfated derivatives. By employing tetrasaccharides with different backbone compositions, a library of 47 HS-oligosaccharides was prepared and the resulting compounds were used to construct a HS microarray. The ligand requirements of a number of HS-binding proteins including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and the chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL13, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were examined using the array. Although all proteins recognized multiple compounds, they exhibited clear differences in structure-binding characteristics. The HS microarray data guided the selection of compounds that could interfere in biological processes such as cell proliferation. Although the library does not cover the entire chemical space of HS-tetrasaccharides, the binding data support a notion that changes in cell surface HS composition can modulate protein function.	0
Title: Specific modulation of protein activity by using a bioorthogonal reaction Abstract: Unnatural amino acids with bioorthogonal reactive groups have the potential to provide a rapid and specific mechanism for covalently inhibiting a protein of interest. Here, we use mutagenesis to insert an unnatural amino acid containing an azide group (Z) into the target protein at positions such that a "click" reaction with an alkyne modulator (X) will alter the function of the protein. This bioorthogonally reactive pair can engender specificity of X for the Z-containing protein, even if the target is otherwise identical to another protein, allowing for rapid target validation in living cells. We demonstrate our method using inhibition of the Escherichia coli enzyme aminoacyl transferase by both active-site occlusion and allosteric mechanisms. We have termed this a "clickable magic bullet" strategy, and it should be generally applicable to studying the effects of protein inhibition, within the limits of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis.	0
Title: A Conserved Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase in Xenorhabdus bovienii Produces Citrulline-Functionalized Lipopeptides Abstract: The entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii exists in a mutualistic relationship with nematodes of the genus Steinernema. Free-living infective juveniles of Steinernema prey on insect larvae and regurgitate X. bovienii within the hemocoel of a host larva. X. bovienii subsequently produces a complex array of specialized metabolites and effector proteins that kill the insect and regulate various aspects of the trilateral symbiosis. While Xenorhabdus species are rich producers of secondary metabolites, many of their biosynthetic gene clusters remain uncharacterized. Here, we describe a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) identified through comparative genomics analysis that is widely conserved in Xenorhabdus species. Heterologous expression of this NRPS gene from X. bovienii in E. coli led to the discovery of a family of lipo-tripeptides that chromatographically appear as pairs, containing either a C-terminal carboxylic acid or carboxamide. Coexpression of the NRPS with the leupeptin protease inhibitor pathway enhanced production, facilitating isolation and characterization efforts. The new lipo-tripeptides were also detected in wild-type X. bovienii cultures. These metabolites, termed bovienimides, share an uncommon C-terminal d-citrulline residue. The NRPS lacked a dedicated chain termination domain, resulting in product diversification and release from the assembly line through reactions with ammonia, water, or exogenous alcohols.	1
Title: Lasso peptides from proteobacteria: Genome mining employing heterologous expression and mass spectrometry Abstract: Lasso peptides are natural products with a unique three dimensional structure resembling a lariat knot. They are from ribosomal origin and are post-translationally modified by two enzymes (B and C), one of which shares little similarity to enzymes outside of lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters and as such is a useful target for genome mining. In this study, we demonstrate a B protein-centric genome mining approach through which we were able to identify 102 putative lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters from a total of 87 different proteobacterial strains. Ten of these clusters were cloned into the pET41a expression vector, optimized through incorporation of a ribosomal binding site and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). All 12 predicted lasso peptides (namely burhizin, caulonodin I, caulonodin II, caulonodin III, rhodanodin, rubrivinodin, sphingonodin I, sphingonodin II, syanodin I, sphingopyxin I, sphingopyxin II, and zucinodin) were detected by high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry and their proposed primary structure was confirmed through tandem mass spectrometry. High yields (ranging from 0.4 to 5.2 mg/L) were observable for eight of these compounds, while thermostability assays revealed five new representatives of heat labile lasso peptides.	1
Title: Urdamycins, new angucycline antibiotics from Streptomyces fradiae. IV. Biosynthetic studies of urdamycins A-D Abstract: The biogenetic origin of the angucycline antibiotics urdamycins A-D was studied by feeding experiments with isotope labeled precursors and by NMR analysis. Feeding experiments with [1-13C]acetate and [1,2-13C2]acetate show that the chromophores of urdamycins A and B and the angucycline 4-ring skeleton of the urdamycins C and D chromophores are formed from a single decapolyketide chain. The chromophores of the urdamycins C and D contain additional structural elements which derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. The latter was shown by feeding deuterium-labeled tyrosine and 13C-labeled tryptophan derivatives. Feeding of [1-13C]glucose and of [U-13C3]glycerol proved that the C-glycosidic moiety and the three sugars (2 x L-rhodinose, 1 x D-olivose each) of the urdamycins arise from glucose. Experiments with 14C-labeled urdamycin A, obtained by biosynthesis from [14C]acetate, showed this compound to be a late precursor of the urdamycins C and D.	1
Title: Fabclavine biosynthesis in X. szentirmaii: shortened derivatives and characterization of the thioester reductase FclG and the condensation domain-like protein FclL Abstract: Fabclavines, unusual peptide-polyketide-polyamine hybrids, show broad-spectrum bioactivity against a variety of different organism like Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa. We elucidated the biosynthesis of these NRPS-PKS hybrids in Xenorhabdus szentirmaii by deletion of most genes encoded in the fabclavine BGC and subsequent analysis of produced fabclavine or polyamine intermediates. Thereby, we identified shortened fabclavines similar to the bioactive zeamines. Furthermore, we analyzed the thioester reductase FclG and the free-standing condensation domain-like protein FclL in detail and observed low substrate specificity for both enzymes.	1
Title: Protein Patterns and Oscillations on Lipid Monolayers and in Microdroplets Abstract: The Min proteins from E.coli position the bacterial cell-division machinery through pole-to-pole oscillations. In vitro, Min protein self-organization can be reconstituted in the presence of a lipid membrane as a catalytic surface. However, Min dynamics have so far not been reconstituted in fully membrane-enclosed volumes. Microdroplets interfaced by lipid monolayers were employed as a simple 3D mimic of cellular compartments to reconstitute Min protein oscillations. We demonstrate that lipid monolayers are sufficient to fulfil the catalytic role of the membrane and thus represent a facile platform to investigate Min protein regulated dynamics of the cell-division protein FtsZ-mts. In particular, we show that droplet containers reveal distinct Min oscillation modes, and reveal a dependence of FtsZ-mts structures on compartment size. Finally, co-reconstitution of Min proteins and FtsZ-mts in droplets yields antagonistic localization, thus demonstrating that droplets indeed support the analysis of complex bacterial self-organization in confined volumes.	0
Title: Tandem prenyltransferases catalyze isoprenoid elongation and complexity generation in biosynthesis of quinolone alkaloids Abstract: Modification of natural products with prenyl groups and the ensuing oxidative transformations are important for introducing structural complexity and biological activities. Penigequinolones (1) are potent insecticidal alkaloids that contain a highly modified 10-carbon prenyl group. Here we reveal an iterative prenylation mechanism for installing the 10-carbon unit using two aromatic prenyltransferases (PenI and PenG) present in the gene cluster of 1 from Penicillium thymicola. The initial Friedel-Crafts alkylation is catalyzed by PenI to yield dimethylallyl quinolone 6. The five-carbon side chain is then dehydrogenated by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase to give aryl diene 9, which serves as the electron-rich substrate for a second alkylation with dimethylallyl diphosphate to yield stryrenyl product 10. The completed, oxidized 10-carbon prenyl group then undergoes further structural morphing to yield yaequinolone C (12), the immediate precursor of 1. Our studies have therefore uncovered an unprecedented prenyl chain extension mechanism in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Ketopremithramycins and ketomithramycins, four new aureolic acid-type compounds obtained upon inactivation of two genes involved in the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moieties of the antitumor drug mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus, reveal novel insights into post-PKS tailoring steps of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Mithramycin is an aureolic acid-type antimicrobial and antitumor agent produced by Streptomyces argillaceus. Modifying post-polyketide synthase (PKS) tailoring enzymes involved in the production of mithramycin is an effective way of gaining further information regarding the late steps of its biosynthetic pathway. In addition, new "unnatural" natural products of the aureolic acid-type class are likely to be produced. The role of two such post-PKS tailoring enzymes, encoded by mtmC and mtmTIII, was investigated, and four novel aureolic acid class drugs, two premithramycin-type molecules and two mithramycin derivatives, were isolated from mutant strains constructed by insertional gene inactivation of either of these two genes. From data bank comparisons, the corresponding proteins MtmC and MtmTIII were believed to act as a C-methyltransferase involved in the production of the D-mycarose (sugar E) of mithramycin and as a ketoreductase seemingly involved in the biosynthesis of the mithramycin aglycon, respectively. However, gene inactivation and analysis of the accumulated products revealed that both genes encode enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of the D-mycarose building block. Furthermore, the inactivation of MtmC seems to affect the ketoreductase responsible for 4-ketoreduction of sugar C, a D-olivose. Instead of obtaining premithramycin and mithramycin derivatives with a modified E-sugar upon inactivation of mtmC, compounds were obtained that completely lack the E-sugar moiety and that possess an unexpected 4-ketosugar moiety instead of the D-olivose at the beginning of the lower deoxysaccharide chain. The inactivation of mtmTIII led to the accumulation of 4E-ketomithramycin, showing that this ketoreductase is responsible for the 4-ketoreduction of the D-mycarose moiety. The new compounds of the mutant strains, 4A-ketopremithramycin A2, 4A-keto-9-demethylpremithramycin A2, 4C-keto-demycarosylmithramycin, and 4E-ketomithramycin, indicate surprising substrate flexibility of post-PKS enzymes of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway. Although the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of D-mycarose cannot transfer the unmethylated sugar to the existing lower disaccharide chain, it can transfer the 4-ketoform of sugar E. In addition, the glycosyltransferase MtmGIV, which is responsible for the linkage of sugar C, is also able to transfer an activated 4-ketosugar. The oxygenase MtmOIV, normally responsible for the oxidative cleavage of the tetracyclic premithramycin B into the tricyclic immediate precursor of mithramycin, can act on a substrate analogue with a modified or even incomplete trisaccharide chain. The same is true for glycosyltransferases MtmGI and MtmGII, both of which partake in the formation and attachment of the A-B disaccharide in mithramycin.	1
Title: CLM1 of Fusarium graminearum encodes a longiborneol synthase required for culmorin production Abstract: Fusarium graminearum is a fungal pathogen of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, barley, maize) and produces a number of mycotoxins, including 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, butenolide, zearalenone, and culmorin. To identify a biosynthetic gene for the culmorin pathway, an expressed-sequence-tag database was examined for terpene cyclase genes. A gene designated CLM1 was expressed under trichothecene-inducing conditions. Expression of CLM1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) resulted in the production of a sesquiterpene alcohol, longiborneol, which has the same ring structure as culmorin. Gene disruption and add-back experiments in F. graminearum showed that CLM1 was required for culmorin biosynthesis. CLM1 gene disruptants were able to convert exogenously added longiborneol to culmorin. Longiborneol accumulated transiently in culmorin-producing strains. The results indicate that CLM1 encodes a longiborneol synthase and is required for culmorin biosynthesis in F. graminearum.	1
Title: The biosynthetic pathway for aurofusarin in Fusarium graminearum reveals a close link between the naphthoquinones and naphthopyrones Abstract: Fungal polyketide biosynthesis typically involves multiple enzymatic steps and the encoding genes are often found in gene clusters. A gene cluster containing PKS12, the polyketide synthase gene responsible for the synthesis of the pigment aurofusarin, was analysed by gene replacement using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation to determine the biosynthesis pathway of aurofusarin. Replacement of aurR1 with hygB shows that it encodes a positively acting transcription factor that is required for the full expression of PKS12, aurJ, aurF, gip1 and FG02329.1, which belong to the gene cluster. AurR1 and PKS12 deletion mutants are unable to produce aurofusarin and rubrofusarin. Bio- and chemoinformatics combined with chemical analysis of replacement mutants (DeltaaurJ, DeltaaurF, Deltagip1, DeltaaurO and DeltaPKS12) indicate a five-step enzyme catalysed pathway for the biosynthesis of aurofusarin, with rubrofusarin as an intermediate. This links the biosynthesis of naphthopyrones and naphthoquinones together. Replacement of the putative transcription factor aurR2 results in an increased level of rubrofusarin relative to aurofusarin. Gip1, a putative laccase, is proposed to be responsible for the dimerization of two oxidized rubrofusarin molecules resulting in the formation of aurofusarin.	1
Title: Secondary structure of the lac repressor DNA-binding domain by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance in solution Abstract: A recently proposed approach for spatial structure determination in noncrystalline proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance was applied to the lac repressor DNA-binding domain. On the basis of sequence-specific 1H NMR assignments, the location of alpha-helices in the amino acid sequence was determined from nuclear Overhauser enhancement data and from amide proton exchange studies. These investigations provide detailed experimental data on the structure of a noncrystalline DNA-binding protein. The results support the hypothesis advanced by others that sequence-specific interactions between lac repressor and DNA are mediated by a particular spatial arrangement of two alpha-helices common to various different DNA-binding proteins.	0
Title: Amplification of the entire kanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster during empirical strain improvement of Streptomyces kanamyceticus Abstract: Streptomyces kanamyceticus 12-6 is a derivative of the wild-type strain developed for industrial kanamycin (Km) production. Southern analysis and DNA sequencing revealed amplification of a large genomic segment including the entire Km biosynthetic gene cluster in the chromosome of strain 12-6. At 145 kb, the amplifiable unit of DNA (AUD) is the largest AUD reported in Streptomyces. Striking repetitive DNA sequences belonging to the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats family were found in the AUD and may play a role in its amplification. Strain 12-6 contains a mixture of different chromosomes with varying numbers of AUDs, sometimes exceeding 36 copies and producing an amplified region >5.7 Mb. The level of Km production depended on the copy number of the Km biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that DNA amplification occurred during strain improvement as a consequence of selection for increased Km resistance. Amplification of DNA segments including entire antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters might be a common mechanism leading to increased antibiotic production in industrial strains.	1
Title: Anticancer and multidrug resistance-reversal effects of solanidine analogs synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate Abstract: A set of solanidine analogs with antiproliferative properties were recently synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate, which occurs in Nature. The aim of the present study was an in vitro characterization of their antiproliferative action and an investigation of their multidrug resistance-reversal activity on cancer cells. Six of the compounds elicited the accumulation of a hypodiploid population of HeLa cells, indicating their apoptosis-inducing character, and another one caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The most effective agents inhibited the activity of topoisomerase I, as evidenced by plasmid supercoil relaxation assays. One of the most potent analogs down-regulated the expression of cell-cycle related genes at the mRNA level, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and induced growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45 alpha. Some of the investigated compounds inhibited the ABCB1 transporter and caused rhodamine-123 accumulation in murine lymphoma cells transfected by human MDR1 gene, expressing the efflux pump (L5178). One of the most active agents in this aspect potentiated the antiproliferative action of doxorubicin without substantial intrinsic cytostatic capacity. The current results indicate that the modified solanidine skeleton is a suitable substrate for the rational design and synthesis of further innovative drug candidates with anticancer activities.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of sorangipyranone - a new γ-dihydropyrone from the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 Abstract: Sorangipyranone was isolated as a novel natural product featuring a unique 2,3-dihydro-γ-4H-pyrone scaffold from cultures of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020. We report here the full structure elucidation of sorangipyranone by spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry together with the analysis of the biosynthetic pathway. Determination of the absolute configuration was performed by time-dependent density functional theory-electronic circular dichroism calculations and determination of the applicability of the Snatzke's helicity rule, to correlate the high-wavelength n→π* electronic circular dichroism (ECD) transition and the absolute configuration of the 2,3-dihydro-4H-γ-pyrone, was done by the analysis of low-energy conformers and the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Sorangipyranone outlines a new class of a γ-dihydropyrone-containing natural product comprised of malonyl-CoA-derived building blocks and features a unique polyketide scaffold. In silico analysis of the genome sequence of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 complemented with feeding experiments employing stable isotope-labeled precursors allowed the identification and annotation of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. A model for the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the γ-dihydropyrone scaffold is presented in this study.	1
Title: Catalytic promiscuity of a bacterial α-N-methyltransferase Abstract: The posttranslational methylation of N-terminal α-amino groups (α-N-methylation) is a ubiquitous reaction found in all domains of life. Although this modification usually occurs on protein substrates, recent studies have shown that it also takes place on ribosomally synthesized natural products. Here we report an investigation of the bacterial α-N-methyltransferase CypM involved in the biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotic cypemycin. We demonstrate that CypM has low substrate selectivity and methylates a variety of oligopeptides, cyclic peptides such as nisin and haloduracin, and the ε-amino group of lysine. Hence it may have potential for enzyme engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis. Bayesian phylogenetic inference of bacterial α-N-methyltransferases suggests that they have not evolved as a specific group based on the chemical transformations they catalyze, but that they have been acquired from various other methyltransferase classes during evolution.	1
Title: Designed peptides that assemble into cross-α amyloid-like structures Abstract: Amyloids adopt 'cross-β' structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with β-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-α structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted β-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-α amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170 Å to 200 Å. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.	0
Title: Adhesion and aggregation properties of Lactobacillaceae strains as protection ways against enteropathogenic bacteria Abstract: The adhesion and aggregation are characteristic attributes of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillaceae genus. Due to these properties the host organisms can avoid colonisation of the intestinal tract by enteropathogenic bacteria. The presented research includes a comparison of the properties of various strains belonging to different Lactobacillaceae species and isolated from different sources The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. ultunensis) from probiotic products and clinical specimens to direct and competitive adherence to Caco-2 and HT-29 cell lines. Furthermore, the ability of lactobacilli and enteropathogenic bacteria, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. Typhimurium, to auto- and co-aggregation was also investigated.The results showed that all tested strains adhered to Caco-2 and HT-29 cell lines. Though, the factor of adhesion depended on the species and origin of the strain. L. rhamnosus strains showed a lowest degree of adherence as compared to L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sp. strains. On the other side both, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus strains reduced the pathogenic bacteria in competition adherence test most effectively. All tested lactobacilli strains were characterised by auto- and co-aggregation abilities, to various degrees. The properties of Lactobacillaceae strains analysed in this study, like adhesion abilities, competitive adherence, auto- and co-aggregation, may affect the prevention of colonisation and elimination of pathogenic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract.	0
Title: Photoaffinity labeling reveals nuclear proteins that uniquely recognize cisplatin-DNA interstrand cross-links Abstract: The DNA-binding inorganic compound cisplatin is one of the most successful anticancer drugs. The detailed mechanism by which cells recognize and process cisplatin-DNA damage is of great interest. Although the family of proteins that bind cisplatin 1,2- and 1,3-intrastrand cross-links has been identified, much less is known about cellular protein interactions with cisplatin interstrand cross-links (ICLs). In order to address this question, a photoreactive analogue of cisplatin, PtBP(6), was used to construct a DNA duplex containing a site-specific platinum ICL. This DNA probe was characterized and used in photo-cross-linking experiments to separate and identify nuclear proteins that bind to the ICL by peptide mass fingerprint analysis. Several such proteins were discovered, including PARP-1, hMutSbeta, DNA ligase III, XRCC1, and PNK. The photo-cross-linking approach was independently validated by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrating hMutSbeta binding to a cisplatin ICL. Proteins that recognize the platinum ICL were also identified in cisplatin-resistant cells, cells halted at various phases of the cell cycle, and in different carcinoma cells. Nuclear proteins that bind to the platinum ICL differ from those binding to intrastrand cross-links, indicating different mechanisms for disruption of cellular functions.	0
Title: Detection of miRNA expression in intact cells using activatable sensor oligonucleotides Abstract: We describe a technology for the profiling of miRNA expression in intact cells. The technology is based on sensor oligonucleotides that are cleavable, completely complementary to a target miRNA, and dual-labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher. Upon entering the cell, the sensor oligonucleotide binds its specific miRNA target through complementary base-pairing. This triggers assembly of the endogenous RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) around the miRNA-sensor duplex and cleavage of the sensor oligonucleotide, resulting in separation between the dye and quencher, and a fluorescence turn-on. In the presented feasibility studies, we focus on a specific miRNA (miR-10b) implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Using a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we illustrate the application of this technology for miRNA detection with nanomolar sensitivity in both a cell-free system and intact cells.	0
Title: Aromatic-aromatic interactions enhance interfiber contacts for enzymatic formation of a spontaneously aligned supramolecular hydrogel Abstract: Anisotropy or alignment is a critical feature of functional soft materials in living organisms, but it remains a challenge for spontaneously generating anisotropic gel materials. Here we report a molecular design that increases intermolecular aromatic-aromatic interactions of hydrogelators during enzymatic hydrogelation for spontaneously forming an anisotropic hydrogel. This process, relying on both aromatic-aromatic interactions and enzyme catalysis, results in spontaneously aligned supramolecular nanofibers as the matrices of a monodomain hydrogel that exhibits significant birefringence. This work, as the first example of monodomain hydrogels formed via an enzymatic reaction, illustrates a new biomimetic approach for generating aligned anisotropic soft materials.	0
Title: Temporal sequence of events during the initiation process in Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid replication: roles of the dnaA and dnaC gene products and ribonucleic acid polymerase Abstract: Three thermosensitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) initiation mutants of Escherichia coli exposed to the restrictive temperature for one to two generations were examined for the ability to reinitiate DNA replication after returning to the permissive temperature in the presence of rifampin, chloramphenicol, or nalidixic acid. Reinitiation in the dnaA mutant was inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas renitiation was not inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas reinitiation was not inhibited in two dnaC mutants by either rifampin or chloramphenicol. To observe the rifampin inhibition, the antibiotic must be added at least 10 min before return to the permissive temperature. The rifampin inhibition of reinitiation was not observed when a rifampin-resistant ribonucleic acid ((RNA) polymerase gene was introduced into the dnaA mutant, demonstrating that RNA polymerase synthesizes one or more RNA species required for the initation of DNA replication (origin-RNA). Reinitiation at 30 degrees C was not inhibited by streptolydigin in a stretolydigin-sensitive dnaA muntant. Incubation in the presence of nalidixic acid prevented subsequent reinitiation in the dnaC28 mutant but did not inhibit reinitiation in the dnaA5 muntant. These results demonstrate that the dnaA gene product acts before or during the synthesis of an origin-RNA, RNA polymerase synthesizes this origin RNA, and the dnaC gene product is involved in a step after this RNA synthesis event. Furthermore, these results suggest that the dnaC gene product is involved in the first deoxyribounucleotide polymerization event wheareas the dnaA gene product acts prior to this event. A model is presented describing the temporal sequence of events that occur during initiation of a round of DNA replication, based on results in this and the accompanying paper.	0
Title: The aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A is inactivated by a phosphotransferase activity from Streptomyces capreolus NRRL 3817, the producing organism. Isolation and molecular characterization of the relevant encoding gene and its DNA flanking regions Abstract: A novel resistance determinant (ard2) to the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A was cloned from Streptomyces capreolus NRRL 3817, the producing organism, and expressed in Streptomyces lividans. Sequencing and subcloning experiments of a 3-kb fragment localized ard2 to an ORF of 591 nucleotides. Cell-free extracts from both S. capreolus and S. lividans (ard2) were shown to phosphorylate A201A in an ATP-dependent reaction. The resulting product (P-A201A) was purified and shown to lack any detectable biological activity against a gram-positive indicator organism. Phosphorylation by Ard2 takes place on the hydroxyl group at C2 of the unsaturated hexofuranose moiety of A201A, as shown by 1H-NMR analysis of purified P-A201A. The expression of ard2 appears to be developmentally controlled. In addition to ard2, the sequenced DNA fragment contained two incomplete ORFs (2 and 5) and one complete ORF (4), which appear to determine enzymes of the A201A biosynthetic pathway. Whereas the deduced product of ORF2 did not show any similarity to proteins in data banks, those of ORF5 and ORF4 encode putative glycosyltransferase and ketoreductase activities, respectively. ard2 and these three ORFs seem to be transcribed in a single polycistronic transcript, which supports the notion that they are a part of an A201A biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: Photoaffinity probes for nematode pheromone receptor identification Abstract: Identification of pheromone receptors plays a central role for uncovering signaling pathways that underlie chemical communication in animals. Here, we describe the synthesis and bioactivity of photoaffinity probes for the ascaroside ascr#8, a sex-pheromone of the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Structure-activity studies guided incorporation of alkyne- and diazirine-moieties and revealed that addition of functionality in the sidechain of ascr#8 was well tolerated, whereas modifications to the ascarylose moiety resulted in loss of biological activity. Our study will guide future probe design and provides a basis for pheromone receptor identification via photoaffinity labeling in C. elegans.	0
Title: The Aspergillus fumigatus septins play pleiotropic roles in septation, conidiation, and cell wall stress, but are dispensable for virulence Abstract: Septins are a conserved family of GTPases that regulate important cellular processes such as cell wall integrity, and septation in fungi. The requirement of septins for virulence has been demonstrated in the human pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, as well as the plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Aspergillus spp. contains five genes encoding for septins (aspA-E). While the importance of septins AspA, AspB, AspC, and AspE for growth and conidiation has been elucidated in the filamentous fungal model Aspergillus nidulans, nothing is known on the role of septins in growth and virulence in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we deleted all five A. fumigatus septins, and generated certain double and triple septin deletion strains. Phenotypic analyses revealed that while all the septins are dispensable in normal growth conditions, AspA, AspB, AspC and AspE are required for regular septation. Furthermore, deletion of only the core septin genes significantly reduced conidiation. Concomitant with the absence of an electron-dense outer conidial wall, the ΔaspB strain was also sensitive to anti-cell wall agents. Infection with the ΔaspB strain in a Galleria mellonella model of invasive aspergillosis showed hypervirulence, but no virulence difference was noted when compared to the wild-type strain in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Although the deletion of aspB resulted in increased release of TNF-α from the macrophages, no significant inflammation differences in lung histology was noted between the ΔaspB strain and the wild-type strain. Taken together, these results point to the importance of septins in A. fumigatus growth, but not virulence in a murine model.	0
Title: Design, synthesis, and kinetic analysis of potent protein N-terminal methyltransferase 1 inhibitors Abstract: The protein N-terminal methyltransferase 1 (NTMT1) methylates the α-N-terminal amines of proteins. NTMT1 is upregulated in a variety of cancers and knockdown of NTMT1 results in cell mitotic defects. Therefore, NTMT1 inhibitors could be potential anticancer therapeutics. This study describes the design and synthesis of the first inhibitor targeting NTMT1. A novel bisubstrate analogue (NAM-TZ-SPKRIA) was shown to be a potent inhibitor (Ki = 0.20 μM) for NTMT1 and was selective versus protein lysine methyltransferase G9a and arginine methyltransferase 1. NAM-TZ-SPKRIA was found to exhibit a competitive inhibition pattern for both substrates, and mass spectrometry experiments revealed that the inhibitor substantially suppressed the methylation progression. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a triazole group to link an S-adenosyl-L-methionine analog with a peptide substrate to construct bisubstrate analogues as NTMT1 potent and selective inhibitors. This study lays a foundation to further discover small molecule NTMT1 inhibitors to interrogate its biological functions, and suggests a general strategy for the development of selective protein methyltransferase inhibitors.	0
Title: Epoxide hydrolase Lsd19 for polyether formation in the biosynthesis of lasalocid A: direct experimental evidence on polyene-polyepoxide hypothesis in polyether biosynthesis Abstract: Polyether metabolites are an important class of natural products. Although their biosynthesis, especially construction of polyether skeletons, attracted organic chemists for many years, no experimental data on the enzymatic polyether formation has been obtained. In this study, a putative epoxide hydrolase gene lsd19 found on the biosynthetic gene cluster of an ionophore polyether lasalocid was cloned and successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Using the purified Lsd19, a proposed substrate, bisepoxyprelasalocid, and its synthesized analogue were successfully converted into lasalocid A and its derivative via a 6-endo-tet cyclization mode. On the other hand, treatment of the bisepoxide with trichloroacetic acid gave isolasalocid A via a 5-exo-tet cyclization mode. Therefore, the enzymatic conversion observed in this study unambiguously showed that the bisepoxyprelasalocid is an intermediate of the lasalocid biosynthesis and that Lsd19 catalyzes the sequential cyclic ether formations involving an energetically disfavored 6-endo-tet cyclization. This is the first example of the enzymatic epoxide-opening reactions leading to a polyether natural product.	1
Title: Biochemical and structural insights of the early glycosylation steps in calicheamicin biosynthesis Abstract: The enediyne antibiotic calicheamicin (CLM) gamma(1)(I) is a prominent antitumor agent that is targeted to DNA by a novel aryltetrasaccharide comprised of an aromatic unit and four unusual carbohydrates. Herein we report the heterologous expression and the biochemical characterization of the two "internal" glycosyltransferases CalG3 and CalG2 and the structural elucidation of an enediyne glycosyltransferase (CalG3). In conjunction with the previous characterization of the "external" CLM GTs CalG1 and CalG4, this study completes the functional assignment of all four CLM GTs, extends the utility of enediyne GT-catalyzed reaction reversibility, and presents conclusive evidence of a sequential glycosylation pathway in CLM biosynthesis. This work also reveals the common GT-B structural fold can now be extended to include enediyne GTs.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of endophytic colonizing bacteria from agronomic crops and prairie plants Abstract: Endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without causing disease symptoms. In this study, 853 endophytic strains were isolated from aerial tissues of four agronomic crop species and 27 prairie plant species. We determined several phenotypic properties and found approximately equal numbers of gram-negative and gram-positive isolates. In a greenhouse study, 28 of 86 prairie plant endophytes were found to colonize their original hosts at 42 days postinoculation at levels of 3.5 to 7.7 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). More comprehensive colonization studies were conducted with 373 corn and sorghum endophytes. In growth room studies, none of the isolates displayed pathogenicity, and 69 of the strains were recovered from corn or sorghum seedlings at levels of 8.3 log(10) CFU/plant or higher. Host range greenhouse studies demonstrated that 26 of 29 endophytes were recoverable from at least one host other than corn and sorghum at levels of up to 5.8 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). Long-range dent corn greenhouse studies and field trials with 17 wild-type strains and 14 antibiotic-resistant mutants demonstrated bacterial persistence at significant average colonization levels ranging between 3.4 and 6.1 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight) up to 78 days postinoculation. Three prairie and three agronomic endophytes exhibiting the most promising levels of colonization and an ability to persist were identified as Cellulomonas, Clavibacter, Curtobacterium, and Microbacterium isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence, fatty acid, and carbon source utilization analyses. This study defines for the first time the endophytic nature of Microbacterium testaceum. These microorganisms may be useful for biocontrol and other applications.	0
Title: Type III secretion system 1 of Vibrio parahaemolyticus induces oncosis in both epithelial and monocytic cell lines Abstract: The Vibrio parahaemolyticus type III secretion system 1 (T3SS1) induces cytotoxicity in mammalian epithelial cells. We characterized the cell death phenotype in both epithelial (HeLa) and monocytic (U937) cell lines following infection with V. parahaemolyticus. Using a combination of the wild-type strain and gene knockouts, we confirmed that V. parahaemolyticus strain NY-4 was able to induce cell death in both cell lines via a T3SS1-dependent mechanism. Bacterial contact, but not internalization, was required for T3SS1-induced cytotoxicity. The mechanism of cell death involves formation of a pore structure on the surface of infected HeLa and U937 cells, as demonstrated by cellular swelling, uptake of cell membrane-impermeable dye and protection of cytotoxicity by osmoprotectant (PEG3350). Western blot analysis showed that poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) was not cleaved and remained in its full-length active form. This result was evident for seven different V. parahaemolyticus strains. V. parahaemolyticus-induced cytotoxicity was not inhibited by addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) or the caspase-1 inhibitor N-acetyl-tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO); thus, caspases were not involved in T3SS1-induced cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation was not evident following infection and autophagic vacuoles were not observed after monodansylcadaverine staining. We conclude that T3SS1 of V. parahaemolyticus strain NY-4 induces a host cell death primarily via oncosis rather than apoptosis, pyroptosis or autophagy.	0
Title: The reductase domain in a Type I fatty acid synthase from the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum: restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters Abstract: Background:                       The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum genome possesses a 25-kb intronless open reading frame (ORF) that predicts a multifunctional Type I fatty acid synthase (CpFAS1) with at least 21 enzymatic domains. Although the architecture of CpFAS1 resembles those of bacterial polyketide synthases (PKSs), this megasynthase is predicted to function as a fatty acyl elongase as our earlier studies have indicated that the N-terminal loading unit (acyl-[ACP] ligase) prefers using intermediate to long chain fatty acids as substrates, and each of the three internal elongation modules contains a complete set of enzymes to produce a saturated fatty acyl chain. Although the activities of almost all domains were confirmed using recombinant proteins, that of the C-terminal reductase domain (CpFAS1-R) was yet undetermined. In fact, there were no published studies to report the kinetic features of any reductase domains in bacterial PKSs using purified recombinant or native proteins.                  Results:                       In the present study, the identity of CpFAS1-R as a reductase is confirmed by in silico analysis on sequence similarity and characteristic motifs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the R-domains supports a previous notion on the bacterial origin of apicomplexan Type I FAS/PKS genes. We also developed a novel assay using fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, and determined that CpFAS1-R could only utilize very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates (i.e., with activity on C26 > C24 > C22 > C20, but no activity on C18 and C16). It was capable of using both NADPH and NADH as electron donors, but prefers NADPH to NADH. The activity of CpFAS1-R displayed allosteric kinetics towards C26 hexacosanoyl CoA as a substrate (h = 2.0; Vmax = 32.8 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein; and K50 = 0.91 mM).                  Conclusions:                       We have confirmed the activity of CpFAS1-R by directly assaying its substrate preference and kinetic parameters, which is for the first time for a Type I FAS, PKS or non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) reductase domain. The restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters may be an important feature for this megasynthase to avoid the release of product(s) with undesired lengths.	0
Title: Refactoring the silent spectinabilin gene cluster using a plug-and-play scaffold Abstract: Natural products (secondary metabolites) are a rich source of compounds with important biological activities. Eliciting pathway expression is always challenging but extremely important in natural product discovery because an individual pathway is tightly controlled through a unique regulation mechanism and hence often remains silent under the routine culturing conditions. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches that lack general applicability, we developed a simple synthetic biology approach that decouples pathway expression from complex native regulations. Briefly, the entire silent biosynthetic pathway is refactored using a plug-and-play scaffold and a set of heterologous promoters that are functional in a heterologous host under the target culturing condition. Using this strategy, we successfully awakened the silent spectinabilin pathway from Streptomyces orinoci. This strategy bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit pathway expression and represents a new platform for discovering novel natural products.	1
Title: 5-thiomannosides block the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides and mimic class I congenital disorders of glycosylation Abstract: In a cell-based assay for novel inhibitors, we have discovered that two glycosides of 5-thiomannose, each containing an interglycosidic nitrogen atom, prevented the correct zymogen processing of the prohormone proopiomelanocortinin (POMC) and the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in mouse pituitary cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, respectively. In the case of SREBP-2, these effects were correlated with the altered N-linked glycosylation of subtilisin/kexin-like isozyme-1 (SKI-1), the protease responsible for SREBP-2 processing under sterol-limiting conditions. Further examination of the effects of these compounds in CHO cells showed that they cause extensive protein hypoglycosylation in a manner similar to type I congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) since the remaining N-glycans in treated cells were complete (normal) structures. The under-glycosylation of glycoproteins in 5-thiomannoside-treated cells is now shown to be caused by the compromised biosynthesis of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (DLO) N-glycosylation donor, although the nucleotide sugars required for the synthesis of DLOs were neither reduced under these conditions, nor were their effects reversed upon the addition of exogenous mannose. Analysis of DLO intermediates by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis demonstrated that 5-thiomannose-containing glycosides block DLO biosynthesis most likely at a stage prior to the GlcNAc(2) Man(3) intermediate, on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum.	0
Title: Genetic analysis of plasmid determinants for microcin J25 production and immunity Abstract: Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a small peptide antibiotic produced by an Escherichia coli strain isolated from human feces. The genetic determinants for MccJ25 synthesis and immunity have been cloned from the low-copy-number wild-type plasmid pTUC1OO into the compatible vectors pBR322 and pACYC184. Physical and phenotypical analysis of insertion mutations and complementation tests defined three contiguous genes involved in MccJ25 production which span a region of about 2.2 kb. Immunity to the antibiotic is provided by an additional gene adjacent to the production region.	1
Title: A cold oceanographic regime with high exploitation rates in the Northeast Pacific forecasts a collapse of the sardine stock Abstract: The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.	0
Title: The basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain of CIN85 regulate its interaction with c-Cbl and phosphatidic acid during epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis Abstract: Background:                       During EGFR internalization CIN85 bridges EGFR-Cbl complex, endocytic machinery and fusible membrane through the interactions of CIN85 with c-Cbl, endophilins and phosphatidic acid. These protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are mediated or regulated by the positively charged C-terminal coiled-coil domain of CIN85. However, the details of CIN85-lipid interaction remain unknown. The present study suggested a possible electric interaction between the negative charge of phosphatidic acid and the positive charge of basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain.                  Results:                       Mutations of the basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain, especially K645, K646, R648 and R650, into neutral amino acid alanine completely blocked the interaction of CIN85 with c-Cbl or phosphatidic acid. However, they did not affect CIN85-endophilin interaction. In addition, CIN85 was found to associate with the internalized EGFR endosomes. It interacted with several ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) component proteins for ESCRT assembly on endosomal membrane. Mutations in the coiled-coil domain (deletion of the coiled-coil domain or point mutations of the basic amino acids) dissociated CIN85 from endosomes. These mutants bound the ESCRT components in cytoplasm to prevent them from assembly on endosomal membrane and inhibited EGFR sorting for degradation.                  Conclusions:                       As an adaptor protein, CIN85 interacts with variety of partners through several domains. The positive charges of basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain are not only involved in the interaction with phosphatidic acid, but also regulate the interaction of CIN85 with c-Cbl. CIN85 also interacts with ESCRT components for protein sorting in endosomes. These CIN85-protein and CIN85-lipid interactions enable CIN85 to link EGFR-Cbl endocytic complex with fusible membrane during EGFR endocytosis and subsequently to facilitate ESCRT formation on endosomal membrane for EGFR sorting and degradation.	0
Title: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. IV. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of (3S,4R)-3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)acetamido]-4-methyl-1- (1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-azetidinones Abstract: The synthesis and in vitro activity of the 3-(O-substituted oxyiminoacetamido)-2-azetidinones (IV) possessing a tetrazole moiety at N-1 position are described. The introduction of lipophilic functions into the oxyimino moiety gave in some good activity against staphylococci, but decreased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, the introduction of hydrophilic functions such as carboxycyclobutane resulted in strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no or very small activity against the staphylococci.	0
Title: Probing the Interaction of Huntingtin Exon-1 Polypeptides with the Chaperonin Nanomachine GroEL Abstract: Huntington's disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon-1 region of huntingtin (httex1 ), resulting in an aggregation-prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various httex1 constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy, we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of httex1 constructs with intact GroEL and a mini-chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation-based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100 to 400 μs with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD ) of ∼1-2 mM. The binding interface is formed by the N-terminal amphiphilic region of httex1 (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric httex1 by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.	0
Title: Terrequinone A biosynthesis through L-tryptophan oxidation, dimerization and bisprenylation Abstract: The antitumor fungal metabolite terrequinone A, identified in extracts of Aspergillus sp., is biosynthesized by the five-gene cluster tdiA-tdiE. In this work, we have overproduced all five proteins (TdiA-TdiE) in the bacterial host Escherichia coli, fully reconstituting the biosynthesis of terrequinone A. This pathway involves aminotransferase activity, head-to-tail dimerization and bisprenylation of the scaffold to yield the benzoquinone natural product. We have established that TdiD is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent L-tryptophan aminotransferase that generates indolepyruvate for an unusual nonoxidative coupling by the tridomain nonribosomal peptide synthetase TdiA. TdiC, an NADH-dependent quinone reductase, generates the nucleophilic hydroquinone for two distinct rounds of prenylation by the single prenyltransferase TdiB. TdiE is required to shunt the benzoquinone away from an off-pathway monoprenylated species by an as yet unknown mechanism. Overall, we have biochemically characterized the complete biosynthetic pathway to terrequinone A, highlighting the nonoxidative dimerization pathway and the unique asymmetric prenylation involved in its maturation.	1
Title: Biological effects of paenilamicin, a secondary metabolite antibiotic produced by the honey bee pathogenic bacterium Paenibacillus larvae Abstract: Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood (AFB) a world-wide distributed devastating disease of the honey bee brood. Previous comparative genome analysis and more recently, the elucidation of the bacterial genome, provided evidence that this bacterium harbors putative functional nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) and therefore, might produce nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs). Such biosynthesis products have been shown to display a wide-range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activity. Herein we present an in silico analysis of the first NRPS/PKS hybrid of P. larvae and we show the involvement of this cluster in the production of a compound named paenilamicin (Pam). For the characterization of its in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, a knock-out mutant strain lacking the production of Pam was constructed and subsequently compared to wild-type species. This led to the identification of Pam by mass spectrometry. Purified Pam-fractions showed not only antibacterial but also antifungal and cytotoxic activities. The latter suggested a direct effect of Pam on honey bee larval death which could, however, not be corroborated in laboratory infection assays. Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death. We propose that Pam, although not essential for larval mortality, is a virulence factor of P. larvae influencing the time course of disease. These findings are not only of significance in elucidating and understanding host-pathogen interactions but also within the context of the quest for new compounds with antibiotic activity for drug development.	1
Title: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Title: Energy Transfer between Spatially Separated Entangled Molecules Abstract: Light-matter strong coupling allows for the possibility of entangling the wave functions of different molecules through the light field. We hereby present direct evidence of non-radiative energy transfer well beyond the Förster limit for spatially separated donor and acceptor cyanine dyes strongly coupled to a cavity. The transient dynamics and the static spectra show an energy transfer efficiency approaching 37 % for donor-acceptor distances ≥100 nm. In such systems, the energy transfer process becomes independent of distance as long as the coupling strength is maintained. This is consistent with the entangled and delocalized nature of the polaritonic states.	0
Title: Relevance of the endosymbiosis of Blochmannia floridanus and carpenter ants at different stages of the life cycle of the host Abstract: Expression of several genes possibly involved in the symbiotic relationship between the obligate intracellular endosymbiont Blochmannia floridanus and its ant host Camponotus floridanus was investigated at different developmental stages of the host by real-time quantitative PCR. These included a set of genes related to nitrogen metabolism (ureC, ureF, glnA, and speB) as well as genes involved in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine (tyrA, aspC, and hisC). The overall transcriptional activity of Blochmannia was found to be quite low during early developmental stages and to increase steadily with host age. However, a concerted peak of gene expression related to nitrogen recycling could be detected around the entire process of pupation, while expression of biosynthesis pathways for aromatic amino acids was elevated only during a short phase in pupation. These data suggest an important role of certain metabolic functions for the symbiotic interactions of the bacteria and an individual host organism in early phases of development. General relevance of Blochmannia for its ant host was tested in fostering experiments with worker groups of Camponotus floridanus, and their success in raising pupae from first-instar larvae was used as a fitness measure. Groups treated with antibiotics had a significantly reduced success in raising the brood in comparison to untreated control groups, indicating that the symbiosis is relevant for the development of the entire colony.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of two contiguous operons required for aerobactin transport and biosynthesis in Vibrio mimicus Abstract: In response to iron deprivation, Vibrio mimicus produces aerobactin as a major siderophore. Application of the Fur titration assay to a V. mimicus genomic DNA library followed by further cloning of the surrounding regions led to the identification of two adjacent, iron-regulated operons. One contains three genes encoding homologs of the Escherichia coli FhuCDB and the other, five genes encoding homologs of the E. coli IucABCD IutA. Construction of the V. mimicus polar disruptants in the respective operons allowed us to confirm their functions. The genetic arrangement of the aerobactin-mediated iron acquisition system in V. mimicus is unique in that the aerobactin operon (iucABCD iutA ) is contiguous to the operon (matCDB ) encoding components of an ATP-binding cassette transport system for ferric aerobactin. This is the first report demonstrating that aerobactin transport and biosynthesis genes are present in a species outside the family Enterobacteriaceae.	1
Title: Disruption of carotene biosynthesis leads to abnormal plastids and variegated leaves in Brassica napus Abstract: Leaf color is an important characteristic of normal chloroplast development. Variegated plants have green- and white-sectored leaves, which can be used to identify important pathways and molecular mechanisms of chloroplast development. We studied two Brassica napus variegation mutants from same one variegated ancestor, designated ZY-4 and ZY-8, which have different degrees of variegation. When grown in identical conditions, the ratio of white sectors in ZY-4 leaves is higher than in ZY-8. In both mutants, the cells in green sectors contain normal chloroplasts; while, the cells in white sectors contain abnormal plastids. Seedling chloroplasts ultrastructure of both mutants showed that the biogenesis of chloroplasts was blocked in early stages; delayed development and structual damage in ZY-4 were more serious than in ZY-8. Employing bulked segregant analysis(BSA), two bulks (BY142 and BY137) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-4 and ZS11, and one bulk (BY56) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-8 and ZS11, and screening by Brassica 60K SNP BeadChip Array, showed the candidate regions localized in chromosome A08 (BY142), C04 (BY137), and A08 (BY56), respectively. Transcriptome analysis of five seedling development stages of ZY-4, ZY-8, and ZS11 showed that photosynthesis, energy metabolism-related pathways and translation-related pathways were important for chloroplast biogenesis. The number of down- or up-regulated genes related to immune system process in ZY-4 was more than in ZY-8. The retrograde signaling pathway was mis-regulated in both mutants. DEG analysis indicated that both mutants showed photooxidative damages. By coupling transcriptome and BSA CHIP analyses, some candidate genes were identified. The gene expression pattern of carotene biosynthesis pathway was disrupted in both mutants. However, histochemical analysis of ROS revealed that there was no excessive accumulation of ROS in ZY-4 and ZY-8. Taken together, our data indicate that the disruption of carotene biosynthetic pathways leads to the variegation phenotypes of ZY-4 and ZY-8 and there are some functions that can compensate for the disruption of carotene biosynthesis in ZY-4 and ZY-8 to reduce ROS and prevent seedling mortality.	0
Title: Transcriptional analysis of the jamaicamide gene cluster from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula and identification of possible regulatory proteins Abstract: Background:                       The marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula is a prolific producer of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although biosynthetic gene clusters encoding several of these compounds have been identified, little is known about how these clusters of genes are transcribed or regulated, and techniques targeting genetic manipulation in Lyngbya strains have not yet been developed. We conducted transcriptional analyses of the jamaicamide gene cluster from a Jamaican strain of Lyngbya majuscula, and isolated proteins that could be involved in jamaicamide regulation.                  Results:                       An unusually long untranslated leader region of approximately 840 bp is located between the jamaicamide transcription start site (TSS) and gene cluster start codon. All of the intergenic regions between the pathway ORFs were transcribed into RNA in RT-PCR experiments; however, a promoter prediction program indicated the possible presence of promoters in multiple intergenic regions. Because the functionality of these promoters could not be verified in vivo, we used a reporter gene assay in E. coli to show that several of these intergenic regions, as well as the primary promoter preceding the TSS, are capable of driving beta-galactosidase production. A protein pulldown assay was also used to isolate proteins that may regulate the jamaicamide pathway. Pulldown experiments using the intergenic region upstream of jamA as a DNA probe isolated two proteins that were identified by LC-MS/MS. By BLAST analysis, one of these had close sequence identity to a regulatory protein in another cyanobacterial species. Protein comparisons suggest a possible correlation between secondary metabolism regulation and light dependent complementary chromatic adaptation. Electromobility shift assays were used to evaluate binding of the recombinant proteins to the jamaicamide promoter region.                  Conclusion:                       Insights into natural product regulation in cyanobacteria are of significant value to drug discovery and biotechnology. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize the transcription and regulation of secondary metabolism in a marine cyanobacterium. If jamaicamide is light regulated, this mechanism would be similar to other cyanobacterial natural product gene clusters such as microcystin LR. These findings could aid in understanding and potentially assisting the management of toxin production by Lyngbya in the environment.	1
Title: Isolation of a gene cluster from Armillaria gallica for the synthesis of armillyl orsellinate-type sesquiterpenoids Abstract: Melleolides and armillyl orsellinates are protoilludene-type aryl esters that are synthesized exclusively by parasitic fungi of the globally distributed genus Armillaria (Agaricomycetes, Physalacriaceae). Several of these compounds show potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, making them promising leads for the development of new antibiotics or drugs for the treatment of cancer. We recently cloned and characterized the Armillaria gallica gene Pro1 encoding protoilludene synthase, a sesquiterpene cyclase catalyzing the pathway-committing step to all protoilludene-type aryl esters. Fungal enzymes representing secondary metabolic pathways are sometimes encoded by gene clusters, so we hypothesized that the missing steps in the pathway to melleolides and armillyl orsellinates might be identified by cloning the genes surrounding Pro1. Here we report the isolation of an A. gallica gene cluster encoding protoilludene synthase and four cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Heterologous expression and functional analysis resulted in the identification of protoilludene-8α-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in the armillyl orsellinate pathway. This confirms that ∆-6-protoilludene is a precursor for the synthesis of both melleolides and armillyl orsellinates, but the two pathways already branch at the level of the first oxygenation step. Our results provide insight into the synthesis of these valuable natural products and pave the way for their production by metabolic engineering. KEY POINTS: • Protoilludene-type aryl esters are bioactive metabolites produced by Armillaria spp. • The pathway-committing step to these compounds is catalyzed by protoilludene synthase. • We characterized CYP-type enzymes in the cluster and identified novel intermediates.	1
Title: Tirandamycins from Streptomyces sp. 17944 inhibiting the parasite Brugia malayi asparagine tRNA synthetase Abstract: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the parasitic nematodes Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti, and asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) is considered an excellent antifilarial target. The discovery of three new tirandamycins (TAMs), TAM E (1), F (2), and G (3), along with TAM A (4) and B (5), from Streptomyces sp. 17944 was reported. Remarkably, 5 selectively inhibits the B. malayi AsnRS and efficiently kills the adult B. malayi parasite, representing a new lead scaffold to discover and develop antifilarial drugs.	0
Title: Iterative Catalysis in the Biosynthesis of Mitochondrial Complex II Inhibitors Harzianopyridone and Atpenin B Abstract: The pentasubstituted pyridine natural products harzianopyridone and atpenins are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial complex II. We identified the pathways of these compounds from their fungal producers and uncovered that the biosynthetic steps require multiple iterative enzymes. In particular, a methyltransferase and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase are used iteratively to introduce C5 and C6 methoxy groups. The pathway unexpectedly requires the installation and removal of an N-methoxy group, which is proposed to be a directing group that tunes the reactivity of the pyridone ring, possibly through the alpha effect.	1
Title: Substrate-dependent proton antiport in neurotransmitter:sodium symporters Abstract: Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions.	0
Title: Fluorescent visualization of Src by using dasatinib-BODIPY Abstract: Many biological experiments are not compatible with the use of immunofluorescence, genetically encoded fluorescent tags, or FRET-based reporters. Conjugation of existing kinase inhibitors to cell-permeable fluorophores can provide a generalized approach to develop fluorescent probes of intracellular kinases. Here, we report the development of a small molecule probe of Src through conjugation of BODIPY to two well-established dual Src-Abl kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and saracatinib. We show that this approach is not successful for saracatinib but that dasatinib-BODIPY largely retains the biological activity of its parent compound and can be used to monitor the presence of Src kinase in individual cells by flow cytometry. It can also be used to track the localization of Src by fixed and live-cell fluorescence microscopy. This strategy could enable generation of additional kinase-specific probes useful in systems not amenable to genetic manipulation or could be used together with fluorescent proteins to enable a multiplexed assay readout.	0
Title: Evolutionary formation of gene clusters by reorganization: the meleagrin/roquefortine paradigm in different fungi Abstract: The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in fungi is catalyzed by enzymes encoded by genes linked in clusters that are frequently co-regulated at the transcriptional level. Formation of gene clusters may take place by de novo assembly of genes recruited from other cellular functions, but also novel gene clusters are formed by reorganization of progenitor clusters and are distributed by horizontal gene transfer. This article reviews (i) the published information on the roquefortine/meleagrin/neoxaline gene clusters of Penicillium chrysogenum (Penicillium rubens) and the short roquefortine cluster of Penicillium roqueforti, and (ii) the correlation of the genes present in those clusters with the enzymes and metabolites derived from these pathways. The P. chrysogenum roq/mel cluster consists of seven genes and includes a gene (roqT) encoding a 12-TMS transporter protein of the MFS family. Interestingly, the orthologous P. roquefortine gene cluster has only four genes and the roqT gene is present as a residual pseudogene that encodes only small peptides. Two of the genes present in the central region of the P. chrysogenum roq/mel cluster have been lost during the evolutionary formation of the short cluster and the order of the structural genes in the cluster has been rearranged. The two lost genes encode a N1 atom hydroxylase (nox) and a roquefortine scaffold-reorganizing oxygenase (sro). As a consequence P. roqueforti has lost the ability to convert the roquefortine-type carbon skeleton to the glandicoline/meleagrin-type scaffold and is unable to produce glandicoline B, meleagrin and neoxaline. The loss of this genetic information is not recent and occurred probably millions of years ago when a progenitor Penicillium strain got adapted to life in a few rich habitats such as cheese, fermented cereal grains or silage. P. roqueforti may be considered as a "domesticated" variant of a progenitor common to contemporary P. chrysogenum and related Penicillia.	1
Title: Dependence of prePhoA-phospholipid interaction in vivo and in vitro on charge of signal peptide N-terminus and content of anionic phospholipids in membranes Abstract: Replacement of the positively charged signal peptide with neutral or negatively charged peptides due to substitution of Lys(-20) in the N-terminal region of the signal peptide leads to decreases in the rate of prePhoA membrane translocation in vivo and in the efficiency of prePhoA insertion into liposomes in vitro. The effect of anionic phospholipids on prePhoA insertion into model membranes is determined by the signal peptide N-terminus charge, while the dependence of prePhoA translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in vivo is not, under the studied variations in the content of anionic phospholipids. This is evidence of the possibility of direct electrostatic interaction between the signal peptide N-terminus and anionic phospholipids, which in vivo, however, seems to involve some proteins of the Sec machinery.	0
Title: Discovery of indolotryptoline antiproliferative agents by homology-guided metagenomic screening Abstract: Natural product discovery by random screening of broth extracts derived from cultured bacteria often suffers from high rates of redundant isolation, making it ever more challenging to identify novel biologically interesting natural products. Here we show that homology-based screening of soil metagenomes can be used to specifically target the discovery of new members of traditionally rare, biomedically relevant natural product families. Phylogenetic analysis of oxy-tryptophan dimerization gene homologs found within a large soil DNA library enabled the identification and recovery of a unique tryptophan dimerization biosynthetic gene cluster, which we have termed the bor cluster. When heterologously expressed in Streptomyces albus, this cluster produced an indolotryptoline antiproliferative agent with CaMKIIδ kinase inhibitory activity (borregomycin A), along with several dihydroxyindolocarbazole anticancer/antibiotics (borregomycins B-D). Similar homology-based screening of large environmental DNA libraries is likely to permit the directed discovery of new members within other previously rare families of bioactive natural products.	1
Title: Biosynthetic conclusions from the functional dissection of oxygenases for biosynthesis of actinorhodin and related Streptomyces antibiotics Abstract: Actinorhodin (ACT) produced by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) belongs to the benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) class of antibiotics. ActVA-ORF5, a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) essential for ACT biosynthesis, forms a two-component enzyme system in combination with a flavin:NADH oxidoreductase, ActVB. The genes for homologous two-component FMOs are found in the biosynthetic gene clusters for two other BIQs, granaticin (GRA) and medermycin (MED), and a closely related antibiotic, alnumycin (ALN). Our functional analysis of these FMOs (ActVA-ORF5, Gra-ORF21, Med-ORF7, and AlnT) in S. coelicolor unambiguously demonstrated that ActVA-ORF5 and Gra-ORF21 are bifunctional and capable of both p-quinone formation at C-6 in the central ring and C-8 hydroxylation in the lateral ring, whereas Med-ORF7 catalyzes only p-quinone formation. No p-quinone formation on a BIQ substrate was observed for AlnT, which is involved in lateral p-quinone formation in ALN.	1
Title: Deletion analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae late competence genes distinguishes virulence determinants that are dependent or independent of competence induction Abstract: The competence regulon of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is crucial for genetic transformation. During competence development, the alternative sigma factor ComX is activated, which in turn, initiates transcription of 80 'late' competence genes. Interestingly, only 16 late genes are essential for genetic transformation. We hypothesized that these late genes that are dispensable for competence are beneficial to pneumococcal fitness during infection. These late genes were systematically deleted, and the resulting mutants were examined for their fitness during mouse models of bacteremia and acute pneumonia. Among these, 14 late genes were important for fitness in mice. Significantly, deletion of some late genes attenuated pneumococcal fitness to the same level in both wild-type and ComX-null genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the constitutive baseline expression of these genes was important for bacterial fitness. In contrast, some mutants were attenuated only in the wild-type genetic background but not in the ComX-null background, suggesting that specific expression of these genes during competence state contributed to pneumococcal fitness. Increased virulence during competence state was partially caused by the induction of allolytic enzymes that enhanced pneumolysin release. These results distinguish the role of basal expression versus competence induction in virulence functions encoded by ComX-regulated late competence genes.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of EctR1, a new transcriptional regulator of the ectoine biosynthesis genes in the halotolerant methanotroph Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z Abstract: Genes encoding key enzymes of the ectoine biosynthesis pathway in the halotolerant obligate methanotroph Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z have been shown to be organized into an ectABC-ask operon. Transcription of the ect operon is initiated from two promoters, ectAp(1) and ectAp(2) (ectAp(1)p(2)), similar to the sigma(70)-dependent promoters of Escherichia coli. Upstream of the gene cluster, an open reading frame (ectR1) encoding a MarR-like transcriptional regulator was identified. Investigation of the influence of EctR1 on the activity of the ectAp(1)p(2) promoters in wild-type M. alcaliphilum 20Z and ectR1 mutant strains suggested that EctR1 is a negative regulator of the ectABC-ask operon. Purified recombinant EctR1-His(6) specifically binds as a homodimer to the putative -10 motif of the ectAp(1) promoter. The EctR1 binding site contains a pseudopalindromic sequence (TATTTAGT-GT-ACTATATA) composed of 8-bp half-sites separated by 2 bp. Transcription of the ectR1 gene is initiated from a single sigma(70)-like promoter. The location of the EctR1 binding site between the transcriptional and translational start sites of the ectR1 gene suggests that EctR1 may regulate its own expression. The data presented suggest that in Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, EctR1-mediated control of the transcription of the ect genes is not the single mechanism for the regulation of ectoine biosynthesis.	1
Title: Functional and evolutionary characterization of a secondary metabolite gene cluster in budding yeasts Abstract: Secondary metabolites are key in how organisms from all domains of life interact with their environment and each other. The iron-binding molecule pulcherrimin was described a century ago, but the genes responsible for its production in budding yeasts have remained uncharacterized. Here, we used phylogenomic footprinting on 90 genomes across the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina to identify the gene cluster associated with pulcherrimin production. Using targeted gene replacements in Kluyveromyces lactis, we characterized the four genes that make up the cluster, which likely encode two pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis enzymes, a pulcherrimin transporter, and a transcription factor involved in both biosynthesis and transport. The requirement of a functional putative transporter to utilize extracellular pulcherrimin-complexed iron demonstrates that pulcherriminic acid is a siderophore, a chelator that binds iron outside the cell for subsequent uptake. Surprisingly, we identified homologs of the putative transporter and transcription factor genes in multiple yeast genera that lacked the biosynthesis genes and could not make pulcherrimin, including the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae We deleted these previously uncharacterized genes and showed they are also required for pulcherrimin utilization in S. cerevisiae, raising the possibility that other genes of unknown function are linked to secondary metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses of this gene cluster suggest that pulcherrimin biosynthesis and utilization were ancestral to budding yeasts, but the biosynthesis genes and, subsequently, the utilization genes, were lost in many lineages, mirroring other microbial public goods systems that lead to the rise of cheater organisms.	1
Title: Automated genome mining of ribosomal peptide natural products Abstract: Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), especially from microbial sources, are a large group of bioactive natural products that are a promising source of new (bio)chemistry and bioactivity.1 In light of exponentially increasing microbial genome databases and improved mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic platforms, there is a need for computational tools that connect natural product genotypes predicted from microbial genome sequences with their corresponding chemotypes from metabolomic data sets. Here, we introduce RiPPquest, a tandem mass spectrometry database search tool for identification of microbial RiPPs, and apply it to lanthipeptide discovery. RiPPquest uses genomics to limit search space to the vicinity of RiPP biosynthetic genes and proteomics to analyze extensive peptide modifications and compute p-values of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). We highlight RiPPquest by connecting multiple RiPPs from extracts of Streptomyces to their gene clusters and by the discovery of a new class III lanthipeptide, informatipeptin, from Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736 to reflect that it is a natural product that was discovered by mass spectrometry based genome mining using algorithmic tools rather than manual inspection of mass spectrometry data and genetic information. The presented tool is available at cyclo.ucsd.edu.	1
Title: N-acylated peptides derived from human lactoferricin perturb organization of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in cell membranes and induce defects in Escherichia coli cell division Abstract: Two types of recently described antibacterial peptides derived from human lactoferricin, either nonacylated or N-acylated, were studied for their different interaction with membranes of Escherichia coli in vivo and in model systems. Electron microscopy revealed striking effects on the bacterial membrane as both peptide types induced formation of large membrane blebs. Electron and fluorescence microscopy, however demonstrated that only the N-acylated peptides partially induced the generation of oversized cells, which might reflect defects in cell-division. Further a different distribution of cardiolipin domains on the E. coli membrane was shown only in the presence of the N-acylated peptides. The lipid was distributed over the whole bacterial cell surface, whereas cardiolipin in untreated and nonacylated peptide-treated cells was mainly located at the septum and poles. Studies with bacterial membrane mimics, such as cardiolipin or phosphatidylethanolamine revealed that both types of peptides interacted with the negatively charged lipid cardiolipin. The nonacylated peptides however induced segregation of cardiolipin into peptide-enriched and peptide-poor lipid domains, while the N-acylated peptides promoted formation of many small heterogeneous domains. Only N-acylated peptides caused additional severe effects on the main phase transition of liposomes composed of pure phosphatidylethanolamine, while both peptide types inhibited the lamellar to hexagonal phase transition. Lipid mixtures of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin revealed anionic clustering by all peptide types. However additional strong perturbation of the neutral lipids was only seen with the N-acylated peptides. Nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated different conformational arrangement of the N-acylated peptide in anionic and zwitterionic micelles revealing possible mechanistic differences in their action on different membrane lipids. We hypothesized that both peptides kill bacteria by interacting with bacterial membrane lipids but only N-acylated peptides interact with both charged cardiolipin and zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine resulting in remodeling of the natural phospholipid domains in the E. coli membrane that leads to defects in cell division.	0
Title: The avilamycin resistance determinants AviRa and AviRb methylate 23S rRNA at the guanosine 2535 base and the uridine 2479 ribose Abstract: Avilamycin is an orthosomycin antibiotic that has shown considerable potential for clinical use, although it is presently used as a growth promoter in animal feed. Avilamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The ribosomes of the producer strain, Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57, are protected from the drug by the action of three resistance factors located in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Two of the resistance factors, aviRa and aviRb, encode rRNA methyltransferases that specifically target 23S rRNA. Recombinant AviRa and AviRb proteins retain their activity after purification, and both specifically methylate in vitro transcripts of 23S rRNA domain V. Reverse transcriptase primer extension indicated that AviRa is an N-methyltransferase that targets G2535 within helix 91 of the rRNA, whereas AviRb modified the 2'-O-ribose position of nucleotide U2479 within helix 89. MALDI mass spectrometry confirmed the exact positions of each of these modifications, and additionally established that a single methyl group is added at each nucleotide. Neither of these two nucleotides have previously been described as a target for enzymatic methylation. Molecular models of the 50S subunit crystal structure show that the N-1 of the G2535 base and the 2'-hydroxyl of U2479 are separated by approximately 10 A, a distance that can be spanned by avilamycin. In addition to defining new resistance mechanisms, these data refine our understanding of the probable ribosome contacts made by orthosomycins and of how these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis.	1
Title: Who Needs Neighbors? PKS8 Is a Stand-Alone Gene in Fusarium graminearum Responsible for Production of Gibepyrones and Prolipyrone B Abstract: Genome sequencing of the genus Fusarium has revealed a great capacity for discovery of new natural products of potential economical and therapeutic importance. Several of these are unknown. In this study, we investigated the product of the PKS8 gene in Fusarium graminearum, which was recently linked to gibepyrones in F. fujikuroi. Genomic analyses showed that PKS8 constitutes a stand-alone gene in F. graminearum and related species. Overexpression of PKS8 resulted in production of gibepyrones A, B, D, G and prolipyrone B, which could not be detected in the wild type strain. Our results suggest that PKS8 produces the entry compound gibepyrone A, which is subsequently oxidized by one or several non-clustering cytochrome P450 monooxygenases ending with prolipyrone B.	1
Title: Synthesis and reactivity of a trigonal porous nanographene on a gold surface Abstract: The synthesis of porous nanographenes is a challenging task for solution chemistry, and thus, on-surface synthesis provides an alternative approach. Here, we report the synthesis of a triporous nanographene with 102 sp2 carbon atoms by combining solution and surface chemistry. The carbon skeleton was obtained by Pd-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of arynes in solution, while planarization of the molecule was achieved through two hierarchically organized on-surface cyclodehydrogenation reactions, intra- and inter-blade. Remarkably, the three non-planar [14]annulene pores of this nanographene further evolved at higher temperatures showing interesting intra-porous on-surface reactivity.	0
Title: Occurrence of the Campylobacter resistance gene tetO in Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp Abstract: The distribution of nucleotide sequences related to tetK, tetL, tetM, and tetO was studied by dot blot hybridization in 178 strains of Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. that were resistant to tetracycline. The tetO gene, which is responsible for tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter spp., was detected in six Streptococcus strains and two Enterococcus strains, in which it was borne by similar plasmids. This observation confirms our previous proposal that tetO originated in gram-positive cocci. tetM, the most prevalent resistance gene, was present alone in 109 strains and associated with tetL in 33 strains in which the two genes contributed cooperatively to high-level tetracycline resistance. tetL was present alone in five Enterococcus strains, and tetK was detected in a single Streptococcus strain. The existence of 22 strains that did not hybridize to the probes suggest that tetracycline resistance in streptococci and enterococci involves additional gene classes as well.	0
Title: DNA recovery from soils of diverse composition Abstract: A simple, rapid method for bacterial lysis and direct extraction of DNA from soils with minimal shearing was developed to address the risk of chimera formation from small template DNA during subsequent PCR. The method was based on lysis with a high-salt extraction buffer (1.5 M NaCl) and extended heating (2 to 3 h) of the soil suspension in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and proteinase K. The extraction method required 6 h and was tested on eight soils differing in organic carbon, clay content, and pH, including ones from which DNA extraction is difficult. The DNA fragment size in crude extracts from all soils was > 23 kb. Preliminary trials indicated that DNA recovery from two soils seeded with gram-negative bacteria was 92 to 99%. When the method was tested on all eight unseeded soils, microscopic examination of indigenous bacteria in soil pellets before and after extraction showed variable cell lysis efficiency (26 to 92%). Crude DNA yields from the eight soils ranged from 2.5 to 26.9 micrograms of DNA g-1, and these were positively correlated with the organic carbon content in the soil (r = 0.73). DNA yields from gram-positive bacteria from pure cultures were two to six times higher when the high-salt-SDS-heat method was combined with mortar-and-pestle grinding and freeze-thawing, and most DNA recovered was of high molecular weight. Four methods for purifying crude DNA were also evaluated for percent recovery, fragment size, speed, enzyme restriction, PCR amplification, and DNA-DNA hybridization. In general, all methods produced DNA pure enough for PCR amplification. Since soil type and microbial community characteristics will influence DNA recovery, this study provides guidance for choosing appropriate extraction and purification methods on the basis of experimental goals.	0
Title: A small-molecule probe of the histone methyltransferase G9a induces cellular senescence in pancreatic adenocarcinoma Abstract: Post-translational modifications of histones alter chromatin structure and play key roles in gene expression and specification of cell states. Small molecules that target chromatin-modifying enzymes selectively are useful as probes and have promise as therapeutics, although very few are currently available. G9a (also named euchromatin histone methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2)) catalyzes methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification linked to aberrant silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, among others. Here, we report the discovery of a novel histone methyltransferase inhibitor, BRD4770. This compound reduced cellular levels of di- and trimethylated H3K9 without inducing apoptosis, induced senescence, and inhibited both anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. ATM-pathway activation, caused by either genetic or small-molecule inhibition of G9a, may mediate BRD4770-induced cell senescence. BRD4770 may be a useful tool to study G9a and its role in senescence and cancer cell biology.	0
Title: Identification of the Lomofungin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster and Associated Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase Gene in Streptomyces lomondensis S015 Abstract: Streptomyces lomondensis S015 synthesizes the broad-spectrum phenazine antibiotic lomofungin. Whole genome sequencing of this strain revealed a genomic locus consisting of 23 open reading frames that includes the core phenazine biosynthesis gene cluster lphzGFEDCB. lomo10, encoding a putative flavin-dependent monooxygenase, was also identified in this locus. Inactivation of lomo10 by in-frame partial deletion resulted in the biosynthesis of a new phenazine metabolite, 1-carbomethoxy-6-formyl-4,9-dihydroxy-phenazine, along with the absence of lomofungin. This result suggests that lomo10 is responsible for the hydroxylation of lomofungin at its C-7 position. This is the first description of a phenazine hydroxylation gene in Streptomyces, and the results of this study lay the foundation for further investigation of phenazine metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces.	1
Title: Draft genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. TP-A0882 reveals putative butyrolactol biosynthetic pathway Abstract: We report the draft genome sequence of marine-derived Streptomyces sp. TP-A0882, a producer of buryrolactol, an antifungal γ-lactone-containing polyketide. The genome harbored at least three type I polyketide synthase (PKS), three type II PKS, four nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and two hybrid PKS/NRPS gene clusters. Annotation of gene functions enabled us to identify the type I PKS gene cluster for butyrolactol biosynthesis and propose a plausible biosynthetic pathway for this unique polyketide.	1
Title: Isolation and Characterization of a Thermophilic Strain of Methanosarcina Unable to Use H(2)-CO(2) for Methanogenesis Abstract: A thermophilic strain of Methanosarcina, designated Methanosarcina strain TM-1, was isolated from a laboratory-scale 55 degrees C anaerobic sludge digestor by the Hungate roll-tube technique. Penicillin and d-cycloserine, inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis, were used as selective agents to eliminate contaminating non-methanogens. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 had a temperature optimum for methanogenesis near 50 degrees C and grew at 55 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. Substrates used for methanogenesis and growth by Methanosarcina strain TM-1 were acetate (12-h doubling time), methanol (7- to 10-h doubling time), methanol-acetate mixtures (5-h doubling time), methylamine, and trimethylamine. When radioactively labeled acetate was the sole methanogenic substrate added to the growth medium, it was predominantly split to methane and carbon dioxide. When methanol was also present in the medium, the metabolism of acetate shifted to its oxidation and incorporation into cell material. Electrons derived from acetate oxidation apparently were used to reduce methanol. H(2)-CO(2) was not used for growth and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina strain TM-1. When presented with both H(2)-CO(2) and methanol, Methanosarcina strain TM-1 was capable of limited hydrogen metabolism during growth on methanol, but hydrogen metabolism ceased once the methanol was depleted. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 required a growth factor (or growth factors) present in the supernatant of anaerobic digestor sludge. Growth factor requirements and the inability to use H(2)-CO(2) are characteristics not found in other described Methanosarcina strains. The high numbers of Methanosarcina-like clumps in sludges from thermophilic digestors and the fast generation times reported here for Methanosarcina TM-1 indicate that Methanosarcina may play an important role in thermophilic methanogenesis.	0
Title: New insights into polyene macrolide biosynthesis in Couchioplanes caeruleus Abstract: Couchioplanes caeruleus DSM43634 synthesises 67-121C, an aromatic heptaene macrolide that contains a mannosyl-mycosaminyl disaccharide. An improved draft genome sequence was used to obtain the biosynthetic gene cluster for this antifungal. Bioinformatic analysis of the polyketide synthase indicated that extension modules 7 and 8 contain A-type ketoreductase and dehydratase domains. These modules are therefore predicted to form cis double bonds. The deduced stereostructure of the 67-121C macrolactone is identical to that experimentally determined for the partricin subgroup of aromatic heptaenes. Some of these polyenes are N-methylated on the aminoacetophenone moiety. The C. caeruleus AceS protein was shown to methylate 4-aminoacetophenone and esters of 4-aminobenzoate, but not 4-aminobenzoate. This suggests that the substrate specificity of AceS prevents it from interfering with folate biosynthesis. The methyltransferase should be valuable for chemoenzymatic alkylation of compounds that contain aminobenzoyl moieties.	1
Title: A Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutation impairs the ORC1-nucleosome association Abstract: Recent studies have identified several genetic mutations within the BAH domain of human Origin Recognition Complex subunit 1 (hORC1BAH), including the R105Q mutation, implicated in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). However, the pathological role of the hORC1 R105Q mutation remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated the interactions of the hORC1BAH domain with histone H4K20me2, DNA, and the nucleosome core particle labeled with H4Kc20me2, a chemical analog of H4K20me2. Our study revealed a nucleosomal DNA binding site for hORC1BAH. The R105Q mutation reduces the hORC1BAH-DNA binding affinity, leading to impaired hORC1BAH-nucleosome interaction, which likely influences DNA replication initiation and MGS pathogenesis. This study provides an etiologic link between the hORC1 R105Q mutation and MGS.	0
Title: Conformational cycle of the ABC transporter MsbA in liposomes: detailed analysis using double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy Abstract: Driven by the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis, ATP-binding cassette transporters alternate between inward- and outward-facing conformations, allowing vectorial movement of substrates. Conflicting models have been proposed to describe the conformational motion underlying this switch in access of the transport pathway. One model, based on three crystal structures of the lipid flippase MsbA, envisions a large-amplitude motion that disengages the nucleotide-binding domains and repacks the transmembrane helices. To test this model and place the crystal structures in a mechanistic context, we use spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to define the nature and amplitude of MsbA conformational change during ATP hydrolysis cycle. For this purpose, spin labels were introduced at sites selected to provide a distinctive pattern of distance changes unique to the crystallographic transformation. Distance changes in liposomes, induced by the transition from nucleotide-free MsbA to the highest energy intermediate, fit a simple pattern whereby residues on the cytoplasmic side undergo 20-30 A closing motion while a 7- to 10-A opening motion is observed on the extracellular side. The transmembrane helices undergo relative movement to create the outward opening consistent with that implied by the crystal structures. Double electron-electron resonance distance distributions reveal asymmetric backbone flexibility on the two sides of the transporter that correlates with asymmetric opening of the substrate-binding chamber. Together with extensive accessibility analysis, our results suggest that these structures capture features of the motion that couples ATP energy expenditure to work, providing a framework for the mechanism of substrate transport.	0
Title: The AcbC protein from Actinoplanes species is a C7-cyclitol synthase related to 3-dehydroquinate synthases and is involved in the biosynthesis of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose Abstract: The putative biosynthetic gene cluster for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose was identified in the producer Actinoplanes sp. 50/110 by cloning a DNA segment containing the conserved gene for dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, acbB. The two flanking genes were acbA (dTDP-D-glucose synthase) and acbC, encoding a protein with significant similarity to 3-dehydroquinate synthases (AroB proteins). The acbC gene was overexpressed heterologously in Streptomyces lividans 66, and the product was shown to be a C7-cyclitol synthase using sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate, but not ido-heptulose 7-phosphate, as its substrate. The cyclization product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanon-2,3,4,5-tetrol), is a precursor of the valienamine moiety of acarbose. A possible five-step reaction mechanism is proposed for the cyclization reaction catalyzed by AcbC based on the recent analysis of the three-dimensional structure of a eukaryotic 3-dehydroquinate synthase domain (Carpenter, E. P., Hawkins, A. R., Frost, J. W., and Brown, K. A. (1998) Nature 394, 299-302).	1
Title: Cloning and elucidation of the FR901464 gene cluster revealing a complex acyltransferase-less polyketide synthase using glycerate as starter units Abstract: FR901464, an antitumor natural product, represents a new class of potent anticancer small molecules targeting spliceosome and inhibiting both splicing and nuclear retention of pre-mRNA. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of FR901464, identified by degenerate primer PCR amplification of a gene encoding the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) postulated to be involved in the biosynthesis of a β-branched polyketide from Pseudomonas sp. No. 2663. This cluster consists of twenty open reading frames (ORFs) and was localized to 93-kb DNA segment, and its involvement in FR901464 biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation. FR901464 is biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), HCS, and acyltransferases (AT)-less system. The PKS/NRPS modules feature unusual domain organization including multiple domain redundancy, inactivation, and tandem. Biochemical characterization of a glyceryl transferase and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the start module revealed that it incorporates D-1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is dephosphorylated and transferred to ACP as the starter unit. Furthermore, an oxidative Baeyer-Villiger reaction followed by chain release was postulated to form a pyran moiety. On the basis of in silico analysis and genetic and biochemical evidances, a biosynthetic pathway for FR901464 was proposed, which sets the stage to further investigate the complex PKS biochemically and engineer the biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues.	1
Title: Reactivity of N-(1,2,4-triazolyl)-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles Abstract: Synthetically useful rhodium(II) carbenes were obtained from N-(1,2,4-triazolyl)-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles and Rh(II) carboxylates. The electron-withdrawing 1,2,4-triazolyl group reveals the heretofore unknown reactivity of nonsulfonyl 1,2,3-triazoles, which exhibit the reactivity of diazo compounds. The resulting carbenes provide ready asymmetric access to secondary homoaminocyclopropanes (80-95% ee, dr >20:1) via reactions with olefins and also engage in efficient transannulation reactions with nitriles.	0
Title: Physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T chromosome Abstract: A combined physical and genetic map of the Serpulina hyodysenteriae B78T genome was constructed by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and DNA blot hybridizations. The S. hyodysenteriae genome is a single circular chromosome about 3.2 Mb in size. The physical map of the chromosome was constructed with the restriction enzymes BssHII, EclXI, NotI, SalI, and SmaI. The physical map was used to constructed a linkage map for genes encoding rRNA, flagellum subunit proteins, DNA gyrase, NADH oxidase, and three distinct hemolysins. Several flaB2-related loci, encoding core flagellum subunit proteins, were detected and are dispersed around the chromosome. The rRNA gene organization in S. hyodysenteriae is unusual. S. hyodysenteriae has one gene each for 5S (rrf), 16S (rrs), and 23S (rrl) rRNAs. The rrf and rrl genes are closely linked (within 5 kb), while the rrs gene is about 860 kb from the other two rRNA genes. Using a probe for the S. hyodysenteriae gyrA gene, we identified a possible location for the chromosomal replication origin. The size and genetic organization of the S. hyodysenteriae chromosome are different from those of previously characterized spirochetes.	0
Title: Astaxanthin Complexes to Attenuate Muscle Damage after In Vivo Femoral Ischemia-Reperfusion Abstract: (1) Background: Reperfusion injury refers to the cell and tissue damage induced, when blood flow is restored after an ischemic period. While reperfusion reestablishes oxygen supply, it generates a high concentration of radicals, resulting in tissue dysfunction and damage. Here, we aimed to challenge and achieve the potential of a delivery system based on astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant, in attenuating the muscle damage in an animal model of femoral hind-limb ischemia and reperfusion. (2) Methods: The antioxidant capacity and non-toxicity of astaxanthin was validated before and after loading into a polysaccharide scaffold. The capacity of astaxanthin to compensate stress damages was also studied after ischemia induced by femoral artery clamping and followed by varied periods of reperfusion. (3) Results: Histological evaluation showed a positive labeling for CD68 and CD163 macrophage markers, indicating a remodeling process. In addition, higher levels of Nrf2 and NQO1 expression in the sham group compared to the antioxidant group could reflect a reduction of the oxidative damage after 15 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, non-significant differences were observed in non-heme iron deposition in both groups, reflecting a cell population susceptible to free radical damage. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that the in situ release of an antioxidant molecule could be effective in improving the antioxidant defenses of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-damaged muscles.	0
Title: Modulation of polyketide synthase activity by accessory proteins during lovastatin biosynthesis Abstract: Polyketides, the ubiquitous products of secondary metabolism in microorganisms, are made by a process resembling fatty acid biosynthesis that allows the suppression of reduction or dehydration reactions at specific biosynthetic steps, giving rise to a wide range of often medically useful products. The lovastatin biosynthesis cluster contains two type I polyketide synthase genes. Synthesis of the main nonaketide-derived skeleton was found to require the previously known iterative lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), plus at least one additional protein (LovC) that interacts with LNKS and is necessary for the correct processing of the growing polyketide chain and production of dihydromonacolin L. The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J.	1
Title: Classification of virulent and temperate bacteriophages of Listeria spp. on the basis of morphology and protein analysis Abstract: A set of 22 phages of Listeria species (listeriaphages) (21 temperate and 1 virulent) were compared on the basis of morphology and protein composition. All 22 phages had icosahedral heads and exhibited either contractile or noncontractile tails. They represented two different morphotypes. Twenty phages belonged to the Siphoviridae family and could be differentiated only on the basis of tail length. Accordingly, they could be assigned to previously defined listeriaphage species. Two other phages were classified as members of the Myoviridae family, one of which (A511) should be regarded as a new species. It was found to be substantially different from all other known listeriaphages. All phages exhibited typical protein profiles, which were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent laser densitometrical analysis of the gels. It was then possible to distinguish eight protein subgroups on the basis of unique protein patterns. This classification corresponds well to the previous groupings based on host range. Most of the phages revealed two or three major proteins ranging from 21 to 24 kDa and 30 to 36 kDa. In addition, at least 10 minor proteins could be observed for each phage. Our results indicate that the major proteins are structural proteins of the capsid and tail, and the protein band ranging from 30 to 35 kDa could clearly be assigned to the proteins of the phage capsid.	0
Title: A 3.9-kb DNA region of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris that is necessary for lipopolysaccharide production encodes a set of enzymes involved in the synthesis of dTDP-rhamnose Abstract: By mutational analysis it was found that a 3.9-kb SmaI-XhoII DNA fragment of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. LPS samples isolated from different mutants carrying mutations in the 3.9-kb SmaI-XhoII DNA fragment exhibited banding patterns in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels markedly different from that of the wild-type LPS. Moreover, comparison of the monosaccharide composition obtained by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection of LPS purified from wild-type Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 and from mutants with mutations in the 3.9-kb SmaI-XhoII DNA fragment revealed a lack of rhamnose moieties in the mutant LPS. Sequence analysis of this DNA fragment revealed four open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF302, ORF183, ORF295, and ORF351. The deduced amino acid sequences of these ORFs showed a high degree of homology to the deduced amino acid sequences of the rfbC, rfbD, rfbA, and rfbB genes of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, which have been shown to encode a set of enzymes responsible for conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to dTDP-rhamnose.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the antimicrobial peptide epilancin 15X and its N-terminal lactate Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. The recently discovered lantibiotic epilancin 15X produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 15X154 contains an unusual N-terminal lactate group. To understand its biosynthesis, the epilancin 15X biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The N-terminal lactate is produced by dehydration of a serine residue in the first position of the core peptide by ElxB, followed by proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP and hydrolysis of the resulting new N-terminal dehydroalanine. The pyruvate group thus formed is reduced to lactate by an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase designated ElxO. The enzymatic activity of ElxB, ElxP, and ElxO were investigated in vitro or in vivo and the importance of the N-terminal modification for peptide stability against bacterial aminopeptidases was assessed.	1
Title: Glutathione boosting the cytotoxicity of a magnetic platinum(iv) nano-prodrug in tumor cells Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are potential vehicles for targeted drug delivery and viable contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A PtIV prodrug (HSPt) derived from functionalization of cisplatin with hydroxyl and succinate is conjugated with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified SPION for cancer therapy and monitoring of therapeutic responses. The relaxivity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is larger than that of commercial contrast agent Feridex, and a tumor-selective negative contrast is observed in MRI in a magnetic field. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs can be dissociated and reduced into PtII species by glutathione (GSH). Instead of forming DNA-Pt crosslinks, the reduced product induces direct DNA single- or double-strand breaks, which is uncommon for Pt drugs. The cytotoxicity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is positively correlated with the GSH level of tumor cells, which is opposite to the scenario of current Pt drugs. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs are as cytotoxic as cisplatin against cancer cells but are almost nontoxic towards normal cells. Since the mechanism of action of the nanocomposite is different from the established paradigm for Pt drugs, it may become a special theranostic agent for cancer treatment.	0
Title: Catalytic Carbocation Generation Enabled by the Mesolytic Cleavage of Alkoxyamine Radical Cations Abstract: A new catalytic method is described to access carbocation intermediates via the mesolytic cleavage of alkoxyamine radical cations. In this process, electron transfer between an excited state oxidant and a TEMPO-derived alkoxyamine substrate gives rise to a radical cation with a remarkably weak C-O bond. Spontaneous scission results in the formation of the stable nitroxyl radical TEMPO(.) as well as a reactive carbocation intermediate that can be intercepted by a wide range of nucleophiles. Notably, this process occurs under neutral conditions and at comparatively mild potentials, enabling catalytic cation generation in the presence of both acid sensitive and easily oxidized nucleophilic partners.	0
Title: Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins Abstract: In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.	0
Title: Involvement of enterobactin synthesis pathway in production of microcin H47 Abstract: Microcin H47 (MccH47) is a gene-encoded peptide antibiotic produced by an Escherichia coli clinical isolate which is active on strains of gram-negative bacteria. Its uptake by E. coli K-12-susceptible cells depends on the presence of any of the outer membrane proteins Cir, Fiu, and FepA, the three catechol receptors of this organism. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of the MccH47 genetic system that had not yet been studied was elucidated. Five open reading frames were identified, three of which corresponded to genes encoding functions related to catechol-type siderophores: mchA and mchS1 are iroB and iroD homologues, respectively, and mchS4 was found to promote the production of the catecholate siderophore enterobactin. The possible relationship between enterobactin synthesis and MccH47 production was studied. Enterobactin-deficient strains failed to produce MccH47 when transformed with the antibiotic genetic determinants and upon introduction of the ent genetic cluster, the production of both the siderophore and MccH47 was restored. Further studies demonstrated that at least the enterobactin nonribosomal peptide synthase EntF is necessary for MccH47 synthesis. The relationship found between MccH47 and catecholate siderophore production is discussed, and a model outlining MccH47 synthesis is proposed.	1
Title: Synthesis of oxalamides by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and amines and the reverse hydrogenation catalyzed by ruthenium Abstract: A sustainable, new synthesis of oxalamides, by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol with amines, generating H2, homogeneously catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex, is presented. The reverse hydrogenation reaction is also accomplished using the same catalyst. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric reactions, NMR studies, X-ray crystallography as well as observation of plausible intermediates.	0
Title: The methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus and the nearby gene with the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain are involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolides in Streptomyces galbus, but these loci are separate from the modular polyketide synthase gene cluster Abstract: Galbonolides A and B are antifungal compounds, which are produced by Streptomyces galbus. A multimodular polyketide synthase (PKS) was predicted to catalyze their biosynthesis, and a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (methoxymalonyl-ACP) was expected to be involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. Cloning of a methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis locus (galGHIJK) and the flanking regions has revealed that the locus is colocalized with beta-ketoacyl synthase (KAS)-related genes (orf3, 4, and 5), but separated from any multimodular PKS gene cluster in S. galbus. A galI-disruption mutant (SK-galI-5) is unable to produce galbonolide A, but can synthesize galbonolide B, indicating that galGHIJK is involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. A disruption mutant of orf4 is severely impaired in the production of both galbonolides A and B. These results indicate that galGHIJK and the KAS genes are involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolides, although they are not colocalized with a multimodular PKS gene cluster. We further propose that a single galbonolide PKS generates two discrete structures, galbonolides A and B, by alternatively incorporating methoxymalonate and methylmalonate, respectively.	1
Title: The Neisseria gonorrhoeae Obg protein is an essential ribosome-associated GTPase and a potential drug target Abstract: Background:                       Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) is a Gram-negative pathogen that most commonly infects mucosal surfaces, causing sexually transmitted urethritis in men and endocervicitis in women. Serious complications associated with these infections are frequent and include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. The incidence of gonorrhea cases remains high globally while antibiotic treatment options, the sole counter measures against gonorrhea, are declining due to the remarkable ability of GC to acquire resistance. Evaluating of potential drug targets is essential to provide opportunities for developing antimicrobials with new mechanisms of action. We propose the GC Obg protein, belonging to the Obg/CgtA GTPase subfamily, as a potential target for the development of therapeutic interventions against gonorrhea, and in this study perform its initial functional and biochemical characterization.                  Results:                       We report that NGO1990 encodes Obg protein, which is an essential factor for GC viability, associates predominantly with the large 50S ribosomal subunit, and is stably expressed under conditions relevant to infection of the human host. The anti-Obg antisera cross-reacts with a panel of contemporary GC clinical isolates, demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of Obg. The cellular levels of Obg reach a maximum in the early logarithmic phase and remain constant throughout bacterial growth. The in vitro binding and hydrolysis of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide analogs mant-GTP and mant-GDP by recombinant wild type and T192AT193A mutated variants of Obg are also assessed.                  Conclusions:                       Characterization of the GC Obg at the molecular and functional levels presented herein may facilitate the future targeting of this protein with small molecule inhibitors and the evaluation of identified lead compounds for bactericidal activity against GC and other drug-resistant bacteria.	0
Title: Phylum-wide comparative genomics unravel the diversity of secondary metabolism in Cyanobacteria Abstract: Background:                       Cyanobacteria are an ancient lineage of photosynthetic bacteria from which hundreds of natural products have been described, including many notorious toxins but also potent natural products of interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. Many of these compounds are the products of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. However, current understanding of the diversification of these pathways is largely based on the chemical structure of the bioactive compounds, while the evolutionary forces driving their remarkable chemical diversity are poorly understood.                  Results:                       We carried out a phylum-wide investigation of genetic diversification of the cyanobacterial NRPS and PKS pathways for the production of bioactive compounds. 452 NRPS and PKS gene clusters were identified from 89 cyanobacterial genomes, revealing a clear burst in late-branching lineages. Our genomic analysis further grouped the clusters into 286 highly diversified cluster families (CF) of pathways. Some CFs appeared vertically inherited, while others presented a more complex evolutionary history. Only a few horizontal gene transfers were evidenced amongst strongly conserved CFs in the phylum, while several others have undergone drastic gene shuffling events, which could result in the observed diversification of the pathways.                  Conclusions:                       Therefore, in addition to toxin production, several NRPS and PKS gene clusters are devoted to important cellular processes of these bacteria such as nitrogen fixation and iron uptake. The majority of the biosynthetic clusters identified here have unknown end products, highlighting the power of genome mining for the discovery of new natural products.	1
Title: Determination of the mechanism of free radical generation in human aortic endothelial cells exposed to anoxia and reoxygenation Abstract: Endothelial cell-derived oxygen free radicals are important mediators of postischemic injury; however, the mechanisms that trigger this radical generation are not known, and it is not known if this process can occur in human cells and tissues. The enzyme xanthine oxidase can be an important source of radical generation; however, it has been reported that this enzyme may not be present in human endothelium. To determine the presence and mechanisms of radical generation in human vascular endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were performed on cultured human aortic endothelial cells using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). These measurements were correlated with cellular injury, xanthine oxidase activity, and alterations in cellular nucleotides. Upon reoxygenation after 60 min of anoxia, large DMPO-OH (aN = aH = 14.9 G) and smaller DMPO-R (aN = 15.8 G, aH = 22.8 G) signals were seen. Superoxide dismutase totally quenched this radical generation. The ferric iron chelator deferoxamine prevented cell death and totally quenched the DMPO-R signal with a 40% decrease in the DMPO-OH signal. Xanthine oxidase was shown to be present in these cells and to be the primary source of free radicals. While the concentration of this enzyme did not change after anoxia, the concentration of its substrate, hypoxanthine, markedly increased, resulting in increased free radical generation upon reoxygenation. Thus, reoxygenated human vascular endothelial cells generate superoxide free radicals, which further react with iron to form the reactive hydroxyl radical, which in turn causes cell death. Xanthine oxidase was the primary source of radical generation with this process triggered by the breakdown of ATP to the substrate hypoxanthine during anoxia.	0
Title: ACTTS3 encoding a polyketide synthase is essential for the biosynthesis of ACT-toxin and pathogenicity in the tangerine pathotype of Alternaria alternata Abstract: The tangerine pathotype of Alternaria alternata produces host-selective ACT-toxin and causes Alternaria brown spot disease of tangerine and tangerine hybrids. Sequence analysis of a genomic BAC clone identified part of the ACT-toxin TOX (ACTT) gene cluster, and knockout experiments have implicated several open reading frames (ORF) contained within the cluster in the biosynthesis of ACT-toxin. One of the ORF, designated ACTTS3, encoding a putative polyketide synthase, was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genomic/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions using the specific primers designed from the BAC sequences. The 7,374-bp ORF encodes a polyketide synthase with putative beta-ketoacyl synthase, acyltransferase, methyltransferase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, and phosphopantetheine attachment site domains. Genomic Southern blots demonstrated that ACTTS3 is present on the smallest chromosome in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata, and the presence of ACTTS3 is highly correlated with ACT-toxin production and pathogenicity. Targeted gene disruption of two copies of ACTTS3 led to a complete loss of ACT-toxin production and pathogenicity. These results indicate that ACTTS3 is an essential gene for ACT-toxin biosynthesis in the tangerine pathotype of A. alternata and is required for pathogenicity of this fungus.	1
Title: The Enzymology of Prochlorosin Biosynthesis Abstract: Lanthipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides containing thioether cross-links formed through addition of a cysteine to a dehydroalanine (to form lanthionine) or to a dehydrobutyrine (to form 3-methyllanthionine). Genome sequencing of marine cyanobacteria lead to the discovery of 1.6 million open reading frames encoding lanthipeptides. In many cases, a genome encodes a single lanthipeptide synthetase, but a large number of substrates. The enzymatic modification process in Prochlorococcus MIT9313 has been reconstituted in vitro, and a variety of experimental approaches have been used to try and understand how one enzyme is capable of modifying 30 different substrates. The methods used to characterize this system will be described along with a brief genomic description of the lanthipeptide landscape found in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of a New Benzazepine Alkaloid Nanangelenin A from Aspergillus nanangensis Involves an Unusual l-Kynurenine-Incorporating NRPS Catalyzing Regioselective Lactamization Abstract: 1-Benzazepine is a pharmaceutically important scaffold but is rare among natural products. Nanangelenin A (1), containing an unprecedented 3,4-dihydro-1-benzazepine-2,5-dione-N-prenyl-N-acetoxy-anthranilamide scaffold, was isolated from a novel species of Australian fungus, Aspergillus nanangensis. Genomic and retrobiosynthetic analyses identified a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster (nan). The detailed biosynthetic pathway to 1 was established by heterologous pathway reconstitution in A. nidulans, which led to biosynthesis of intermediates nanagelenin B-F (2-5 and 7). We demonstrated that the NRPS NanA incorporates anthranilic acid (Ant) and l-kynurenine (l-Kyn), which is supplied by a dedicated indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase NanC encoded in the gene cluster. Using heterologous in vivo assays and mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the C-terminal condensation (CT) and thiolation (T3) domains of NanA are responsible for the regioselective cyclization of the tethered Ant-l-Kyn dipeptide to form the unusual benzazepine scaffold in 1. We also showed that NanA-CT catalyzes the regioselective cyclization of a surrogate synthetic substrate, Ant-l-Kyn-N-acetylcysteamine, to give the benzazepine scaffold, while spontaneous cyclization of the dipeptide yielded the alternative kinetically favored benzodiazepine scaffold. The discovery of 1 and the characterization of NanA have expanded the chemical and functional diversities of fungal NRPSs.	1
Title: Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels Abstract: Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg-1 (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with energy metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.	0
Title: Proteinaceous receptors for the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins Abstract: Mild trypsin treatment of isolated Neurospora mitochondria strongly inhibits their ability to bind and import the precursors of several mitochondrial proteins. Evidence is presented for two proteins, the ADP/ATP carrier and the mitochondrial porin, that specific binding of the precursors to the outer surface of the mitochondria is affected by the protease treatment. We suggest that the receptors that mediate the import of these two precursors are proteinaceous. Treatment of mitochondria with elastase also inhibits the binding and import of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin. In contrast the import of the precursors of subunits 2 and 9 of the mitochondrial proton-translocating ATPase was unaffected by elastase treatment at the concentrations used. We suggest that the import pathways of the latter two proteins are distinct from those of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin.	0
Title: Elucidation of the hrp clusters of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola that control the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in susceptible host rice Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the cause of bacterial leaf streak in rice, possesses clusters of hrp genes that determine its ability to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice. A 27-kb region of the genome of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (RS105) was identified and sequenced, revealing 10 hrp, 9 hrc (hrp conserved), and 8 hpa (hrp-associated) genes and 7 regulatory plant-inducible promoter boxes. While the region from hpa2 to hpaB and the hrpF operon resembled the corresponding genes of other xanthomonads, the hpaB-hrpF region incorporated an hrpE3 gene that was not present in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. We found that an hrpF mutant had lost the ability to elicit the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in adult rice plants but still caused water-soaking symptoms in rice seedlings and that Hpa1 is an HR elicitor in nonhost tobacco whose expression is controlled by an hrp regulator, HrpX. Using an Hrp phenotype complementation test, we identified a small hrp cluster containing the hrpG and hrpX regulatory genes, which is separated from the core hrp cluster. In addition, we identified a gene, prhA (plant-regulated hrp), that played a key role in the Hrp phenotype of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola but was neither in the core hrp cluster nor in the hrp regulatory cluster. A prhA mutant failed to reduce the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in rice but caused water-soaking symptoms in rice. This is the first report that X. oryzae pv. oryzicola possesses three separate DNA regions for HR induction in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice, which will provide a fundamental base to understand pathogenicity determinants of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola compared with those of X. oryzae pv. oryzae.	0
Title: Discovery of Alternative Producers of the Enediyne Antitumor Antibiotic C-1027 with High Titers Abstract: The potent cytotoxicity and unique mode of action make the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 an exquisite drug candidate for anticancer chemotherapy. However, clinical development of C-1027 has been hampered by its low titer from the original producer Streptomyces globisporus C-1027. Here we report three new C-1027 alternative producers, Streptomyces sp. CB00657, CB02329, and CB03608, from The Scripps Research Institute actinomycetes strain collection. Together with the previously disclosed Streptomyces sp. CB02366 strain, four C-1027 alternative producers with C-1027 titers of up to 11-fold higher than the original producer have been discovered. The five C-1027 producers, isolated from distant geographic locations, are distinct Streptomyces strains based on morphology and taxonomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis of the five C-1027 producers reveal that their C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are all located on giant plasmids of varying sizes. The high nucleotide sequence similarity among the five C-1027 BGCs implies that they most likely have evolved from a common ancestor.	0
Title: Chemical knockout of pantothenate kinase reveals the metabolic and genetic program responsible for hepatic coenzyme A homeostasis Abstract: Coenzyme A (CoA) is the major acyl group carrier in intermediary metabolism. Hopantenate (HoPan), a competitive inhibitor of the pantothenate kinases, was used to chemically antagonize CoA biosynthesis. HoPan dramatically reduced liver CoA and mice developed severe hypoglycemia. Insulin was reduced, glucagon and corticosterone were elevated, and fasting accelerated hypoglycemia. Metabolic profiling revealed a large increase in acylcarnitines, illustrating the role of carnitine in buffering acyl groups to maintain the nonesterified CoASH level. HoPan triggered significant changes in hepatic gene expression that substantially increased the thioesterases, which liberate CoASH from acyl-CoA, and increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which prevents the conversion of CoASH to acetyl-CoA. These results identify the metabolic rearrangements that maintain the CoASH pool which is critical to mitochondrial functions, including gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles.	0
Title: Complex genetic architecture of Drosophila aggressive behavior Abstract: Epistasis and pleiotropy feature prominently in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits but are difficult to assess in outbred populations. We performed a diallel cross among coisogenic Drosophila P-element mutations associated with hyperaggressive behavior and showed extensive epistatic and pleiotropic effects on aggression, brain morphology, and genome-wide transcript abundance in head tissues. Epistatic interactions were often of greater magnitude than homozygous effects, and the topology of epistatic networks varied among these phenotypes. The transcriptional signatures of homozygous and double heterozygous genotypes derived from the six mutations imply a large mutational target for aggressive behavior and point to evolutionarily conserved genetic mechanisms and neural signaling pathways affecting this universal fitness trait.	0
Title: Effects of ethanol and acetic acid on the transport of malic acid and glucose in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe: implications in wine deacidification Abstract: Ethanol and acetic acid, at concentrations which may occur during wine-making, inhibited the transport of L-malic acid in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The inhibition was non-competitive, the decrease of the maximum initial velocity following exponential kinetics. Glucose transport was not significantly affected either by ethanol (up to 13%, w/v) or by acetic acid (up to 1.5%, w/v). The uptake of labelled acetic acid followed simple diffusion kinetics, indicating that a carrier was not involved in its transport. Therefore, the undissociated acid appears to be the only form that enters the cells and is probably responsible for the toxic effects. Accordingly, deacidification by Ss. pombe during wine fermentation should take place before, rather than after, the main alcoholic fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	0
Title: Heparan Sulfate Microarray Reveals That Heparan Sulfate-Protein Binding Exhibits Different Ligand Requirements Abstract: Heparan sulfates (HS) are linear sulfated polysaccharides that modulate a wide range of physiological and disease-processes. Variations in HS epimerization and sulfation provide enormous structural diversity, which is believed to underpin protein binding and regulatory properties. The ligand requirements of HS-binding proteins have, however, been defined in only a few cases. We describe here a synthetic methodology that can rapidly provide a library of well-defined HS oligosaccharides. It is based on the use of modular disaccharides to assemble several selectively protected tetrasaccharides that were subjected to selective chemical modifications such as regioselective O- and N-sulfation and selective de-sulfation. A number of the resulting compounds were subjected to enzymatic modifications by 3-O-sulfotransferases-1 (3-OST1) to provide 3-O-sulfated derivatives. The various approaches for diversification allowed one tetrasaccharide to be converted into 12 differently sulfated derivatives. By employing tetrasaccharides with different backbone compositions, a library of 47 HS-oligosaccharides was prepared and the resulting compounds were used to construct a HS microarray. The ligand requirements of a number of HS-binding proteins including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and the chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL13, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were examined using the array. Although all proteins recognized multiple compounds, they exhibited clear differences in structure-binding characteristics. The HS microarray data guided the selection of compounds that could interfere in biological processes such as cell proliferation. Although the library does not cover the entire chemical space of HS-tetrasaccharides, the binding data support a notion that changes in cell surface HS composition can modulate protein function.	0
Title: Characterization of the tautomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus unveiling new insights into dialkylmaleic anhydride and polyketide biosynthesis Abstract: Tautomycin (TTM) is a highly potent and specific protein phosphatase inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus. The biological activity of TTM makes it an important lead for drug discovery, whereas its spiroketal-containing polyketide chain and rare dialkylmaleic anhydride moiety draw attention to novel biosynthetic chemistries responsible for its production. To elucidate the biosynthetic machinery associated with these novel molecular features, the ttm biosynthetic gene cluster from S. spiroverticillatus was isolated and characterized, and its involvement in TTM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation experiments. The ttm cluster was localized to a 86-kb DNA region, consisting of 20 open reading frames that encode three modular type I polyketide synthases (TtmHIJ), one type II thioesterase (TtmT), five proteins for methoxymalonyl-S-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis (Ttm-ABCDE), eight proteins for dialkylmaleic anhydride biosynthesis and regulation (TtmKLMNOPRS), as well as two additional regulatory proteins (TtmF and TtmQ) and one tailoring enzyme (TtmG). A model for TTM biosynthesis is proposed based on functional assignments from sequence analysis, which agrees well with previous feeding experiments, and has been further supported by in vivo gene inactivation experiments. These findings set the stage to fully investigate TTM biosynthesis and to biosynthetically engineer new TTM analogs.	1
Title: MyBASE: a database for genome polymorphism and gene function studies of Mycobacterium Abstract: Background:                       Mycobacterial pathogens are a major threat to humans. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, research on mycobacterial pathogenesis and subsequent control strategies will be greatly accelerated. It has been suggested that genome polymorphisms, namely large sequence polymorphisms, can influence the pathogenicity of different mycobacterial strains. However, there is currently no database dedicated to mycobacterial genome polymorphisms with functional interpretations.                  Description:                       We have developed a mycobacterial database (MyBASE) housing genome polymorphism data and gene functions to provide the mycobacterial research community with a useful information resource and analysis platform. Whole genome comparison data produced by our lab and the novel genome polymorphisms identified were deposited into MyBASE. Extensive literature review of genome polymorphism data, mainly large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), operon predictions and curated annotations of virulence and essentiality of mycobacterial genes are unique features of MyBASE. Large-scale genomic data integration from public resources makes MyBASE a comprehensive data warehouse useful for current research.

Title: Synthesis of Pyrroles through the CuH-Catalyzed Coupling of Enynes and Nitriles Abstract: Herein, we describe an efficient method to prepare polysubstituted pyrroles via a copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed enyne-nitrile coupling reaction. This protocol accommodates both aromatic and aliphatic substituents and a broad range of functional groups, providing a variety of N-H pyrroles in good yields and with high regioselectivity. We propose that the Cu-based catalyst promotes both the initial reductive coupling and subsequent cyclization steps. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.	0
Title: De novo biosynthesis of terminal alkyne-labeled natural products Abstract: The terminal alkyne is a functionality widely used in organic synthesis, pharmaceutical science, material science and bioorthogonal chemistry. This functionality is also found in acetylenic natural products, but the underlying biosynthetic pathways for its formation are not well understood. Here we report the characterization of what is to our knowledge the first carrier protein-dependent terminal alkyne biosynthetic machinery in microbes. We further demonstrate that this enzymatic machinery can be exploited for the in situ generation and incorporation of terminal alkynes into two natural product scaffolds in Escherichia coli. These results highlight the prospect for tagging major classes of natural products, including polyketides and polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrids, using biosynthetic pathway engineering.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Antibiotic Leucinostatins in Bio-control Fungus Purpureocillium lilacinum and Their Inhibition on Phytophthora Revealed by Genome Mining Abstract: Purpureocillium lilacinum of Ophiocordycipitaceae is one of the most promising and commercialized agents for controlling plant parasitic nematodes, as well as other insects and plant pathogens. However, how the fungus functions at the molecular level remains unknown. Here, we sequenced two isolates (PLBJ-1 and PLFJ-1) of P. lilacinum from different places Beijing and Fujian. Genomic analysis showed high synteny of the two isolates, and the phylogenetic analysis indicated they were most related to the insect pathogen Tolypocladium inflatum. A comparison with other species revealed that this fungus was enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases and pathogenesis related genes. Whole genome search revealed a rich repertoire of secondary metabolites (SMs) encoding genes. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase LcsA, which is comprised of ten C-A-PCP modules, was identified as the core biosynthetic gene of lipopeptide leucinostatins, which was specific to P. lilacinum and T. ophioglossoides, as confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, gene expression level was analyzed when PLBJ-1 was grown in leucinostatin-inducing and non-inducing medium, and 20 genes involved in the biosynthesis of leucionostatins were identified. Disruption mutants allowed us to propose a putative biosynthetic pathway of leucinostatin A. Moreover, overexpression of the transcription factor lcsF increased the production (1.5-fold) of leucinostatins A and B compared to wild type. Bioassays explored a new bioactivity of leucinostatins and P. lilacinum: inhibiting the growth of Phytophthora infestans and P. capsici. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthetic mechanism of leucinostatins and may allow us to utilize P. lilacinum better as bio-control agent.	1
Title: Dss1 regulates interaction of Brh2 with DNA Abstract: Brh2, the BRCA2 homologue in Ustilago maydis, plays a crucial role in homologous recombination by controlling Rad51. In turn, Brh2 is governed by Dss1, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms a tight complex with the C-terminal region of Brh2. This region of the protein associating with Dss1 is highly conserved in sequence and by comparison with mammalian BRCA2 corresponds to a part of the DNA binding domain with characteristic OB folds. The N-terminal region of Brh2 harbors a less-defined but powerful DNA binding site, the activity of which is revealed upon deletion of the C-terminal region. Full-length Brh2 complexed with Dss1 binds DNA slowly, while the N-terminal fragment binds quickly. The DNA binding activity of full-length Brh2 appears to correlate with dissociation of Dss1. Addition of Dss1 to the heterotypic Brh2-Dss1 complex attenuates DNA binding activity, but not by direct competition for the N-terminal DNA binding site. Conversely, the Brh2-Dss1 complex dissociates more quickly when DNA is present. These findings suggest a model in which binding of Brh2 to DNA is subject to allosteric regulation by Dss1.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster from Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 probably involved in landomycin biosynthesis Abstract: From a cosmid library of Streptomyces cyanogenus S136, DNA fragments encompassing approximately 35 kb of the presumed landomycin biosynthetic gene cluster were identified and sequenced, revealing 32 open reading frames most of which could be assigned through data base comparison.	1
Title: A vicious cycle of β amyloid-dependent neuronal hyperactivation Abstract: β-amyloid (Aβ)-dependent neuronal hyperactivity is believed to contribute to the circuit dysfunction that characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis continues to accrue, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. In this experiment, we used mouse models of Aβ-amyloidosis to show that hyperactivation is initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake. Hyperactivity occurred in neurons with preexisting baseline activity, whereas inactive neurons were generally resistant to Aβ-mediated hyperactivation. Aβ-containing AD brain extracts and purified Aβ dimers were able to sustain this vicious cycle. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism of Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction that can be active before plaque formation.	0
Title: The initial step of glycerolipid metabolism in Leishmania major promastigotes involves a single glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase enzyme important for the synthesis of triacylglycerol but not essential for virulence Abstract: The synthesis of the major phospholipids, including those that play an essential role in Leishmania virulence, initiates with the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate at the sn-1 position by glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferases respectively. In this study, we show that Leishmania major promastigotes express a single glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity important for triacylglycerol synthesis but not essential for virulence. The encoding gene, LmGAT, expressed in yeast results in full complementation of the lethality of a mutant, gat1Deltagat2Delta, lacking glycerol-3-phosphate activity. Biochemical analyses revealed that LmGAT is a low-affinity glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and exhibits higher specific activity with unsaturated long fatty acyl-CoA donors. A L. major null mutant, Deltalmgat/Deltalmgat, was created and a thorough analysis of its lipid composition was performed. Deletion of LmGAT resulted in a complete loss of Leishmania glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity and a major reduction in triacylglycerol synthesis. Consistent with the specificity of LmGAT for glycerol-3-phosphate but not dihydroxyacetonephosphate, Deltalmgat/Deltalmgat mutant expressed normal levels of the ether-lipid derivatives and virulence factors, lipophosphoglycan and GPI-anchored proteins, gp63, and its virulence was not affected in mice.	0
Title: In vitro biosynthesis of violacein from L-tryptophan by the enzymes VioA-E from Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: The purple chromobacterial pigment violacein arises by enzymatic oxidation and coupling of two molecules of l-tryptophan to give a rearranged pyrrolidone-containing scaffold in the final pigment. We have purified five contiguously encoded proteins VioA-E after expression in Escherichia coli and demonstrate the full 14-electron oxidation pathway to yield the final chromophore. The flavoenzyme VioA and the heme protein VioB work in conjunction to oxidize and dimerize l-tryptophan to a nascent product that can default to the off pathway metabolite chromopyrrolic acid. In the presence of VioE, the intermediate instead undergoes on-pathway [1,2] indole rearrangement to prodeoxyviolacein. The last two enzymes in the pathway are flavin-dependent oxygenases, VioC and VioD, that act sequentially. VioD hydroxylates one indole ring at the 5-position to yield proviolacein, and VioC then acts on the other indole ring at the 2-position to create the oxindole and complete violacein formation.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of ambiguine indole alkaloids in cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua Abstract: Ambiguines belong to a family of hapalindole-type indole alkaloid natural products, with many of the members possessing up to eight consecutive carbon stereocenters in a fused pentacyclic 6-6-6-5-7 ring scaffold. Here, we report the identification of a 42 kbp ambiguine (amb) biosynthetic gene cluster that harbors 32 protein-coding genes in its native producer Fischerella ambigua UTEX1903. Association of the amb cluster with ambiguine biosynthesis was confirmed by both bioinformatic analysis and in vitro characterizations of enzymes responsible for 3-((Z)-2'-isocyanoethenyl) indole and geranyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis and a C-2 indole dimethylallyltransferase that regiospecifically tailors hapalindole G to ambiguine A. The presence of five nonheme iron-dependent oxygenase coding genes (including four Rieske-type oxygenases) within the amb cluster suggests late-stage C-H activations are likely responsible for the structural diversities of ambiguines by regio- and stereospecific chlorination, hydroxylation, epoxidation, and sp(2)-sp(3) C-C bond formation.	1
Title: Cloning and functional characterization of a 30 kb gene locus required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Legionella pneumophila Abstract: The spontaneous Legionella pneumophila lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant 137, which did not bind the LPS-specific mAb 2625, was complemented with a genomic library from the parental wild-type strain. Transformants were screened for reconstitution of the wild-type LPS phenotype, able to bind mAb 2625. By this strategy, a 32,661 bp region comprising 30 open reading frames (Orfs) was identified. Orfs with significant homologies to genes encoding enzymes required for LPS or capsule biosynthesis of Gram-negative bacteria were located on the gene locus. The mutation of strain 137 could be assigned to a deletion of a cytosine residue in Orf 8. The protein encoded by Orf 8 exhibited homology to bacterial methyl-transferases. The L. pneumophila LPS gene locus included genes with deduced products likely to be involved in LPS core oligosaccharide biosynthesis (rmlA-D, rhamnosyl-transferases, acetyl-transferase) as well as LPS O-chain biosynthesis and translocation (mnaA, neuB, neuA, wecA, wzt, wzm). The neuA (Orf 25) and neuB (Orf 24) gene products were functionally characterized by complementation of the capsule negative E. coli K1 mutants EV5 and EV24, respectively. By introduction of the L. pneumophila neuA gene into E. coli EV5 and the neuB gene into EV24, expression of the K1 polysialic acid capsule could be restored. We, therefore, conclude that the biosynthesis pathway of legionaminic acid, the structural unit of the L. pneumophila Sg1 O-antigen, might be similar to the biosynthesis of sialic acid. Southern blot analysis indicated the entire gene locus to be present in L. pneumophila serogroup (Sg)1 strains, whereas only parts of the DNA stretch hybridized to DNA from Sg2 to Sg14 strains.	1
Title: Gamma-aminobutyric acid binding to receptor sites in the rat central nervous system Abstract: [(3)H]Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binds to synaptic membrane fractions of rat brain in a selective fashion representing an interaction with postsynaptic GABA receptors. Inhibition of [(3)H]GABA binding by a variety of amino acids closely parallels their ability to mimic the synaptic inhibitory actions of GABA and does not correlate with their relative affinity for the presynaptic synaptosomal GABA uptake system. [(3)H]GABA binding is saturable with an affinity constant of about 0.1 muM. The GABA antagonist bicuculline inhibits [(3)H]GABA binding with half maximal effects at 5 muM, whereas it requires a concentration of 0.5 mM to reduce synaptosomal GABA uptake by 50%. In subcellular fractionation experiments [(3)H]GABA binding is most enriched in crude synaptic membranes. [(3)H]GABA binding is greatest in the cerebellum, least in the spinal cord and medulla oblongatapons, with intermediate values in the thalamus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, midbrain, and corpus striatum.	0
Title: Targeting tumor hypoxia: a third generation 2-nitroimidazole-indocyanine dye-conjugate with improved fluorescent yield Abstract: Tumor hypoxia is associated with the rapid proliferation and growth of malignant tumors, and the ability to detect tumor hypoxia is important for predicting tumor response to anti-cancer treatments. We have developed a class of dye-conjugates that are related to indocyanine green (ICG, ) to target tumor hypoxia, based on in vivo infrared fluorescence imaging using nitroimidazole moieties linked to indocyanine fluorescent dyes. We previously reported that linking 2-nitroimidazole to an indocyanine dicarboxylic acid dye derivative () using an ethanolamine linker (ethanolamine-2-nitroimidazole-ICG, ), led to a dye-conjugate that gave promising results for targeting cancer hypoxia in vivo. Structural modification of the dye conjugate replaced the ethanolamine unit with a piperazineacetyl unit and led a second generation dye conjugate, piperzine-2-nitroimidazole-ICG (). This second generation dye-conjugate showed improved targeting of tumor hypoxia when compared with . Based on the hypothesis that molecules with more planar and rigid structures have a higher fluorescence yield, as they could release less absorbed energy through molecular vibration or collision, we have developed a new 2-nitroimidazole ICG conjugate, , with two carbon atoms less in the polyene linker. Dye-conjugate was prepared from our new dye (), and coupled to 2-nitroimidazole using a piperazine linker to produce this third-generation dye-conjugate. Spectral measurements showed that the absorption/emission wavelengths of 657/670 were shifted ∼100 nm from the second-generation hypoxia dye of 755/780 nm. Its fluorescence quantum yield was measured to be 0.467, which is about 5 times higher than that of (0.083). In vivo experiments were conducted with balb/c mice and showed more than twice the average in vivo fluorescence intensity in the tumor beyond two hours post retro-orbital injection as compared with . These initial results suggest that may significantly improve in vivo tumor hypoxia targeting.	0

Title: Cell division in Escherichia coli: analysis of double mutants for filamentation and abnormal septation of deoxyribonucleic acid-less cells Abstract: The link between chromosome termination, initiation of cell division, and choice of division sites was studied in Escherichia coli by preparing double mutants. Hybrid mutants containing div52-ts, a cell division initiation mutation, and min, mutations which affect the choice of division sites resulting in the septation of minicells, were characterized. The mutants produced minicells and normal cells coordinately under all conditions studied, although the fraction of minicells is half that of the parental minicell strain. The mutant gradually stopped dividing at both the median and minicell septation sites when transferred from 30 to 41 C in rich medium. A synchronous cell division of filaments was induced 15 min after addition of chloramphenicol to the medium, even at 41 C. Divisions were observed at both normal and minicell sites. These results indicate that div52-ts and min functions share a common step in a cell division pathway. A double mutant containing div52-ts and div27-ts, a dnaB mutant which divides in the absence of DNA synthesis, was characterized. The mutant continues to divide after a shift to the high temperature, although at a reduced rate. The behavior of this hybrid mutant suggests a hypothesis that the chromosome termination signal and div52-ts division initiation signal act on a single membrane site which is altered in div27-ts strains.	0
Title: Developing elite Neurospora crassa strains for cellulosic ethanol production using fungal breeding Abstract: The demand for renewable and sustainable energy has generated considerable interest in the conversion of cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels such as ethanol using a filamentous fungus. While attempts have been made to study cellulose metabolism through the use of knock-out mutants, there have been no systematic effort to characterize natural variation for cellulose metabolism in ecotypes adapted to different habitats. Here, we characterized natural variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation in 73 ecotypes and 89 laboratory strains of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We observed significant variation in both traits among natural and laboratory generated populations, with some elite strains performing better than the reference strain. In the F1 population N345, 15% of the population outperformed both parents with the top performing strain having 10% improvement in ethanol production. These results suggest that natural alleles can be exploited through fungal breeding for developing elite industrial strains for bioethanol production.	0
Title: New alpha-amylase inhibitor, trestatins. II. Structure determination of trestatins A, B and C Abstract: The structures of trestatins A (C56H94N2O40), B (C37H63NO28) and C (C75H125N3O52), new basic oligosaccharides with potent inhibitory activity against various alpha-amylases, have been shown by spectroscopic and chemical methods to be 1, 2 and 3, respectively.	0
Title: Engineering viable foot-and-mouth disease viruses with increased acid stability facilitate the development of improved vaccines Abstract: Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the most acid-unstable virus among picornaviruses, tends to disassemble into pentamers at pH values slightly below neutrality. However, the structural integrity of intact virion is one of the most important factors that influence the induction of a protective antibody response. Thus, improving the acid stability of FMDV is required for the efficacy of vaccine preparations. According to the previous studies, a single substitution or double amino acid substitutions (VP1 N17D, VP2 H145Y, VP2 D86H, VP3 H142D, VP3 H142G, and VP1 N17D + VP2 H145Y) in the capsid were introduced into the full-length infectious clone of type O FMDV vaccine strain O/HN/CHN/93 to develop seed FMDV with improved acid stability. After the transfection into BSR/T7 cells of constructed plasmids, substitution VP1 N17D or VP2 D86H resulted in viable and genetically stable FMDVs, respectively. However, substitution VP2 H145Y or VP1 N17D + VP2 H145Y showed reverse mutation and additional mutations, and substitution VP3 H141G or VP3 H141D prevented viral viability. We found that substitution VP1 N17D or VP2 D86H could confer increased acid resistance, alkali stability, and thermostability on FMDV O/HN/CHN/93, whereas substitution VP1 N17D was observed to lead to a decreased replication ability in BHK-21 cells and mildly impaired virulence in suckling mice. In contrast, substitution VP2 D86H had no negative effect on viral infectivity. These results indicated that the mutant rD86H carrying substitution VP2 D86H firstly reported by us could be more adequate for the development of inactivated FMD vaccines with enhanced acid stability.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the antibiotic tropodithietic acid by the marine bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens Abstract: The biosynthesis of tropodithietic acid was investigated using a combinatorial approach of feeding experiments, gene knockouts and bioinformatic analyses.

Title: Application of Gelatin Decorated with Allura Red as Resonance Rayleigh Scattering Sensor to Detect Chito-Oligosaccharides Abstract: A convenient and sensitive triple-wavelength overlapping resonance Rayleigh scattering (TWO-RRS) method for the detection of chito-oligosaccharides (COS) was proposed based on enhancing the rigid surface of porous reticular spatial structure of gelatin and COS by introducing allura red AC (AR). The interaction and resultant porous reticular spatial structure were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), RRS, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results indicated that gelatin and COS formed porous reticular spatial structure with an average diameter of 1.5-2.0 μm, and the RRS value of COS-AR-gelatin ternary system with gelatin participation was significantly higher than that of COS-AR binary system. Under the optimal conditions, the enhanced TWO-RRS intensity of the system was linearly proportional to COS concentration in the range of 0.30-2.50 μg/mL, and the regression equation was ΔI = 4933.2c-446.21 with R2 = 0.9980. The limit of detection was 0.0478 μg/mL. So, a new method for the detection of COS was established and verified in the health products with satisfactory results.	0
Title: The response regulator PmrA is a major regulator of the icm/dot type IV secretion system in Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii Abstract: Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii have been shown to utilize the icm/dot type IV secretion system for pathogenesis and recently a large number of icm/dot-translocated substrates were identified in L. pneumophila. Bioinformatic analysis has revealed that 13 of the genes encoding for L. pneumophila-translocated substrates and five of the C. burnetii icm/dot genes, contain a conserved regulatory element that resembles the target sequence of the PmrA response regulator. Experimental analysis which included the construction of a L. pneumophila pmrA deletion mutant, intracellular growth analysis, comparison of gene expression between L. pneumophila wild type and the pmrA mutant, construction of mutations in the PmrA conserved regulatory element, controlled expression studies as well as mobility shift assays, demonstrated the direct relation between the PmrA regulator and the expression of L. pneumophila icm/dot-translocated substrates and several C. burnetii icm/dot genes. Furthermore, genomic analysis identified 35 L. pneumophila and 68 C. burnetii unique genes that contain the PmrA regulatory element and few of these genes from L. pneumophila were found to be new icm/dot-translocated substrates. Our results establish the PmrA regulator as a fundamental regulator of the icm/dot type IV secretion system in these two bacteria.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of fusarubins accounts for pigmentation of Fusarium fujikuroi perithecia Abstract: Fusarium fujikuroi produces a variety of secondary metabolites, of which polyketides form the most diverse group. Among these are the highly pigmented naphthoquinones, which have been shown to possess different functional properties for the fungus. A group of naphthoquinones, polyketides related to fusarubin, were identified in Fusarium spp. more than 60 years ago, but neither the genes responsible for their formation nor their biological function has been discovered to date. In addition, although it is known that the sexual fruiting bodies in which the progeny of the fungus develops are darkly colored by a polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived pigment, the structure of this pigment has never been elucidated. Here we present data that link the fusarubin-type polyketides to a defined gene cluster, which we designate fsr, and demonstrate that the fusarubins are the pigments responsible for the coloration of the perithecia. We studied their regulation and the function of the single genes within the cluster by a combination of gene replacements and overexpression of the PKS-encoding gene, and we present a model for the biosynthetic pathway of the fusarubins based on these data.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of the antibiotic bottromycin D Abstract: Drug resistant infectious diseases are quickly becoming a global health crisis. While Streptomyces spp. have been a major source of antibiotics over the past 50 years, efficient methods are needed to identify new antibiotics and greatly improve the rate of discovery. LCMS-based metabolomics were applied to analyze extracts of 50 Streptomyes spp. Using this methodology, we discovered bottromycin D and used whole genome sequencing to determine its biosynthesis by a ribosomal pathway.	1
Title: Identification of a cluster of genes that directs desferrioxamine biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor M145 Abstract: Desferrioxamines are a structurally related family of tris-hydroxamate siderophores that form strong hexadentate complexes with ferric iron. Desferrioxamine B has been used clinically for the treatment of iron overload in man. We have unambiguously identified desferrioxamine E as the major desferrioxamine siderophore produced by Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and have identified a cluster of four genes (desA-D) that directs desferrioxamine biosynthesis in this model actinomycete. On the basis of comparative sequence analysis of the proteins encoded by these genes, we propose a plausible pathway for desferrioxamine biosynthesis. The desferrioxamine biosynthetic pathway belongs to a new and rapidly emerging family of pathways for siderophore biosynthesis, widely distributed across diverse species of bacteria, which is biochemically distinct from the better known nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway used in many organisms for siderophore biosynthesis.	1
Title: Uncovering production of specialized metabolites by Streptomyces argillaceus: Activation of cryptic biosynthesis gene clusters using nutritional and genetic approaches Abstract: Sequencing of Streptomyces genomes has revealed they harbor a high number of biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC), which uncovered their enormous potentiality to encode specialized metabolites. However, these metabolites are not usually produced under standard laboratory conditions. In this manuscript we report the activation of BGCs for antimycins, carotenoids, germicidins and desferrioxamine compounds in Streptomyces argillaceus, and the identification of the encoded compounds. This was achieved by following different strategies, including changing the growth conditions, heterologous expression of the cluster and inactivating the adpAa or overexpressing the abrC3 global regulatory genes. In addition, three new carotenoid compounds have been identified.	1
Title: LanV, a bifunctional enzyme: aromatase and ketoreductase during landomycin A biosynthesis Abstract: LanV is involved in the biosynthesis of landomycin A. The exact function of this enzyme was elucidated with combinatorial biosynthesis by using Streptomyces fradiae mutants that produce urdamycin A. After expression of lanV in S. fradiae DeltaurdM, which is a mutant that accumulates rabelomycin, urdamycinon B and urdamycin B were found to be produced by the strain. This result indicates that LanV is involved in the 6-ketoreduction of the angucycline core, which preceeds a 5,6-dehydration reaction. 9-C-D-Olivosyltetrangulol was also produced by this strain; this demonstrates that LanV catalyses the aromatization of ring A of the angucycline structure. Coexpression of lanV and lanGT2 in S. fradiae AO, a mutant that lacks all four urdamycin glycosyltransferases, resulted in the production of tetrangulol and the glycoside landomycin H, both of which have an aromatic ring A. As glycosylated angucyclines were not observed after expression of lanGT2 in the absence of lanV, we conclude that LanGT2 needs an aromatized ring A for substrate recognition.	1
Title: Influence of water management on the active root-associated microbiota involved in arsenic, iron, and sulfur cycles in rice paddies Abstract: In recent years, the role of microorganisms inhabiting rice rhizosphere in promoting arsenic contamination has emerged. However, little is known concerning the species and metabolic properties involved in this phenomenon. In this study, the influence of water management on the rhizosphere microbiota in relation to arsenic dissolution in soil solution was tested. Rice plants were cultivated in macrocosms under different water regimes: continuous flooding, continuous flooding with a 2-week period drainage before flowering, and dry soil watered every 10 days. The active bacterial communities in rhizosphere soil and in rhizoplane were characterized by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. An in-depth analysis of microbial taxa with direct or indirect effects on arsenic speciation was performed and related contribution was evaluated. Continuous flooding promoted high diversity in the rhizosphere, with the plant strongly determining species richness and evenness. On the contrary, under watering the communities were uniform, with little differences between rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane. Arsenic-releasing and arsenite-methylating bacteria were selected by continuous flooding, where they represented 8% of the total. On the contrary, bacteria decreasing arsenic solubility were more abundant under watering, with relative abundance of 10%. These values reflected arsenic concentrations in soil solution: 135 μg L-1 and negligible in continuous flooding and under watering, respectively. When short-term drainage was applied before flowering, intermediate conditions were achieved. This evidence strongly indicates an active role of the rhizosphere microbiota in driving arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddies, influenced by water management, explaining amounts and speciation of arsenic often found in rice grains.	0
Title: Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster for R1128, a non-steroidal estrogen receptor antagonist. Insights into an unusual priming mechanism Abstract: R1128 substances are anthraquinone natural products that were previously reported as non-steroidal estrogen receptor antagonists with in vitro and in vivo potency approaching that of tamoxifen. From a biosynthetic viewpoint, these polyketides possess structurally interesting features such as an unusual primer unit that are absent in the well studied anthracyclic and tetracyclic natural products. The entire R1128 gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Streptomyces lividans, a genetically well developed heterologous host. In addition to R1128C, a novel optically active natural product, designated HU235, was isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster revealed genes encoding two ketosynthases, a chain length factor, an acyl transferase, three acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunits, two cyclases, two oxygenases, an amidase, and remarkably, two acyl carrier proteins. Feeding studies indicate that the unusual 4-methylvaleryl side chain of R1128C is derived from valine. Together with the absence of a dedicated ketoreductase, dehydratase, or enoylreductase within the R1128 gene cluster, this suggests a functional link between fatty acid biosynthesis and R1128 biosynthesis in the engineered host. Specifically, we propose that the R1128 synthase recruits four subunits from the endogenous fatty acid synthase during the biosynthesis of this family of pharmacologically significant natural products.	1
Title: Expression and functional analysis of a gene cluster involved in the synthesis of decaprenoxanthin reveals the mechanisms for C50 carotenoid formation Abstract: Corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates the C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. Rescued DNA from transposon color mutants of this Gram-positive bacterium was used to clone the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster. By sequence comparison and functional complementation, the genes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids with 50 carbon atoms were identified. The genes crtE, encoding a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, crtB, encoding a phytoene synthase, and crtI, encoding a phytoene desaturase, are responsible for the formation of lycopene. The products of three novel genes, crtYe and crtYf, with sequence similarities to heterodimeric lycopene cyclase crtYc and crtYd, together with crtEb which exhibits a prenyl transferase motif, were involved in the conversion of C40 acyclic lycopene to cyclic C50 carotenoids. Using functional complementation in Escherichia coli, it could be shown that the elongation of lycopene to the acyclic C50 carotenoid flavuxanthin by the addition of C5 isoprenoid units at positions C-2 and C-2' is catalyzed by the crtEb gene product. Subsequently, the gene products of crtYe and crtYf in a concerted action convert the acyclic flavuxanthin into the cyclic C50 carotene, decaprenoxanthin, forming two epsilon-ionone groups. The mechanisms, involving two individual steps for the formation of cyclic C50 carotenoids from lycopene, are proposed on the basis of these results.	1
Title: Cloning and biochemical characterization of the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula Abstract: Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are a rich source of novel bioactive secondary metabolites that have potential applications as antimicrobial or anticancer agents or useful probes in cell biology studies. A Jamaican collection of the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula has yielded several unique compounds including hectochlorin ( 1) and the jamaicamides A-C ( 5- 7). Hectochlorin has remarkable antifungal and cytotoxic properties. In this study, we have isolated the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster ( hct) from L. majuscula to obtain details regarding its biosynthesis at the molecular genetic level. The genetic architecture and domain organization appear to be colinear with respect to its biosynthesis and consists of eight open reading frames (ORFs) spanning 38 kb. An unusual feature of the cluster is the presence of ketoreductase (KR) domains in two peptide synthetase modules, which are predicted to be involved in the formation of the two 2,3-dihydroxyisovaleric acid (DHIV) units. This biosynthetic motif has only recently been described in cereulide, valinomycin, and cryptophycin biosynthesis, and hence, this is only the second such report of an embedded ketoreductase in a cyanobacterial secondary metabolite gene cluster. Also present at the downstream end of the cluster are two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which are likely involved in the formation of the DHIV units. A putative halogenase, at the beginning of the gene cluster, is predicted to form 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acid.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of Chitinophaga pinensis type strain (UQM 2034) Abstract: Chitinophaga pinensis Sangkhobol and Skerman 1981 is the type strain of the species which is the type species of the rapidly growing genus Chitinophaga in the sphingobacterial family 'Chitinophagaceae'. Members of the genus Chitinophaga vary in shape between filaments and spherical bodies without the production of a fruiting body, produce myxospores, and are of special interest for their ability to degrade chitin. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence, and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the family 'Chitinophagaceae', and the 9,127,347 bp long single replicon genome with its 7,397 protein-coding and 95 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.	1
Title: Relative catalytic efficiency of ldhL- and ldhD-encoded products is crucial for optical purity of lactic acid produced by lactobacillus strains Abstract: NAD-dependent l- and d-lactate dehydrogenases coexist in Lactobacillus genomes and may convert pyruvic acid into l-lactic acid and d-lactic acid, respectively. Our findings suggest that the relative catalytic efficiencies of ldhL- and ldhD-encoded products are crucial for the optical purity of lactic acid produced by Lactobacillus strains.	0
Title: Studies on WB-3559 A, B, C and D, new potent fibrinolytic agents. I. Discovery, identification, isolation and characterization Abstract: WB-3559 A, B, C and D were produced by a bacterium which was classified as a member of the genus Flavobacterium. These compounds were purified by solvent extraction followed by chromatography on silica gel and then isolated by HPLC. The chemical structures were determined on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence as in the succeeding papers. WB-3559 A, B, C and D stimulated rabbit plasma euglobulin clot lysis time. A chemically synthesized compound (WB-3559 D-syn) stimulated mouse plasma euglobulin clot lysis time when injected intravenously.	0
Title: The blasticidin S biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces griseochromogenes: sequence analysis, organization, and initial characterization Abstract: Blasticidin S is a potent antifungal and cytotoxic peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic from Streptomyces griseochromogenes. The mixed biosynthesis of the compound is evident from the three distinct structural components: a cytosine base, an amino deoxyglucuronic acid, and N-methyl beta-arginine. The blasticidin S biosynthesis gene cluster was cloned from S. griseochromogenes and the pathway heterologously expressed in S. lividans from a cosmid harboring a 36.7-kb fragment of S. griseochromogenes DNA. The complete DNA sequence of this insert has now been determined and evidence suggests a contiguous 20-kb section defines the blasticidin S biosynthesis cluster. The predicted functions of several open reading frames are consistent with the expected biochemistry and include an arginine 2,3-aminomutase, a cytosylglucuronic acid synthase, and a guanidino N-methyltransferase. Insight into other steps in the assembly of blasticidin S was evident from sequence homology with proteins of known function and heterologous expression of fragments of the cluster. Additionally, the gene that directs the production of free cytosine, blsM, was subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of BlsM revealed that cytidine monophosphate serves as the precursor to cytosine.	1
Title: Extracellular signalling, translational control, two repressors and an activator all contribute to the regulation of methylenomycin production in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Bioinformatic analysis of the plasmid-linked gene cluster associated with biosynthesis of methylenomycin (Mm) suggested that part of the cluster directs synthesis of a gamma-butyrolactone-like autoregulator. Autoregulator activity could be extracted from culture fluids, but differed from gamma-butyrolactones in being alkali resistant. The activity has recently been shown to comprise a series of novel autoregulator molecules, the methylenomycin furans (termed MMF). MMF autoregulator activity is shown to account for the ability of certain Mm non-producing mutants to act as 'secretors' in cosynthesis with other 'convertor' mutants. Three genes implicated in MMF biosynthesis are flanked by two regulatory genes, which are related to genes for gamma-butyrolactone-binding proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that these two genes encode components of a hetero-oligomeric repressor of MMF and Mm biosynthesis. The Mm biosynthetic genes themselves depend on the activator gene mmyB, which appears to be repressed by the putative MmyR/MmfR complex until enough MMF accumulates to release repression. The presence of TTA codons in mmyB and the main MMF biosynthetic gene causes Mm production to be dependent on the pleiotropically acting bldA gene, which encodes the tRNA for the rarely used UUA codon.	1
Title: Molecular basis for the recognition of structurally distinct autoinducer mimics by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing signaling receptor Abstract: The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the expression of virulence factors using quorum sensing, a signaling cascade triggered by the activation of signal receptors by small-molecule autoinducers. These homoserine lactone autoinducers stabilize their cognate receptors and activate their functions as transcription factors. Because quorum sensing regulates the progression of infection and host immune resistance, significant efforts have been devoted toward the identification of small molecules that disrupt this process. Screening efforts have identified a class of triphenyl compounds that are structurally distinct from the homoserine lactone autoinducer, yet interact specifically and potently with LasR receptor to modulate quorum sensing (Muh et al., 2006a). Here we present the high-resolution crystal structures of the ligand binding domain of LasR in complex with the autoinducer N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (1.4 A resolution), and with the triphenyl mimics TP-1, TP-3, and TP-4 (to between 1.8 A and 2.3 A resolution). These crystal structures provide a molecular rationale for understanding how chemically distinct compounds can be accommodated by a highly selective receptor, and provide the framework for the development of novel quorum-sensing regulators, utilizing the triphenyl scaffold.	0
Title: Xanthomonins I-III: a new class of lasso peptides with a seven-residue macrolactam ring Abstract: Lasso peptides belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. Their common distinguishing feature is an N-terminal macrolactam ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail. This lasso fold is maintained through steric interactions. The isolation and characterization of xanthomonins I-III, the first lasso peptides featuring macrolactam rings consisting of only seven amino acids, is now presented. The crystal structure of xanthomonin I and the NMR structure of xanthomonin II were also determined. A total of 25 variants of xanthomonin II were generated to probe different aspects of the biosynthesis, stability, and fold maintenance. These mutational studies reveal the limits such a small ring imposes on the threading and show that every plug amino acid larger than serine is able to maintain a heat-stable lasso fold in the xanthomonin II scaffold.	1
Title: Receptor-Type Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase ζ and Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor in the Intestine: Cellular Expression and Cytokine- and Chemokine Responses by Interleukin-34 and Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Abstract: Differential intestinal expression of the macrophage growth factors colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), interleukin (IL)-34, and their shared CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown. Diverse expression between CSF-1 and IL-34, suggest that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. Receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTPRZ1, RPTP-ζ), an additional IL-34 receptor, was recently identified. Here, we aimed to assess PTPRZ1 expression in IBD and non-IBD intestinal biopsies. Further, we aimed to investigate cellular PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R expression, and cytokine- and chemokine responses by IL-34 and CSF-1. The expression of PTPRZ1 was higher in non-IBD colon compared to ileum. PTPRZ1 expression was not altered with inflammation in IBD, however, correlated to IL34, CSF1, and CSF1R. The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line. PBMCs and monocytes of the same donors responded differently to IL-34 and CSF-1 with altered expression of tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-13, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. This study shows that PTPRZ1 was expressed in bowel tissue. Furthermore, CSF-1R protein was detected in an intestinal epithelial cell line and donor dependently in primary PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages, and first hints also suggest an expression in these cells for PTPRZ1, which may mediate IL-34 and CSF-1 actions.	0
Title: Synthesis, molecular and crystal structure analysis of 1-(4-Methylbenzenesulfonyl)indole-3-carbaldehyde and DFT investigation of its rotational conformers Abstract: Two independent molecules that differ in terms of rotation about the central S-N bond comprise the asymmetric unit of the title compound 1. The molecules have a V-shape with the dihedral angles between the fused ring system and benzene ring being 79.08(6)° and 72.83(5)°, respectively. The packing is mostly driven by p···p interactions occurring between the tolyl ring of one molecule and the C6 ring of the indole fused ring system of the other. DFT and IRC calculations for these and related 1-(arylsulfonyl)indole molecules showed that the rotational barrier about the S-N bond between conformers is within the 2.5-5.5 kcal/mol range. Crystal data for C16H13NO3S (1): Mr = 299.33, space group Pna21, a = 19.6152(4) Å, b = 11.2736(4) Å, c = 12.6334(3) Å, V = 2793.67(13) Å3, Z = 8, Z' = 2, R = 0.034.	0
Title: Comparative analysis and insights into the evolution of gene clusters for glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The bal, cep, dbv, sta and tcp gene clusters specify the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotics balhimycin, chloroeremomycin, A40926, A47934 and teicoplanin, respectively. These structurally related compounds share a similar mechanism of action in their inhibition of bacterial cell wall formation. Comparative sequence analysis was performed on the five gene clusters. Extensive conserved synteny was observed between the bal and cep clusters, which direct the synthesis of very similar compounds but originate from two different species of the genus Amycolatopsis. All other cluster pairs show a limited degree of conserved synteny, involving biosynthetically functional gene cassettes: these include those involved in the synthesis of the carbon backbone of two non-proteinogenic amino acids; in the linkage of amino acids 1--3 and 4--7 in the heptapeptide; and in the formation of the aromatic cross-links. Furthermore, these segments of conserved synteny are often preceded by conserved intergenic regions. Phylogenetic analysis of protein families shows several instances in which relatedness in the chemical structure of the glycopeptides is not reflected in the extent of the relationship of the corresponding polypeptides. Coherent branchings are observed for all polypeptides encoded by the syntenous gene cassettes. These results suggest that the acquisition of distinct, functional genetic elements has played a significant role in the evolution of glycopeptide gene clusters, giving them a mosaic structure. In addition, the synthesis of the structurally similar compounds A40926 and teicoplanin appears as the result of convergent evolution.	1
Title: Bisucaberin B, a linear hydroxamate class siderophore from the marine bacterium Tenacibaculum mesophilum Abstract: A siderophore, named bisucaberin B, was isolated from Tenacibaculum mesophilum bacteria separated from a marine sponge collected in the Republic of Palau. Using spectroscopic and chemical methods, the structure of bisucaberin B (1) was clearly determined to be a linear dimeric hydroxamate class siderophore. Although compound 1 is an open form of the known macrocyclic dimer bisucaberin (2), and was previously described as a bacterial degradation product of desferrioxamine B (4), the present report is the first description of the de novo biosynthesis of 1. To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 is the first chemically characterized siderophore isolated from a bacterium belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes.	1
Title: CMY-31 and CMY-36 cephalosporinases encoded by ColE1-like plasmids Abstract: Two CMY-2 derivatives, CMY-31 (Gln(215)-->Arg) from Salmonella enterica serotype Newport and CMY-36 (Ala(77)-->Cys and Gln(193)-->Glu) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, were characterized. Both cephalosporinases functionally resembled CMY-2. bla(CMY) alleles occurred as parts of a putative transposon comprising ISEcp1B and a Citrobacter freundii-derived sequence carried by ColE1-like plasmids similar to CMY-5-encoding pTKH11 from Klebsiella oxytoca.	0
Title: Cytosolic NADPH balancing in Penicillium chrysogenum cultivated on mixtures of glucose and ethanol Abstract: The in vivo flux through the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) in Penicillium chrysogenum was determined during growth in glucose/ethanol carbon-limited chemostat cultures, at the same growth rate. Non-stationary (13)C flux analysis was used to measure the oxPPP flux. A nearly constant oxPPP flux was found for all glucose/ethanol ratios studied. This indicates that the cytosolic NADPH supply is independent of the amount of assimilated ethanol. The cofactor assignment in the model of van Gulik et al. (Biotechnol Bioeng 68(6):602-618, 2000) was supported using the published genome annotation of P. chrysogenum. Metabolic flux analysis showed that NADPH requirements in the cytosol remain nearly the same in these experiments due to constant biomass growth. Based on the cytosolic NADPH balance, it is known that the cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase in P. chrysogenum is NAD(+) dependent. Metabolic modeling shows that changing the NAD(+)-aldehyde dehydrogenase to NADP(+)-aldehyde dehydrogenase can increase the penicillin yield on substrate.	0
Title: Similarity and differences in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics Abstract: A set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis, DNA typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. On microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of L. johnsonii. When projected on the NCC533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. A quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile DNA. Signatures for horizontal gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in DNA from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. On microarray hybridizations, Lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence intensities than the L. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from L. acidophilus hybridized to the L. johnsonii array. In-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of L. johnsonii with L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with Lactobacillus casei; and scattered X-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. The observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the L. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. Modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.	1
Title: A family of diiron monooxygenases catalyzing amino acid beta-hydroxylation in antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthesis of chloramphenicol requires a beta-hydroxylation tailoring reaction of the precursor L-p-aminophenylalanine (L-PAPA). Here, it is shown that this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme CmlA from an operon containing the genes for biosynthesis of L-PAPA and the nonribosomal peptide synthetase CmlP. EPR, Mössbauer, and optical spectroscopies reveal that CmlA contains an oxo-bridged dinuclear iron cluster, a metal center not previously associated with nonribosomal peptide synthetase chemistry. Single-turnover kinetic studies indicate that CmlA is functional in the diferrous state and that its substrate is L-PAPA covalently bound to CmlP. Analytical studies show that the product is hydroxylated L-PAPA and that O(2) is the oxygen source, demonstrating a monooxygenase reaction. The gene sequence of CmlA shows that it utilizes a lactamase fold, suggesting that the diiron cluster is in a protein environment not previously known to effect monooxygenase reactions. Notably, CmlA homologs are widely distributed in natural product biosynthetic pathways, including a variety of pharmaceutically important beta-hydroxylated antibiotics and cytostatics.	1
Title: A fluorogenic histone deacetylase assay well suited for high-throughput activity screening Abstract: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important enzymes for the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Recent findings suggest that HDACs could be key targets for chemotherapeutic intervention in malignant diseases. A convenient and sensitive fluorogenic assay for HDAC activity would therefore expedite studies of HDAC in transcriptional regulation and in vitro screening for drug discovery. In this study, novel fluorogenic substrates of HDACs were synthesized with an epsilon-acetylated lysyl moiety and an adjacent MCA moiety at the C terminus of the peptide chain. Upon deacetylation of the acetylated lysyl moiety, molecules became substrates for trypsin, which released highly fluorescent AMC molecules in a subsequent step of the assay. The fluorescence increased in direct proportion to the amount of deacetylated substrate molecules, i.e., HDAC activity. The nonisotopic, homogeneous assay is well suited for high-throughput HDAC inhibitor screening.	0
Title: Amplification, Decoherence, and the Acquisition of Information by Spin Environments Abstract: Quantum Darwinism recognizes the role of the environment as a communication channel: Decoherence can selectively amplify information about the pointer states of a system of interest (preventing access to complementary information about their superpositions) and can make records of this information accessible to many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective, classical reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the amplification of information in realistic spin environments can be quantified by the quantum Chernoff information, which characterizes the distinguishability of partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except for a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires redundant information. Moreover, the Chernoff information captures the rich behavior of amplification in both finite and infinite spin environments, from quadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These results will considerably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using nitrogen vacancies in diamond.	0
Title: The Escherichia coli highly expressed entD gene complements the pfaE deficiency in a pfa gene clone responsible for the biosynthesis of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Abstract: The Escherichia coli entD gene, which encodes an Sfp-type phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that is involved in the biosynthesis of siderophore, is available as a high-expression ASKA clone (pCA24N::entD) constructed from the E. coli K-12 strain AG1. In E. coli DH5alpha, pCA24N::entD complemented a pfaE-deficient clone that comprised pfaA, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD, which are four of the five pfa genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid derived from Shewanella pneumatophori SCRC-2738. Sfp-type PPTases are classified into the EntD and PfaE groups, based on differences between their N-terminal-domain structures. Here, we showed that all Sfp-type PPTases may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	0
Title: Characterization of a Prenyltransferase for Iso-A82775C Biosynthesis and Generation of New Congeners of Chloropestolides Abstract: Chloropupukeananin and chloropestolides are novel metabolites of the plant endophyte Pestalotiopsis fici, showing antimicrobial, antitumor, and anti-HIV activities. Their highly complex and unique skeletons were generated from the coisolated pestheic acid (1) and iso-A82775C (10) based on our previous studies. Here, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster iac of 10 and characterized an iacE encoded prenyltransferase. Deletion of iacE abolished iso-A82775C production, accumulated the prenyl group-lacking siccayne (2), and generated four new chloropestolides (3-6). Compounds 5 and 6 showed antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and 5 was also cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines HeLa, MCF-7, and SW480. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical insights into the biosynthesis of natural prenylepoxycyclohexanes and demonstrated the feasibility for generation of diversified congeners by manipulating the biosynthetic genes of 10.	1
Title: Mitochondrial mutations restricting spontaneous translational frameshift suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The +1 frameshift mutation, M5631, which is located in the gene (oxi1) for cytochrome c oxidase II (COXII) of the yeast mitochondrial genome, is suppressed spontaneously to a remarkably high extent (20%-30%). The full-length wild-type COXII produced as a result of suppression allows the mutant strain to grow with a "leaky" phenotype on non-fermentable medium. In order to elucidate the factors and interactions involved in this translational suppression, the strain with the frameshift mutation was mutated by MnCl2 treatment and a large number of mutants showing restriction of the suppression were isolated. Of 20 mutants exhibiting a strong, restricted, respiration-deficient (RD) phenotype, 6 were identified as having mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, genetic analyses mapped one mutation to the vicinity of the gene for tRNA(Pro) and two others to a region of the tRNA cluster where two-thirds of all mitochondrial tRNA genes are encoded. The degree of restriction of the spontaneous frameshift suppression was characterized at the translational level by in vivo 35S-labeling of the mitochondrial translational products and immunoblotting. These results showed that in some of these mutant strains the frameshift suppression product is synthesized to the same extent as in the leaky parent strain. It is suggested that more than one +1 frame-shifted product is made as a result of suppression in these strains: one is as functional as the wild-type COXII, the other(s) is (are) nonfunctional and prevent leaky growth on non-fermentable medium. A possible mechanism for this heterogenous frameshift suppression is discussed.	0
Title: Design of a Short Thermally Stable α-Helix Embedded in a Macrocycle Abstract: Although helices play key roles in peptide-protein and protein-protein interactions, the helical conformation is generally unstable for short peptides (10-15 residues) in aqueous solution in the absence of their binding partners. Thus, stabilizing the helical conformation of peptides can lead to increases in binding potency, specificity, and stability towards proteolytic degradation. Helices have been successfully stabilized by introducing side chain-to-side chain crosslinks within the central portion of the helix. However, this approach leaves the ends of the helix free, thus leading to fraying and exposure of the non-hydrogen-bonded amide groups to solvent. Here, we develop a "capped-strapped" peptide strategy to stabilize helices by embedding the entire length of the helix within a macrocycle, which also includes a semirigid organic template as well as end-capping interactions. We have designed a ten-residue capped-strapped helical peptide that behaves like a miniprotein, with a cooperative thermal unfolding transition and Tm ≈70 °C, unprecedented for helical peptides of this length. The NMR structure determination confirmed the design, and X-ray crystallography revealed a novel quaternary structure with implications for foldamer design.	0
Title: Structure of cytochrome P450eryF involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: Cytochrome P450eryF catalyzes the 6S-hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the initial reaction in a multistep pathway to convert 6-deoxyerythronolide B into the antibiotic, erythromycin. The overall structure of P450eryF is similar to that of P450cam but differs in the exact positioning of several alpha-helices. The largest difference occurs in the B' helix and results in the enlargement of the substrate-binding pocket of P450eryF. The substrate is positioned with the macrolide ring perpendicular to the haem plane and contacts seven hydrophobic residues and three solvent molecules. The substrate participates in a network of hydrogen bonds that may provide a proton shuttle pathway in the oxygen cleavage reaction.	1
Title: Chemical Constituents of the Deep-Sea-Derived Penicillium citreonigrum MCCC 3A00169 and Their Antiproliferative Effects Abstract: Six new citreoviridins (citreoviridins J-O, 1-6) and twenty-two known compounds (7-28) were isolated from the deep-sea-derived Penicillium citreonigrum MCCC 3A00169. The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods, including the HRESIMS, NMR, ECD calculations, and dimolybdenum tetraacetate-induced CD (ICD) experiments. Citreoviridins J-O (1-6) are diastereomers of 6,7-epoxycitreoviridin with different chiral centers at C-2-C-7. Pyrenocine A (7), terrein (14), and citreoviridin (20) significantly induced apoptosis for HeLa cells with IC50 values of 5.4 μM, 11.3 μM, and 0.7 μM, respectively. To be specific, pyrenocine A could induce S phase arrest, while terrein and citreoviridin could obviously induce G0-G1 phase arrest. Citreoviridin could inhibit mTOR activity in HeLa cells.	0
Title: Heterologous expression of the msp2 gene from Marasmius scorodonius Abstract: For the heterologous expression of the msp2 gene from the edible mushroom Marasmius scorodonius in Escherichia coli the cDNA encoding the extracellular Msp2 peroxidase was cloned into the pBAD III expression plasmid. Expression of the protein with or without signal peptide was investigated in E. coli strains TOP10 and LMG194. Different PCR products were amplified for expression of the native target protein or a protein with a signal peptide. Omitting the native stop codon and adding six His-residues resulted in a fusion protein amenable to immune detection and purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography. In E. coli the recombinant protein was produced in high yield as insoluble inclusion bodies. The influence of different parameters on MsP2 refolding was investigated. Active enzyme was obtained by glutathione-mediated oxidation in a medium containing urea, Ca(2+), and hemin.	0
Title: Genomics-Guided Exploitation of Lipopeptide Diversity in Myxobacteria Abstract: Analysis of 122 myxobacterial genome sequences suggested 16 strains as producers of the myxochromide lipopeptide family. Detailed sequence comparison of the respective mch biosynthetic gene clusters informed a genome-mining approach, ultimately leading to the discovery and chemical characterization of four novel myxochromide core types. The myxochromide megasynthetase is subject to evolutionary diversification, resulting in considerable structural diversity of biosynthesis products. The observed differences are due to the number, type, sequence, and configuration of the incorporated amino acids. The analysis revealed molecular details on how point mutations and recombination events led to structural diversity. It also gave insights into the evolutionary scenarios that have led to the emergence of mch clusters in different strains and genera of myxobacteria.	1
Title: The effect of geometric isomerism on the anticancer activity of the monofunctional platinum complex trans-[Pt(NH3)2(phenanthridine)Cl]NO3 Abstract: A trans-DDP based monofunctional phenanthridine Pt(ii) complex was synthesized and characterized. Its anticancer activity was studied in vitro on a panel of human cancer cell lines and mouse intestinal cancer organoids. This complex displays significant antitumor properties, with a different spectrum of activity than that of classic bifunctional cross-linking agents like cisplatin.	0
Title: Comparison of cyanopeptolin genes in Planktothrix, Microcystis, and Anabaena strains: evidence for independent evolution within each genus Abstract: The major cyclic peptide cyanopeptolin 1138, produced by Planktothrix strain NIVA CYA 116, was characterized and shown to be structurally very close to the earlier-characterized oscillapeptin E. A cyanopeptolin gene cluster likely to encode the corresponding peptide synthetase was sequenced from the same strain. The 30-kb oci gene cluster contains two novel domains previously not detected in nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters (a putative glyceric acid-activating domain and a sulfotransferase domain), in addition to seven nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules. Unlike in two previously described cyanopeptolin gene clusters from Anabaena and Microcystis, a halogenase gene is not present. The three cyanopeptolin gene clusters show similar gene and domain arrangements, while the binding pocket signatures deduced from the adenylation domain sequences and the additional tailoring domains vary. This suggests loss and gain of tailoring domains within each genus, after the diversification of the three clades, as major events leading to the present diversity. The ABC transporter genes associated with the cyanopeptolin gene clusters form a monophyletic clade and accordingly are likely to have evolved as part of the functional unit. Phylogenetic analyses of adenylation and condensation domains, including domains from cyanopeptolins and microcystins, show a closer similarity between the Planktothrix and Microcystis cyanopeptolin domains than between these and the Anabaena domain. No clear evidence of recombination between cyanopeptolins and microcystins could be detected. There were no strong indications of horizontal gene transfer of cyanopeptolin gene sequences across the three genera, supporting independent evolution within each genus.	1
Title: The Structure of the Bifunctional Everninomicin Biosynthetic Enzyme EvdMO1 Suggests Independent Activity of the Fused Methyltransferase-Oxidase Domains Abstract: Members of the orthosomycin family of natural products are decorated polysaccharides with potent antibiotic activity and complex biosynthetic pathways. The defining feature of the orthosomycins is an orthoester linkage between carbohydrate moieties that is necessary for antibiotic activity and is likely formed by a family of conserved oxygenases. Everninomicins are octasaccharide orthosomycins produced by Micromonospora carbonacea that have two orthoester linkages and a methylenedioxy bridge, three features whose formation logically requires oxidative chemistry. Correspondingly, the evd gene cluster encoding everninomicin D encodes two monofunctional nonheme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases and one bifunctional enzyme with an N-terminal methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal oxygenase domain. To investigate whether the activities of these domains are linked in the bifunctional enzyme EvdMO1, we determined the structure of the N-terminal methyltransferase domain to 1.1 Å and that of the full-length protein to 3.35 Å resolution. Both domains of EvdMO1 adopt the canonical folds of their respective superfamilies and are connected by a short linker. Each domain's active site is oriented such that it faces away from the other domain, and there is no evidence of a channel connecting the two. Our results support EvdMO1 working as a bifunctional enzyme with independent catalytic activities.	1
Title: Degradation of mutant influenza virus hemagglutinins is influenced by cytoplasmic sequences independent of internalization signals Abstract: A mutant influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA+8, having a carboxyl-terminal extension of 8 amino acids that included 4 aromatic residues, was internalized within 2 min of arriving at the cell surface and was degraded quickly by a process that was inhibited by ammonium chloride. Through second-site mutagenesis, the internalization sequence of HA+8 was found to closely resemble the internalization signals of the transferrin receptor or large mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Comparison of the intracellular traffic of HA+8 and a series of other HA mutants that differed in their rates of internalization revealed a relation between the amount of the protein on the plasma membrane at steady state and the internalization rate that would be predicted if most of each protein recycled to the cell surface. However, there was no simple correlation between the internalization rate and the rate of degradation, indicating that transport to the compartment where degradation occurred was not simply a function of the concentration of the proteins in early endosomes. The internal populations of both HA+8, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 1.9 h, and HA-Y543, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 2.9 h, were found by cell fractionation and density-shift experiments to reside in early endosomes with little accumulation in lysosomes. A fluid-phase marker reached lysosomes 3-4-fold faster than these proteins were degraded. Degradation of these mutant HAs involved a rate-determining step in early endosomes that was sensitive to some feature of the protein that depended upon sequence differences in the cytoplasmic domain unrelated to the internalization signal.	0
Title: Three-dimensional structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PvcA and PvcB, two proteins involved in the synthesis of 2-isocyano-6,7-dihydroxycoumarin Abstract: The pvcABCD operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes four proteins (PA2254, PA2255, PA2256, and PA2257) that form a cluster that is responsible for the synthesis of a cyclized isocyano derivative of tyrosine. These proteins, which were identified originally as being responsible for a step in the maturation of the chromophore of the peptide siderophore pyoverdine, have been identified recently as belonging to a family of proteins that produce small organic isonitriles. We report that strains harboring a disruption in the pvcA or pvcB genes are able to grow in iron-depleted conditions and to produce pyoverdine. Additionally, we have determined the three-dimensional crystal structures of PvcA and PvcB. The structure of PvcA demonstrates a novel enzyme architecture that is built upon a Rossmann fold. We have analyzed the sequence conservation of enzymes within this family and identified six conserved motifs. These regions of the protein cluster around a putative active site cavity. The structure of the PvcB protein confirms it is a member of the Fe2+/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase family of enzymes. The active site of PvcB is compared to the structures of other family members and suggests that a conformational change to order several loops will accompany the binding of ligands.	1
Title: Specificity of the ester bond forming condensation enzyme SgcC5 in C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: The SgcC5 condensation enzyme catalyzes the attachment of SgcC2-tethered (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-β-tyrosine (2) to the enediyne core in C-1027 (1) biosynthesis. It is reported that SgcC5 (i) exhibits high stereospecificity toward the (S)-enantiomers of SgcC2-tethered β-tyrosine and analogues as donors, (ii) prefers the (R)-enantiomers of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (3) and analogues, mimicking the enediyne core, as acceptors, and (iii) can recognize a variety of donor and acceptor substrates to catalyze their regio- and stereospecific ester bond formations.	1
Title: A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase is integrated in DIMBOA-biosynthesis Abstract: Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites of grasses that function as natural pesticides. While many steps of DIMBOA biosynthesis have been elucidated, the mechanism of the introduction of OCH(3)-group at the C-7 position was unknown. Inhibitor experiments in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays suggest that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalyses the hydroxylation reaction at C-7. Cloning and reverse genetics analysis have identified the Bx6 gene that encodes this enzyme. Bx6 is located in the Bx-gene cluster of maize.	1
Title: NrsZ: a novel, processed, nitrogen-dependent, small non-coding RNA that regulates Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 virulence Abstract: The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has a remarkable capacity to adapt to various environments and to survive with limited nutrients. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a novel small non-coding RNA: NrsZ (nitrogen-regulated sRNA). We show that under nitrogen limitation, NrsZ is induced by the NtrB/C two component system, an important regulator of nitrogen assimilation and P. aeruginosa's swarming motility, in concert with the alternative sigma factor RpoN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NrsZ modulates P. aeruginosa motility by controlling the production of rhamnolipid surfactants, virulence factors notably needed for swarming motility. This regulation takes place through the post-transcriptional control of rhlA, a gene essential for rhamnolipids synthesis. Interestingly, we also observed that NrsZ is processed in three similar short modules, and that the first short module encompassing the first 60 nucleotides is sufficient for NrsZ regulatory functions.	0
Title: Chemoselective Alteration of Fluorophore Scaffolds as a Strategy for the Development of Ratiometric Chemodosimeters Abstract: Ratiometric sensors generally couple binding events or chemical reactions at a distal site to changes in the fluorescence of a core fluorophore scaffold. However, such approaches are often hindered by spectral overlap of the product and reactant species. We provide a strategy to design ratiometric sensors that display dramatic spectral shifts by leveraging the chemoselective reactivity of novel functional groups inserted within fluorophore scaffolds. As a proof-of-principle, fluorophores containing a borinate (RF620 ) or silanediol (SiOH2R) functionality at the bridging position of the xanthene ring system are developed as endogenous H2 O2 sensors. Both these fluorophores display far-red to near-infrared excitation and emission prior to reaction. Upon oxidation by H2 O2 both sensors are chemically converted to tetramethylrhodamine, producing significant (≥66 nm) blue-shifts in excitation and emission maxima. This work provides a new concept for the development of ratiometric probes.	0
Title: Analysis of a polyketide synthesis-encoding gene cluster of Streptomyces curacoi Abstract: A gene cluster homologous to the beta-ketoacyl synthase-encoding gene, actl, was cloned by Southern blot hybridization from Streptomyces curacoi, and a 5469-bp fragment was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed seven open reading frames (ORFs). A striking similarity to the whiE locus (encoding spore pigment synthesis) of Streptomyces coelicolor was found throughout the whole cluster, with conservation of the size and position of the seven ORFs. The structure of these two gene clusters suggests that they have a common origin, although the lower similarity in the noncoding regions suggests that the regulatory regions have diverged through evolution.	1
Title: Formation of plant metabolic gene clusters within dynamic chromosomal regions Abstract: In bacteria, genes with related functions often are grouped together in operons and are cotranscribed as a single polycistronic mRNA. In eukaryotes, functionally related genes generally are scattered across the genome. Notable exceptions include gene clusters for catabolic pathways in yeast, synthesis of secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi, and the major histocompatibility complex in animals. Until quite recently it was thought that gene clusters in plants were restricted to tandem duplicates (for example, arrays of leucine-rich repeat disease-resistance genes). However, operon-like clusters of coregulated nonhomologous genes are an emerging theme in plant biology, where they may be involved in the synthesis of certain defense compounds. These clusters are unlikely to have arisen by horizontal gene transfer, and the mechanisms behind their formation are poorly understood. Previously in thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) we identified an operon-like gene cluster that is required for the synthesis and modification of the triterpene thalianol. Here we characterize a second operon-like triterpene cluster (the marneral cluster) from A. thaliana, compare the features of these two clusters, and investigate the evolutionary events that have led to cluster formation. We conclude that common mechanisms are likely to underlie the assembly and control of operon-like gene clusters in plants.	1
Title: On the regioselectivity of thioether formation by lacticin 481 synthetase Abstract: Lantibiotic synthetases generate intramolecular thioether cross-links within peptides through the Michael-type addition of cysteines onto dehydroamino acids originating from Ser and Thr. Presented here is an assay that readily distinguishes between enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of these cross-links. The results demonstrate unequivocally that lacticin 481 synthetase can generate non-native thioether cross-links.	0
Title: A novel 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one-containing tyrosine aminomutase in enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: The C-1027 enediyne antibiotic contains an unusual 3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety that is thought to be derived from tyrosine by an aminomutase reaction. However, none of the genes identified within the C-1027 gene cluster encode proteins with strong homology to known aminomutases. The sgcC4 gene encodes a protein with strong homology to dehydroalanine-dependent histidine/phenylalanine ammonia lyases. The sgcC4 gene was expressed in E. coli, and overproduced SgcC4 was purified as a His6-tagged fusion protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified SgcC4 establishes that SgcC4 is an aminomutase that catalyzes the conversion of l-tyrosine to (S)-beta-tyrosine and employs 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) at its active site. The latter was supported by borohydride and cyanide inhibition studies and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The S153A mutant exhibited a 340-fold decrease in kcat/KM. SgcC4 represents a novel type of aminomutase, extending the known MIO chemistry from ammonia lyases into aminomutases.	1
Title: Discovery of a pathway for terminal-alkyne amino acid biosynthesis Abstract: Living systems can generate an enormous range of cellular functions, from mechanical infrastructure and signalling networks to enzymatic catalysis and information storage, using a notably limited set of chemical functional groups. This observation is especially notable when compared to the breadth of functional groups used as the basis for similar functions in synthetically derived small molecules and materials. The relatively small cross-section between biological and synthetic reactivity space forms the foundation for the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, in which the absence of a pair of reactive functional groups within the cell allows for a selective in situ reaction1-4. However, biologically 'rare' functional groups, such as the fluoro5, chloro6,7, bromo7,8, phosphonate9, enediyne10,11, cyano12, diazo13, alkene14 and alkyne15-17 groups, continue to be discovered in natural products made by plants, fungi and microorganisms, which offers a potential route to genetically encode the endogenous biosynthesis of bioorthogonal reagents within living organisms. In particular, the terminal alkyne has found broad utility via the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 'click' reaction18. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a unique pathway to produce a terminal alkyne-containing amino acid in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. We found that L-lysine undergoes an unexpected reaction sequence that includes halogenation, oxidative C-C bond cleavage and triple bond formation through a putative allene intermediate. This pathway offers the potential for de novo cellular production of halo-, alkene- and alkyne-labelled proteins and natural products from glucose for a variety of downstream applications.	1
Title: Pneumocandin biosynthesis: involvement of a trans-selective proline hydroxylase Abstract: Echinocandins are cyclic nonribosomal hexapeptides based mostly on nonproteinogenic amino acids and displaying strong antifungal activity. Despite previous studies on their biosynthesis by fungi, the origin of three amino acids, trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline, as well as trans-3-hydroxy-4-methylproline, is still unknown. Here we describe the identification, overexpression, and characterization of GloF, the first eukaryotic α-ketoglutarate/Fe(II) -dependent proline hydroxylase from the pneumocandin biosynthesis cluster of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis ATCC 74030. In in vitro transformations with L-proline, GloF generates trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline simultaneously in a ratio of 8:1; the latter reaction was previously unknown for proline hydroxylase catalysis. trans-4-Methyl-L-proline is converted into the corresponding trans-3-hydroxyproline. All three hydroxyprolines required for the biosynthesis of the echinocandins pneumocandins A0 and B0 in G. lozoyensis are thus provided by GloF. Sequence analyses revealed that GloF is not related to bacterial proline hydroxylases, and none of the putative proteins with high sequence similarity in the databases has been characterized so far.	1
Title: UMI-linked consensus sequencing enables phylogenetic analysis of directed evolution Abstract: The success of protein evolution campaigns is strongly dependent on the sequence context in which mutations are introduced, stemming from pervasive non-additive interactions between a protein's amino acids ('intra-gene epistasis'). Our limited understanding of such epistasis hinders the correct prediction of the functional contributions and adaptive potential of mutations. Here we present a straightforward unique molecular identifier (UMI)-linked consensus sequencing workflow (UMIC-seq) that simplifies mapping of evolutionary trajectories based on full-length sequences. Attaching UMIs to gene variants allows accurate consensus generation for closely related genes with nanopore sequencing. We exemplify the utility of this approach by reconstructing the artificial phylogeny emerging in three rounds of directed evolution of an amine dehydrogenase biocatalyst via ultrahigh throughput droplet screening. Uniquely, we are able to identify lineages and their founding variant, as well as non-additive interactions between mutations within a full gene showing sign epistasis. Access to deep and accurate long reads will facilitate prediction of key beneficial mutations and adaptive potential based on in silico analysis of large sequence datasets.	0
Title: Cylindrical superparticles from semiconductor nanorods Abstract: In this communication, we report a synthesis of anisotropic colloidal superparticles (SPs) from CdSe/CdS semiconductor nanorods. These anisotropic SPs are cylindrical disks or stacked-disk arrays. We attribute the major driving forces controlling the SP shape to interparticle interactions between nanorods and solvophobic interactions between a superparticle and its surrounding solvent. According to their sizes (or volumes), the SPs adopt either single- or multilayered structures. In addition, these SPs exhibit linearly polarized emissions, demonstrating their potential role as useful components in devices such as polarized light-emitting diodes and electrooptical modulators.	0
Title: A call to order at the spirochaetal host-pathogen interface Abstract: As the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi shuttles back and forth between arthropod vector and vertebrate host, it encounters vastly different and hostile environments. Major mechanisms contributing to the success of this pathogen throughout this complex transmission cycle are phase and antigenic variation of abundant and serotype-defining surface lipoproteins. These peripherally membrane-anchored virulence factors mediate niche-specific interactions with vector/host factors and protect the spirochaete from the perils of the mammalian immune response. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Tilly, Bestor and Rosa redefine the roles of two lipoproteins, OspC and VlsE, during mammalian infection. Using a variety of promoter fusions in combination with a sensitive in vivo 'use it or lose it' gene complementation assay, the authors demonstrate that proper sequential expression of OspC followed by VlsE indeed matters. A previously suggested general functional redundancy between these and other lipoproteins is shown to be limited and dependent on an immunodeficient experimental setting that is arguably of diminished ecological relevance. These data reinforce the notion that OspC plays a unique role during initial infection while the antigenically variant VlsE proteins allow for persistence in the mammalian host.	0
Title: The proteomic response to mutants of the Escherichia coli RNA degradosome Abstract: The Escherichia coli RNA degradosome recognizes and degrades RNA through the coordination of four main protein components, the endonuclease RNase E, the exonuclease PNPase, the RhlB helicase and the metabolic enzyme enolase. To help our understanding of the functions of the RNA degradosome, we quantified expression changes of >2300 proteins using mass spectrometry based shotgun proteomics in E. coli strains deficient in rhlB, eno, pnp (which displays temperature sensitive growth), or rne(1-602) which encodes a C-terminal truncation mutant of RNase E and is deficient in degradosome assembly. Global protein expression changes are most similar between the pnp and rhlB mutants, confirming the functional relationship between the genes. We observe down-regulation of protein chaperones including GroEL and DnaK (which associate with the degradosome), a decrease in translation related proteins in Δpnp, ΔrhlB and rne(1-602) cells, and a significant increase in the abundance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Analysis of the observed proteomic changes points to a shared motif, CGCTGG, that may be associated with RNA degradosome targets. Further, our data provide information on the expression modulation of known degradosome-associated proteins, such as DeaD and RNase G, as well as other RNA helicases and RNases - suggesting or confirming functional complementarity in some cases. Taken together, our results emphasize the role of the RNA degradosome in the modulation of the bacterial proteome and provide the first large-scale proteomic description of the response to perturbation of this major pathway of RNA degradation.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts Abstract: Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate-bearing natural product from beetle-associated bacteria (Burkholderia gladioli) that might protect beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable-isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis, we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer into isonitrile precursors.	1
Title: Enrichment of dibenzofuran utilizing bacteria with high co-metabolic potential towards dibenzodioxin and other anellated aromatics Abstract: Dibenzofuran degrading bacteria were enriched from various environmental sources. A mutualistic mixed culture of strain DPO 220 and strain DPO 230 was characterized. Strain DPO 220 alone showed limited growth with dibenzofuran as sole source of carbon and energy (td greater than or equal to 4.5 h). A labile degradation product, C12H10O5, and salicylate were isolated from the culture fluid. Salicylate was found to be a central intermediate of DBF-degradation. Strain DPO 220 co-metabolized a wide range of anellated aromatics as well as heteroaromatics. High rates of co-oxidation of dibenzodioxin demonstrate analogue-enrichment to be a powerful technique for selecting enzymatic activities for otherwise non-degradable substrates.	0
Title: Boronated tartrolon antibiotic produced by symbiotic cellulose-degrading bacteria in shipworm gills Abstract: Shipworms are marine wood-boring bivalve mollusks (family Teredinidae) that harbor a community of closely related Gammaproteobacteria as intracellular endosymbionts in their gills. These symbionts have been proposed to assist the shipworm host in cellulose digestion and have been shown to play a role in nitrogen fixation. The genome of one strain of Teredinibacter turnerae, the first shipworm symbiont to be cultivated, was sequenced, revealing potential as a rich source of polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation and identification of two macrodioloide polyketides belonging to the tartrolon class. Both compounds were found to possess antibacterial properties, and the major compound was found to inhibit other shipworm symbiont strains and various pathogenic bacteria. The gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of these compounds was identified and characterized, and the ketosynthase domains were analyzed phylogenetically. Reverse-transcription PCR in addition to liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry revealed the transcription of these genes and the presence of the compounds in the shipworm, suggesting that the gene cluster is expressed in vivo and that the compounds may fulfill a specific function for the shipworm host. This study reports tartrolon polyketides from a shipworm symbiont and unveils the biosynthetic gene cluster of a member of this class of compounds, which might reveal the mechanism by which these bioactive metabolites are biosynthesized.	1
Title: Apoptogenic metabolites in fractions of the Benthic diatom Cocconeis scutellum parva Abstract: Benthic diatoms of the genus Cocconeis contain a specific apoptogenic activity. It triggers a fast destruction of the androgenic gland in the early post-larval life of the marine shrimp Hippolyte inermis, leading to the generation of small females. Previous in vitro investigations demonstrated that crude extracts of these diatoms specifically activate a dose-dependent apoptotic process in human cancer cells (BT20 breast carcinoma) but not in human normal lymphocytes. Here, a bioassay-guided fractionation has been performed to detect the apoptogenic compound(s). Various HPLC separation systems were needed to isolate the active fractions, since the apoptogenic metabolite is highly active, present in low amounts and is masked by abundant but non-active cellular compounds. The activity is due to at least two compounds characterized by different polarities, a hydrophilic and a lipophilic fraction. We purified the lipophilic fraction, which led to the characterization of an active sub-fraction containing a highly lipophilic compound, whose molecular structure has not yet been identified, but is under investigation. The results point to the possible medical uses of the active compound. Once the molecular structure has been identified, the study and modulation of apoptotic processes in various types of cells will be possible.	0
Title: A complex ergovaline gene cluster in epichloe endophytes of grasses Abstract: Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes of the genera Epichloë and Neotyphodium form symbioses with grasses of the subfamily Pooideae, in which they can synthesize an array of bioprotective alkaloids. Some strains produce the ergopeptine alkaloid ergovaline, which is implicated in livestock toxicoses caused by ingestion of endophyte-infected grasses. Cloning and analysis of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene from Neotyphodium lolii revealed a putative gene cluster for ergovaline biosynthesis containing a single-module NRPS gene, lpsB, and other genes orthologous to genes in the ergopeptine gene cluster of Claviceps purpurea and the clavine cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. Despite conservation of gene sequence, gene order is substantially different between the N. lolii, C. purpurea, and A. fumigatus ergot alkaloid gene clusters. Southern analysis indicated that the N. lolii cluster was linked with previously identified ergovaline biosynthetic genes dmaW and lpsA. The ergovaline genes are closely associated with transposon relics, including retrotransposons and autonomous and nonautonomous DNA transposons. All genes in the cluster were highly expressed in planta, but expression was very low or undetectable in mycelia from axenic culture. This work provides a genetic foundation for elucidating biochemical steps in the ergovaline pathway, the ecological role of individual ergot alkaloid compounds, and the regulation of their synthesis in planta.	1
Title: EcpA, an extracellular protease, is a specific virulence factor required by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola but not by X. oryzae pv. oryzae in rice Abstract: Previously, 12 protease-deficient mutants of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) RS105 strain were recovered from a Tn5-tagged mutant library. In the current study, the Tn5 insertion site in each mutant was mapped. Mutations in genes encoding components of the type II secretion apparatus, cAMP regulatory protein, integral membrane protease subunit, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme and extracellular protease (ecpA(Xoc)) either partially or completely abolished extracellular protease activity (ECPA) and reduced virulence in rice. Transcription of ecpA(Xoc) was induced in planta in all the mutants except RΔecpA. Complementation of RΔecpA with ecpA(Xoc) in trans restored ECPA, virulence and bacterial growth in planta. Purified EcpA(Xoc) induced chlorosis- and necrosis-like symptoms similar to those induced by the pathogen when injected into rice leaves. Heterologous expression of ecpA(Xoc) conferred ECPA upon the vascular bacterium X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and upon non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the C-terminal residues of EcpA in Xoo PXO99(A) and Xoc RS105 are different, and a frame shift in ecpA(Xoo) may explain the absence of EcpA activity in Xoo. Collectively, these results suggest that EcpA(Xoc) is a tissue-specific virulence factor for Xoc but not Xoo, although the two pathovars are closely related bacterial pathogens of rice.	0
Title: Reverberant 3D optical coherence elastography maps the elasticity of individual corneal layers Abstract: The elasticity mapping of individual layers in the cornea using non-destructive elastography techniques advances diagnosis and monitoring of ocular diseases and treatments in ophthalmology. However, transient Lamb waves, currently used in most dynamic optical coherence and ultrasound elastography techniques, diminish the translation of wave speed into shear/Young's modulus. Here, we present reverberant 3D optical coherence elastography (Rev3D-OCE), a novel approach leveraging the physical properties of diffuse fields in detecting elasticity gradients not only in the lateral direction, but also along the depth axis of the cornea. A Monte Carlo analysis, finite element simulations, and experiments in layered phantoms are conducted to validate the technique and to characterize the axial elastography resolution. Experiments in ex vivo porcine cornea at different intraocular pressures reveal that Rev3D-OCE enables the elastic characterization of single layers that matches the anatomical description of corneal layers with unprecedented contrast in the dynamic OCE field.	0
Title: Functional analysis of the gene cluster involved in production of the bacteriocin circularin A by Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752 Abstract: A region of 12 kb flanking the structural gene of the cyclic antibacterial peptide circularin A of Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752 was sequenced, and the putative proteins involved in the production and secretion of circularin A were identified. The genes are tightly organized in overlapping open reading frames. Heterologous expression of circularin A in Enterococcus faecalis was achieved, and five genes were identified as minimally required for bacteriocin production and secretion. Two of the putative proteins, CirB and CirC, are predicted to contain membrane-spanning domains, while CirD contains a highly conserved ATP-binding domain. Together with CirB and CirC, this ATP-binding protein is involved in the production of circularin A. The fifth gene, cirE, confers immunity towards circularin A when expressed in either Lactococcus lactis or E. faecalis and is needed in order to allow the bacteria to produce bacteriocin. Additional resistance against circularin A is conferred by the activity of the putative transporter consisting of CirB and CirD.	1
Title: A symbiosis expressed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase from a mutualistic fungal endophyte of perennial ryegrass confers protection to the symbiotum from insect herbivory Abstract: While much is known about the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by filamentous fungi their biological role is often less clear. The assumption is these pathways have adaptive value to the organism but often the evidence to support this role is lacking. We provide the first genetic evidence that the fungal produced secondary metabolite, peramine, protects a host plant from insect herbivory. Peramine is a potent insect feeding deterrent synthesized by Epichloë/Neotyphodium mutualistic endophytes in association with their grass hosts. The structure of peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine, suggests that it is the product of a reaction catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Candidate sequences for a peramine synthetase were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Four unique NRPS products were identified, two of which were preferentially expressed in planta. One of these hybridized to known peramine producing strains. This clone was used to isolate an Epichloë festucae cosmid that contained a two-module NRPS, designated perA. Nine additional genes, which show striking conservation of microsynteny with Fusarium graminearum and other fungal genomes, were identified on the perA-containing cosmid. Associations between perennial ryegrass and an E. festucae mutant deleted for perA lack detectable levels of peramine. A wild-type copy of perA complemented the deletion mutant, confirming that perA is a NRPS required for peramine biosynthesis. In a choice bioassay, plant material containing the perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.	1
Title: Characterization of Three Tailoring Enzymes in Dutomycin Biosynthesis and Generation of a Potent Antibacterial Analogue Abstract: The anthracycline natural product dutomycin and its precursor POK-MD1 were isolated from Streptomyces minoensis NRRL B-5482. The dutomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by genome sequencing and disruption of the ketosynthase gene. Two polyketide synthase (PKS) systems are present in the gene cluster, including a type II PKS and a rare highly reducing iterative type I PKS. The type I PKS DutG repeatedly uses its active sites to create a nine-carbon triketide chain that is subsequently transferred to the α-l-axenose moiety of POK-MD1 at 4″-OH to yield dutomycin. Using a heterologous recombination approach, we disrupted a putative methyltransferase gene (dutMT1) and two glycosyltransferase genes (dutGT1 and dutGT2). Analysis of the metabolites of these mutants revealed the functions of these genes and yielded three dutomycin analogues SW140, SW91, and SW75. The major product SW91 in Streptomyces minoensis NRRL B-5482-ΔDutMT1 was identified as 12-desmethyl-dutomycin, suggesting that DutMT1 is the dedicated 12-methyltransferase. This was confirmed by the in vitro enzymatic assay. DutGT1 and DutGT2 were found to be responsible for the introduction of β-d-amicetose and α-l-axenose, respectively. Dutomycin and SW91 showed strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, whereas POK-MD1 and SW75 had no obvious inhibition, which revealed the essential role of the C-4″ triketide chain in antibacterial activity. The minimal inhibitory concentration of SW91 against the two strains was 0.125 μg mL(-1), lower than that of dutomycin (0.25 μg mL(-1)), indicating that the antibacterial activity of dutomycin can be improved through biosynthetic structural modification.	1
Title: Biosynthetic studies of aziridine formation in azicemicins Abstract: The azicemicins, which are angucycline-type antibiotics produced by the actinomycete, Kibdelosporangium sp. MJ126-NF4, contain an aziridine ring attached to the polyketide core. Feeding experiments using [1-(13)C]acetate or [1,2-(13)C(2)]acetate indicated that the angucycline skeleton is biosynthesized by a type II polyketide synthase. Isotope-tracer experiments using deuterium-labeled amino acids revealed that aspartic acid is the precursor of the aziridine moiety. Subsequent cloning and sequencing efforts led to the identification of the azicemicin (azic) gene cluster spanning approximately 50 kbp. The cluster harbors genes typical for type II polyketide synthesis. Also contained in the cluster are genes for two adenylyl transferases, a decarboxylase, an additional acyl carrier protein (ACP), and several oxygenases. On the basis of the assigned functions of these genes, a possible pathway for aziridine ring formation in the azecimicins can now be proposed. To obtain support for the proposed biosynthetic pathway, two genes encoding adenylyltransferases were overexpressed and the resulting proteins were purified. Enzyme assays showed that one of the adenylyltransferases specifically recognizes aspartic acid, providing strong evidence, in addition to the feeding experiments, that aspartate is the precursor of the aziridine moiety. The results reported herein set the stage for future biochemical studies of aziridine biosynthesis and assembly.	1
Title: A multifunctional enzyme is involved in bacterial ether lipid biosynthesis Abstract: Fatty acid-derived ether lipids are present not only in most vertebrates but also in some bacteria. Here we describe what is to our knowledge the first gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of such lipids in myxobacteria that encodes the multifunctional enzyme ElbD, which shows similarity to polyketide synthases. Initial characterization of elbD mutants in Myxococcus xanthus and Stigmatella aurantiaca showed the importance of these ether lipids for fruiting body formation and sporulation.	1
Title: Engineering of Streptomyces platensis MA7339 for overproduction of platencin and congeners Abstract: Platensimycin (1) and platencin (2) are novel antibiotic leads against multidrug resistant pathogens. The production of 2 in Streptomyces platensis MA7339 is under the control of ptnR1, a GntR-like transcriptional regulator. Inactivating ptnR1 afforded S. platensis MA7339 mutant strain SB12600 that overproduces 2 at a titer approximately 100-fold greater than that from the wild-type strain and accumulates platencin A(1) (3) and eight new congeners, platencins A(2)-A(9) (4-11). The isolation, structural elucidation, and antibacterial activity of 4-11, in comparison to 1-3, are described.	1
Title: Is the Illegal Trade of Glass Eels ( Anguilla anguilla) Increasing the Spread of Disease? A Case of EVEX Abstract: The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a catadromous species that inhabits the rivers of the Adriatic watershed in Croatia. It is a critically endangered fish species, according to the IUCN, due to its declining abundance in European rivers caused by overfishing and trafficking and by diseases caused by nematodes, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. An illegal parcel of glass eels was confiscated at the Zagreb Airport and was intended to re-populate Croatian rivers. Barcoding was employed to determine species affiliation, and a thorough health check was carried out. This study reports the evaluation of gross lesions, histological findings, and EVEX virus isolation and identification. Since the confiscated glass eels were of unknown origin and given the serological and genetic similarities of EVA and EVEX, we designed primers and probes for almost whole genome sequencing to elucidate the origin of glass eels based on viral phylogeny. Bayesian phylogeny showed that the isolated strain had the most common ancestor with a Danish isolate and likely evolved from the French isolate of EVEX. These findings are discussed in light of the divergence of recently isolated strains and their possible contribution to the decrease of the abundance of the European eel in European waters.	0
Title: Olefination via Cu-Mediated Dehydroacylation of Unstrained Ketones Abstract: The dehydroacylation of ketones to olefins is realized under mild conditions, which exhibits a unique reaction pathway involving aromatization-driven C-C cleavage to remove the acyl moiety, followed by Cu-mediated oxidative elimination to form an alkene between the α and β carbons. The newly adopted N'-methylpicolinohydrazonamide (MPHA) reagent is key to enable efficient cleavage of ketone C-C bonds at room temperature. Diverse alkyl- and aryl-substituted olefins, dienes, and special alkenes are generated with broad functional group tolerance. Strategic applications of this method are also demonstrated.	0
Title: Multiple regulatory genes in the salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces albus CCM 4719 Abstract: A DNA fragment containing part of the salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from industrial strain Streptomyces albus CCM 4719 was cloned. Sequence analysis of the 25.809-kbp fragment revealed the presence of 8 open reading frames (ORFs), including two large ORFs encoding three modular sets of oligoketide synthase, followed by three genes (salRI, salRII, salRIII) encoding transcriptional regulators. The first two regulators, SalRI and SalRII, belonged to the novel LAL family of large transcriptional regulators. SalRIII was highly similar to the NysRIV, AmphRIV, and FscRI transcriptional regulators from the oligoene macrolides nystatin, amphotericin, and R008/candicidin clusters, respectively.	1
Title: SPR741, an Antibiotic Adjuvant, Potentiates the In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of Rifampin against Clinically Relevant Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is responsible for 10% of all nosocomial infections and has >50% mortality rates when causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated SPR741, an antibiotic adjuvant that permeabilizes the Gram-negative membrane, in combination with rifampin against AB5075, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii strain. In standard in vitro assays and in a murine pulmonary model, we found that this drug combination can significantly reduce bacterial burden and promote animal survival despite an aggressive infection.	0
Title: A tryptophan 6-halogenase and an amidotransferase are involved in thienodolin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the plant growth-regulating compound thienodolin was identified in and cloned from the producer organism Streptomyces albogriseolus MJ286-76F7. Sequence analysis of a 27 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 21 ORFs, 14 of which are involved in thienodolin biosynthesis. Three insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to analyze their involvement in thienodolin biosynthesis and to functionally characterize specific genes. The gene inactivation experiments together with enzyme assays with enzymes obtained by heterologous expression and feeding studies showed that the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis is catalyzed by a tryptophan 6-halogenase and that the last step is the formation of a carboxylic amide group catalyzed by an amidotransferase. The results led to a hypothetical model for thienodolin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Reconstitution of F factor DNA replication in vitro with purified proteins Abstract: Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin pioneered the development of the F plasmid as a model system to study replication control, and these investigations led to the development of the "replicon model" (Jacob, F., Brenner, S., and Cuzin, F. (1964) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 28, 329-348). To elucidate further the mechanism of initiation of replication of this plasmid and its control, we have reconstituted its replication in vitro with 21 purified host-encoded proteins and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The replication in vitro was specifically initiated at the F ori (oriV) and required both the bacterial initiator protein DnaA and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The wild type dimeric RepE was inactive in catalyzing replication, whereas a monomeric mutant form called RepE(*) (R118P) was capable of catalyzing vigorous replication. The replication topology was mostly of the Cairns form, and the fork movement was unidirectional and mostly from right to left. The replication was dependent on the HU protein, and the structurally and functionally related DNA bending protein IHF could not efficiently substitute for HU. The priming was dependent on DnaG primase. Many of the characteristics of the in vitro replication closely mimicked those of in vivo replication. We believe that the in vitro system should be very useful in unraveling the mechanism of replication initiation and its control.	0
Title: Heterologous expression of a cryptic gene cluster from Grimontia marina affords a novel tricyclic peptide grimoviridin Abstract: Microviridins are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that have been isolated from a wide variety of cyanobacterial strains. There are similar gene clusters of RiPPs distributed in the genomes of bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A cryptic gene cluster for the production of microviridin-type peptide was found in the genome of the marine γ-Proteobacterium Grimontia marina. Heterologous production of new microviridin-type peptide named grimoviridin was accomplished in Escherichia coli using the biosynthetic gene cluster of G. marina. The structure of grimoviridin was determined by analysis of MS and NMR data. Grimoviridin contained one isopeptide and two ester bonds, which had exactly the same bridging pattern as other microviridin-type peptides. The absolute stereochemistries of constituent amino acids were determined to be all L-forms by modified Marfey's method. Grimoviridin showed potent inhibitory activity against trypsin with an IC50 value of 238 nM. This is the first report of heterologous production of microviridin-type peptide using a biosynthetic gene cluster from a Proteobacterium. Key points • Heterologous production afforded new microviridin-type peptide named grimoviridin. • This is the first report of microviridin-type peptide from proteobacterial origin. • Grimoviridin showed potent inhibitory activity against trypsin.	1
Title: Terminal steps in the biosynthesis of herbicidins, nucleoside antibiotics Abstract: The biosynthetic relationship of the herbicidins produced by Streptomyces saganonensis was studied with blocked mutants by means of a bioconversion method using growing and resting cells. It is proposed that the biosynthetic sequence for herbicidins is; herbicidin G----herbicidin F----herbicidin A. Both herbicidins A and F were converted to herbicidin B by non-enzymatic reactions. Herbicidin G was also converted to herbicidin C non-enzymatically.	0
Title: High-efficiency promoter-driven coordinated regulation of multiple metabolic nodes elevates lipid accumulation in the model microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum Abstract: Background:                       Microalgal metabolic engineering holds great promise for the overproduction of a wide range of commercial bioproducts. It demands simultaneous manipulation of multiple metabolic nodes. However, high-efficiency promoters have been lacking.                  Results:                       Here we report a strong constitutive promoter Pt211 in expressing multiple target genes in oleaginous microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Pt211 was revealed to contain significant cis-acting elements. GUS reporter and principal genes glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis were tested under driven of Pt211 in P. tricornutum. GUS staining and qPCR analysis showed strong GUS expression. DGAT2 and GPAT linked with a designed 2A sequence exhibited higher transcript abundances than WT, while algal growth and photosynthesis were not impaired.                  Conclusion:                       The total lipid content increased notably by 2.6-fold compared to WT and reached up to 57.5% (dry cell weight). Overall, our findings report a strong promoter and a strategy for coordinated manipulation of complex metabolic pathways.	0
Title: Optogenetic Amplification Circuits for Light-Induced Metabolic Control Abstract: Dynamic control of microbial metabolism is an effective strategy to improve chemical production in fermentations. While dynamic control is most often implemented using chemical inducers, optogenetics offers an attractive alternative due to the high tunability and reversibility afforded by light. However, a major concern of applying optogenetics in metabolic engineering is the risk of insufficient light penetration at high cell densities, especially in large bioreactors. Here, we present a new series of optogenetic circuits we call OptoAMP, which amplify the transcriptional response to blue light by as much as 23-fold compared to the basal circuit (OptoEXP). These circuits show as much as a 41-fold induction between dark and light conditions, efficient activation at light duty cycles as low as ∼1%, and strong homogeneous light-induction in bioreactors of at least 5 L, with limited illumination at cell densities above 40 OD600. We demonstrate the ability of OptoAMP circuits to control engineered metabolic pathways in novel three-phase fermentations using different light schedules to control enzyme expression and improve production of lactic acid, isobutanol, and naringenin. These circuits expand the applicability of optogenetics to metabolic engineering.	0
Title: Glycan microarray analysis of Candida glabrata adhesin ligand specificity Abstract: The Candida glabrata genome encodes at least 23 members of the EPA (epithelial adhesin) family responsible for mediating adherence to host cells. To better understand the mechanism by which the Epa proteins contribute to pathogenesis, we have used glycan microarray analysis to characterize their carbohydrate-binding specificities. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains surface-expressing the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of the Epa proteins, we found that the three Epa family members functionally identified as adhesins in Candida glabrata (Epa1, Epa6 and Epa7) bind to ligands containing a terminal galactose residue. However, the specificity of the three proteins for glycans within this class varies, with Epa6 having a broader specificity range than Epa1 or Epa7. This result is intriguing given the close homology between Epa6 and Epa7, which are 92% identical at the amino acid level. We have mapped a five-amino-acid region within the N-terminal ligand-binding domain that accounts for the difference in specificity of Epa6 and Epa7 and show that these residues contribute to adherence to both epithelial and endothelial cell lines in vitro.	0
Title: Proteus mirabilis fimbriae (PMF) are important for both bladder and kidney colonization in mice Abstract: Proteus mirabilis expresses different types of fimbriae simultaneously. Several fimbrial types have been described and their role in the colonization of the urinary tract is under study. Previously, P. mirabilis fimbriae (PMF) have been shown to be associated with bacterial colonization of the lower urinary tract but not of the kidneys. In this study, a pmfA mutant was generated and used in several in vivo and in vitro studies. Two different urinary tract infection models in the mouse and two in vitro assays of bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells were performed. Expression of PmfA in a collection of P. mirabilis strains of different sources was also assessed. The results shown here indicate that PMF are involved in both bladder and kidney colonization by P. mirabilis and that these fimbriae are widely distributed among P. mirabilis isolates from different origins since all strains tested expressed PmfA.	0
Title: Complexity generation in fungal polyketide biosynthesis: a spirocycle-forming P450 in the concise pathway to the antifungal drug griseofulvin Abstract: Griseofulvin (1) is a spirocyclic fungal natural product used in treatment of fungal dermatophytes. Formation of the spirocycle, or the grisan scaffold, from a benzophenone precursor is critical for the activity of 1. In this study, we have systematically characterized each of the biosynthetic enzymes related to the biogenesis of 1, including the characterization of a new polyketide synthase GsfA that synthesizes the benzophenone precursor and a cytochrome P450 GsfF that performs oxidative coupling between the orcinol and the phloroglucinol rings to yield the grisan structure. Notably, the finding of GsfF is in sharp contrast to the copper-dependent dihydrogeodin oxidase that performs a similar reaction in the geodin biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic knowledge enabled the in vitro total biosynthesis of 1 from malonyl-CoA using all purified enzyme components. This work therefore completely maps out the previously unresolved enzymology of the biosynthesis of a therapeutically relevant natural product.	1
Title: New atomically precise M1Ag21 (M = Au/Ag) nanoclusters as excellent oxygen reduction reaction catalysts Abstract: By introducing 1,1'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as an activating ligand, two novel nanoclusters, M1Ag21 (M = Au/Ag), have been controllably synthesized and structurally characterized. The atomically precise structures of the M1Ag21 nanoclusters were determined by SCXC and further confirmed by ESI-TOF-MS, TGA, XPS, DPV, and FT-IR measurements. The M1Ag21 nanoclusters supported on activated carbon (C) are exploited as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in alkaline solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the catalytic activities of the two cluster-based systems originate from the significant ensemble synergy effect between the M13 kernel and dppf ligand in M1Ag21. This work sheds lights on the preparation of cluster-based electrocatalysts and other catalysts that are activated and modified by peripheral ligands.	0
Title: Heterologous expression, purification, reconstitution and kinetic analysis of an extended type II polyketide synthase Abstract: Background:                       Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are bacterial multienzyme systems that synthesize a broad range of natural products. The 'minimal' PKS consists of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein and a malonyl transferase. Auxiliary components (ketoreductases, aromatases and cyclases are involved in controlling the oxidation level and cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain. We describe the heterologous expression and reconstitution of several auxiliary PKS components including the actinorhodin ketoreductase (act KR), the griseusin aromatase/cyclase (gris ARO/CYC), and the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase (tcm ARO/CYC).                  Results:                       The polyketide products of reconstituted act and tcm PKSs were identical to those identified in previous in vivo studies. Although stable protein-protein interactions were not detected between minimal and auxiliary PKS components, kinetic analysis revealed that the extended PKS comprised of the act minimal PKS, the act KR and the gris ARO/CYC had a higher turnover number than the act minimal PKS plus the act KR or the act minimal PKS alone. Adding the tcm ARO/CYC to the tcm minimal PKS also increased the overall rate.                  Conclusions:                       Until recently the principal strategy for functional analysis of PKS subunits was through heterologous expression of recombinant PKSs in Streptomyces. Our results corroborate the implicit assumption that the product isolated from whole-cell systems is the dominant product of the PKS. They also suggest that an intermediate is channeled between the various subunits, and pave the way for more detailed structural and mechanistic analysis of these multienzyme systems.	0
Title: A single PLP-dependent enzyme PctV catalyzes the transformation of 3-dehydroshikimate into 3-aminobenzoate in the biosynthesis of pactamycin Abstract: Natural amino donation: A PLP-dependent aminotransferase PctV, encoded in the pactamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, was found to catalyze the formation of 3-aminobenzoate from 3-dehydroshikimate with L-glutamate as the amino donor. The PctV reaction comprises a transamination and two dehydration reactions. This is the first report of a simple 3-ABA synthase in nature.	1
Title: A minimalist substrate for enzymatic peptide and protein conjugation Abstract: Recently a number of nonnatural prenyl groups containing alkynes and azides have been developed as handles to perform click chemistry on proteins and peptides ending in the sequence "CAAX", where C is a cysteine that becomes alkylated, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid. When such molecules are modified, a tag containing a prenyl analogue and the "CAAX box" sequence remains. Here we report the synthesis of an alkyne-containing substrate comprised of only nine nonhydrogen atoms. This substrate was synthesized in six steps from 3-methylbut-2-en-1-ol and has been enzymatically incorporated into both proteins and peptides by using protein farnesyltransferase. After prenylation the final three amino acids required for enzymatic recognition can be removed by using carboxypeptidase Y, leaving a single residue (the cysteine from the "CAAX box") and the prenyl analogue as the only modifications. We also demonstrate that this small tag minimizes the impact of the modification on the solubility of the targeted protein. Hence, this new approach should be useful for applications in which the presence of a large tag hinders the modified protein's solubility, reactivity, or utility.	0
Title: Characterization of the complete zwittermicin A biosynthesis gene cluster from Bacillus cereus Abstract: Bacillus cereus UW85 produces the linear aminopolyol antibiotic zwittermicin A (ZmA). This antibiotic has diverse biological activities, such as suppression of disease in plants caused by protists, inhibition of fungal and bacterial growth, and amplification of the insecticidal activity of the toxin protein from Bacillus thuringiensis. ZmA has an unusual chemical structure that includes a d amino acid and ethanolamine and glycolyl moieties, as well as having an unusual terminal amide that is generated from the modification of the nonproteinogenic amino acid beta-ureidoalanine. The diverse biological activities and unusual structure of ZmA have stimulated our efforts to understand how this antibiotic is biosynthesized. Here, we present the identification of the complete ZmA biosynthesis gene cluster from B. cereus UW85. A nearly identical gene cluster is identified on a plasmid from B. cereus AH1134, and we show that this strain is also capable of producing ZmA. Bioinformatics and biochemical analyses of the ZmA biosynthesis enzymes strongly suggest that ZmA is initially biosynthesized as part of a larger metabolite that is processed twice, resulting in the formation of ZmA and two additional metabolites. Additionally, we propose that the biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of the amino sugar kanosamine is contained within the ZmA biosynthesis gene cluster in B. cereus UW85.	1
Title: Metabolic coupling of dehydration and decarboxylation in the curacin A pathway: functional identification of a mechanistically diverse enzyme pair Abstract: This study describes the functional identification of a pair of mechanistically diverse enzymes that catalyze the successive dehydration (CurE ECH1) and decarboxylation (CurF ECH2) of (S)-HMG-ACP to generate a 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP intermediate, the presumed precursor of the cyclopropyl ring in curacin A. The reactions catalyzed by ECH1 and ECH2 are found in a broad cross-section of microbial natural product gene clusters and participate in the introduction of carbon chain branch points and functional group diversity as key steps in the HMG-CoA synthase mediated addition of C-2 from acetate to the beta-carbonyl group of polyketide chains.	1
Title: The total synthesis of immunostimulant α-galactosylceramides from naturally configured α-galactoside raffinose Abstract: The total synthesis of absolute anomeric confirmation α-galactosylceramide analogues from raffinose is described. Using the naturally occurring α-galactoside raffinose as the starting material, the easily maneuverable protocol without glycosylation reactions ensured the critical α-linkage in the product and simplified the synthetic procedures. The immunostimulatory activities of the new α-galactosylceramides were validated by both in vitro and in vivo NKT cell stimulation assays.	0
Title: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPR184w gene encodes the glycogen debranching enzyme Abstract: The YPR184w gene encodes a 1536-amino acid protein that is 34-39% identical to the mammal, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans glycogen debranching enzyme. The N-terminal part of the protein possesses the four conserved sequences of the alpha-amylase superfamily, while the C-terminal part displays 50% similarity with the C-terminal of other eukaryotic glycogen debranching enzymes. Reliable measurement of alpha-1,4-glucanotransferase and alpha-1, 6-glucosidase activity of the yeast debranching enzyme was determined in strains overexpressing YPR184w. The alpha-1, 4-glucanotransferase activity of a partially purified preparation of debranching enzyme preferentially transferred maltosyl units than maltotriosyl. Deletion of YPR184w prevents glycogen degradation, whereas overexpression had no effect on the rate of glycogen breakdown. In response to stress and growth conditions, the transcriptional control of YPR184w gene, renamed GDB1 (for Glycogen DeBranching gene), is strictly identical to that of other genes involved in glycogen metabolism.	0
Title: Dihydroaeruginoic acid synthetase and pyochelin synthetase, products of the pchEF genes, are induced by extracellular pyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The siderophore pyochelin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is derived from one molecule of salicylate and two molecules of cysteine. Two cotranscribed genes, pchEF, encoding peptide synthetases have been identified and characterized. pchE was required for the conversion of salicylate to dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), the condensation product of salicylate and one cysteine residue and pchF was essential for the synthesis of pyochelin from Dha. The deduced PchE (156 kDa) and PchF (197 kDa) proteins had adenylation, thiolation and condensation/cyclization motifs arranged as modules which are typical of those peptide synthetases forming thiazoline rings. The pchEF genes were coregulated with the pchDCBA operon, which provides enzymes for the synthesis (PchBA) and activation (PchD) of salicylate as well as a putative thioesterase (PchC). Expression of a translational pchE'-'lacZ fusion was strictly dependent on the PchR regulator and was induced by extracellular pyochelin, the end product of the pathway. Iron replete conditions led to Fur (ferric uptake regulator)-dependent repression of the pchE'-'lacZ fusion. A translational pchD'-'lacZ fusion was also positively regulated by PchR and pyochelin and repressed by Fur and iron. Thus, autoinduction by pyochelin (or ferric pyochelin) and repression by iron ensure a sensitive control of the pyochelin pathway in P. aeruginosa.	1
Title: Cryptic Sulfur Incorporation in Thioangucycline Biosynthesis Abstract: Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur-containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether-bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non-enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Multivalent Antibody-Recruiting Macromolecules: Linking Increased Binding Affinity with Enhanced Innate Immune Killing Abstract: Antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs) are a novel class of immunotherapeutics. They are capable of introducing antibodies onto disease-relevant targets such as cancer cells, bacterial cells or viruses. This can induce antibody-mediated immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which can kill the pathogen. In contrast to the classic ARMs, multivalent ARMs could offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of antibody recruitment and subsequent innate immune killing. Such compounds consist of multiple target-binding termini (TBT) and/or antibody-binding termini (ABT). Those multivalent interactions are able to convert low binding affinities into increased binding avidities. This minireview summarizes the current status of multivalent ARMs and gives insight into possible benefits, hurdles still to be overcome and future perspectives.	0
Title: Microscale sulfur cycling in the phototrophic pink berry consortia of the Sippewissett Salt Marsh Abstract: Microbial metabolism is the engine that drives global biogeochemical cycles, yet many key transformations are carried out by microbial consortia over short spatiotemporal scales that elude detection by traditional analytical approaches. We investigate syntrophic sulfur cycling in the 'pink berry' consortia of the Sippewissett Salt Marsh through an integrative study at the microbial scale. The pink berries are macroscopic, photosynthetic microbial aggregates composed primarily of two closely associated species: sulfide-oxidizing purple sulfur bacteria (PB-PSB1) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (PB-SRB1). Using metagenomic sequencing and (34) S-enriched sulfate stable isotope probing coupled with nanoSIMS, we demonstrate interspecies transfer of reduced sulfur metabolites from PB-SRB1 to PB-PSB1. The pink berries catalyse net sulfide oxidation and maintain internal sulfide concentrations of 0-500 μm. Sulfide within the berries, captured on silver wires and analysed using secondary ion mass spectrometer, increased in abundance towards the berry interior, while δ(34) S-sulfide decreased from 6‰ to -31‰ from the exterior to interior of the berry. These values correspond to sulfate-sulfide isotopic fractionations (15-53‰) consistent with either sulfate reduction or a mixture of reductive and oxidative metabolisms. Together this combined metagenomic and high-resolution isotopic analysis demonstrates active sulfur cycling at the microscale within well-structured macroscopic consortia consisting of sulfide-oxidizing anoxygenic phototrophs and sulfate-reducing bacteria.	0
Title: Engineered biosynthesis of hybrid macrolide polyketides containing D-angolosamine and D-mycaminose moieties Abstract: The glycosylation of natural product scaffolds with highly modified deoxysugars is often essential for their biological activity, being responsible for specific contacts to molecular targets and significantly affecting their pharmacokinetic properties. In order to provide tools for the targeted alteration of natural product glycosylation patterns, significant strides have been made to understand the biosynthesis of activated deoxysugars and their transfer. We report here efforts towards the production of plasmid-borne biosynthetic gene cassettes capable of producing TDP-activated forms of D-mycaminose, D-angolosamine and D-desosamine. We additionally describe the transfer of these deoxysugars to macrolide aglycones using the glycosyl transferases EryCIII, TylMII and AngMII, which display usefully broad substrate tolerance.	1
Title: Gene expression analysis reveals matrilysin as a key regulator of pulmonary fibrosis in mice and humans Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and largely untreatable group of disorders that affects up to 100,000 people on any given day in the United States. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to end-stage human pulmonary fibrosis we analyzed samples from patients with histologically proven pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia) by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression patterns clearly distinguished normal from fibrotic lungs. Many of the genes that were significantly increased in fibrotic lungs encoded proteins associated with extracellular matrix formation and degradation and proteins expressed in smooth muscle. Using a combined set of scoring systems we determined that matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase 7), a metalloprotease not previously associated with pulmonary fibrosis, was the most informative increased gene in our data set. Immunohistochemisry demonstrated increased expression of matrilysin protein in fibrotic lungs. Furthermore, matrilysin knockout mice were dramatically protected from pulmonary fibrosis in response to intratracheal bleomycin. Our results identify matrilysin as a mediator of pulmonary fibrosis and a potential therapeutic target. They also illustrate the power of global gene expression analysis of human tissue samples to identify molecular pathways involved in clinical disease.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster enable yield improvement by overexpressing a transcriptional activator Abstract: Spiruchostatins A and B are members of the FK228-family of natural products with potent histone deacetylase inhibitory activities and antineoplastic activities. However, their production in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 is low. To improve the yield, the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster (spi) was first identified by rapid genome sequencing and characterized by genetic mutations. This spi gene cluster encodes a hybrid biosynthetic pathway similar to that encoded by the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster (dep) in Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968. Each gene cluster contains a pathway regulatory gene (spiR vs. depR), but these two genes encode transcriptional activators of different classes. Overexpression of native spiR or heterologous depR in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 resulted in 268 or 1,285 % increase of the combined titer of spiruchostatins A and B, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicates that overexpression of heterologous depR upregulates the expression of native spiR.	1
Title: Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family Abstract: The Mas-related genes (Mrgs) comprise a family of >50 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), many of which are expressed in specific subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons in mice. In contrast, humans contain a related but nonorthologous family of genes, called MrgXs or sensory neuron-specific receptors, of which many fewer appear to be expressed in sensory neurons. To determine whether the diversity of murine Mrgs is generic to rodents or is an atypical feature of mice, we characterized MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD subfamilies in rat and gerbil. Surprisingly, although mice have approximately 22 MrgA and approximately 14 MrgC genes, rats and gerbils have just a single MrgA and MrgC gene. This murine-specific expansion likely reflects recent retrotransposon-mediated unequal crossover events. The expression of Mrgs in rat sensory ganglia suggests that the extensive cellular diversity in mice can be simplified to a core subset of approximately four different genes (MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD), defining a similar number of neuronal subpopulations. Our results suggest more generally that mouse-human genomic comparisons may sometimes reveal differences atypical of rodents.	0
Title: Chemical Proteomics for Expanding the Druggability of Human Disease Abstract: Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small-molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.	0
Title: Cell-permeant and photocleavable chemical inducer of dimerization Abstract: Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) have been developed to orchestrate protein dimerization and translocation. Here we present a novel photocleavable HaloTag- and SNAP-tag-reactive CID (MeNV-HaXS) with excellent selectivity and intracellular reactivity. Excitation at 360 nm cleaves the methyl-6-nitroveratryl core of MeNV-HaXS. MeNV-HaXS covalently links HaloTag- and SNAP-tag fusion proteins, and enables targeting of selected membranes and intracellular organelles. MeNV-HaXS-mediated translocation has been validated for plasma membrane, late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi, mitochondria, and the actin cytoskeleton. Photocleavage of MeNV-HaXS liberates target proteins and provides access to optical manipulation of protein relocation with high spatiotemporal and subcellular precision. MeNV-HaXS supports kinetic studies of protein dynamics and the manipulation of subcellular enzyme activities, which is exemplified for Golgi-targeted cargo and the assessment of nuclear import kinetics.	0
Title: Phylogenetic constraints on elemental stoichiometry and resource allocation in heterotrophic marine bacteria Abstract: The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of evolutionary history to variation in the biomass stoichiometry and underlying biochemical allocation patterns of heterotrophic marine bacteria. We hypothesized that phylogeny significantly constrains biochemical allocation strategy and elemental composition among taxa of heterotrophic marine bacteria. Using a 'common-garden' experimental design, we detected significant interspecific variation in stoichiometry, macromolecule allocation and growth rate among 13 strains of marine Proteobacteria. However, this variation was not well explained by 16S rRNA phylogenetic relationships or differences in growth rate. Heterotrophic bacteria likely experience C-limitation when consuming resources in Redfield proportions, which consequently decouples growth rate from allocation to rRNA and biomass P content. Accordingly, overall bacterial C : nutrient ratios (C : P = 77, C : N = 4.9) were lower than Redfield proportions, whereas the average N : P ratio of 17 was consistent with the Redfield ratio. Our results suggest that strain-level diversity is an important driver of variation in the C : N : P ratios of heterotrophic bacterial biomass and that the potential importance of non-nucleic acid pools of P warrants further investigation. Continued work clarifying the range and controls on the stoichiometry of heterotrophic marine bacteria will help improve understanding and predictions of global ocean C, N and P dynamics.	0
Title: Comparative genomics of citric-acid-producing Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 versus enzyme-producing CBS 513.88 Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger exhibits great diversity in its phenotype. It is found globally, both as marine and terrestrial strains, produces both organic acids and hydrolytic enzymes in high amounts, and some isolates exhibit pathogenicity. Although the genome of an industrial enzyme-producing A. niger strain (CBS 513.88) has already been sequenced, the versatility and diversity of this species compel additional exploration. We therefore undertook whole-genome sequencing of the acidogenic A. niger wild-type strain (ATCC 1015) and produced a genome sequence of very high quality. Only 15 gaps are present in the sequence, and half the telomeric regions have been elucidated. Moreover, sequence information from ATCC 1015 was used to improve the genome sequence of CBS 513.88. Chromosome-level comparisons uncovered several genome rearrangements, deletions, a clear case of strain-specific horizontal gene transfer, and identification of 0.8 Mb of novel sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms per kilobase (SNPs/kb) between the two strains were found to be exceptionally high (average: 7.8, maximum: 160 SNPs/kb). High variation within the species was confirmed with exo-metabolite profiling and phylogenetics. Detailed lists of alleles were generated, and genotypic differences were observed to accumulate in metabolic pathways essential to acid production and protein synthesis. A transcriptome analysis supported up-regulation of genes associated with biosynthesis of amino acids that are abundant in glucoamylase A, tRNA-synthases, and protein transporters in the protein producing CBS 513.88 strain. Our results and data sets from this integrative systems biology analysis resulted in a snapshot of fungal evolution and will support further optimization of cell factories based on filamentous fungi.	1
Title: A single module type I polyketide synthase directs de novo macrolactone biogenesis during galbonolide biosynthesis in Streptomyces galbus Abstract: Galbonolide (GAL) A and B are antifungal macrolactone polyketides produced by Streptomyces galbus. During their polyketide chain assembly, GAL-A and -B incorporate methoxymalonate and methylmalonate, respectively, in the fourth chain extension step. The methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus (galG to K) is specifically involved in GAL-A biosynthesis, and this locus is neighbored by a gene cluster composed of galA-E. GalA-C constitute a single module, highly reducing type I polyketide synthase (PKS). GalD and GalE are cytochrome P450 and Rieske domain protein, respectively. Gene knock-out experiments verified that galB, -C, and -D are essential for GAL biosynthesis. A galD mutant accumulated a GAL-C that lacked two hydroxyl groups and a double bond when compared with GAL-B. A [U-(13)C]propionate feeding experiment indicated that no rare precursor other than methoxymalonate was incorporated during GAL biogenesis. A search of the S. galbus genome for a modular type I PKS system, the type that was expected to direct GAL biosynthesis, resulted in the identification of only one modular type I PKS gene cluster. Homology analysis indicated that this PKS gene cluster is the locus for vicenistatin biosynthesis. This cluster was previously reported in Streptomyces halstedii. A gene deletion of the vinP2 ortholog clearly demonstrated that this modular type I PKS system is not involved in GAL biosynthesis. Therefore, we propose that GalA-C direct macrolactone polyketide formation for GAL. Our studies provide a glimpse into a novel biochemical strategy used for polyketide synthesis; that is, the iterative assembly of propionates with highly programmed β-keto group modifications.	1
Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of an allosteric inhibitor of HSET that targets cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes Abstract: Centrosomes associate with spindle poles; thus, the presence of two centrosomes promotes bipolar spindle assembly in normal cells. Cancer cells often contain supernumerary centrosomes, and to avoid multipolar mitosis and cell death, these are clustered into two poles by the microtubule motor protein HSET. We report the discovery of an allosteric inhibitor of HSET, CW069, which we designed using a methodology on an interface of chemistry and biology. Using this approach, we explored millions of compounds in silico and utilized convergent syntheses. Only compound CW069 showed marked activity against HSET in vitro. The inhibitor induced multipolar mitoses only in cells containing supernumerary centrosomes. CW069 therefore constitutes a valuable tool for probing HSET function and, by reducing the growth of cells containing supernumerary centrosomes, paves the way for new cancer therapeutics.	0
Title: Identification of the oriC region and its influence on heterocyst development in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 Abstract: Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 (Anabaena PCC 7120) is a filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium. Upon deprivation of combined nitrogen, about 5-10 % of the cells become heterocysts, i.e. cells devoted to N(2) fixation. Heterocysts are intercalated among vegetative cells and distributed in a semi-regular pattern, and adjacent heterocysts are rarely observed. Previously, we showed that the cell cycle could play a regulatory function during heterocyst development, although the mechanism involved remains unknown. As a further step to understand this phenomenon, we identified the oriC region for chromosomal DNA replication, located between dnaA and dnaN. The oriC region of Anabaena PCC 7120 was able to support the self-replication of a plasmid in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Surprisingly, integration of the oriC region into the chromosome of Anabaena PCC 7120 through homologous recombination led to much slower cell growth in the absence of a combined-nitrogen source and to multiple contiguous proheterocysts after prolonged incubation. Real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of two heterocyst-related genes, hetR and hetN, was altered in these strains: hetR expression remained high 48 h after induction, and hetN increased to high levels after induction for 12 h. These results suggest that the balance between oriC and DnaA could be important for heterocyst development.	0
Title: Initiation of actinorhodin export in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Many microorganisms produce molecules having antibiotic activity and expel them into the environment, presumably enhancing their ability to compete with their neighbours. Given that these molecules are often toxic to the producer, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the assembly of the export apparatus accompanies or precedes biosynthesis. Streptomyces coelicolor produces the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin in a multistep pathway involving enzymes encoded by genes that are clustered together. Embedded within the cluster are genes for actinorhodin export, two of which, actR and actA resemble the classic tetR and tetA repressor/efflux pump-encoding gene pairs that confer resistance to tetracycline. Like TetR, which represses tetA, ActR is a repressor of actA. We have identified several molecules that can relieve repression by ActR. Importantly (S)-DNPA (an intermediate in the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway) and kalafungin (a molecule related to the intermediate dihydrokalafungin), are especially potent ActR ligands. This suggests that along with the mature antibiotic(s), intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway might activate expression of the export genes thereby coupling export to biosynthesis. We suggest that this could be a common feature in the production of many bioactive natural products.	1
Title: Identification of a polymyxin synthetase gene cluster of Paenibacillus polymyxa and heterologous expression of the gene in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Polymyxin, a long-known peptide antibiotic, has recently been reintroduced in clinical practice because it is sometimes the only available antibiotic for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Lack of information on the biosynthetic genes of polymyxin, however, has limited the study of structure-function relationships and the development of improved polymyxins. During whole genome sequencing of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681, a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium, we identified a gene cluster encoding polymyxin synthetase. Here, we report the complete sequence of the gene cluster and its function in polymyxin biosynthesis. The gene cluster spanning the 40.6-kb region consists of five open reading frames, designated pmxA, pmxB, pmxC, pmxD, and pmxE. The pmxC and pmxD genes are similar to genes that encode transport proteins, while pmxA, pmxB, and pmxE encode polymyxin synthetases. The insertional disruption of pmxE led to a loss of the ability to produce polymyxin. Introduction of the pmx gene cluster into the amyE locus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome resulted in the production of polymyxin in the presence of extracellularly added L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the pmx gene cluster is responsible for polymyxin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Highly selective fluorescence off-on probes for biothiols and imaging in live cells Abstract: Three sulfonyl benzothiazole-based fluorescent probes (, , and ) for the detection of biothiols (cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione) are developed based on thiol-mediated nucleophilic aromatic substitutions. The probes exhibited good selectivity and sensitivity toward biothiols over other analytes. The probes were successfully applied for visualizing endogenous thiols in living cells.	0
Title: Genetic analysis of xenocoumacin antibiotic production in the mutualistic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila Abstract: Xenocoumacin 1 (Xcn1) and xenocoumacin 2 (Xcn2) are the major antimicrobial compounds produced by Xenorhabdus nematophila. To study the role of Xcn1 and Xcn2 in the life cycle of X. nematophila the 14 gene cluster (xcnA-N) required for their synthesis was identified. Overlap RT-PCR analysis identified six major xcn transcripts. Individual inactivation of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes, xcnA and xcnK, and polyketide synthetase genes, xcnF, xcnH and xcnL, eliminated Xcn1 production. Xcn1 levels and expression of xcnA-L were increased in an ompR strain while Xcn2 levels and xcnMN expression were reduced. Xcn1 production was also increased in a strain lacking acetyl-phosphate that can donate phosphate groups to OmpR. Together these findings suggest that OmpR-phosphate negatively regulates xcnA-L gene expression while positively regulating xcnMN expression. HPLC-MS analysis revealed that Xcn1 was produced first and was subsequently converted to Xcn2. Inactivation of xcnM and xcnN eliminated conversion of Xcn1 to Xcn2 resulting in elevated Xcn1 production. The viability of the xcnM strain was reduced 20-fold relative to the wild-type strain supporting the idea that conversion of Xcn1 to Xcn2 provides a mechanism to avoid self-toxicity. Interestingly, inactivation of ompR enhanced cell viability during prolonged culturing.	1
Title: Purification and structure of mutacin B-Ny266: a new lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Mutacins are bactericidal substances of proteinaceous nature produced by Streptococcus mutans. Lantibiotics are antibacterial substances containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as lanthionine. Mutacin B-Ny266 was purified from the cell pellet of S. mutans strain Ny266 by ethanol extraction at pH 2.0 followed by reversed-phase chromatography (Sep-Pak cartridge) and by HPLC on a C18 column. The mean purification factor was 3240 +/- 81 and the mean yield was 1.0 +/- 0.1%. Molecular mass of mutacin B-Ny266 as determined by mass spectroscopy is 2270.29 +/- 0.21 Da. The amino acid sequence of the purified active fraction was obtained by Edman degradation after treatment with alkaline ethanethiol. Twenty-one amino acids were detected in this analysis. Mutacin B-Ny266 belongs to the type A lantibiotics. The proposed sequence is: F-K-A-W-U-F-A-Abu-P-G-A-A-K-O-G-A-F-N-U-Y-A. The molecule differs from that of epidermin/staphylococcin 1580 and gallidermin at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.	1
Title: Identification of the genes involved in the secretion and self-immunity of lacticin Q, an unmodified leaderless bacteriocin from Lactococcus lactis QU 5 Abstract: Lacticin Q (LnqQ) produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 5 is an unmodified linear bacteriocin, which is synthesized without an N-terminal leader peptide. In vitro synthesis and in vivo expression of LnqQ have revealed the intracellular toxicity of this leaderless peptide, as well as the necessity of a dedicated secretion and self-immunity system of producer cells. Further DNA sequencing and analysis have discovered 11 putative orf genes at the LnqQ locus. None of the orf genes showed similarities to any of the bacteriocin biosynthetic genes characterized to date; however, six orf genes (orf2q-7q), not including the structural gene (lnqQ), were highly conserved at the lacticin Z locus (orf2z-7z), which is a LnqQ homologue produced by L. lactis QU 14. ORF2q (ORF2z), the gene of which is located upstream of the structural gene, is a putative transcriptional regulator, whereas ORF6q and ORF7q (ORF6z and ORF7z) form a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter. The ORF3q-5q (ORF3z-5z) are all predicted to be membrane proteins with no clear functions. Co-expression of LnqQ and ORF3q-7q in a heterologous host allowed the extracellular production of LnqQ; additionally, the expression of ORF3q-7q rendered the host cells immune to LnqQ. This self-immunity was facilitated possibly by two means; firstly, by secreting the active LnqQ peptides, thus reducing the intracellular toxicity, and secondly, by protecting the host cells from extracellularly released LnqQ. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that describes intracellular toxicity of a leaderless bacteriocin and provides a rare example of biosynthetic genes that are required for bacteriocin secretion and immunity.	1
Title: Identification of Novel Rotihibin Analogues in Streptomyces scabies, Including Discovery of Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Streptomyces scabies is a phytopathogen associated with common scab disease. This is mainly attributed to its ability to produce the phytotoxin thaxtomin A, the biosynthesis of which is triggered by cellobiose. During a survey of other metabolites released in the presence of cellobiose, we discovered additional compounds in the thaxtomin-containing extract from Streptomyces scabies. Structural analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that these compounds are amino acid sequence variants of the TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase (TORK) pathway-inhibitory lipopeptide rotihibin A, and the main compounds were named rotihibins C and D. In contrast to thaxtomin, the production of rotihibins C and D was also elicited in the presence of glucose, indicating different regulation of their biosynthesis. Through a combination of shotgun and targeted proteomics, the putative rotihibin biosynthetic gene cluster rth was identified in the publicly available genome of S. scabies 87-22. This cluster spans 33 kbp and encodes 2 different nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and 12 additional enzymes. Homologous rth biosynthetic gene clusters were found in other publicly available and complete actinomycete genomes. Rotihibins C and D display herbicidal activity against Lemna minor and Arabidopsis thaliana at low concentrations, shown by monitoring the effects on growth and the maximal photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II. IMPORTANCE Rotihibins A and B are plant growth inhibitors acting on the TORK pathway. We report the isolation and characterization of new sequence analogues of rotihibin from Streptomyces scabies, a major cause of common scab in potato and other tuber and root vegetables. By combining proteomics data with genomic analysis, we found a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster coding for enzyme machinery capable of rotihibin production. This work may lead to the biotechnological production of variants of this lipopeptide to investigate the exact mechanism by which it can target the plant TORK pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, bioinformatics revealed the existence of other variants in plant-associated Streptomyces strains, both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, raising new questions about the actual function of this lipopeptide. The discovery of a module in the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that incorporates the unusual citrulline residue may improve the prediction of peptides encoded by cryptic NRPS gene clusters.	1
Title: Identification of two genes from Streptomyces argillaceus encoding glycosyltransferases involved in transfer of a disaccharide during biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: Mithramycin is an antitumor polyketide drug produced by Streptomyces argillaceus that contains two deoxysugar chains, a disaccharide consisting of two D-olivoses and a trisaccharide consisting of a D-olivose, a D-oliose, and a D-mycarose. From a cosmid clone (cosAR3) which confers resistance to mithramycin in streptomycetes, a 3-kb PstI-XhoI fragment was sequenced, and two divergent genes (mtmGI and mtmGII) were identified. Comparison of the deduced products of both genes with proteins in databases showed similarities with glycosyltransferases and glucuronosyltransferases from different sources, including several glycosyltransferases involved in sugar transfer during antibiotic biosynthesis. Both genes were independently inactivated by gene replacement, and the mutants generated (M3G1 and M3G2) did not produce mithramycin. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants of both mutants showed the presence of several peaks with the characteristic spectra of mithramycin biosynthetic intermediates. Four compounds were isolated from both mutants by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by physicochemical methods. The structures of these compounds were identical in both mutants, and the compounds are suggested to be glycosylated intermediates of mithramycin biosynthesis with different numbers of sugar moieties attached to C-12a-O of a tetracyclic mithramycin precursor and to C-2-O of mithramycinone: three tetracyclic intermediates containing one sugar (premithramycin A1), two sugars (premithramycin A2), or three sugars (premithramycin A3) and one tricyclic intermediate containing a trisaccharide chain (premithramycin A4). It is proposed that the glycosyltransferases encoded by mtmGI and mtmGII are responsible for forming and transferring the disaccharide during mithramycin biosynthesis. From the structures of the new metabolites, a new biosynthetic sequence regarding late steps of mithramycin biosynthesis can be suggested, a sequence which includes glycosyl transfer steps prior to the final shaping of the aglycone moiety of mithramycin.	1
Title: Variacin, a new lanthionine-containing bacteriocin produced by Micrococcus varians: comparison to lacticin 481 of Lactococcus lactis Abstract: A new lanthionine-containing bacteriocin, variacin, displaying a broad host range of inhibition against gram-positive food spoilage bacteria, has been identified from two strains of Micrococcus varians isolated from meat fermentations. The new bacteriocin was purified, and its amino-terminal end and total amino acid composition were determined. The structural gene was isolated and analyzed. Variacin is resistant to heat and pH conditions from 2 to 10. Its primary sequence shows significant homology to lacticin 481 to Lactococcus lactis, which is more pronounced for the probacteriocin than for the leader sequence. Variacin, like lacticin 481, contains lanthionine and beta-methyllanthionine residues, but its leader sequence clearly resembles nonlantibiotic leader sequences. In particular, the prepeptide contains glycine residues at positions -1 and -2 of the processing site.	1
Title: Chemoproteomic profiling reveals that cathepsin D off-target activity drives ocular toxicity of β-secretase inhibitors Abstract: Inhibition of β-secretase BACE1 is considered one of the most promising approaches for treating Alzheimer's disease. Several structurally distinct BACE1 inhibitors have been withdrawn from development after inducing ocular toxicity in animal models, but the target mediating this toxicity has not been identified. Here we use a clickable photoaffinity probe to identify cathepsin D (CatD) as a principal off-target of BACE1 inhibitors in human cells. We find that several BACE1 inhibitors blocked CatD activity in cells with much greater potency than that displayed in cell-free assays with purified protein. Through a series of exploratory toxicology studies, we show that quantifying CatD target engagement in cells with the probe is predictive of ocular toxicity in vivo. Taken together, our findings designate off-target inhibition of CatD as a principal driver of ocular toxicity for BACE1 inhibitors and more generally underscore the power of chemical proteomics for discerning mechanisms of drug action.	0
Title: Cloning and sequencing of the biosynthetic gene cluster for saquayamycin Z and galtamycin B and the elucidation of the assembly of their saccharide chains Abstract: Sweet ways: We have investigated the glycosyltransferase genes of the saquayamycin Z (shown) and galtamycin B biosynthetic gene cluster from Micromonospora sp. Tü6368. The results unambiguously show that both compounds are derived from the same cluster. Furthermore, the function of five glycosyltransferases was elucidated, and the results have shed light on the assembly of the sugar chains.The Gram-positive bacterium, Micromonospora sp. Tü6368 produces the angucyclic antibiotic saquayamycin Z and the tetracenequinone galtamycin B. The structural similarity of both compounds suggests a common biosynthetic pathway. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster (saq gene cluster) was cloned and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of a 36.7 kb region revealed the presence of 31 genes that are probably involved in saquayamycin Z and galtamycin B formation. Heterologous expression experiments and targeted gene inactivations were carried out to specifically manipulate the saquayamycin Z and galtamycin B pathways; this demonstrated unambiguously that both compounds are derived from the same cluster. The inactivation of glycosyltransferase genes led to the production of novel saquayamycin and galtamycin derivatives, provided information on the assembly of the sugar chains, and showed that tetracenequinones are formed from angucyclines.	1
Title: Coordinated Biosynthesis of the Purine Nucleoside Antibiotics Aristeromycin and Coformycin in Actinomycetes Abstract: Purine nucleoside antibiotic pairs, concomitantly produced by a single strain, are an important group of microbial natural products. Here, we report a target-directed genome mining approach to elucidate the biosynthesis of the purine nucleoside antibiotic pair aristeromycin (ARM) and coformycin (COF) in Micromonospora haikouensis DSM 45626 (a new producer for ARM and COF) and Streptomyces citricolor NBRC 13005 (a new COF producer). We also provide biochemical data that MacI and MacT function as unusual phosphorylases, catalyzing an irreversible reaction for the tailoring assembly of neplanocin A (NEP-A) and ARM. Moreover, we demonstrate that MacQ is shown to be an adenosine-specific deaminase, likely relieving the potential "excess adenosine" for producing cells. Finally, we report that MacR, an annotated IMP dehydrogenase, is actually an NADPH-dependent GMP reductase, which potentially plays a salvage role for the efficient supply of the precursor pool. Hence, these findings illustrate a fine-tuned pathway for the biosynthesis of ARM and also open the way for the rational search for purine antibiotic pairs.IMPORTANCE ARM and COF are well known for their prominent biological activities and unusual chemical structures; however, the logic of their biosynthesis has long been poorly understood. Actually, the new insights into the ARM and COF pathway will not only enrich the biochemical repertoire for interesting enzymatic reactions but may also lay a solid foundation for the combinatorial biosynthesis of this group of antibiotics via a target-directed genome mining strategy.	1
Title: Tri13 and Tri7 determine deoxynivalenol- and nivalenol-producing chemotypes of Gibberella zeae Abstract: Gibberella zeae, a major cause of cereal scab, can be divided into two chemotypes based on production of the 8-ketotrichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). We cloned and sequenced a Tri13 homolog from each chemotype. The Tri13 from a NIV chemotype strain (88-1) is located in the trichothecene gene cluster and carries an open reading frame similar to that of Fusarium sporotrichioides, whereas the Tri13 from a DON chemotype strain (H-11) carries several mutations. To confirm the roles of the Tri13 and Tri7 genes in trichothecene production by G. zeae, we genetically altered toxin production in 88-1 and H-11. In transgenic strains, the targeted deletion of Tri13 from the genome of 88-1 caused production of DON rather than NIV. Heterologous expression of the 88-1 Tri13 gene alone or in combination with the 88-1 Tri7 gene conferred on H-11 the ability to synthesize NIV; in the latter case, 4-acetylnivalenol (4-ANIV) also was produced. These results suggest that Tri13 and Tri7 are required for oxygenation and acetylation of the oxygen at C-4 during synthesis of NIV and 4-ANIV in G. zeae. These functional analyses of the Tri13 and Tri7 genes provide the first clear evidence for the genetic basis of the DON and NIV chemotypes in G. zeae.	1
Title: Metabolic engineering of aminocoumarins: inactivation of the methyltransferase gene cloP and generation of new clorobiocin derivatives in a heterologous host Abstract: Aminocoumarin antibiotics are highly potent inhibitors of bacterial gyrase and represent a class of antibiotics that are very suitable for the generation of new compounds by metabolic engineering. In this study, the putative methyltransferase gene cloP in the biosynthetic gene cluster of clorobiocin was inactivated. Expression of the modified gene cluster in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512 gave three new aminocoumarin antibiotics. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by MS and 1H NMR, and their antibacterial activities were determined. All three compounds lacked clorobiocin's methyl group at 4-OH of the deoxysugar moiety, noviose. They differed from each other in the position of the 5-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl group, which was found to be attached to either 2-OH, 3-OH or 4-OH of noviose. Attachment at 4-OH resulted in the highest antibacterial activity. This is the first time that an aminocoumarin antibiotic acylated at 4-OH in noviose has been detected.	1
Title: LC-MS-based metabolomics Abstract: Metabolomics aims at identification and quantitation of small molecules involved in metabolic reactions. LC-MS has enjoyed a growing popularity as the platform for metabolomic studies due to its high throughput, soft ionization, and good coverage of metabolites. The success of a LC-MS-based metabolomic study often depends on multiple experimental, analytical, and computational steps. This review presents a workflow of a typical LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis for identification and quantitation of metabolites indicative of biological/environmental perturbations. Challenges and current solutions in each step of the workflow are reviewed. The review intends to help investigators understand the challenges in metabolomic studies and to determine appropriate experimental, analytical, and computational methods to address these challenges.	0
Title: Possible transmission of Streptococcus iniae from wild fish to cultured marine fish Abstract: Streptococcus iniae was isolated from diseased wild fish collected near a mariculture facility where gilthead sea bream and European sea bass exhibited a similar infection. Species-specific PCR and ribotyping confirmed that wild and cultured fish were infected by a single S. iniae clone. Wild fish are therefore potential amplifiers of pathogenic S. iniae strains.	0
Title: A Two-Dimensional Zirconium Carbide by Selective Etching of Al3C3 from Nanolaminated Zr3Al3C5 Abstract: The room-temperature synthesis of a new two-dimensional (2D) zirconium-containing carbide, Zr3C2T(z) MXene is presented. In contrast to traditional preparation of MXene, the layered ternary Zr3Al3C5 material instead of MAX phases is used as source under hydrofluoric acid treatment. The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of the synthesized 2D carbide are investigated, combined with first-principles density functional calculations. A comparative study on the structrual stability of our obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) and Ti3C2T(z) MXenes at elevated temperatures is performed. The obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) exhibits relatively better ability to maintain 2D nature and strucural integrity compared to Ti-based Mxene. The difference in structural stability under high temperature condition is explained by a theoretical investigation on binding energy.	0
Title: Six new genes required for production of T-toxin, a polyketide determinant of high virulence of Cochliobolus heterostrophus to maize Abstract: Southern Corn Leaf Blight, one of the worst plant disease epidemics in modern history, was caused by Cochliobolus heterostrophus race T, which produces T-toxin, a determinant of high virulence to maize carrying Texas male sterile cytoplasm. The genetics of T-toxin production is complex and the evolutionary origin of associated genes is uncertain. It is known that ability to produce T-toxin requires three genes encoded at two unlinked loci, Tox1A and Tox1B, which map to the breakpoints of a reciprocal translocation. DNA associated with Tox1A and Tox1B sums to about 1.2 Mb of A+T rich, repeated DNA that is not found in less virulent race O or other Cochliobolus species. Here, we describe identification and targeted deletion of six additional genes, three mapping to Tox1A and three to Tox1B. Mutant screens indicate that all six genes are involved in T-toxin production and high virulence to maize. The nine known Tox1 genes encode two polyketide synthases (PKS), one decarboxylase, five dehydrogenases, and one unknown protein. Only two have a similar phylogenetic profile. To trace evolutionary history of one of the core PKS, DNA from more than 100 Dothideomycete species were screened for homologs. An ortholog (60% identity) was confirmed in Didymella zeae-maydis, which produces PM-toxin, a polyketide of similar structure and biological specificity as T-toxin. Only one additional Dothideomycete species, the dung ascomycete Delitschia winteri harbored a paralog. The unresolved evolutionary history and distinctive gene signature of the PKS (fast-evolving, discontinuous taxonomic distribution) leaves open the question of lateral or vertical transmission.	1
Title: An Unusual Type II Polyketide Synthase System Involved in Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis Abstract: As a unique structural moiety in natural products, cinnamoyl lipids (CLs), are proposed to be assembled by unusual type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Herein, we demonstrate that the assembly of the CL compounds youssoufenes is accomplished by a PKS system that uniquely harbors three phylogenetically different ketosynthase/chain length factor (KS/CLF) complexes (YsfB/C, YsfD/E, and YsfJ/K). Through in vivo gene inactivation and in vitro reconstitution, as well as an intracellular tagged carrier-protein tracking (ITCT) strategy developed in this study, we successfully elucidated the isomerase-dependent ACP-tethered polyunsaturated chain elongation process. The three KS/CLFs were revealed to modularly assemble different parts of the youssoufene skeleton, during which benzene ring closure happens right after the formation of an ACP-tethered C18 polyene. Of note, the ITCT strategy could significantly contribute to the elucidation of other carrier-protein-dependent biosynthetic machineries.	1
Title: Structural organization of microcystin biosynthesis in Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806: an integrated peptide-polyketide synthetase system Abstract: Background:                       Blooms of toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have become increasingly common in the surface waters of the world. Of the known toxins produced by cyanobacteria, the microcystins are the most significant threat to human and animal health. These cyclic peptides are potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein phosphatases type 1 and 2A. Synthesized nonribosomally, the microcystins contain a number of unusual amino acid residues including the beta-amino polyketide moiety Adda (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6, 8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-4,6-decadienoic acid). We have characterized the microcystin biosynthetic gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806.                  Results:                       A cluster spanning 55 kb, composed of 10 bidirectionally transcribed open reading frames arranged in two putative operons (mcyA-C and mcyD-J), has been correlated with microcystin formation by gene disruption and mutant analysis. Of the 48 sequential catalytic reactions involved in microcystin synthesis, 45 have been assigned to catalytic domains within six large multienzyme synthases/synthetases (McyA-E, G), which incorporate the precursors phenylacetate, malonyl-CoA, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, glutamate, serine, alanine, leucine, D-methyl-isoaspartate, and arginine. The additional four monofunctional proteins are putatively involved in O-methylation (McyJ), epimerization (McyF), dehydration (McyI), and localization (McyH). The unusual polyketide amino acid Adda is formed by transamination of a polyketide precursor as enzyme-bound intermediate, and not released during the process.                  Conclusions:                       This report is the first complete description of the biosynthesis pathway of a complex cyanobacterial metabolite. The enzymatic organization of the microcystin assembly represents an integrated polyketide-peptide biosynthetic pathway with a number of unusual structural and enzymatic features. These include the integrated synthesis of a beta-amino-pentaketide precursor and the formation of beta- and gamma-carboxyl-peptide bonds, respectively. Other features of this complex system also observed in diverse related biosynthetic clusters are integrated C- and N-methyltransferases, an integrated aminotransferase, and an associated O-methyltransferase and a racemase acting on acidic amino acids.	1
Title: The puzzle of RNAs that target gene promoters Abstract: Setting the right target: Most researchers who use small RNAs in mammalian cells assume that mRNA will be the target. Recent studies suggest that small RNAs can also target chromosomal DNA. Few discoveries have had the impact of RNAi. Most researchers who use small RNAs to control gene expression in mammalian cells assume that mRNA will be the target. Recent studies, however, have suggested that small RNAs can also target chromosomal DNA.	0
Title: Inactivation of an ABC transporter gene, mcyH, results in loss of microcystin production in the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 Abstract: The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa is widely known for its production of the potent hepatotoxin microcystin. Microcystin is synthesized nonribosomally by the thiotemplate function of a large, modular enzyme complex encoded within the 55-kb microcystin synthetase (mcy) gene cluster. Also encoded within the mcy gene cluster is a putative ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, McyH. This study details the bioinformatic and mutational analyses of McyH and offers functional predictions for the hypothetical protein. The transporter is putatively comprised of two homodimers, each with an N-terminal hydrophobic domain and a C-terminal ATPase. Phylogenetically, McyH was found to cluster with members of the ABC-A1 subgroup of ABC ATPases, suggesting an export function for the protein. Two mcyH null mutant (DeltamcyH) strains were constructed by partial deletion of the mcyH gene. Microcystin production was completely absent in these strains. While the mcyH deletion had no apparent effect on the transcription of other mcy genes, the complete microcystin biosynthesis enzyme complex could not be detected in DeltamcyH mutant strains. Finally, expression levels of McyH in the wild type and in DeltamcyA, DeltamcyB, and DeltamcyH mutants were investigated by using immunoblotting with an anti-McyH antibody. Expression of McyH was found to be reduced in DeltamcyA and DeltamcyB mutants and completely absent in the DeltamcyH mutant. By virtue of its association with the mcy gene cluster and the bioinformatic and experimental data presented in this study, we predict that McyH functions as a microcystin exporter and is, in addition, intimately associated with the microcystin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: Strategies for Site-Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site-specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live-cell labeling of peptide-tagged cell-surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme-mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled-coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide-templated labeling chemistry.	0
Title: [18F]- and [11C]-labeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues as PET tracers for apoptosis: synthesis, radiolabeling mechanism, and in vivo imaging study of apoptosis in Fas-treated mice using [11C]WC-98 Abstract: The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [18F] 2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [18F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [18F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [18F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18F-labeled isatinate 17. [18F] 17 can be converted to isatin [18F] 2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [11C] 4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [11C] 4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radio-synthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [11C] 4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.	0
Title: Insights into xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri biofilm through proteomics Abstract: Background:                       Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. a. pv. citri) causes citrus canker that can result in defoliation and premature fruit drop with significant production losses worldwide. Biofilm formation is an important process in bacterial pathogens and several lines of evidence suggest that in X. a. pv. citri this process is a requirement to achieve maximal virulence since it has a major role in host interactions. In this study, proteomics was used to gain further insights into the functions of biofilms.                  Results:                       In order to identify differentially expressed proteins, a comparative proteomic study using 2D difference gel electrophoresis was carried out on X. a. pv. citri mature biofilm and planktonic cells. The biofilm proteome showed major variations in the composition of outer membrane proteins and receptor or transport proteins. Among them, several porins and TonB-dependent receptor were differentially regulated in the biofilm compared to the planktonic cells, indicating that these proteins may serve in maintaining specific membrane-associated functions including signaling and cellular homeostasis. In biofilms, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase with a major role in exopolysaccharide production and the non-fimbrial adhesin YapH involved in adherence were over-expressed, while a polynucleotide phosphorylase that was demonstrated to negatively control biofilm formation in E. coli was down-regulated. In addition, several proteins involved in protein synthesis, folding and stabilization were up-regulated in biofilms. Interestingly, some proteins related to energy production, such as ATP-synthase were down-regulated in biofilms. Moreover, a number of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were differentially expressed. In addition, X. a. pv. citri biofilms also showed down-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes. The respective gene expression patterns of several identified proteins in both X. a. pv. citri mature biofilm and planktonic cells were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and shown to consistently correlate with those deduced from the proteomic study.                  Conclusions:                       Differentially expressed proteins are enriched in functional categories. Firstly, proteins that are down-regulated in X. a. pv. citri biofilms are enriched for the gene ontology (GO) terms 'generation of precursor metabolites and energy' and secondly, the biofilm proteome mainly changes in 'outer membrane and receptor or transport'. We argue that the differentially expressed proteins have a critical role in maintaining a functional external structure as well as enabling appropriate flow of nutrients and signals specific to the biofilm lifestyle.	0
Title: Mutation of a gene encoding a putative glycoprotease leads to reduced salt tolerance, altered pigmentation, and cyanophycin accumulation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The salt-sensitive mutant 549 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was genetically and physiologically characterized. The mutated site and corresponding wild-type site were cloned and partially sequenced. The genetic analysis revealed that during the mutation about 1.8 kb was deleted from the chromosome of mutant 549. This deletion affected four open reading frames: a gcp gene homolog, the psaFJ genes, and an unknown gene. After construction of mutants with single mutations, only the gcp mutant showed a reduction in salt tolerance comparable to that of the initial mutant, indicating that the deletion of this gene was responsible for the salt sensitivity and that the other genes were of minor importance. Besides the reduced salt tolerance, a remarkable change in pigmentation was observed that became more pronounced in salt-stressed cells. The phycobilipigment content decreased, and that of carotenoids increased. Investigations of changes in the ultrastructure revealed an increase in the amount of characteristic inclusion bodies containing the high-molecular-weight nitrogen storage polymer cyanophycin (polyaspartate and arginine). The salt-induced accumulation of cyanophycin was confirmed by chemical estimations. The putative glycoprotease encoded by the gcp gene might be responsible for the degradation of cyanophycin in Synechocystis. Mutation of this gene leads to nitrogen starvation of the cells, accompanied by characteristic changes in pigmentation, ultrastructure, and salt tolerance level.	0
Title: Mechanistic insights into the LsrK kinase required for autoinducer-2 quorum sensing activation Abstract: In enteric bacteria, the kinase LsrK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the C5-hydroxyl group in the linear form of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor of the type II bacterial quorum sensing molecule (AI-2). This phosphorylation is required for AI-2 sequestration in the cytoplasm and subsequent derepression of AI-2-related genes necessary for quorum development. While LsrK is a critical enzyme within the DPD quorum sensing relay system, kinetic details of this kinase have yet to be reported. A continuous UV-vis spectrophotometric assay was developed that allowed steady-state kinetic analysis of LsrK to be undertaken with the substrates ATP and DPD. The data was most consistent with a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with ATP binding first: kcat (7.4 ± 0.6 s(-1)), Km,ATP (150 ± 30 μM) and Km(app),DPD (1.0 ± 0.2 mM). The assay also allowed a DPD substrate profile to be conducted, which provided an unexpected biochemical disconnect between the previous agonist/antagonist cell-based reporter assay and the LsrK assay presented herein. Together these findings raise the importance of LsrK and lay the foundation not only for further understanding of this enzyme and its critical biological role but also for the rational design of regulatory molecules targeting AI-2 quorum sensing in pathogenic bacteria.	0
Title: An Hsp90 co-chaperone protein in yeast is functionally replaced by site-specific posttranslational modification in humans Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone. To properly chaperone its clientele, Hsp90 proceeds through an ATP-dependent conformational cycle influenced by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and assisted by a number of co-chaperone proteins. Although Hsp90 conformational changes in solution have been well-studied, regulation of these complex dynamics in cells remains unclear. Phosphorylation of human Hsp90α at the highly conserved tyrosine 627 has previously been reported to reduce client interaction and Aha1 binding. Here we report that these effects are due to a long-range conformational impact inhibiting Hsp90α N-domain dimerization and involving a region of the middle domain/carboxy-terminal domain interface previously suggested to be a substrate binding site. Although Y627 is not phosphorylated in yeast, we demonstrate that the non-conserved yeast co-chaperone, Hch1, similarly affects yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) conformation and function, raising the possibility that appearance of this PTM in higher eukaryotes represents an evolutionary substitution for HCH1.	0
Title: Sequence analysis of mutA and mutM genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mutacin II in Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Streptococcus mutans, along with many other gram-positive bacteria produce small antibacterial peptides called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins elaborated by S. mutans, termed mutacins, may provide a selective force necessary for initial or sustained colonization in dental plaque by this major dental pathogen. Previously, we purified and characterized mutacin II, the first lantibiotic found in S. mutans. Specific oligonucleotides designed according to the N-terminal amino acid sequence permitted amplification of 0.7 kb upstream and 2.1 kb downstream of the N-terminus, using single-specific-primer PCR (SSP-PCR). The gene encoding the mutacin II prepeptide, mutA, was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The complete prepeptide consists of 53 amino acids, including the 26 amino acid amphipathic leader peptide with the Gly(-2)-Gly(-1) sequence at the processing site. The prepeptide showed similarity to the lantibiotics lacticin 481, variacin, salivaricin and streptococcin A-FF22. A 3 kb open reading frame immediately downstream of mutA, denoted mutM, showed sequence similarities to LCNDR2 from Lactococcus lactis. By analogy, mutM is probably involved in post-translational modification of the mutacin prepeptide. Gene disruption with an insertional vector pVA891 showed that intact copies of mutA and mutM are required for production of mutacin II.	1
Title: Fueling up skeletal muscle to reduce obesity: A TrkB story Abstract: Targeting TrkB signaling could represent a good therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Chan et al. report the efficacy of 7,8-DHT, a TrkB agonist, in preventing obesity in female mice. The underlying molecular mechanisms behind this activity seem to involve increased energy expenditure in skeletal muscle.	0
Title: Multiplexed screening of cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry Abstract: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are highly promising candidates as drug delivery agents into cells of interest. We describe for the first time the multiplexed analysis of nanoparticle uptake by cells using mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that the cellular uptake of functionalized gold nanoparticles with cationic or neutral surface ligands can be readily determined using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of cell lysates. The surface ligands have "mass barcodes" that allow different nanoparticles to be simultaneously identified and quantified at levels as low as 30 pmol. Using this method, we find that subtle changes to AuNP surface functionalities can lead to measurable changes in cellular uptake propensities.	0
Title: Extension of the Rhizobium meliloti succinoglycan biosynthesis gene cluster: identification of the exsA gene encoding an ABC transporter protein, and the exsB gene which probably codes for a regulator of succinoglycan biosynthesis Abstract: Two new genes, designated exsA and exsB, were identified adjacent to the 24 kb exo gene cluster of Rhizobium meliloti, which is involved in succinoglycan (EPS I) biosynthesis. The derived amino acid sequence of ExsA displayed significant homologies to ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. R. meliloti strains mutated in exsA were characterized by a decreased ratio of HMW to LMW EPS I, indicating a function for ExsA in EPS I biosynthesis. The R. meliloti NdvA protein, which is involved in the transport of cyclic beta-(1,2)-glucans, was identified as the closest homologue of ExsA. R. meliloti exsB mutants produced a three-fold increased amount of EPS I in comparison to the wild-type strain. In contrast, high copy number of exsB resulted in a decrease in the EPS I level to 20% of wild type, indicating that the exsB gene product can negatively influence EPS I biosynthesis. It was demonstrated that this influence is not due to transcriptional regulation of the exo genes by the exsB gene product. By plasmid integration it was shown that exsA and exsB represent monocistronic transcription units.	1
Title: Structure of the nucleotide radical formed during reaction of CDP/TTP with the E441Q-alpha2beta2 of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase Abstract: The Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleotides and requires a diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor for catalysis. RNR is composed of a 1:1 complex of two homodimeric subunits: alpha and beta. Incubation of the E441Q-alpha mutant RNR with substrate CDP and allosteric effector TTP results in loss of the tyrosyl radical and formation of two new radicals on the 200 ms to min time scale. The first radical was previously established by stopped flow UV/vis spectroscopy and pulsed high field EPR spectroscopy to be a disulfide radical anion. The second radical was proposed to be a 4'-radical of a 3'-keto-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate. To identify the structure of the nucleotide radical [1'-(2)H], [2'-(2)H], [4'-(2)H], [5'-(2)H], [U-(13)C, (15)N], [U-(15)N], and [5,6 -(2)H] CDP and [beta-(2)H] cysteine-alpha were synthesized and incubated with E441Q-alpha2beta2 and TTP. The nucleotide radical was examined by 9 GHz and 140 GHz pulsed EPR spectroscopy and 35 GHz ENDOR spectroscopy. Substitution of (2)H at C4' and C1' altered the observed hyperfine interactions of the nucleotide radical and established that the observed structure was not that predicted. DFT calculations (B3LYP/IGLO-III/B3LYP/TZVP) were carried out in an effort to recapitulate the spectroscopic observations and lead to a new structure consistent with all of the experimental data. The results indicate, unexpectedly, that the radical is a semidione nucleotide radical of cytidine 5'-diphosphate. The relationship of this radical to the disulfide radical anion is discussed.	0
Title: Complete biosynthetic pathway of anditomin: nature's sophisticated synthetic route to a complex fungal meroterpenoid Abstract: Anditomin and its precursors, andilesins, are fungal meroterpenoids isolated from Aspergillus variecolor and have unique, highly oxygenated chemical structures with a complex bridged-ring system. Previous isotope-feeding studies revealed their origins as 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid and farnesyl pyrophosphate and suggested the possible involvement of a Diels-Alder reaction to afford the congested bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure of andilesins. Here we report the first identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of anditomin and the determination of the complete biosynthetic pathway by characterizing the functions of 12 dedicated enzymes. The anditomin pathway actually does not employ a Diels-Alder reaction, but involves the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase AndA to synthesize the bridged-ring by an unprecedented skeletal reconstruction. Another dioxygenase, AndF, is also responsible for the structural complexification, generating the end product anditomin by an oxidative rearrangement.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of clorobiocin: investigation of the transfer and methylation of the pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl moiety Abstract: Clorobiocin is an aminocoumarin antibiotic containing a 5-methylpyrrolyl-2-carboxyl moiety, attached by an ester bond to a deoxysugar. This pyrrolyl moiety is important for the binding of the antibiotic to its biological target, the B subunit of gyrase. Inactivation experiments had shown that two putative acyl carrier proteins, CloN5 and CloN1, and two putative acyl transferases, CloN2 and CloN7, are involved in the transfer of the pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar. In this study, pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl-N-acetylcysteamine thioester was synthesized and fed to cloN1 ( - ), cloN2 ( - ) and cloN7 ( - ) mutants, and secondary metabolite formation was analyzed by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Transfer of the pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl moiety was observed in the cloN1 ( - ) and cloN2 ( - ) mutants, but not in the cloN7 ( - ) mutant, suggesting that CloN7 is responsible for this reaction. The product of this transfer, novclobiocin 109, was not further methylated to the 5-methylpyrrolyl-2-carboxyl compound, i.e. clorobiocin, suggesting that methylation does not take place after the acyl transfer. Additional investigations for the presence of 5-methylpyrrolyl-2-carboxylic acid in the mutants, and inactivation experiments with the methyltransferase gene cloN6, suggested that methylation by CloN6 and acyl transfer by CloN7 take place in a concerted fashion, requiring the presence of both proteins for efficient product formation. A mechanism for the methylation/acyl transfer process in the late steps of clorobiocin biosynthesis, involving CloN1, CloN2, CloN5, CloN6 and CloN7 is suggested.	1
Title: Zincophorin - biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus and antibiotic properties Abstract: Zincophorin is a polyketide antibiotic that possesses potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including human pathogens. While a number of total syntheses of this highly functionalized natural product were reported since its initial discovery, the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of zincophorin has remained unclear. In this study, the co-linearity inherent to polyketide pathways was used to identify the zincophorin biosynthesis gene cluster in the genome of the natural producer Streptomyces griseus HKI 0741. Interestingly, the same locus is fully conserved in the streptomycin-producing actinomycete S. griseus IFO 13350, suggesting that the latter bacterium is also capable of zincophorin biosynthesis. Biological profiling of zincophorin revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The antibacterial effect, however, is accompanied by cytotoxicity. Antibiotic and cytotoxic activities were completely abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic acid group in zincophorin.	1
Title: In vivo effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on lymphocyte activation in response to alloantigens Abstract: We studied the effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on the events of lymphocyte activation in vivo by inoculating mice in the footpad with allogeneic spleen cells, and compared the effects with those of cyclosporin A (CyA). The administration of NKT-01 increased the numbers of cells recovered from the popliteal lymph node (PLN) 7 days after inoculation, but inhibited the proliferation of these cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). NKT-01 enhanced IL-2 production, but suppressed the production of macrophage activating factor (MAF) in the mixed lymphocyte reaction between the PLN cells and allogeneic spleen cells treated with mitomycin C. CyA decreased the numbers of PLN cells little, and suppressed the response to exogenous IL-2 and the production of both IL-2 and MAF. Results with tumor cells used as allogeneic cells suggested that there was a close relationship between the suppression of MAF production by NKT-01 and its inhibition of allograft rejection. The findings showed that NKT-01 inhibited both the MAF production by and the response to IL-2 of PLN cells, and that these effects were involved in the suppression of allograft rejection by NKT-01.	0
Title: Traceless parallel peptide purification by a first-in-class reductively cleavable linker system featuring a safety-release Abstract: Hundreds of peptides can be synthesized by automated parallel synthesizers in a single run. In contrast, the most widely used peptide purification method - high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) - only allows one-by-one processing of each sample. The chromatographic purification of many peptides, therefore, remains a time-consuming and costly effort. Catch-and-release methods can be processed in parallel and potentially provide a remedy. However, no such system has yet provided a true alternative to HPLC. Herein we present the development of a side-reaction free, reductively cleavable linker. The linker is added to the target peptide as the last building block during peptide synthesis. After acidic cleavage from synthetic resin, the linker-tagged full-length peptide is caught onto an aldehyde-modified solid support by rapid oxime ligation, allowing removal of all impurities lacking the linker by washing. Reducing the aryl azide to an aniline sensitizes the linker for cleavage. However, scission does not occur at non-acidic pH enabling wash out of reducing agent. Final acidic treatment safely liberates the peptide by an acid-catalysed 1,6-elimination. We showcase this first-in-class reductively cleavable linker system in the parallel purification of a personalized neoantigen cocktail, containing 20 peptides for cancer immunotherapy within six hours.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolactone ring of the immunosuppressant FK506 Abstract: Biosynthesis of the macrolactone ring of FK506 involves 10 elongation cycles that mechanistically resemble the steps in fatty acid synthesis. Sequencing of a 40-kb DNA segment of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 has revealed two additional polyketide synthases (PKS) genes fkbB and fkbC which lie upstream of fkbA, a PKS gene recently shown to be responsible for the last four condensation steps of the FK506 biosynthesis [Motamedi, H., Cai, S. J., Shafiee, A. & Elliston, K. O. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 74-80]. fkbB and fkbC are contiguous and encode respectively, the first (790129 Da) and the second (374438 Da) components of the FK506 polyketide synthase, a complex of three multidomain polypeptides. The predicted domain structures of FkbB and FkbC are analogous to that of FkbA and comprise 30 fatty-acid-synthase(FAS)-like domains arranged in 6 modules. Each module performs a specific extension cycle in the assembly of the carbon skeleton of the FK506 macrolactone ring. The component activities for the initiation of the polyketide chain consisting of a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase and a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl CoA reductase required for the formation of the dihydrocyclohexylcarbonyl CoA starter unit and an acyl-carrier-protein to which the starter unit is anchored and translocated to the appropriate site on the PKS multienzyme are located at the N-terminal region of the FkbB polypeptide. A third gene, fkbL, lies at one end of the cluster and encodes lysine cyclodeaminase which catalyzes alpha-deamination and cyclization of the lysine into pipecolate. A fourth gene fkbP located at the other end of the sequence reported here encodes a peptide synthetase required for the activation and incorporation of the pipecolate moiety into the completed acyl chain. Finally the cluster carries a gene, fkbO, whose product is presumed to carry out a post-polyketide oxidation step of the FK506 marocycle.	1
Title: Direct synthesis of fluorinated heteroarylether bioisosteres Abstract: This work delineates a method for the modular synthesis of reagents that are capable of direct incorporation of difluoroalkyl groups onto heterocycles. The scope and generality of this method is exemplified with the difluoroethyl group (along with the introduction of a new reagent for difluoroethylation, DFES-Na) and a proof of principle is shown for a general synthesis of fluorinated heteroarylether bioisosteres.	0
Title: Response of Secondary Metabolism of Hypogean Actinobacterial Genera to Chemical and Biological Stimuli Abstract: Microorganisms within microbial communities respond to environmental challenges by producing biologically active secondary metabolites, yet the majority of these small molecules remain unidentified. We have previously demonstrated that secondary metabolite biosynthesis in actinomycetes can be activated by model environmental chemical and biological stimuli, and metabolites can be identified by comparative metabolomics analyses under different stimulus conditions. Here, we surveyed the secondary metabolite productivity of a group of 20 phylogenetically diverse actinobacteria isolated from hypogean (cave) environments by applying a battery of stimuli consisting of exposure to antibiotics, metals, and mixed microbial culture. Comparative metabolomics was used to reveal secondary metabolite responses from stimuli. These analyses revealed substantial changes in global metabolomic dynamics, with over 30% of metabolomic features increasing more than 10-fold under at least one stimulus condition. Selected features were isolated and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revealing several known secondary metabolite families, including the tetarimycins, aloesaponarins, hypogeamicins, actinomycins, and propeptins. One prioritized metabolite was identified to be a previously unreported aminopolyol polyketide, funisamine, produced by a cave isolate of Streptosporangium when exposed to mixed culture. The production of funisamine was most significantly increased in mixed culture with Bacillus species. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of funisamine was identified via genomic sequencing of the producing strain, Streptosporangium sp. strain KDCAGE35, which facilitated a deduction of its biosynthesis. Together, these data demonstrate that comparative metabolomics can reveal the stimulus-induced production of natural products from diverse microbial phylogenies.IMPORTANCE Microbial secondary metabolites are an important source of biologically active and therapeutically relevant small molecules. However, much of this active molecular diversity is challenging to access due to low production levels or difficulty in discerning secondary metabolites within complex microbial extracts prior to isolation. Here, we demonstrate that ecological stimuli increase secondary metabolite production in phylogenetically diverse actinobacteria isolated from understudied hypogean environments. Additionally, we show that comparative metabolomics linking stimuli to metabolite response data can effectively reveal secondary metabolites within complex biological extracts. This approach highlighted secondary metabolites in almost all observed natural product classes, including low-abundance analogs of biologically relevant metabolites, as well as a new linear aminopolyol polyketide, funisamine. This study demonstrates the generality of activating stimuli to potentiate secondary metabolite production across diverse actinobacterial genera.	1
Title: Cytotoxic withanolide constituents of Physalis longifolia Abstract: Fourteen new withanolides, 1-14, named withalongolides A-N, respectively, were isolated from the aerial parts of Physalis longifolia together with eight known compounds (15-22). The structures of compounds 1-14 were elucidated through spectroscopic techniques and chemical methods. In addition, the structures of withanolides 1, 2, 3, and 6 were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using a MTS viability assay, eight withanolides (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, and 19) and four acetylated derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b) showed potent cytotoxicity against human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (JMAR and MDA-1986), melanoma (B16F10 and SKMEL-28), and normal fetal fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC₅₀ values in the range between 0.067 and 9.3 μM.	0
Title: Macrodiolide formation by the thioesterase of a modular polyketide synthase Abstract: Elaiophylin is an unusual C2 -symmetric antibiotic macrodiolide produced on a bacterial modular polyketide synthase assembly line. To probe the mechanism and selectivity of diolide formation, we sought to reconstitute ring formation in vitro by using a non-natural substrate. Incubation of recombinant elaiophylin thioesterase/cyclase with a synthetic pentaketide analogue of the presumed monomeric polyketide precursor of elaiophylin, specifically its N-acetylcysteamine thioester, produced a novel 16-membered C2 -symmetric macrodiolide. A linear dimeric thioester is an intermediate in ring formation, which indicates iterative use of the thioesterase active site in ligation and subsequent cyclization. Furthermore, the elaiophylin thioesterase acts on a mixture of pentaketide and tetraketide thioesters to give both the symmetric decaketide diolide and the novel asymmetric hybrid nonaketide diolide. Such thioesterases have potential as tools for the in vitro construction of novel diolides.	0
Title: Molecular analysis of an inactive aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae RIB strains Abstract: To help assess the potential for aflatoxin production by Aspergillus oryzae, the structure of an aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homolog cluster in A. oryzae RIB 40 was analyzed. Although most genes in the corresponding cluster exhibited from 97 to 99% similarity to those of Aspergillus flavus, three genes shared 93% similarity or less. A 257-bp deletion in the aflT region, a frameshift mutation in norA, and a base pair substitution in verA were found in A. oryzae RIB 40. In the aflR promoter, two substitutions were found in one of the three putative AreA binding sites and in the FacB binding site. PCR primers were designed to amplify homologs of aflT, nor-1, aflR, norA, avnA, verB, and vbs and were used to detect these genes in 210 A. oryzae strains. Based on the PCR results, the A. oryzae RIB strains were classified into three groups, although most of them fell into two of the groups. Group 1, in which amplification of all seven genes was confirmed, contained 122 RIB strains (58.1% of examined strains), including RIB 40. Seventy-seven strains (36.7%) belonged to group 2, characterized by having only vbs, verB, and avnA in half of the cluster. Although slight expression of aflR was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in some group 1 strains, including RIB 40, other genes (avnA, vbs, verB, and omtA) related to aflatoxin production were not detected. aflR was not detected in group 2 strains by Southern analysis.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of the dehydrophos biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Dehydrophos is a vinyl phosphonate tripeptide produced by Streptomyces luridus with demonstrated broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. To identify genes necessary for biosynthesis of this unusual compound we screened a fosmid library of S. luridus for the presence of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase gene, which is required for biosynthesis of most phosphonates. Integration of one such fosmid clone into the chromosome of S. lividans led to heterologous production of dehydrophos. Deletion analysis of this clone allowed identification of the minimal contiguous dehydrophos cluster, which contained 17 open reading frames (ORFs). Bioinformatic analyses of these ORFs are consistent with a proposed biosynthetic pathway that generates dehydrophos from phosphoenolpyruvate. The early steps of this pathway are supported by analysis of intermediates accumulated by blocked mutants and in vitro biochemical experiments.	1
Title: Identification of genetic variation and haplotype structure of the canine ABCA4 gene for retinal disease association studies Abstract: Over 200 mutations in the retina specific member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily (ABCA4) have been associated with a diverse group of human retinal diseases. The disease mechanisms, and genotype-phenotype associations, nonetheless, remain elusive in many cases. As orthologous genes are commonly mutated in canine models of human blinding disorders, canine ABCA4 appears to be an ideal candidate gene to identify and study sequence changes in dogs affected by various forms of inherited retinal degeneration. However, the size of the gene and lack of haplotype assignment significantly limit targeted association and/or linkage approaches. This study assessed the naturally observed sequence diversity of ABCA4 in the dog, identifying 80% of novel variations. While none of the observed polymorphisms have been associated with blinding disorders to date, breed and potentially disease specific haplotypes have been identified. Moreover, a tag SNP map of 17 (15) markers has been established that accurately predicts common ABCA4 haplotypes (frequency > 5%) explaining >85% (>80%) of the observed genetic diversity and will considerably advance future studies. Our sequence analysis of the complete canine ABCA4 coding region will clearly provide a baseline and tools for future association studies and comparative genomics to further delineate the role of ABCA4 in canine blinding disorders.	0
Title: Structure-guided function discovery of an NRPS-like glycine betaine reductase for choline biosynthesis in fungi Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and NRPS-like enzymes have diverse functions in primary and secondary metabolisms. By using a structure-guided approach, we uncovered the function of a NRPS-like enzyme with unusual domain architecture, catalyzing two sequential two-electron reductions of glycine betaine to choline. Structural analysis based on the homology model suggests cation-π interactions as the major substrate specificity determinant, which was verified using substrate analogs and inhibitors. Bioinformatic analysis indicates this NRPS-like glycine betaine reductase is highly conserved and widespread in kingdom fungi. Genetic knockout experiments confirmed its role in choline biosynthesis and maintaining glycine betaine homeostasis in fungi. Our findings demonstrate that the oxidative choline-glycine betaine degradation pathway can operate in a fully reversible fashion and provide insight in understanding fungal choline metabolism. The use of an NRPS-like enzyme for reductive choline formation is energetically efficient compared with known pathways. Our discovery also underscores the capabilities of the structure-guided approach in assigning functions of uncharacterized multidomain proteins, which can potentially aid functional discovery of new enzymes by genome mining.	1
Title: A proteome quality index Abstract: We present the Proteome Quality Index (PQI; http://pqi-list.org), a much-needed resource for users of bacterial and eukaryotic proteomes. Completely sequenced genomes for which there is an available set of protein sequences (the proteome) are given a one- to five-star rating supported by 11 different metrics of quality. The database indexes over 3000 proteomes at the time of writing and is provided via a website for browsing, filtering and downloading. Previous to this work, there was no systematic way to account for the large variability in quality of the thousands of proteomes, and this is likely to have profoundly influenced the outcome of many published studies, in particular large-scale comparative analyses. The lack of a measure of proteome quality is likely due to the difficulty in producing one, a problem that we have approached by integrating multiple metrics. The continued development and improvement of the index will require the contribution of additional metrics by us and by others; the PQI provides a useful point of reference for the scientific community, but it is only the first step towards a 'standard' for the field.	0
Title: Effect of SDS on release of intracellular pneumocandin B0 in extractive batch fermentation of Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Pneumocandin B0 is a hydrophobic secondary metabolite that accumulates in the mycelia of Glarea lozoyensis and inhibits fungal 1,3-β-glucan synthase. Extractive batch fermentation can promote the release of intracellular secondary metabolites into the fermentation broth and is often used in industry. The addition of extractants has been proven as an effective method to attain higher accumulation of hydrophobic secondary metabolites and circumvent troublesome solvent extraction. Various extractants exerted significant but different influences on the biomass and pneumocandin B0 yields. The maximum pneumocandin B0 yield (2528.67 mg/L) and highest extracellular pneumocandin B0 yield (580.33 mg/L) were achieved when 1.0 g/L SDS was added on the 13th day of extractive batch fermentation, corresponding to significant increases of 37.63 and 154% compared with the conventional batch fermentation, respectively. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is partly attributed to the release of intracellular pneumocandin B0 into the fermentation broth and the enhanced biosynthesis of pneumocandin B0 in the mycelia.	0
Title: Efficient carbazole synthesis via Pd/Cu-cocatalyzed cross-coupling/isomerization of 2-allyl-3-iodoindoles and terminal alkynes Abstract: The Pd/Cu-cocatalyzed one-pot reaction of 2-allyl-3-iodo-1-tosyl-1H-indoles and terminal alkynes afforded carbazoles highly efficiently via sequential carbon-carbon coupling, isomerization, cyclization, and aromatization forming a benzene ring. Both Pd and Cu are responsible for the coupling step, while K2CO3 was observed to be critical for the subsequent cyclization.	0
Title: Characterization of a regulatory gene essential for the production of the angucycline-like polyketide antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: A gene, aur1P, encoding a protein similar to the response regulators of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, was identified upstream of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Expression of the gene was directed by a single promoter, aur1Pp, which was transcribed at low levels during the exponential phase and induced just before the stationary phase. A divergently transcribed gene, aur1R, has been identified upstream of aur1P, encoding a protein homologous to transcriptional repressors of the TetR family. The aur1P gene was disrupted in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 chromosome by homologous recombination. The mutation in the aur1P gene had no effect on growth and differentiation. However, biochromatographic analysis of culture extracts from the S. aureofaciens aur1P-disrupted strain revealed that auricin was not produced in the mutant. This indicated that aur1P is essential for auricin production. Transcription from the previously characterized aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of the first gene, aur1A, in the auricin gene cluster, was dramatically decreased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1P mutant strain. Moreover, the Aur1P protein, overproduced in Escherichia coli, was shown to bind specifically upstream of the aur1Ap promoter region. The results indicated that the Aur1P regulator activates expression of the auricin biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: Entianin, a novel subtilin-like lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029T with high antimicrobial activity Abstract: Lantibiotics, such as nisin and subtilin, are lanthionine-containing peptides that exhibit antimicrobial as well as pheromone-like autoinducing activity. Autoinduction is specific for each lantibiotic, and reporter systems for nisin and subtilin autoinduction are available. In this report, we used the previously reported subtilin autoinduction bioassay in combination with mass spectrometric analyses to identify the novel subtilin-like lantibiotic entianin from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029(T). Linearization of entianin using Raney nickel-catalyzed reductive cleavage enabled, for the first time, the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and efficient determination of an entire lantibiotic primary structure, including posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequence determined was verified by DNA sequencing of the etnS structural gene, which confirmed that entianin differs from subtilin at 3 amino acid positions. In contrast to B. subtilis ATCC 6633, which produces only small amounts of unsuccinylated subtilin, B. subtilis DSM 15029(T) secretes considerable amounts of unsuccinylated entianin. Entianin was very active against several Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The growth-inhibiting activity of succinylated entianin (S-entianin) was much lower than that of unsuccinylated entianin: a 40-fold higher concentration was required for inhibition. For succinylated subtilin (S-subtilin), a concentration 100-fold higher than that of unsuccinylated entianin was required to inhibit the growth of a B. subtilis test strain. This finding was in accordance with a strongly reduced sensing of cellular envelope stress provided by S-entianin relative to that of entianin. Remarkably, S-entianin and S-subtilin showed considerable autoinduction activity, clearly demonstrating that autoinduction and antibiotic activity underlie different molecular mechanisms.	1
Title: Spirohexenolide A targets human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (hMIF) Abstract: Spirohexenolides A and B comprise a unique family of spirotetronate natural products. We report on the identification of their binding to and modulation of human macrophage migration inhibitor factor (hMIF). Using an immunoaffinity-fluorescent labeling method, the properties of this interaction are detailed and evidence is provided that hMIF plays a key role in the cytostatic activity of the spirohexenolides.	0
Title: Identification of a topoisomerase IV in actinobacteria: purification and characterization of ParYR and GyrBR from the coumermycin A1 producer Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene clusters of the gyrase inhibitors coumermycin A(1) and clorobiocin contain two different resistance genes (gyrB(R) and parY(R)). Both genes code for B subunits of type II topoisomerases. The authors have now overexpressed and purified the encoded proteins, as well as the corresponding A subunits GyrA and ParX. Expression was carried out in Streptomyces lividans in the form of hexahistidine fusion proteins, allowing purification by nickel affinity chromatography. The complex of GyrA and GyrB(R) was found to catalyse ATP-dependent supercoiling of DNA, i.e. to function as a gyrase, whereas the complex of ParX and ParY(R) catalysed ATP-dependent decatenation and relaxation, i.e. the functions of topoisomerase IV (topo IV). This is believed to represent the first topo IV identified in the class of actinobacteria, and the first demonstration of the formation of a topo IV as a resistance mechanism of an antibiotic producer.	1
Title: Uncovering the unusual D-ring construction in terretonin biosynthesis by collaboration of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 and a unique isomerase Abstract: Terretonin (1) is a fungal meroterpenoid isolated from Aspergillus terreus, and possesses a highly oxygenated and unique tetracyclic structure. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1 has been identified and the biosynthesis has recently been studied by heterologous reconstitution and targeted-gene deletion experiments, the last few steps of the terretonin pathway after terrenoid (6) have yet to be elucidated. Notably, the mechanism for the D-ring expansion to afford the terretonin scaffold has been a long-standing mystery to solve. Here we report the characterization of three enzymes that convert 6 into 1, as well as the complete biosynthetic pathway of 1. In the proposed terretonin pathway, the cytochrome P450 Trt6 catalyzes three successive oxidations to transform 6 into an unstable intermediate, which then undergoes the D-ring expansion and unusual rearrangement of the methoxy group to afford the core skeleton of 1. This unprecedented rearrangement is catalyzed by a novel isomerase Trt14. Finally, the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase Trt7 accomplishes the last two oxidation reactions steps to complete the biosynthesis.	1
Title: A fungal biofilm reactor based on metal structured packing improves the quality of a Gla::GFP fusion protein produced by Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Fungal biofilm is known to promote the excretion of secondary metabolites in accordance with solid-state-related physiological mechanisms. This work is based on the comparative analysis of classical submerged fermentation with a fungal biofilm reactor for the production of a Gla::green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein by Aspergillus oryzae. The biofilm reactor comprises a metal structured packing allowing the attachment of the fungal biomass. Since the production of the target protein is under the control of the promoter glaB, specifically induced in solid-state fermentation, the biofilm mode of culture is expected to enhance the global productivity. Although production of the target protein was enhanced by using the biofilm mode of culture, we also found that fusion protein production is also significant when the submerged mode of culture is used. This result is related to high shear stress leading to biomass autolysis and leakage of intracellular fusion protein into the extracellular medium. Moreover, 2-D gel electrophoresis highlights the preservation of fusion protein integrity produced in biofilm conditions. Two fungal biofilm reactor designs were then investigated further, i.e. with full immersion of the packing or with medium recirculation on the packing, and the scale-up potentialities were evaluated. In this context, it has been shown that full immersion of the metal packing in the liquid medium during cultivation allows for a uniform colonization of the packing by the fungal biomass and leads to a better quality of the fusion protein.	0
Title: Salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus salivarius Abstract: Salivaricin 9 (Sal9) is a 2560 Da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the Streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic SA-FF22. The Sal9 locus (designated siv) in Streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin A4. The entire locus was fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of S. salivarius strain JIM8780 and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivK, sensor kinase; sivR, response regulator; sivA, Sal9 precursor peptide; sivM, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivT, ABC transporter involved in the export of Sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivFEG, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. Intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain JIM8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in S. salivarius. Sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain JIM8780, indicating that Sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. Screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (S. salivarius, S. pyogenes and S. mitis) for sivA indicated that it was present only in S. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested S. salivarius positive. Since Sal9 was inhibitory to all tested S. pyogenes strains it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of S. salivarius probiotics intended to control S. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.	1
Title: Discovery and assembly-line biosynthesis of the lymphostin pyrroloquinoline alkaloid family of mTOR inhibitors in Salinispora bacteria Abstract: The pyrroloquinoline alkaloid family of natural products, which includes the immunosuppressant lymphostin, has long been postulated to arise from tryptophan. We now report the molecular basis of lymphostin biosynthesis in three marine Salinispora species that maintain conserved biosynthetic gene clusters harboring a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase that is central to lymphostin assembly. Through a series of experiments involving gene mutations, stable isotope profiling, and natural product discovery, we report the assembly-line biosynthesis of lymphostin and nine new analogues that exhibit potent mTOR inhibitory activity.	1
Title: Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Phenyl Addition-Dehydrocyclization: The Third Way Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent the link between resonance-stabilized free radicals and carbonaceous nanoparticles generated in incomplete combustion processes and in circumstellar envelopes of carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although these PAHs resemble building blocks of complex carbonaceous nanostructures, their fundamental formation mechanisms have remained elusive. By exploring these reaction mechanisms of the phenyl radical with biphenyl/naphthalene theoretically and experimentally, we provide compelling evidence on a novel phenyl-addition/dehydrocyclization (PAC) pathway leading to prototype PAHs: triphenylene and fluoranthene. PAC operates efficiently at high temperatures leading through rapid molecular mass growth processes to complex aromatic structures, which are difficult to synthesize by traditional pathways such as hydrogen-abstraction/acetylene-addition. The elucidation of the fundamental reactions leading to PAHs is necessary to facilitate an understanding of the origin and evolution of the molecular universe and of carbon in our galaxy.	0
Title: Unexpected consequences of administering bacteriocinogenic probiotic strains for Salmonella populations, revealed by an in vitro colonic model of the child gut Abstract: New biological strategies for the treatment of Salmonella infection are needed in response to the increase in antibiotic-resistant strains. Escherichia coli L1000 and Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 were previously shown to produce antimicrobial proteinaceous compounds (microcin B17 and thermophilicin B67, respectively) active in vitro against a panel of Salmonella strains recently isolated from clinical cases in Switzerland. In this study, two three-stage intestinal continuous fermentation models of Salmonella colonization inoculated with immobilized faeces of a two-year-old child were implemented to study the effects of the two bacteriocinogenic strains compared with a bacteriocin-negative mutant of strain L1000 on Salmonella growth, as well as gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Immobilized E. coli L1000 added to the proximal colon reactor showed a low colonization, and developed preferentially in the distal colon reactor independent of the presence of genetic determinants for microcin B17 production. Surprisingly, E. coli L1000 addition strongly stimulated Salmonella growth in all three reactors. In contrast, B. thermophilum RBL67 added in a second phase stabilized at high levels in all reactors, but could not inhibit Salmonella already present at a high level (>10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1)) when the probiotic was added. Inulin added at the end of fermentation induced a strong bifidogenic effect in all three colon reactors and a significant increase of Salmonella counts in the distal colon reactor. Our data show that under the simulated child colonic conditions, the microcin B17 production phenotype does not correlate with inhibition of Salmonella but leads to a better colonization of E. coli L1000 in the distal colon reactor. We conclude that in vitro models with complex and complete gut microbiota are required to accurately assess the potential and efficacy of probiotics with respect to Salmonella colonization in the gut.	0
Title: Mechanism of amido-thiourea catalyzed enantioselective imine hydrocyanation: transition state stabilization via multiple non-covalent interactions Abstract: An experimental and computational investigation of amido-thiourea promoted imine hydrocyanation has revealed a new and unexpected mechanism of catalysis. Rather than direct activation of the imine by the thiourea, as had been proposed previously in related systems, the data are consistent with a mechanism involving catalyst-promoted proton transfer from hydrogen isocyanide to imine to generate diastereomeric iminium/cyanide ion pairs that are bound to catalyst through multiple noncovalent interactions; these ion pairs collapse to form the enantiomeric alpha-aminonitrile products. This mechanistic proposal is supported by the observation of a statistically significant correlation between experimental and calculated enantioselectivities induced by eight different catalysts (P << 0.01). The computed models reveal a basis for enantioselectivity that involves multiple stabilizing and destabilizing interactions between substrate and catalyst, including thiourea-cyanide and amide-iminium interactions.	0
Title: Modulation of kanamycin B and kanamycin A biosynthesis in Streptomyces kanamyceticus via metabolic engineering Abstract: Both kanamycin A and kanamycin B, antibiotic components produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus, have medical value. Two different pathways for kanamycin biosynthesis have been reported by two research groups. In this study, to obtain an optimal kanamycin A-producing strain and a kanamycin B-high-yield strain, we first examined the native kanamycin biosynthetic pathway in vivo. Based on the proposed parallel biosynthetic pathway, kanN disruption should lead to kanamycin A accumulation; however, the kanN-disruption strain produced neither kanamycin A nor kanamycin B. We then tested the function of kanJ and kanK. The main metabolite of the kanJ-disruption strain was identified as kanamycin B. These results clarified that kanamycin biosynthesis does not proceed through the parallel pathway and that synthesis of kanamycin A from kanamycin B is catalyzed by KanJ and KanK in S. kanamyceticus. As expected, the kanamycin B yield of the kanJ-disruption strain was 3268±255 μg/mL, 12-fold higher than that of the original strain. To improve the purity of kanamycin A and reduce the yield of kanamycin B in the fermentation broth, four different kanJ- and kanK-overexpressing strains were constructed through either homologous recombination or site-specific integration. The overexpressing strain containing three copies of kanJ and kanK in its genome exhibited the lowest kanamycin B yield (128±20 μg/mL), which was 54% lower than that of the original strain. Our experimental results demonstrate that kanamycin A is derived from KanJ-and-KanK-catalyzed conversion of kanamycin B in S. kanamyceticus. Moreover, based on the clarified biosynthetic pathway, we obtained a kanamycin B-high-yield strain and an optimized kanamycin A-producing strain with minimal byproduct.	1
Title: Genetic evidence for the requirements of antroquinonol biosynthesis by Antrodia camphorata during liquid-state fermentation Abstract: The solid-state fermentation of Antrodia camphorata could produce a variety of ubiquinone compounds, such as antroquinonol (AQ). However, AQ is hardly synthesized during liquid-state fermentation (LSF). To investigates the mechanism of AQ synthesis, three precursors (ubiquinone 0 UQ0, farnesol and farnesyl diphosphate FPP) were added in LSF. The results showed that UQ0 successfully induced AQ production; however, farnesol and FPP could not induce AQ synthesis. The precursor that restricts the synthesis of AQ is the quinone ring, not the isoprene side chain. Then, the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system of A. camphorata was established and the genes for quinone ring modification (coq2-6) and isoprene synthesis (HMGR, fps) were overexpressed. The results showed that overexpression of genes for isoprene side chain synthesis could not increase the yield of AQ, but overexpression of coq2 and coq5 could significantly increase AQ production. This is consistent with the results of the experiment of precursors. It indicated that the A. camphorata lack the ability to modify the quinone ring of AQ during LSF. Of the modification steps, prenylation of UQ0 is the key step of AQ biosynthesis. The result will help us to understand the genetic evidence for the requirements of AQ biosynthesis in A. camphorata.	0
Title: The mildiomycin biosynthesis: initial steps for sequential generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytidine 5'-monophosphate and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Streptoverticillium rimofaciens ZJU5119 Abstract: Mildiomycin (MIL) is a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic with strong activity against powdery mildew disease of plants. We have cloned the MIL biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptoverticillum rimofaciens ZJU5119 and shown that this organism also produces the related antifungal compound, deshydroxymethyl mildiomycin (dHM-MIL). A cosmid genomic library was screened for a putative nucleotide hydrolase gene that is related to blsM from the blasticidin S cluster. Six cosmids were identified that contained a 3.5 kb DNA fragment that harbors a homologue of blsM. The sequence of the fragment revealed two open-reading frames that are likely to function in MIL formation: milA is a CMP hydroxymethylase gene and milB is the homologue of the CMP hydrolase gene blsM. Insertional disruption of milA abolished the production of MIL but not dHM-MIL, whereas a milB knockout strain did not produce either of the peptidyl nucleosides. Recombinant MilA was produced in E. coli and shown to specifically introduce a C-5 hydroxymethyl group on CMP, but it did not accept cytosine or dCMP as a substrate. MilB was also expressed and purified from E. coli and shown to efficiently hydrolyze both hydroxymethyl-CMP (HMCMP) and could accept CMP as an alternative substrate. The ratio of free HMC and cytosine released by MilB was ca. 9:1 in in vitro assays, and is consistent with the higher levels of MIL compared to dHM-MIL that are produced by Streptoverticillum rimofaciens.	1
Title: Biological characterization of the hygrobafilomycin antibiotic JBIR-100 and bioinformatic insights into the hygrolide family of natural products Abstract: The hygrolides, a family of 16-member-ring-containing plecomacrolides produced by Actinobacteria, exhibit numerous reported bioactivities. Using HR-MS/MS, nucleophilic 1,4-addition-based labeling, NMR, and bioinformatic analysis, we identified Streptomyces varsoviensis as a novel producer of JBIR-100, a fumarate-containing hygrolide, and elucidated the previously unknown stereochemistry of the natural product. We investigated the antimicrobial activity of JBIR-100, with preliminary insight into mode of action indicating that it perturbs the membrane of Bacillus subtilis. S. varsoviensis is known to produce compounds from multiple hygrolide sub-families, namely hygrobafilomycins (JBIR-100 and hygrobafilomycin) and bafilomycins (bafilomycin C1 and D). In light of this, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for JBIR-100, which, to our knowledge, represents the first reported for a hygrobafilomycin. Finally, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of the hygrolide family, describing clusters from known and predicted producers. Our results indicate that potential remains for the Actinobacteria to yield novel hygrolide congeners, perhaps with differing biological activities.	1
Title: Analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotic epidermin Abstract: The structural gene of the lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic epidermin is located on a 54-kb plasmid of Staphylococcus epidermidis [Schnell et al. (1988) Nature 333, 276-278]. A 13.5-kb DNA region neighbouring the epidermin structural gene (epiA) was subcloned and its sequencing revealed five additional open reading frames. Three of these reading frames, epiB, epiC and epiD shared no homology with previously described proteins stored in data bases. They were located 3' adjacent to epiA. Using epiB as a probe, a 5-kb mRNA was identified indicating that three or all four reading frames are transcribed as an operon. Additionally, a 0.3-kb mRNA specific for epiA was identified. Two open reading frames (epiP and epiQ) were located 3' to epiA, epiB, epiC and epiD, but in the reverse orientation. The epiQ gene product shows similarity to the positive regulatory factor PhoB. This might indicate a regulatory function of epiQ in epidermin biosynthesis. The epiP gene product shows striking similarity to several serine proteases which makes epiP a likely candidate for processing the epidermin prepeptide. Heterologous epidermin synthesis in the non-producing organism Staphylococcus carnosus finally proved that these reading frames are necessary for epidermin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biochemical and genetic characterization of coagulin, a new antilisterial bacteriocin in the pediocin family of bacteriocins, produced by Bacillus coagulans I(4) Abstract: A plasmid-linked antimicrobial peptide, named coagulin, produced by Bacillus coagulans I(4) has recently been reported (B. Hyronimus, C. Le Marrec and M. C. Urdaci, J. Appl. Microbiol. 85:42-50, 1998). In the present study, the complete, unambiguous primary amino acid sequence of the peptide was obtained by a combination of both N-terminal sequencing of purified peptide and the complete sequence deduced from the structural gene harbored by plasmid I(4). Data revealed that this peptide of 44 residues has an amino acid sequence similar to that described for pediocins AcH and PA-1, produced by different Pediococcus acidilactici strains and 100% identical. Coagulin and pediocin differed only by a single amino acid at their C terminus. Analysis of the genetic determinants revealed the presence, on the pI(4) DNA, of the entire 3.5-kb operon of four genes described for pediocin AcH and PA-1 production. No extended homology was observed between pSMB74 from P. acidilactici and pI(4) when analyzing the regions upstream and downstream of the operon. An oppositely oriented gene immediately dowstream of the bacteriocin operon specifies a 474-amino-acid protein which shows homology to Mob-Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded by several small plasmids extracted from gram-positive bacteria. This is the first report of a pediocin-like peptide appearing naturally in a non-lactic acid bacterium genus.	1
Title: In vitro augmentation of natural killer activity and interferon-gamma production in murine spleen cells with Agaricus blazei fruiting body fractions Abstract: Aqueous extracts of the Agaricus blazei fruiting body prepared at different temperatures were fractionated by ethanol precipitation with various ethanol concentrations. The original aqueous extracts of A. blazei failed to stimulate natural killer (NK) cell activity in murine spleen cells in vitro, but the strongest effect was observed in a 30% ethanol-soluble-50% ethanol-insoluble fraction prepared from the extract at 40 degrees C (fraction A-50). Fraction A-50 also showed the strongest augmenting effect on interferon (IFN)-gamma production. This augmentation of NK activity and IFN-gamma production by fraction A-50 was completely abrogated by a heat treatment.	0
Title: Enzymatic Formation of Rufoschweinitzin, a Binaphthalene from the Basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus Abstract: Dimeric polyketides are widespread fungal secondary metabolites. They occur in both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes and, therefore, across fungal phyla. Here we report the isolation of a new binaphthalene, named rufoschweinitzin, from the basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus. Rufoschweinitzin consists of two symmetrically 4,4'-coupled torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether moieties. Furthermore, we have identified a binaphthalene biosynthetic gene cluster in an unrelated fungus, the ascomycete Xylaria schweinitzii. Heterologous expression of the encoded cytochrome P450 enzyme verified its coupling activity: dimerization of torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether led to the formation of rufoschweinitzin alongside a hitherto unknown regioisomer, now named alloschweinitzin. We have thus demonstrated enzymatic formation of the basidiomycete's metabolite rufoschweinitzin and made the regiochemistry of alloschweinitzin accessible with an ascomycete-derived enzyme.	1
Title: Multiplexing of combinatorial chemistry in antimycin biosynthesis: expansion of molecular diversity and utility Abstract: Diversity-oriented biosynthesis of a library of antimycin-like compounds (380 altogether) was accomplished by using multiplex combinatorial biosynthesis. The core strategy depends on the use of combinatorial chemistry at different biosynthetic stages. This approach is applicable for the diversification of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and the hybrids that share a similar biosynthetic logic.	1
Title: Sequencing and mutagenesis of genes from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea that are involved in L-mycarose and D-desosamine production Abstract: The nucleotide sequence on both sides of the eryA polyketide synthase genes of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea reveals the presence of ten genes that are involved in L-mycarose (eryB) and D-desosamine (eryC) biosynthesis or attachment. Mutant strains carrying targeted lesions in eight of these genes indicate that three (eryBIV, eryBV and eryBVI) act in L-mycarose biosynthesis or attachment, while the other five (eryCII, eryCIII, eryCIV, eryCV and eryCVI) are devoted to D-desosamine biosynthesis or attachment. The remaining two genes (eryBII and eryBVII) appear to function in L-mycarose biosynthesis based on computer analysis and earlier genetic data. Three of these genes, eryBII, eryCIII and eryCII, lie between the eryAIII and eryG genes on one side of the polyketide synthase genes, while the remaining seven, eryBIV, eryBV, eryCVI, eryBVI, eryCIV, eryCV and eryBVII lie upstream of the eryAI gene on the other side of the gene cluster. The deduced products of these genes show similarities to: aldohexose 4-ketoreductases (eryBIV), aldoketo reductases (eryBII), aldohexose 5-epimerases (eryBVII), the dnmT gene of the daunomycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces peucetius (eryBVI), glycosyltransferases (eryBV and eryCIII), the AscC 3,4-dehydratase from the ascarylose biosynthetic pathway of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (eryCIV), and mammalian N-methyltransferases (eryCVI). The eryCII gene resembles a cytochrome P450, but lacks the conserved cysteine residue responsible for coordination of the haem iron, while the eryCV gene displays no meaningful similarity to other known sequences. From the predicted function of these and other known eryB and eryC genes, pathways for the biosynthesis of L-mycarose and D-desosamine have been deduced.	1
Title: Piperazine ring formation by a single-module NRPS and cleavage by an α-KG-dependent nonheme iron dioxygenase in brasiliamide biosynthesis Abstract: Brasiliamides are a class of piperazine-containing alkaloids produced by Penicillium brasilianum with a range of pharmaceutical activities. The mechanism of brasiliamide biosynthesis, including piperazine ring formation and multiple tailoring modifications, still remains unclear. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of brasiliamides, brs, was identified from the marine-derived fungal strain Penicillium brasilianum WZXY-M122-9. Deletion of a histone deacetylase-encoding gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system led to the production of a new compound, namely brasiliamide I (1). The brs-encoded single-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) BrsA is involved in the formation of the piperazine skeleton of brasiliamides. Full-length BrsA protein (113.6 kDa) was purified, and reconstitution of enzymatic activity in vitro confirmed that BrsA stereoselectively accepts L-phenylalanine as the substrate. Multiple deletion of tailoring genes and analysis of purified proteins in vitro enabled us to propose a brasiliamide biosynthetic pathway. In the tailoring steps, an α-ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent nonheme iron dioxygenase, BrsJ, was identified to catalyze piperazine ring cleavage during biosynthesis of brasiliamide A (2). KEY POINTS: The gene cluster encoding brasiliamide biosynthesis, brs, is identified. Deletion of a histone deacetylase-encoding gene produces brasiliamide I.

Title: Halomonas salinarum sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from saline soil in Yingkou, China Abstract: Strain G5-11T, a Gram-negative, moderately halotolerant, facultatively aerobic, motile bacterium was isolated from saline soil collected from Yingkou, Liaoning, China. The cells of strain G5-11T grew in the presence of 3-15% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 5%), at between 4 and 35 °C (optimum 30 °C), and at a pH of 6.0-9.0 (optimum 8.0). The major respiratory quinone was Q-9 and the dominant cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C18:1ω7c/C18:1ω6c), C16:0, and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c/C16:1ω6c). The major components of the polar lipid profile were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and unidentified aminolipid. The G + C content of the strain G5-11T genome was 61.0 mol%. The isolated strain G5-11T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity to Halomonas niordiana LMG 31227T and Halomonas taeanensis DSM 16463T, both reaching 98.3%, followed by Halomonas pacifica NBRC 102220T. The results from phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic analyses showed that strain G5-11T represented a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas salinarum sp. nov. was proposed. The type strain of Halomonas salinarum is G5-11T (= CGMCC 1.12051T = LMG 31677T).	0
Title: Insights into secondary metabolism from a global analysis of prokaryotic biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Although biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been discovered for hundreds of bacterial metabolites, our knowledge of their diversity remains limited. Here, we used a novel algorithm to systematically identify BGCs in the extensive extant microbial sequencing data. Network analysis of the predicted BGCs revealed large gene cluster families, the vast majority uncharacterized. We experimentally characterized the most prominent family, consisting of two subfamilies of hundreds of BGCs distributed throughout the Proteobacteria; their products are aryl polyenes, lipids with an aryl head group conjugated to a polyene tail. We identified a distant relationship to a third subfamily of aryl polyene BGCs, and together the three subfamilies represent the largest known family of biosynthetic gene clusters, with more than 1,000 members. Although these clusters are widely divergent in sequence, their small molecule products are remarkably conserved, indicating for the first time the important roles these compounds play in Gram-negative cell biology.	1
Title: Phenolic lipids synthesized by type III polyketide synthase confer penicillin resistance on Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) found in plants, fungi, and bacteria synthesize a variety of aromatic polyketides. A Gram-positive, filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus contained an srs operon, in which srsA encoded a type III PKS, srsB encoded a methyltransferase, and srsC encoded a flavoprotein hydroxylase. Consistent with this annotation, overexpression of the srs genes in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, showed that SrsA was a type III PKS responsible for synthesis of phenolic lipids, alkylresorcinols, and alkylpyrones, SrsB was a methyltransferase acting on the phenolic lipids to yield alkylresorcinol methyl ethers, and SrsC was a hydroxylase acting on the alkylresorcinol methyl ethers. In vitro SrsA reaction showed that SrsA synthesized alkylresorcinols from acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths as a starter substrate, one molecule of methylmalonyl-CoA, and two molecules of malonyl-CoA. SrsA was thus unique in that it incorporated the extender substrates in a strictly controlled order of malonyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA to produce alkylresorcinols. An srsA mutant, which produced no phenolic lipids, was highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin G and cephalexin. Together with the fact that the alkylresorcinols were fractionated mainly in the cell wall fraction, this observation suggests that the phenolic lipids, perhaps associated with the cytoplasmic membrane because of their amphiphilic property, affect the characteristic and rigidity of the cytoplasmic membrane/peptidoglycan of a variety of bacteria. An srs-like operon is found widely among Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, indicating wide distribution of the phenolic lipids.	1
Title: Docking domain-mediated subunit interactions in natural product megasynth(et)ases Abstract: Polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) multienzymes produce numerous high value metabolites. The protein subunits which constitute these megasynth(et)ases must undergo ordered self-assembly to ensure correct organisation of catalytic domains for the biosynthesis of a given natural product. Short amino acid regions at the N- and C-termini of each subunit, termed docking domains (DDs), often occur in complementary pairs, which interact to facilitate substrate transfer and maintain pathway fidelity. This review details all structurally characterised examples of NRPS and PKS DDs to date and summarises efforts to utilise DDs for the engineering of biosynthetic pathways.	0
Title: A single cluster of coregulated genes encodes the biosynthesis of the mycotoxins roquefortine C and meleagrin in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: A single gene cluster of Penicillium chrysogenum contains genes involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of the mycotoxins roquefortine C and meleagrin. Five of these genes have been silenced by RNAi. Pc21g15480 (rds) encodes a nonribosomal cyclodipeptide synthetase for the biosynthesis of both roquefortine C and meleagrin. Pc21g15430 (rpt) encodes a prenyltransferase also required for the biosynthesis of both mycotoxins. Silencing of Pc21g15460 or Pc21g15470 led to a decrease in roquefortine C and meleagrin, whereas silencing of the methyltransferase gene (Pc21g15440; gmt) resulted in accumulation of glandicolin B, indicating that this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glandicolin B to meleagrin. All these genes are transcriptionally coregulated. Our results prove that roquefortine C and meleagrin derive from a single pathway.	1
Title: A natural plasmid uniquely encodes two biosynthetic pathways creating a potent anti-MRSA antibiotic Abstract: Background:                       Understanding how complex antibiotics are synthesised by their producer bacteria is essential for creation of new families of bioactive compounds. Thiomarinols, produced by marine bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, are hybrids of two independently active species: the pseudomonic acid mixture, mupirocin, which is used clinically against MRSA, and the pyrrothine core of holomycin.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       High throughput DNA sequencing of the complete genome of the producer bacterium revealed a novel 97 kb plasmid, pTML1, consisting almost entirely of two distinct gene clusters. Targeted gene knockouts confirmed the role of these clusters in biosynthesis of the two separate components, pseudomonic acid and the pyrrothine, and identified a putative amide synthetase that joins them together. Feeding mupirocin to a mutant unable to make the endogenous pseudomonic acid created a novel hybrid with the pyrrothine via "mutasynthesis" that allows inhibition of mupirocin-resistant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the mupirocin target. A mutant defective in pyrrothine biosynthesis was also able to incorporate alternative amine substrates.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Plasmid pTML1 provides a paradigm for combining independent antibiotic biosynthetic pathways or using mutasynthesis to develop a new family of hybrid derivatives that may extend the effective use of mupirocin against MRSA.	1
Title: The fumitremorgin gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus: identification of a gene encoding brevianamide F synthetase Abstract: A gene encoding a putative dimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) was identified within a gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus, a species reported to produce fumitremorgins and other prenylated alkaloids. The gene was deleted and overexpressed in the genome reference strain Af293, and was also expressed in the naïve host Aspergillus nidulans, which lacks the equivalent gene cluster. While neither fumitremorgins nor the dipeptide brevianamide F (cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro), an early intermediate, were detected in wild-type and deletion strains of A. fumigatus, brevianamide F accumulated in fungal cultures following increased expression of the NRPS gene in both A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. We conclude that the gene Afu8g00170, named ftmA, encodes the NRPS brevianamide synthetase. Brevianamide F is the precursor of a variety of fungal prenylated alkaloids with biological activity, including fumitremorgins A, B and C and tryprostatin B.	1
Title: Production of hygromycin A analogs in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 through identification and manipulation of the biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Hygromycin A, an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388, offers a distinct carbon skeleton structure for development of antibacterial agents targeting the bacterial ribosomal peptidyl transferase. A 31.5 kb genomic DNA region covering the hygromycin A biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified, cloned, and sequenced. The hygromycin gene cluster has 29 ORFs which can be assigned to hygromycin A resistance as well as regulation and biosynthesis of the three key moieties of hygromycin A (5-dehydro-alpha-L-fucofuranose, (E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylacrylic acid, and 2L-2-amino-2-deoxy-4,5-O-methylene-neo-inositol. The predicted Hyg26 protein has sequence homology to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases and is assigned to the final step in production of the 5-dehydro-alpha-L-fucofuranose, catalyzing the reduction of alpha-L-fucofuranose. A hyg26 mutant strain was generated and shown to produce no hygromycin A but 5''-dihydrohygromycin A, 5''-dihydromethoxyhygromycin A, and a 5''-dihydrohygromycin A product lacking the aminocyclitol moiety. To the best of our knowledge, these shunt metabolites of biosynthetic pathway intermediates have not previously been identified. They provide insight into the ordering of the multiple unusual steps which compromise the convergent hygromycin A biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Microbial metabolites with tipA promoter inducing activity. II. Geninthiocin, a novel thiopeptide produced by Streptomyces sp. DD84 Abstract: Geninthiocin was isolated from the mycelium of Streptomyces sp. DD84 as a tipA promoter inducing substance. Based on various NMR studies, its structure was established as a thiopeptide with oxazole and thiazole moieties, and several unusual amino acids.	0
Title: Genetic and Biochemical Characterization of a Gene Operon for trans-Aconitic Acid, a Novel Nematicide from Bacillus thuringiensis Abstract: trans-Aconitic acid (TAA) is an isomer of cis-aconitic acid (CAA), an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that is synthesized by aconitase. Although TAA production has been detected in bacteria and plants for many years and is known to be a potent inhibitor of aconitase, its biosynthetic origins and the physiological relevance of its activity have remained unclear. We have serendipitously uncovered key information relevant to both of these questions. Specifically, in a search for novel nematicidal factors from Bacillus thuringiensis, a significant nematode pathogen harboring many protein virulence factors, we discovered a high yielding component that showed activity against the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita and surprisingly identified it as TAA. Comparison with CAA, which displayed a much weaker nematicidal effect, suggested that TAA is specifically synthesized by B. thuringiensis as a virulence factor. Analysis of mutants deficient in plasmids that were anticipated to encode virulence factors allowed us to isolate a TAA biosynthesis-related (tbr) operon consisting of two genes, tbrA and tbrB We expressed the corresponding proteins, TbrA and TbrB, and characterized them as an aconitate isomerase and TAA transporter, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis of the TAA biosynthetic gene cluster revealed the association of the TAA genes with transposable elements relevant for horizontal gene transfer as well as a distribution across B. cereus bacteria and other B. thuringiensis strains, suggesting a general role for TAA in the interactions of B. cereus group bacteria with nematode hosts in the soil environment. This study reveals new bioactivity for TAA and the TAA biosynthetic pathway, improving our understanding of virulence factors employed by B. thuringiensis pathogenesis and providing potential implications for nematode management applications.	1
Title: Host-adapted Cryptosporidium spp. in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) Abstract: The prevalence and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in the fecal droppings of the free-living waterfowl Canada geese were examined at 13 sites in Ohio and Illinois. On the basis of the analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, 49 (23.4%) of 209 fecal specimens collected from 10 sites (76.9%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. The following five Cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified: Cryptosporidium goose genotype I (in 36 specimens), Cryptosporidium goose genotype II (in 9 specimens), Cryptosporidium duck genotype (in 1 specimen), Cryptosporidium parvum (in 4 specimens), and C. hominis (in 2 specimens). Cryptosporidium goose genotype I was the most prevalent parasite and was found at all five Cryptosporidium-positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois, followed by Cryptosporidium goose genotype II, which was found at two of five positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois. Cryptosporidium goose genotype II was detected for the first time, and it is phylogenetically related to goose genotype I and the duck genotype. All three genotypes have not so far been reported in humans, and their pathogenicity in geese has not been determined. Only 10.2% of the Cryptosporidium-positive specimens had C. parvum and C. hominis. The results of this study indicate that Canada geese might only serve as accidental carriers of cryptosporidia infectious to humans and probably play a minor role in the animal-to-human transmission cycle of the pathogen.	0
Title: Three unlinked gene clusters are involved in clavam metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: In Streptomyces clavuligerus, three groups of genes are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of the clavam metabolites. Since antibiotic biosynthetic genes are invariably clustered on the chromosome in prokaryotes, chromosome walking was undertaken in an attempt to show that the three groups of clavam genes would resolve into a single super-cluster when analyzed at larger scale. However, no evidence of linkage between the three groups was obtained. Furthermore, Southern analysis of macro-restriction fragments of genomic DNA separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis also indicated that the three groups of genes are not linked. Despite the structural and biosynthetic relatedness of the clavam metabolites, our results suggest that the genes involved in their production lie in three unlinked gene clusters. We believe that this represents the first instance in bacteria of genes involved in the biosynthesis of a single family of antibiotics sharing a common biosynthetic pathway and yet residing in three separate locations on the chromosome.	1
Title: Probing the substrate specificity of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II by use of synthetic oligosaccharides and a catalytic nucleophile mutant Abstract: Inhibition of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GMII), which acts late in the N-glycan processing pathway, provides a route to blocking cancer-induced changes in cell surface oligosaccharide structures. To probe the substrate requirements of GMII, oligosaccharides were synthesized that contained an alpha(1,3)- or alpha(1,6)-linked 1-thiomannoside. Surprisingly, these oligosaccharides were not observed in X-ray crystal structures of native Drosophila GMII (dGMII). However, a mutant enzyme in which the catalytic nucleophilic aspartate was changed to alanine (D204A) allowed visualization of soaked oligosaccharides and led to the identification of the binding site for the alpha(1,3)-linked mannoside of the natural substrate. These studies also indicate that the conformational change of the bound mannoside to a high-energy B 2,5 conformation is facilitated by steric hindrance from, and the formation of strong hydrogen bonds to, Asp204. The observation that 1-thio-linked mannosides are not well tolerated by the catalytic site of dGMII led to the synthesis of a pentasaccharide containing the alpha(1,6)-linked Man of the natural substrate and the beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc moiety proposed to be accommodated by the extended binding site of the enzyme. A cocrystal structure of this compound with the D204A enzyme revealed the molecular interactions with the beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc. The structure is consistent with the approximately 80-fold preference of dGMII for the cleavage of substrates containing a nonreducing beta(1,2)-linked GlcNAc. By contrast, the lysosomal mannosidase lacks an equivalent GlcNAc binding site and kinetic analysis indicates oligomannoside substrates without non-reducing-terminal GlcNAc modifications are preferred, suggesting that selective inhibitors for GMII could exploit the additional binding specificity of the GlcNAc binding site.	0
Title: Practical Synthesis of Amides via Copper/ABNO-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Alcohols and Amines Abstract: A modular Cu/ABNO catalyst system has been identified that enables efficient aerobic oxidative coupling of alcohols and amines to amides. All four permutations of benzylic/aliphatic alcohols and primary/secondary amines are viable in this reaction, enabling broad access to secondary and tertiary amides. The reactions exhibit excellent functional group compatibility and are complete within 30 min-3 h at rt. All components of the catalyst system are commercially available.	0
Title: Biomechanics of conidial dispersal in the toxic mold Stachybotrys chartarum Abstract: Conidial dispersal in Stachybotrys chartarum in response to low-velocity airflow was studied using a microflow apparatus. The maximum rate of spore release occurred during the first 5 min of airflow, followed by a dramatic reduction in dispersal that left more than 99% of the conidia attached to their conidiophores. Micromanipulation of undisturbed colonies showed that micronewton (microN) forces were needed to dislodge spore clusters from their supporting conidiophores. Calculations show that airspeeds that normally prevail in the indoor environment disturb colonies with forces that are 1000-fold lower, in the nanonewton (nN) range. Low-velocity airflow does not, therefore, cause sufficient disturbance to disperse a large proportion of the conidia of S. chartarum.	0
Title: Novel parameter describing restriction endonucleases: Secondary-Cognate-Specificity and chemical stimulation of TsoI leading to substrate specificity change Abstract: Over 470 prototype Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) are currently known. Most recognise specific DNA sequences 4-8 bp long, with very few exceptions cleaving DNA more frequently. TsoI is a thermostable Type IIC enzyme that recognises the DNA sequence TARCCA (R = A or G) and cleaves downstream at N11/N9. The enzyme exhibits extensive top-strand nicking of the supercoiled single-site DNA substrate. The second DNA strand of such substrate is specifically cleaved only in the presence of duplex oligonucleotides containing a cognate site. We have previously shown that some Type IIC/IIG/IIS enzymes from the Thermus-family exhibit 'affinity star' activity, which can be induced by the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) cofactor analogue-sinefungin (SIN). Here, we define a novel type of inherently built-in 'star' activity, exemplified by TsoI. The TsoI 'star' activity cannot be described under the definition of the classic 'star' activity as it is independent of the reaction conditions used and cannot be separated from the cognate specificity. Therefore, we define this phenomenon as Secondary-Cognate-Specificity (SCS). The TsoI SCS comprises several degenerated variants of the cognate site. Although the efficiency of TsoI SCS cleavage is lower in comparison to the cognate TsoI recognition sequence, it can be stimulated by S-adenosyl-L-cysteine (SAC). We present a new route for the chemical synthesis of SAC. The TsoI/SAC REase may serve as a novel tool for DNA manipulation.	0
Title: A propofol binding site on mammalian GABAA receptors identified by photolabeling Abstract: Propofol is the most important intravenous general anesthetic in current clinical use. It acts by potentiating GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, but where it binds to this receptor is not known and has been a matter of some debate. We synthesized a new propofol analog photolabeling reagent whose biological activity is very similar to that of propofol. We confirmed that this reagent labeled known propofol binding sites in human serum albumin that have been identified using X-ray crystallography. Using a combination of protiated and deuterated versions of the reagent to label mammalian receptors in intact membranes, we identified a new binding site for propofol in GABAA receptors consisting of both β3 homopentamers and α1β3 heteropentamers. The binding site is located within the β subunit at the interface between the transmembrane domains and the extracellular domain and lies close to known determinants of anesthetic sensitivity in the transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2.	0
Title: Analysis of an inactive cyanobactin biosynthetic gene cluster leads to discovery of new natural products from strains of the genus Microcystis Abstract: Cyanobactins are cyclic peptides assembled through the cleavage and modification of short precursor proteins. An inactive cyanobactin gene cluster has been described from the genome Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843. Here we report the discovery of active counterparts in strains of the genus Microcystis guided by this silent cyanobactin gene cluster. The end products of the gene clusters were structurally diverse cyclic peptides, which we named piricyclamides. Some of the piricyclamides consisted solely of proteinogenic amino acids while others contained disulfide bridges and some were prenylated or geranylated. The piricyclamide gene clusters encoded between 1 and 4 precursor genes. They encoded highly diverse core peptides ranging in length from 7-17 amino acids with just a single conserved amino acid. Heterologous expression of the pir gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7005 in Escherichia coli confirmed that this gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of piricyclamides. Chemical analysis demonstrated that Microcystis strains could produce an array of piricyclamides some of which are geranylated or prenylated. The genetic diversity of piricyclamides in a bloom sample was explored and 19 different piricyclamide precursor genes were found. This study provides evidence for a stunning array of piricyclamides in Microcystis, a worldwide occurring bloom forming cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Sequence analysis and biochemical characterization of the nostopeptolide A biosynthetic gene cluster from Nostoc sp. GSV224 Abstract: The cloning, sequencing, annotation and biochemical analysis of the nostopeptolide (nos) biosynthetic gene cluster from the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. GSV224 is described. Nostopeptolides A1 and A2 are cyclic peptide-polyketide hybrid natural products possessing nine amino acid residues, a butyric acid group, and an internal acetate-derived unit that are linked by peptide and ester bonds. The nos gene cluster includes eight ORFs encompassing 40 kb and includes most of the genes predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis and transport of this group of nonapeptolides. The genetic architecture and domain organization of the nos synthetase, a mixed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase, is co-linear in arrangement with respect to the putative order of the biosynthetic assembly of the lipopeptolide. Biochemical analysis of the NosA1, NosC1 and NosD1 adenylation domains coupled with the recent characterization of the nosE and nosF gene products, which are involved in the biosynthesis of the rare non-proteinogenic amino acid residue L-4-methylproline from L-leucine, support the involvement of this gene cluster in nostopeptolide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus gene cluster coding for staphyloferrin A Abstract: Siderophores are key virulence factors that allow bacteria to grow in iron-restricted environments. The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce four siderophores for which genetic and/or structural data are unknown. Here we characterize the gene cluster responsible for producing the prevalent siderophore staphyloferrin A. In addition to expressing the cluster in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, which confers the ability to synthesize the siderophore, we reconstituted staphyloferrin A biosynthesis in vitro by expressing and purifying two key enzymes in the pathway. As with other polycarboxylate siderophores, staphyloferrin A is biosynthesized using the recently described nonribosomal peptide synthetase independent siderophore (NIS) biosynthetic pathway. Two NIS synthetases condense two molecules of citric acid to d-ornithine in a stepwise ordered process with SfnaD using the delta-amine as a nucleophile to form the first amide followed by SfnaB utilizing the alpha-amine to complete staphyloferrin A synthesis.	1
Title: Chromobacterium violaceum: a review of pharmacological and industiral perspectives Abstract: Violet-pigmented bacteria, which have been described since the end of the 19th century, are occasionally the causative agent of septicemia and sometimes cause fatal infection in human and animals. Bacteria, producing violet colonies due to the production of a nondiffusible pigment violacein, were classified as a redefined genus Chromobacterium. Chromobacterium violaceum is gram-negative, and saprophyte from soil and water is normally considered nonpathogenic to human, but is an opportunistic pathogen of extreme virulence for human and animals. The biosynthesis and biological activities of violacein and the diverse effects of this pigment have been studied. Besides violacein, C. violaceum produces other antibiotics, such as aerocyanidin and aerocavin, which exhibit in vitro activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. 3,6-Dihydroxyindoxazene and Y-TO678h exhibit a selective activity against gram-negative bacteria. Arphamenine A and B, and FR901228, that enhanced immunoresponse, and potentiators of beta-lactam antibiotics and chelators such as ferrioxamine exhibit important clinical potential applications. Lipopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyesters together with several enzymes appear as important metabolites with biotechnological applications. Many of these metabolites were already studied at the genome level.	1
Title: Activity-based profiling of retaining β-glucosidases: a comparative study Abstract: Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a versatile strategy to report on enzyme activity in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. The development and use of ABPP tools and techniques has met with considerable success in monitoring physiological processes involving esterases and proteases. Activity-based profiling of glycosidases, on the other hand, has proven more difficult, and to date no broad-spectrum glycosidase activity-based probes (ABPs) have been reported. In a comparative study, we investigated both 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosides and cyclitol epoxides for their utility as a starting point towards retaining β-glucosidase ABP. We also investigated the merits of direct labeling and two-step bio-orthogonal labeling in reporting on glucosidase activity under various conditions. Our results demonstrate that 1) in general cyclitol epoxides are the superior glucosidase ABPs, 2) that direct labeling is the more efficient approach but it hinges on the ability of the glucosidase to be accommodated in the active site of the reporter (BODIPY) entity, and 3) that two-step bio-orthogonal labeling can be achieved on isolated enzymes but translating this protocol to cell extracts requires more investigation.	0
Title: A multiplex oligonucleotide ligation-PCR as a complementary tool for subtyping of Salmonella Typhimurium Abstract: Subtyping below the serovar level is essential for surveillance and outbreak detection and investigation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and its monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:- (S. 1,4,[5],12:i:-), frequent causes of foodborne infections. In an attempt to overcome the intrinsic shortcomings of currently used subtyping techniques, a multiplex oligonucleotide ligation-PCR (MOL-PCR) assay was developed which combines different types of molecular markers in a high-throughput microsphere suspension array. The 52 molecular markers include prophage genes, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) elements, Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), allantoinase gene allB, MLVA locus STTR10, antibiotic resistance genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phase 2 flagellar gene fljB. The in vitro stability of these markers was confirmed in a serial passage experiment. The validation of the MOL-PCR assay for subtyping of S. Typhimurium and S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- on 519 isolates shows that the method is rapid, reproducible, flexible, accessible, easy to use and relatively inexpensive. Additionally, a 100 % typeability and a discriminatory power equivalent to that of phage typing were observed, and epidemiological concordance was assessed on isolates of 2 different outbreaks. Furthermore, a data analysis method is provided so that the MOL-PCR assay allows for objective, computerised data analysis and data interpretation of which the results can be easily exchanged between different laboratories in an international surveillance network.	0
Title: Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of pectinase genes of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Abstract: Genes coding for an endo-pectate lyase, an exo-pectate lyase, and an endopolygalacturonase of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Ecc71 were cloned in Escherichia coli HB101, using the cosmid pHC79. The products of the cloned pectinase genes paralleled their counterparts in strain Ecc71 in isoelectric mobility, mode of substrate degradation, and ability to macerate potato tuber tissue.	0
Title: Essential role of the iron-regulated outer membrane receptor FauA in alcaligin siderophore-mediated iron uptake in Bordetella species Abstract: Phenotypic analysis using heterologous host systems localized putative Bordetella pertussis ferric alcaligin transport genes and Fur-binding sequences to a 3.8-kb genetic region downstream from the alcR regulator gene. Nucleotide sequencing identified a TonB-dependent receptor family homolog gene, fauA, predicted to encode a polypeptide with high amino acid sequence similarity with known bacterial ferric siderophore receptors. In Escherichia coli, the fauA genes of both B. pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica directed the production of a 79-kDa polypeptide, approximating the predicted size of the mature FauA protein. B. bronchiseptica fauA insertion mutant BRM17 was unable to utilize ferric alcaligin, and in complementation analyses ferric alcaligin utilization was restored to this mutant by supplying the wild-type fauA gene in trans. Mutant BRM18, carrying a nonpolar in-frame fauA deletion mutation, was defective in ferric alcaligin utilization and (55)Fe-ferric alcaligin uptake and no longer produced a 79-kDa iron-regulated outer membrane protein. In complementation analyses, BRM18 merodiploids bearing the wild-type fauA gene in trans regained ferric alcaligin siderophore transport and utilization functions and produced the 79-kDa protein. Analysis of a plasmid-borne fauA-lacZ operon fusion confirmed that fauA is subject to iron regulation at the transcriptional level and that cis-acting transcriptional control elements mediating fauA iron repressibility reside within the 3.8-kb PstI fauA DNA region. Moreover, expression of the fauA-lacZ fusion gene under iron starvation conditions was shown to be alcR dependent. FauA is a 79-kDa iron-regulated outer membrane receptor protein required for transport and utilization of ferric alcaligin siderophore complexes by Bordetella species.	1
Title: Fusarium graminearum PKS14 is involved in orsellinic acid and orcinol synthesis Abstract: The available genome sequences show that the number of secondary metabolite genes in filamentous fungi vastly exceeds the number of known products. This is also true for the global plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum, which contains 15 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, of which only 6 have been linked to products. To help remedy this, we focused on PKS14, which has only been shown to be expressed during plant infections or when cultivated on rice or corn meal (RM) based media. To enhance the production of the resulting product we introduced a constitutive promoter in front of PKS14 and cultivated two of the resulting mutants on RM medium. This led to the production of two compounds, which were only detected in the PKS14 overexpressing mutants and not in the wild type or PKS14 deletion mutants. The two compounds were tentatively identified as orsellinic acid and orcinol by comparing spectroscopic data (mass spectroscopy and chromatography) to authentic standards. NMR analysis of putative orcinol isolated from the PKS14 overexpressing mutant supported our identification. Orcinol and orsellinic acid, not previously detected in Fusarium, have primarily been detected in lichen fungi. Orsellinic acid is hypothesized to be the PKS release product which is transformed to orcinol through decarboxylation. Phylogenetic analyses of PKSs placed PKS14 in a subclade of known OA synthases. Expression analysis by microarray of 55 experiments identified seven genes near PKS14 that were expressed in a similar manner. One of the seven genes encodes a predicted carboxylase, which could be responsible for transforming orsellinic acid to orcinol.	1
Title: Skn1 and Ipt1 negatively regulate autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: We demonstrated that a yeast deletion mutant in IPT1 and SKN1, encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of mannosyldiinositolphosphoryl ceramides, is characterized by increased autophagy and DNA fragmentation upon nitrogen (N) starvation as compared with the single deletion mutants or wild type (WT). Apoptotic features were not significantly different between single and double deletion mutants upon N starvation, pointing to increased autophagy in the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant independent of apoptosis. We observed increased basal levels of phytosphingosine in membranes of the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant as compared with the single deletion mutants or WT. These data point to a negative regulation of autophagy by both Ipt1 and Skn1 in yeast, with a putative involvement of phytosphingosine in this process.	0
Title: Magnaporthe grisea avirulence gene ACE1 belongs to an infection-specific gene cluster involved in secondary metabolism Abstract: The avirulence gene ACE1 from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea encodes a polyketide synthase (PKS) fused to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) probably involved in the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite recognized by Pi33 resistant rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars. Analysis of the M. grisea genome revealed that ACE1 is located in a cluster of 15 genes, of which 14 are potentially involved in secondary metabolism as they encode enzymes such as a second PKS-NRPS (SYN2), two enoyl reductases (RAP1 and RAP2) and a putative Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) transcription factor (BC2). These 15 genes are specifically expressed during penetration into the host plant, defining an infection-specific gene cluster. A pORF3-GFP transcriptional fusion showed that the highly expressed ORF3 gene from the ACE1 cluster is only expressed in appressoria, as is ACE1. Phenotypic analysis of deletion or disruption mutants of SYN2 and RAP2 showed that they are not required for avirulence in Pi33 rice cultivars, unlike ACE1. Inactivation of other genes was unsuccessful because targeted gene replacement and disruption were inefficient at this locus. Overall, the ACE1 gene cluster displays an infection-specific expression pattern restricted to the penetration stage which is probably controlled at the transcriptional level and reflects regulatory networks specific to early stages of infection.	1
Title: Dedicated ent-kaurene and ent-atiserene synthases for platensimycin and platencin biosynthesis Abstract: Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising drug leads for both antibacterial and antidiabetic therapies. Comparative analysis of the PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries in Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and MA7339 revealed that the divergence of PTM and PTN biosynthesis is controlled by dedicated ent-kaurene and ent-atiserene synthases, the latter of which represents a new pathway for diterpenoid biosynthesis. The PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries provide a rare glimpse at how secondary metabolic pathway evolution increases natural product structural diversity and support the wisdom of applying combinatorial biosynthesis methods for the generation of novel PTM and/or PTN analogues, thereby facilitating drug development efforts based on these privileged natural product scaffolds.	1
Title: Genomics of glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium abscessus and M. chelonae Abstract: Background:                       The outermost layer of the bacterial surface is of crucial importance because it is in constant interaction with the host. Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are major surface glycolipids present on various mycobacterial species. In the fast-grower model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis, GPL biosynthesis involves approximately 30 genes all mapping to a single region of 65 kb.                  Results:                       We have recently sequenced the complete genomes of two fast-growers causing human infections, Mycobacterium abscessus (CIP 104536T) and M. chelonae (CIP 104535T). We show here that these two species contain genes corresponding to all those of the M. smegmatis "GPL locus", with extensive conservation of the predicted protein sequences consistent with the production of GPL molecules indistinguishable by biochemical analysis. However, the GPL locus appears to be split into several parts in M. chelonae and M. abscessus. One large cluster (19 genes) comprises all genes involved in the synthesis of the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the lipopeptide and methylation/acetylation modifications. We provide evidence that a duplicated acetyltransferase (atf1 and atf2) in M. abscessus and M. chelonae has evolved through specialization, being able to transfer one acetyl at once in a sequential manner. There is a second smaller and distant (M. chelonae, 900 kb; M. abscessus, 3 Mb) cluster of six genes involved in the synthesis of the fatty acyl moiety and its attachment to the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety. The other genes are scattered throughout the genome, including two genes encoding putative regulatory proteins.                  Conclusion:                       Although these three species produce identical GPL molecules, the organization of GPL genes differ between them, thus constituting species-specific signatures. An hypothesis is that the compact organization of the GPL locus in M. smegmatis represents the ancestral form and that evolution has scattered various pieces throughout the genome in M. abscessus and M. chelonae.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and characterization of an ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: Cloning of genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs) has allowed us to identify a gene cluster for ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. Like lovastatin, which is produced by Aspergillus terreus, ML-236B (compactin) inhibits the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Genomic sequencing and Northern analysis showed that nine predicted genes for ML-236B biosynthesis were located within a 38-kb region and were transcribed when ML-236B was produced. The predicted amino acid sequences encoded by these nine genes, designated mlcA- mlcH and mlcR, were similar to those encoded by the genes for lovastatin synthesis, and were therefore assumed to be involved either directly or indirectly in ML-236B biosynthesis. Targeted disruption experiments provided evidence that two PKS genes in the cluster, mlcA and mlcB, are required for the biosynthesis of the nonaketide and the diketide moieties, respectively, of ML-236B, suggesting that the gene cluster as a whole is responsible for ML-236B biosynthesis in P. citrinum. Bioconversion of some of the predicted intermediates by an mlcA-disrupted mutant was also investigated in order to analyze the ML-236B biosynthetic pathway. The molecular organization of the gene cluster and proposed functions for the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in P. citrinum are described.	1
Title: Two aerobic pathways for the formation of unsaturated fatty acids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The double bond in anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis is introduced by the FabA dehydratase/isomerase of the bacterial type II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. A DeltafabA mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew aerobically, but required a UFA supplement for anaerobic growth. Wild-type cells produced 18:1Delta11 as the principal UFA, whereas the DeltafabA strain produced only 16:1Delta9. The double bond in the 16:1Delta9 was introduced after phospholipid formation and was localized in the sn-2 position. Two predicted membrane proteins, DesA and DesB, possessed the conserved histidine clusters characteristic of fatty acid desaturases. The DeltafabADeltadesA double mutant required exogenous fatty acids for growth but the DeltafabAdesB double mutant did not. Exogenous stearate was converted to 18:1Delta9 and supported the growth of DeltafabADeltadesA double mutant. A DeltafabADeltadesAdesB triple mutant was unable to desaturate exogenous stearate and was an UFA auxotroph. We detected a 2.5-fold increase in desA expression in DeltafabA mutants, whereas desB expression was derepressed by the deletion of the gene encoding a transcriptional repressor DesT. These data add two aerobic desaturases to the enzymes used for fatty acid metabolism in proteobacteria: DesA, a 2-position phospholipid Delta9-desaturase that supplements the anaerobic FabA pathway, and DesB, an inducible acyl-CoA Delta9-desaturase whose expression is repressed by DesT.	0
Title: The leader peptide of colicin V shares consensus sequences with leader peptides that are common among peptide bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria Abstract: Colicin V is a ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptide produced by Escherichia coli. Four recently characterized genes, arranged in two convergent operons on the plasmid pCoIV-K30, are required for colicin V synthesis, export and immunity. We report the purification and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the colicin V protein. Our results demonstrate that the colicin V primary translation product, which consists of 103 amino acids, is proteolytically processed. A leader peptide, consisting of 15 amino acid residues, is removed from the N-terminus during maturation of colicin V. This leader peptide is not related to the N-terminal signal sequences which direct proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane via the Sec pathway. The molecular mass of colicin V, obtained by mass spectrometry analysis, showed that the peptide consists of only unmodified amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the leader peptide was highly homologous to the N-terminal extensions found in non-lantibiotic, peptide bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria. These findings strongly indicate that colicin V belongs to a family of small peptide bacteriocins that have been found previously only among the Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria.	1
Title: Multifactorial induction of an orphan PKS-NRPS gene cluster in Aspergillus terreus Abstract: Mining the genome of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus terreus revealed the presence of an orphan polyketide-nonribosomal-peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) gene cluster. Induced expression of the transcriptional activator gene adjacent to the PKS-NRPS gene was not sufficient for the activation of the silent pathway. Monitoring gene expression, metabolic profiling, and using a lacZ reporter strain allowed for the systematic investigation of physiological conditions that eventually led to the discovery of isoflavipucine and dihydroisoflavipucine. Phytotoxin formation is only activated in the presence of certain amino acids, stimulated at alkaline pH, but strictly repressed in the presence of glucose. Global carbon catabolite repression by CreA cannot be abolished by positive-acting factors such as PacC and overrides the pathway activator. Gene inactivation and stable isotope labeling experiments unveiled the molecular basis for flavipucine/fruit rot toxin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Cloning and insertional inactivation of Streptomyces argillaceus genes involved in the earliest steps of biosynthesis of the sugar moieties of the antitumor polyketide mithramycin Abstract: Two genes (mtmD and mtmE) were cloned and sequenced from the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus. Comparison with proteins in databases and enzymatic assays after expression in Escherichia coli showed that they encode a glucose-1-phosphate:TTP thymidylyl transferase and a TDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, respectively. The mtmD gene was inactivated by gene replacement, generating a nonproducing mutant that accumulates a tetracyclic compound designated premithramycinone. The identification of premithramycinone reveals new aspects of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway and suggests that at least some glycosylations occur before breakage of the fourth ring.	1
Title: Migrastatin and a new compound, isomigrastatin, from Streptomyces platensis Abstract: Streptomyces platensis (strain NRRL 18993), a producer of dorrigocins, was shown to produce migrastatin, a cyclic congener of dorrigocin A previously reported from a different organism. Additionally a new compound isomeric to migrastatin, isomigrastatin, was also isolated and its structure was determined to be a cyclic form of dorrigocin B. Both compounds were fully characterized from MS and NMR data. Product titers of both were improved by the addition of XAD-16 resin to the fermentation medium.	1
Title: Structure elucidation of DNA-protein crosslinks by using reductive desulfurization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry Abstract: Easier with ethyl: Guengerich and co-workers have developed a powerful new approach to the structure elucidation of hydrolytically stable AGT-DNA crosslinks by reductive desulfurization of the thioether linkage between AGT and DNA to convert cysteine DPCs to the corresponding ethyl-DNA adducts, which can be readily characterized by LC-MSn.	0
Title: Discovery of a new source of rifamycin antibiotics in marine sponge actinobacteria by phylogenetic prediction Abstract: Phylogenetic analysis of the ketosynthase (KS) gene sequences of marine sponge-derived Salinispora strains of actinobacteria indicated that the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene sequence most closely related to that of Salinispora was the rifamycin B synthase of Amycolatopsis mediterranei. This result was not expected from taxonomic species tree phylogenetics using 16S rRNA sequences. From the PKS sequence data generated from our sponge-derived Salinispora strains, we predicted that such strains might synthesize rifamycin-like compounds. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis was applied to one sponge-derived Salinispora strain to test the hypothesis of rifamycin synthesis. The analysis reported here demonstrates that this Salinispora isolate does produce compounds of the rifamycin class, including rifamycin B and rifamycin SV. A rifamycin-specific KS primer set was designed, and that primer set increased the number of rifamycin-positive strains detected by PCR screening relative to the number detectable using a conserved KS-specific set. Thus, the Salinispora group of actinobacteria represents a potential new source of rifamycins outside the genus Amycolatopsis and the first recorded source of rifamycins from marine bacteria.	1
Title: Plasmid- and chromosome-mediated dissimilation of naphthalene and salicylate in Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 dissimilates naphthalene (Nah), salicylate (Sal), and benzoate (Ben) via catechol which is metabolized through the meta (or alpha-keto acid) pathway. The ability to utilize salicylate but not naphthalene was transferred from P. putida PMD-1 to several Pseudomonas species. Agarose gel electrophoresis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from PMD-1 and Sal+ exconjugants indicated that a plasmid (pMWD-1) of 110 megadaltons is correlated with the Sal+ phenotype; restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from Sal+ exconjugants indicated that plasmid pMWD-1 was transmitted intact. Enzyme analysis of Sal+ exconjugants demonstrated that the enzymes required to oxidize naphthalene to salicylate are absent, but salicylate hydroxylase and enzymes of the meta pathway are present. Thus, naphthalene conversion to salicylate requires chromosomal genes, whereas salicylate degradation is plasmid encoded. Comparison of restriction digests of plasmid pMWD-1 indicated that it differs considerably from the naphthalene and salicylate degradative plasmids previously described in P. putida.	0
Title: Genomic Insights into Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Producing Shewanella sp. N2AIL from Fish Gut Abstract: The genus Shewanella is widely distributed in niches ranging from an aquatic environment to spoiled fish and is loaded with various ecologically and commercially important metabolites. Bacterial species under this genus find application in bioelectricity generation and bioremediation due to their capability to use pollutants as the terminal electron acceptor and could produce health-beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Here, the genome sequence of an EPA-producing bacterium, Shewanella sp. N2AIL, isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of Tilapia fish, is reported. The genome size of the strain was 4.8 Mb with a GC content of 46.3% containing 4385 protein-coding genes. Taxonogenomic analysis assigned this strain to the genus Shewanella on the basis of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), phylogenetically most closely related with S. baltica NCTC 10735T. The comparative genome analysis with the type strain of S. baltica revealed 693 unique genes in the strain N2AIL, highlighting the variation at the strain level. The genes associated with stress adaptation, secondary metabolite production, antibiotic resistance, and metal reduction were identified in the genome suggesting the potential of the bacterium to be explored as an industrially important strain. PUFA synthase gene cluster of size ~20.5 kb comprising all the essential domains for EPA biosynthesis arranged in five ORFs was also identified in the strain N2AIL. The study provides genomic insights into the diverse genes of Shewanella sp. N2AIL, which is particularly involved in adaptation strategies and prospecting secondary metabolite potential, specifically the biosynthesis of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	1
Title: In vivo manipulation of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 revealing new insights into its biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Bleomycin (BLM), an important clinically used antitumor compound, and its analogs are challenging to prepare by chemical synthesis. Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds.	1
Title: Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis Abstract: A revised structure of natural 14-mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid-phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell-based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90 %) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin-1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.	1
Title: Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in different regions: a meta-analysis Abstract: Background:                       To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance in different regions, a meta-analysis was carried out.                  Methods:                       Several databases were searched for relevant studies up to March 3, 2019. A bivariate random-effects model was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy.                  Results:                       We identified 97 studies involving 26,037 samples for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection were 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.95), 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99), respectively. For different regions, the pooled sensitivity were 0.94(95% CI 0.89-0.97) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-1.00) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high and middle/low income countries, respectively. The pooled sensitivity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high TB burden and middle/low prevalence countries, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection was excellent.	0
Title: Target-selective phototherapy using a ligand-based photosensitizer for type 2 cannabinoid receptor Abstract: Phototherapy is a powerful, noninvasive approach for cancer treatment, with several agents currently in clinical use. Despite the progress and promise, most current phototherapy agents have serious side effects as they can lead to damage to healthy tissue, even when the photosensitizers are fused to targeting molecules due to nonspecific light activation of the unbound photosensitizer. To overcome these limitations, we developed a phototherapy agent that combines a functional ligand and a near infrared phthalocyanine dye. Our target is type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R), considered an attractive therapeutic target for phototherapy given it is overexpressed by many types of cancers that are located at a surface or can be reached by an endoscope. We show that our CB2R-targeted phototherapy agent, IR700DX-mbc94, is specific for CB2R and effective only when bound to the target receptor. Overall, this opens up the opportunity for development of an alternative treatment option for CB2R-positive cancers.	0
Title: "Click, click, cyclize": a DOS approach to sultams utilizing vinyl sulfonamide linchpins Abstract: A diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) strategy termed "Click, Click, Cyclize" is reported. This approach relies on functional group (FG) pairing between a vinyl sulfonamide and an array of functional groups to synthesize skeletally diverse sultams. Several FG pairing pathways on central tertiary vinyl sulfonamide linchpins have been developed including intramolecular Heck, aza-Michael, ring-closing enyne metathesis, Pauson-Khand, and chemoselective oxidation/Baylis-Hillman reactions.	0
Title: Expression and characterization of the type III polyketide synthase 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Sequence analysis of the metabolically rich 8.7-Mbp genome of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed three genes encoding predicted type III polyketide synthases (PKSs). We report the inactivation, expression, and characterization of the type III PKS homologous SCO1206 gene product as 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase (THNS). Incubation of recombinant THNS with malonyl-CoA showed THN production, as demonstrated by UV and HPLC analyses. The K(m) value for malonyl-CoA and the k(cat) value for THN synthesis were determined spectrophotometrically to be 3.58+/-0.85 micro M and 0.48+/-0.03 min(-1), respectively. The C-terminal region of S. coelicolor THNS, which is longer than most other bacterial and plant type III PKSs, was shortened by 25 amino acid residues and the resulting mutant was shown to be slightly more active (K(m)=1.97+/-0.19 micro M, k(cat)=0.75+/-0.04 min(-1)) than the wild-type enzyme.	1
Title: Orthogonal ubiquitin transfer through engineered E1-E2 cascades for protein ubiquitination Abstract: Protein modification by ubiquitin (UB) controls diverse cellular processes. UB is conjugated to cellular proteins by sequential transfer through an E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade. The cross-activities of 2 E1s, 50 E2s and thousands of E3s encoded by the human genome make it difficult to identify the substrate proteins of a specific E3 enzyme in the cell. One way to solve this problem is to engineer an orthogonal UB transfer (OUT) cascade in which the engineered UB (xUB) is relayed by engineered E1, E2 and E3 enzymes (xE1, xE2, xE3) to modify the substrate proteins of a specific E3. Here, we use phage display and mutagenesis to construct xUB-xE1 and xE1-xE2 pairs that are orthogonal to the native E1 and E2 enzymes. Our work on engineering the UB transfer cascades will enable us to use OUT to map the signal transduction networks mediated by protein ubiquitination.	0
Title: Expression of ustR and the Golgi protease KexB are required for ustiloxin B biosynthesis in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Ustiloxin B, originally isolated from the fungus Ustilaginoidea virens, is a known inhibitor of microtubule assembly. Ustiloxin B is also produced by Aspergillus flavus and is synthesized through the ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway. In A. flavus, the gene cluster associated with ustiloxin B production contains 15 genes including those encoding a fungal C6-type transcription factor and ustiloxin B precursor. Although the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae, which is genetically close to A. flavus, has the corresponding gene cluster, it does not produce ustiloxin B, which may be explained by the fact that the gene encoding the transcription factor UstR is not expressed. Here, to investigate whether ustiloxin B can be produced by expressing ustR in A. oryzae, we constructed ustR expression (ustR (EX)) strains and analyzed ustiloxin B production. In the ustR (EX) strains, all genes in the cluster were up-regulated, in line with expression of ustR, and ustiloxin B produced. To elucidate whether the KexB protease is involved in the processing of the ustiloxin B precursor protein UstA, which has repeats of basic amino acid doublets resembling KexB target sites, we also constructed a ustR (EX) strain with the ∆kexB genotype. Although ustR was expressed in this strain, ustiloxin B was barely detectable. This finding strongly suggests that KexB is required for ustiloxin B production.	1
Title: Crystal structure of the ECH2 catalytic domain of CurF from Lyngbya majuscula. Insights into a decarboxylase involved in polyketide chain beta-branching Abstract: Curacin A is a mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptide possessing anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative activity. In the biosynthesis of curacin A, the N-terminal domain of the CurF multifunctional protein catalyzes decarboxylation of 3-methylglutaconyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP, the postulated precursor of the cyclopropane ring of curacin A. This decarboxylase is encoded within an "HCS cassette" that is used by several other polyketide biosynthetic systems to generate chemical diversity by introduction of a beta-branch functional group to the natural product. The crystal structure of the CurF N-terminal ECH(2) domain establishes that the protein is a crotonase superfamily member. Ala(78) and Gly(118) form an oxyanion hole in the active site that includes only three polar side chains as potential catalytic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and a biochemical assay established critical functions for His(240) and Lys(86), whereas Tyr(82) was nonessential. A decarboxylation mechanism is proposed in which His(240) serves to stabilize the substrate carboxylate and Lys(86) donates a proton to C-4 of the acyl-ACP enolate intermediate to form the Delta(2) unsaturated isopentenoyl-ACP product. The CurF ECH(2) domain showed a 20-fold selectivity for ACP-over CoA-linked substrates. Specificity for ACP-linked substrates has not been reported for any other crotonase superfamily decarboxylase. Tyr(73) may select against CoA-linked substrates by blocking a contact of Arg(38) with the CoA adenosine 5'-phosphate.	1
Title: Asymmetric Reduction of (R)-Carvone through a Thermostable and Organic-Solvent-Tolerant Ene-Reductase Abstract: Ene-reductases allow regio- and stereoselective reduction of activated C=C double bonds at the expense of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactors [NAD(P)H]. Biological NAD(P)H can be replaced by synthetic mimics to facilitate enzyme screening and process optimization. The ene-reductase FOYE-1, originating from an acidophilic iron oxidizer, has been described as a promising candidate and is now being explored for applied biocatalysis. Biological and synthetic nicotinamide cofactors were evaluated to fuel FOYE-1 to produce valuable compounds. A maximum activity of (319.7±3.2) U mg-1 with NADPH or of (206.7±3.4) U mg-1 with 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) for the reduction of N-methylmaleimide was observed at 30 °C. Notably, BNAH was found to be a promising reductant but exhibits poor solubility in water. Different organic solvents were therefore assayed: FOYE-1 showed excellent performance in most systems with up to 20 vol% solvent and at temperatures up to 40 °C. Purification and application strategies were evaluated on a small scale to optimize the process. Finally, a 200 mL biotransformation of 750 mg (R)-carvone afforded 495 mg of (2R,5R)-dihydrocarvone (>95 % ee), demonstrating the simplicity of handling and application of FOYE-1.	0
Title: Production of D-lactic acid containing polyhydroxyalkanoate polymers in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provide biodegradable and bio-based alternatives to conventional plastics. Incorporation of 2-hydroxy acid monomers into polymer, in addition to 3-hydroxy acids, offers possibility to tailor the polymer properties. In this study, poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) and copolymer P(LA-3HB) were produced and characterized for the first time in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of engineered PHA synthase PhaC1437Ps6-19, propionyl-CoA transferase Pct540Cp, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase PhaA, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase PhaB1 resulted in accumulation of 3.6% P(LA-3HB) and expression of engineered enzymes PhaC1Pre and PctMe resulted in accumulation of 0.73% PDLA of the cell dry weight (CDW). According to NMR, P(LA-3HB) contained D-lactic acid repeating sequences. For reference, expression of PhaA, PhaB1, and PHA synthase PhaC1 resulted in accumulation 11% poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) of the CDW. Weight average molecular weights of these polymers were comparable to similar polymers produced by bacterial strains, 24.6, 6.3, and 1 130 kDa for P(LA-3HB), PDLA, and PHB, respectively. The results suggest that yeast, as a robust and acid tolerant industrial production organism, could be suitable for production of 2-hydroxy acid containing PHAs from sugars or from 2-hydroxy acid containing raw materials. Moreover, the wide substrate specificity of PHA synthase enzymes employed increases the possibilities for modifying copolymer properties in yeast in the future.	0
Title: Extended sequence and functional analysis of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus circulans SANK 72073 Abstract: Butirosin produced by Bacillus circulans is among the clinically important 2-deoxystreptamine containing aminoglycoside antibiotics and its unique structure is found in (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxyburyric acid substituted at C-1 of 2-deoxystreptamine. Recently, the key part of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified from Bacillus circulans SANK 72073, however the whole gene for the biosynthesis awaited for identification. In the present study, we undertook extended analysis of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster and found nine additional open reading flames (ORFs), btrQ, btrR1, btrR2, btrT, btrU, btrV, btrW, btrX and orf1 in the cluster. In addition, we constructed disruption mutants of btrR1 and btrP-V, and found that the btr genes (ca. 24Kb) between btrR1 and btrP-V are at least required for the butirosin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Complete Biosynthetic Pathway of Alazopeptin, a Tripeptide Consisting of Two Molecules of 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and One Molecule of Alanine Abstract: DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine), a diazo-containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60 years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala-DON-DON, which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N-acetyl-DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5-oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr-93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N-N bond formation.	1
Title: A free-standing condensation enzyme catalyzing ester bond formation in C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) catalyze the biosynthesis of many biologically active peptides and typically are modular, with each extension module minimally consisting of a condensation, an adenylation, and a peptidyl carrier protein domain responsible for incorporation of an amino acid into the growing peptide chain. C-1027 is a chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic whose enediyne chromophore consists of an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a benzoxazolinate, and a beta-amino acid moiety. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the activation and incorporation of the beta-amino acid moiety into C-1027 follows an NRPS mechanism whereby biosynthetic intermediates are tethered to the peptidyl carrier protein SgcC2. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of SgcC5, an NRPS condensation enzyme that catalyzes ester bond formation between the SgcC2-tethered (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine and (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, a mimic of the enediyne core. SgcC5 uses (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-SgcC2 as the donor substrate and exhibits regiospecificity for the C-2 hydroxyl group of the enediyne core mimic as the acceptor substrate. Remarkably, SgcC5 is also capable of catalyzing amide bond formation, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency, between (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-(S)-SgcC2 and (R)-2-amino-1-phenyl-1-ethanol, an alternative enediyne core mimic bearing an amine at its C-2 position. Thus, SgcC5 is capable of catalyzing both ester and amide bond formation, providing an evolutionary link between amide- and ester-forming condensation enzymes.	1
Title: Structural organization, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of the Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ gene Abstract: The Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ protein plays a central role in DNA metabolism, participating in general homologous recombination, recombinational (postreplication) DNA repair, and prophage induction. Although many H. influenzae rec-1 mutants have been phenotypically characterized, little is known about the rec-1+ gene at the molecular level. In this study, we present the genetic organization of the rec-1+ locus, the DNA sequence of rec-1+, and studies of the transcriptional regulation of rec-1+ during cellular assault by DNA-damaging agents and during the induction of competence for genetic transformation. Although little is known about promoter structure in H. influenzae, we identified a potential rec-1+ promoter that is identical in 11 of 12 positions to the bacterial sigma 70-dependent promoter consensus sequence. Results from a primer extension analysis revealed that the start site of rec-1+ transcription is centered 6 nucleotides downstream of this promoter. We identified potential DNA binding sites in the rec-1+ gene for LexA, integration host factor, and cyclic AMP receptor protein. We obtained evidence that at least one of the proposed cyclic AMP receptor protein binding sites is active in modulating rec-1+ transcription. This finding makes rec-1+ control circuitry novel among recA+ homologs. Two H. influenzae DNA uptake sequences that may function as a transcription termination signal were identified in inverted orientations at the end of the rec-1+ coding sequence. In addition, we report the first use of the Escherichia coli lacZ operon fusion technique in H. influenzae to study the transcriptional control of rec-1+. Our results indicate that rec-1+ is transcriptionally induced about threefold during DNA-damaging events. Furthermore, we show that rec-1+ can substitute for recA+ in E. coli to modulate SOS induction of dinB1 expression. Surprisingly, although 5% of the H. influenzae genome is in the form of single-stranded DNA during competence for genetic transformation, an event that could be a potent SOS-inducing signal, we failed to detect significant changes in rec-1+ transcription during the induction of genetic competence.	0
Title: Functional Analysis of the Fusarielin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Fusarielins are polyketides with a decalin core produced by various species of Aspergillus and Fusarium. Although the responsible gene cluster has been identified, the biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated. In the present study, members of the gene cluster were deleted individually in a Fusarium graminearum strain overexpressing the local transcription factor. The results suggest that a trans-acting enoyl reductase (FSL5) assists the polyketide synthase FSL1 in biosynthesis of a polyketide product, which is released by hydrolysis by a trans-acting thioesterase (FSL2). Deletion of the epimerase (FSL3) resulted in accumulation of an unstable compound, which could be the released product. A novel compound, named prefusarielin, accumulated in the deletion mutant of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase FSL4. Unlike the known fusarielins from Fusarium, this compound does not contain oxygenized decalin rings, suggesting that FSL4 is responsible for the oxygenation.	1
Title: Being surveyed can change later behavior and related parameter estimates Abstract: Does completing a household survey change the later behavior of those surveyed? In three field studies of health and two of microlending, we randomly assigned subjects to be surveyed about health and/or household finances and then measured subsequent use of a related product with data that does not rely on subjects' self-reports. In the three health experiments, we find that being surveyed increases use of water treatment products and take-up of medical insurance. Frequent surveys on reported diarrhea also led to biased estimates of the impact of improved source water quality. In two microlending studies, we do not find an effect of being surveyed on borrowing behavior. The results suggest that limited attention could play an important but context-dependent role in consumer choice, with the implication that researchers should reconsider whether, how, and how much to survey their subjects.	0
Title: Direct cloning and refactoring of a silent lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster yields the antibiotic taromycin A Abstract: Recent developments in next-generation sequencing technologies have brought recognition of microbial genomes as a rich resource for novel natural product discovery. However, owing to the scarcity of efficient procedures to connect genes to molecules, only a small fraction of secondary metabolomes have been investigated to date. Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning takes advantage of the natural in vivo homologous recombination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to directly capture large genomic loci. Here we report a TAR-based genetic platform that allows us to directly clone, refactor, and heterologously express a silent biosynthetic pathway to yield a new antibiotic. With this method, which involves regulatory gene remodeling, we successfully expressed a 67-kb nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster from the marine actinomycete Saccharomonospora sp. CNQ-490 and produced the dichlorinated lipopeptide antibiotic taromycin A in the model expression host Streptomyces coelicolor. The taromycin gene cluster (tar) is highly similar to the clinically approved antibiotic daptomycin from Streptomyces roseosporus, but has notable structural differences in three amino acid residues and the lipid side chain. With the activation of the tar gene cluster and production of taromycin A, this study highlights a unique "plug-and-play" approach to efficiently gaining access to orphan pathways that may open avenues for novel natural product discoveries and drug development.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of the biosynthesis of the pyrrole and carbamoyl moieties of coumermycin A1 and novobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) contains a central and two terminal pyrrole moieties. The coumermycin gene cluster in Streptomyces rishiriensis contains three genes (couN3, couN4 and couN5) that show sequence similarity to genes involved in the biosynthesis of the pyrrole moieties of pyoluteorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens and of undecylprodiginine in S. coelicolor. The gene couN3, which codes for a putative L-prolyl-S-PCP dehydrogenase, and the gene couN4, which encodes a putative L-prolyl-AMP ligase, were disrupted using in-frame deletion and insertional inactivation, respectively. HPLC analysis of culture extracts showed that formation of the two terminal pyrrole moieties was abolished in the couN3 (-) und couN4 (-) mutants. The mutants accumulated coumermycin D, which contains only the central pyrrole moiety. This result not only confirmed the involvement of couN3 and couN4 in the biosynthesis of the terminal pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moieties of coumermycin A(1), but also indicated, for the first time, that the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid unit of the coumermycins is formed by a biosynthetic pathway that differs from that used to assemble the terminal pyrrole moieties. novN, a putative carbamoyl transferase gene from the gene cluster for novobiocin biosynthesis in S. spheroides was expressed in the couN3 (-) mutant. This led to the formation of bis-carbamoylated coumermycin D, a novel compound of the coumermycin series.	1
Title: Listeria monocytogenes Strains Underrepresented during Selective Enrichment with an ISO Method Might Dominate during Passage through Simulated Gastric Fluid and In Vitro Infection of Caco-2 Cells Abstract: Various Listeria monocytogenes strains may contaminate a single food product, potentially resulting in simultaneous exposure of consumers to multiple strains. However, due to bias in strain recovery, L. monocytogenes strains isolated from foods by selective enrichment (SE) might not always represent those that can better survive the immune system of a patient. We investigated the effect of cocultivation in tryptic soy broth with 0.6% yeast extract (TSB-Y) at 10°C for 8 days on (i) the detection of L. monocytogenes strains during SE with the ISO 11290-1:1996/Amd 1:2004 protocol and (ii) the in vitro virulence of strains toward the Caco-2 human colon epithelial cancer cell line following exposure to simulated gastric fluid (SGF; pH 2.0)-HCl (37°C). We determined whether the strains which were favored by SE would be effective competitors under the conditions of challenges related to gastrointestinal passage of the pathogen. Interstrain competition of L. monocytogenes in TSB-Y determined the relative population of each strain at the beginning of SE. This in turn impacted the outcome of SE (i.e., favoring survival of competitors with better fitness) and the levels exposed subsequently to SGF. However, strong growth competitors could be outcompeted after SGF exposure and infection of Caco-2 cells by strains outgrown in TSB-Y and underdetected (or even missed) during enrichment. Our data demonstrate a preferential selection of certain L. monocytogenes strains during enrichments, often not reflecting a selective advantage of strains during infection. These findings highlight a noteworthy scenario associated with the difficulty of matching the source of infection (food) with the L. monocytogenes isolate appearing to be the causative agent during listeriosis outbreak investigations.IMPORTANCE This report is relevant to understanding the processes involved in selection and prevalence of certain L. monocytogenes strains in different environments (i.e., foods or sites of humans exposed to the pathogen). It highlights the occurrence of multiple strains in the same food as an important aspect contributing to mismatches between clinical isolates and infection sources during listeriosis outbreak investigations.	0
Title: New N-acyl taurine from the sea urchin Glyptocidaris crenularis Abstract: A new N-acyl taurine (1), together with a new natural product, l-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,2,4-triazole (4), and two known compounds (2 and 3), were isolated from the sea urchin, Glyptocidaris crenularis. The new N-acyl taurine was elucidated as 2-(5R,15S-dihydroxyeicosanoylamino) ethanesulfonic acid on the basis of spectroscopic (NMR, MS) analyses and the modified Mosher ester method. Compound 2 showed significant toxicity against brine shrimp larvae.	0
Title: Cooperative assembly of three-ring-based zeolite-type metal-organic frameworks and Johnson-type dodecahedra Abstract: Two birds with one stone One synthetic strategy led to the preparation of both 3-ring-based zeolite-type metal-organic frameworks (NPO-type) and Johnson-type metal-organic polyhedra. The strategy is based on the cooperative assembly of 4-connected indium nodes with two symmetry-complementary ligands (one serves to generate 3-rings and the other crosslinks 3-rings). Photocatalytic H2 production experiments demonstrated these NPO-zeolite compounds behave as semiconductors and exhibit photocatalytic activity for the generation of dihydrogen from water under ultraviolet irradiation.	0
Title: Expanding the genetic code for biological studies Abstract: Using an orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pair, unnatural amino acids can be genetically encoded with high efficiency and fidelity, and over 40 unnatural amino acids have been site-specifically incorporated into proteins in Escherichia coli, yeast, or mammalian cells. Novel chemical or physical properties embodied in these amino acids enable new means for tailored manipulation of proteins. This review summarizes the methodology and recent progress in expanding this technology to eukaryotic cells. Applications of genetically encoded unnatural amino acids are highlighted with reports on labeling and modifying proteins, probing protein structure and function, identifying and regulating protein activity, and generating proteins with new properties. Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids provides a powerful method for investigating a wide variety of biological processes both in vitro and in vivo.	0
Title: Conformational switch triggered by alpha-ketoglutarate in a halogenase of curacin A biosynthesis Abstract: The CurA halogenase (Hal) catalyzes a cryptic chlorination leading to cyclopropane ring formation in the synthesis of the natural product curacin A. Hal belongs to a family of enzymes that use Fe(2+), O(2) and alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) to perform a variety of halogenation reactions in natural product biosynthesis. Crystal structures of the enzyme in five ligand states reveal strikingly different open and closed conformations dependent on alphaKG binding. The open form represents ligand-free enzyme, preventing substrate from entering the active site until both alphaKG and chloride are bound, while the closed form represents the holoenzyme with alphaKG and chloride coordinated to iron. Candidate amino acid residues involved in substrate recognition were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. These new structures provide direct evidence of a conformational switch driven by alphaKG leading to chlorination of an early pathway intermediate.	1
Title: Characterization of the cereulide NRPS alpha-hydroxy acid specifying modules: activation of alpha-keto acids and chiral reduction on the assembly line Abstract: Several nonribosomal peptide natural products are composites of alpha-hydroxy acid and alpha-amino acid monomers. Cereulide, the emetic toxin from the human pathogen Bacillus cereus, and valinomycin, from Streptomyces spp., are closely related macrocyclic K+ ionophores. The macrocyclic core of each natural product contains alternating peptide (six) and ester (six) bonds, and their cyclododecadepsipeptide structures consist of a tetradepsipeptide unit repeated three times. Here we overexpress the cereulide NRPS alpha-hydroxy acid specifying modules from CesA and CesB and demonstrate that each contains an alpha-keto acid activating adenylation domain and a chiral alpha-ketoacyl-S-carrier protein reductase (alpha-KR). The logic used by the cereulide NRPS is likely at work in the valinomycin NRPS and may be the general strategy used in bacterial NRPSs to form alpha-hydroxy acid containing natural products.	1
Title: Structures of OA-6129A, B1, B2 and C, new carbapenem antibiotics produced by Streptomyces sp. OA-6129 Abstract: The chemical structures of OA-6129A, B1, B2 and C, new carbapenem antibiotics having a pantetheinyl group at C-3 were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and chemical transformation as presented in Fig. 1.	0
Title: Pathway for the Biosynthesis of the Pigment Chrysogine by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Chrysogine is a yellow pigment produced by Penicillium chrysogenum and other filamentous fungi. Although the pigment was first isolated in 1973, its biosynthetic pathway has so far not been resolved. Here, we show that deletion of the highly expressed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene Pc21g12630 (chyA) resulted in a decrease in the production of chrysogine and 13 related compounds in the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Each of the genes of the chyA-containing gene cluster was individually deleted, and corresponding mutants were examined by metabolic profiling in order to elucidate their function. The data suggest that the NRPS ChyA mediates the condensation of anthranilic acid and alanine into the intermediate 2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzoic acid, which was verified by feeding experiments of a ΔchyA strain with the chemically synthesized product. The remainder of the pathway is highly branched, yielding at least 13 chrysogine-related compounds.IMPORTANCEPenicillium chrysogenum is used in industry for the production of β-lactams, but also produces several other secondary metabolites. The yellow pigment chrysogine is one of the most abundant metabolites in the culture broth, next to β-lactams. Here, we have characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster involved in chrysogine production and elucidated a complex and highly branched biosynthetic pathway, assigning each of the chrysogine cluster genes to biosynthetic steps and metabolic intermediates. The work further unlocks the metabolic potential of filamentous fungi and the complexity of secondary metabolite pathways.	1
Title: Highly Selective Cascade C-C Bond Formation via Palladium- Catalyzed Oxidative Carbonylation-Carbocyclization-Carbonylation-Alkynylation of Enallenes Abstract: A highly efficient palladium-catalyzed oxidative cascade reaction of enallenes undergoing overall four C-C bond formations has been developed. The insertion cascade proceeds via carbonylation-carbocyclization-carbonylation-alkynylation involving sequential insertion of carbon monoxide, olefin, and carbon monoxide. Furthermore, different types of terminal alkynes and functionalized enallenes have been investigated and found to undergo the cascade reaction under mild reaction conditions.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression, Biosynthetic Studies, and Ecological Function of the Selective Gq-Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), isolated from the tropical plant Ardisia crenata, is a strong and selective inhibitor of Gq proteins, making it an indispensable pharmacological tool to study Gq-related processes, as well as a promising drug candidate. Gq inhibition is a novel mode of action for defense chemicals and crucial for the ecological function of FR, as shown by in vivo experiments in mice, its affinity to insect Gq proteins, and insect toxicity studies. The uncultured endosymbiont of A. crenata was sequenced, revealing the FR nonribosomal peptide synthetase (frs) gene cluster. We here provide a detailed model of FR biosynthesis, supported by in vitro enzymatic and bioinformatic studies, and the novel analogue AC-1, which demonstrates the flexibility of the FR starter condensation domains. Finally, expression of the frs genes in E. coli led to heterologous FR production in a cultivable, bacterial host for the first time.	1
Title: Sequence analysis of porothramycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of porothramycin, a sequence-selective DNA alkylating compound, was identified in the genome of producing strain Streptomyces albus subsp. albus (ATCC 39897) and sequentially characterized. A 39.7 kb long DNA region contains 27 putative genes, 18 of them revealing high similarity with homologous genes from biosynthetic gene cluster of closely related pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) compound anthramycin. However, considering the structures of both compounds, the number of differences in the gene composition of compared biosynthetic gene clusters was unexpectedly high, indicating participation of alternative enzymes in biosynthesis of both porothramycin precursors, anthranilate, and branched L-proline derivative. Based on the sequence analysis of putative NRPS modules Por20 and Por21, we suppose that in porothramycin biosynthesis, the methylation of anthranilate unit occurs prior to the condensation reaction, while modifications of branched proline derivative, oxidation, and dimethylation of the side chain occur on already condensed PBD core. Corresponding two specific methyltransferase encoding genes por26 and por25 were identified in the porothramycin gene cluster. Surprisingly, also methyltransferase gene por18 homologous to orf19 from anthramycin biosynthesis was detected in porothramycin gene cluster even though the appropriate biosynthetic step is missing, as suggested by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-MS) analysis of the product in the S. albus culture broth.	1
Title: Simple model of protein folding kinetics Abstract: A simple model of the kinetics of protein folding is presented. The reaction coordinate is the "correctness" of a configuration compared with the native state. The model has a gap in the energy spectrum, a large configurational entropy, a free energy barrier between folded and partially folded states, and a good thermodynamic folding transition. Folding kinetics is described by a master equation. The folding time is estimated by means of a local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption and then is calculated both numerically and analytically by solving the master equation. The folding time has a maximum near the folding transition temperature and can have a minimum at a lower temperature.	0
Title: Novel robust hepatitis C virus mouse efficacy model Abstract: The lack of a robust small-animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has hindered the discovery and development of novel drug treatments for HCV infections. We developed a reproducible and easily accessible xenograft mouse efficacy model in which HCV RNA replication is accurately monitored in vivo by real-time, noninvasive whole-body imaging of gamma-irradiated SCID mice implanted with a mouse-adapted luciferase replicon-containing Huh-7 cell line (T7-11). The model was validated by demonstrating that both a small-molecule NS3/4A protease inhibitor (BILN 2061) and human alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) decreased HCV RNA replication and that treatment withdrawal resulted in a rebound in replication, which paralleled clinical outcomes in humans. We further showed that protease inhibitor and IFN-alpha combination therapy was more effective in reducing HCV RNA replication than treatment with each compound alone and supports testing in humans. This robust mouse efficacy model provides a powerful tool for rapid evaluation of potential anti-HCV compounds in vivo as part of aggressive drug discovery efforts.	0
Title: Effects of full-length borealin on the composition and protein-protein interaction activity of a binary chromosomal passenger complex Abstract: The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) comprises at least four protein components and functions at various cellular localizations during different mitotic stages to ensure correct chromosome segregation and completion of cytokinesis. Borealin, the most recently identified member of the CPC, is an intrinsically unstructured protein of low solubility and stability. Recent reports have demonstrated the formation of binary or ternary CPC subcomplexes incorporating short Borealin fragments in vitro. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that full-length Borealin, instead of a Borealin fragment possessing the complete Survivin and INCENP recognition sequence, is required for the composition of a Borealin-Survivin complex competent to interact with INCENP. In addition, we show evidence that full-length Borealin, which forms high-order oligomers in its isolated form, is a monomer in the Borealin-Survivin CPC subcomplex.	0
Title: Cell biology of Zymoseptoria tritici: Pathogen cell organization and wheat infection Abstract: Cell biological research in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly Mycosphaerella graminicola) has led to a good understanding of the histology of the infection process. Expression profiling and bioinformatic approaches, combined with molecular studies on signaling pathways, effectors and potential necrosis factors provides first insight into the complex interplay between the host and the pathogen. Cell biological studies will help to further our understanding of the infection strategy of the fungus. The cellular organization and intracellular dynamics of the fungus itself is largely unexplored. Insight into essential cellular processes within the pathogen will expand our knowledge of the basic biology of Z. tritici, thereby providing putative new anti-fungal targets.	0
Title: Activation of the ustilagic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Ustilago maydis by the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor Rua1 Abstract: The phytopathogenic basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis secretes, under conditions of nitrogen starvation, large amounts of the biosurfactant ustilagic acid (UA). This secreted cellobiose glycolipid is toxic for many microorganisms and confers biocontrol activity to U. maydis. Recently, a large gene cluster that is responsible for UA biosynthesis was identified. Here, we show that expression of all cluster genes depends on Rua1, a nuclear protein of the C(2)H(2) zinc finger family, whose gene is located within the gene cluster. While deletion of rua1 results in complete loss of UA production, overexpression of rua1 promotes increased UA synthesis even in the presence of a good nitrogen source. Bioinformatic analysis allowed us to identify a conserved sequence element that is present in the promoters of all structural genes involved in UA biosynthesis. Deletion analysis of several promoters within the cluster revealed that this DNA element serves as an upstream activating sequence (UAS) and mediates Rua1-dependent expression. We used the yeast one-hybrid system to demonstrate specific recognition of this DNA element by Rua1. Introduction of nucleotide exchanges into the consensus sequence interfered with Rua1-dependent activation, suggesting that this sequence element acts as a direct binding site for Rua1.	1
Title: Functional characterization of ttmM unveils new tautomycin analogs and insight into tautomycin biosynthesis and activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycin (TTM), a potent protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor has recently been characterized. Inactivation of ttmM, which encodes a putative C3' hydroxylase, afforded mutant SB6005 which accumulated three new 3'-deshydroxy TTM analogs, supporting the function of TtmM and the previously proposed linear pathway for TTM biosynthesis. Bioassays reveal the importance of the C3' OH moiety in PP inhibition and that PP inhibition is not the exclusive mechanism driving TTM-induced cell death.	1
Title: Improved method for polynucleotide probe-based cell sorting, using DNA-coated microplates Abstract: We developed an improved method for cultivation-independent sorting of bacterial cells. The technique is based on labeling the target cells by in situ hybridization with polynucleotide transcript probes. Due to the probes' length, part of the probe remains outside the cell and can subsequently be used to capture the cells. Target cells are immobilized during a second hybridization step in microplates that are coated with DNA that is complementary to the probe sequence. The method was applied successfully to artificial mixtures of cells with polynucleotide probes targeting either rRNA, a plasmid-borne beta-lactamase gene, or a chromosome-borne glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Cells could be separated based on phylogenetic parameters (using rRNA-targeted probes) as well as on other DNA-encoded traits.	0
Title: Difficidin and oxydifficidin: novel broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotics produced by Bacillus subtilis. I. Production, taxonomy and antibacterial activity Abstract: Difficidin and oxydifficidin, two novel macrocyclic polyene lactone phosphate esters were discovered in fermentation broths of each of two strains of Bacillus subtilis: ATCC 39320 and ATCC 39374. Difficidin and oxydifficidin each showed a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Many of the susceptible aerobes and anaerobes were human pathogens resistant to one or more antibiotics. Difficidin and oxydifficidin when administered intraperitoneally protected mice against an otherwise lethal bacteremia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (ED50 in mg/kg of 1.31 and 15.6 respectively). Neither difficidin nor oxydifficidin were effective when administered via the subcutaneous route.	0
Title: Total synthesis of (±)-cafestol: a late-stage construction of the furan ring inspired by a biosynthesis strategy Abstract: An efficient bioinspired approach to the total synthesis of (±)-cafestol features a late-stage installation of the furan ring with a mild Au-catalyzed cycloisomerization. The Et2AlCl-promoted aldehyde-ene cyclization and subsequent Friedel-Crafts reaction deliver a requisite tricyclic system in gram scale with high stereo- and regioselectivity. Moreover, a highly stereoselective SmI2-mediated aldehyde-alkene radical cyclization furnishes the key bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton to offer an advanced intermediate for the synthesis of other oxygenated ent-kaurene diterpenoids.	0
Title: Genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis in Lactobacillus reuteri Abstract: Reutericyclin is a unique antimicrobial tetramic acid produced by some strains of Lactobacillus reuteri. This study aimed to identify the genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis. Comparisons of the genomes of reutericyclin-producing L. reuteri strains with those of non-reutericyclin-producing strains identified a genomic island of 14 open reading frames (ORFs) including genes coding for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a polyketide synthase (PKS), homologues of PhlA, PhlB, and PhlC, and putative transport and regulatory proteins. The protein encoded by rtcN is composed of a condensation domain, an adenylation domain likely specific for d-leucine, and a thiolation domain. rtcK codes for a PKS that is composed of a ketosynthase domain, an acyl-carrier protein domain, and a thioesterase domain. The products of rtcA, rtcB, and rtcC are homologous to the diacetylphloroglucinol-biosynthetic proteins PhlABC and may acetylate the tetramic acid moiety produced by RtcN and RtcK, forming reutericyclin. Deletion of rtcN or rtcABC in L. reuteri TMW1.656 abrogated reutericyclin production but did not affect resistance to reutericyclin. Genes coding for transport and regulatory proteins could be deleted only in the reutericyclin-negative L. reuteri strain TMW1.656ΔrtcN, and these deletions eliminated reutericyclin resistance. The genomic analyses suggest that the reutericyclin genomic island was horizontally acquired from an unknown source during a unique event. The combination of PhlABC homologues with both an NRPS and a PKS has also been identified in the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus plantarum, suggesting that the genes in these organisms and those in L. reuteri share an evolutionary origin.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the pradimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of Actinomadura hibisca P157-2 Abstract: Pradimicins are potent antifungal antibiotics having an unusual dihydrobenzo[alpha]naphthacenequinone aglycone substituted with D-alanine and sugars. Pradimicins are polyketide antibiotics produced by Actinomadura hibisca P157-2. The gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of pradimicins was cloned and sequenced. The pradimicin gene cluster was localized to a 39-kb DNA segment and its involvement in the biosynthesis of pradimicin was proven by gene inactivation of prmA and prmB (ketosynthases alpha and beta). The pradimicin gene cluster consists of 28 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding a type II polyketide synthase (PKS), the enzymes involved in sugar biosynthesis and tailoring enzymes as well as two resistance proteins. The deduced proteins showed strong similarities to the previously validated gene clusters of angucyclic polyketides such as rubromycin, griseorhodin, and fredericamycin. From the pradimicin gene cluster, prmP3 encoding a component of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex was disrupted. The production levels of pradimicins of the resulting mutants decreased to 62% of the level produced by the wild-type strain, which indicate that the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene would have a significant role in the production of pradimicins through supplying the extender unit precursor, malonyl-CoA.	1
Title: Evidence of Naturalized Stress-Tolerant Strains of Escherichia coli in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants Abstract: Escherichia coli has been proposed to have two habitats-the intestines of mammals/birds and the nonhost environment. Our goal was to assess whether certain strains of E. coli have evolved toward adaptation and survival in wastewater. Raw sewage samples from different treatment plants were subjected to chlorine stress, and ∼59% of the surviving E. coli strains were found to contain a genetic insertion element (IS30) located within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region. The positional location of the IS30 element was not observed across a library of 845 E. coli isolates collected from various animal hosts or within GenBank or whole-genome reference databases for human and animal E. coli isolates (n = 1,177). Phylogenetics clustered the IS30 element-containing wastewater E. coli isolates into a distinct clade, and biomarker analysis revealed that these wastewater isolates contained a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarker pattern that was specific for wastewater. These isolates belonged to phylogroup A, possessed generalized stress response (RpoS) activity, and carried the locus of heat resistance, features likely relevant to nonhost environmental survival. Isolates were screened for 28 virulence genes but carried only the fimH marker. Our data suggest that wastewater contains a naturalized resident population of E. coli We developed an endpoint PCR targeting the IS30 element within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region, and all raw sewage samples (n = 21) were positive for this marker. Conversely, the prevalence of this marker in E. coli-positive surface and groundwater samples was low (≤5%). This simple PCR assay may represent a convenient microbial source-tracking tool for identification of water samples affected by municipal wastewater.                  Importance:                       The results of this study demonstrate that some strains of E. coli appear to have evolved to become naturalized populations in the wastewater environment and possess a number of stress-related genetic elements likely important for survival in this nonhost environment. The presence of non-host-adapted strains in wastewater challenges our understanding of using E. coli as a microbial indicator of wastewater treatment performance, suggesting that the E. coli strains present in human and animal feces may be very different from those found in treated wastewater.	0
Title: Semisynthesis of dimeric proteins by expressed protein ligation Abstract: A one-pot synthesis of homodimeric proteins is described. The synthetic strategy is based on a double expressed protein ligation reaction between thioester peptides and a new bis-cysteinyl linker. The protocol was also applied to the synthesis of heterodimers.	0
Title: In vivo killing of Staphylococcus aureus using a light-activated antimicrobial agent Abstract: Background:                       The widespread problem of antibiotic resistance in pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus has prompted the search for new antimicrobial approaches. In this study we report for the first time the use of a light-activated antimicrobial agent, methylene blue, to kill an epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA-16) strain in two mouse wound models.                  Results:                       Following irradiation of wounds with 360 J/cm(2) of laser light (670 nm) in the presence of 100 microg/ml of methylene blue, a 25-fold reduction in the number of viable EMRSA was seen. This was independent of the increase in temperature of the wounds associated with the treatment. Histological examination of the wounds revealed no difference between the photodynamic therapy (PDT)-treated wounds and the untreated wounds, all of which showed the same degree of inflammatory infiltration at 24 hours.                  Conclusion:                       The results of this study demonstrate that PDT is effective at reducing the total number of viable EMRSA in a wound. This approach has promise as a means of treating wound infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microbes as well as for the elimination of such organisms from carriage sites.	0
Title: Expression and phylogenetic analyses of the Gel/Gas proteins of Tuber melanosporum provide insights into the function and evolution of glucan remodeling enzymes in fungi Abstract: The β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases of the GH72 family are redundant enzymes that are essential for the formation and dynamic remodeling of the fungal wall during different stages of the life cycle. Four putative genes encoding glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases, designated TmelGEL1, TmelGEL2, TmelGEL4 and TmelGAS4, have been annotated in the genome of Tuber melanosporum, an ectomycorrhizal fungus that also produces a hypogeous fruiting body (FB) of great commercial value (black truffle). This work focuses on the characterization and expression of this multigene family by taking advantage of a laser microdissection (LMD) technology that has been used to separate two distinct compartments in the FB, the hyphae and the asci containing the ascospores. Of the four genes, TmelGEL1 was the most up-regulated in the FB compared to the free-living mycelium. Inside the FB, the expression of TmelGEL1 was restricted to the hyphal compartment. A phylogenetic analysis of the Gel/Gas protein family of T. melanosporum was also carried out. A total of 237 GH72 proteins from 51 Ascomycotina and 3 Basidiomycota (outgroup) species were analyzed. The resulting tree provides insight into the evolution of the T. melanosporum proteins and identifies new GH72 paralogs/subfamilies. Moreover, it represents a starting point to formulate new hypotheses on the significance of the striking GH72 gene redundancy in fungal biology.	0
Title: Direct Comparison of d-DNA and l-DNA Strand-Displacement Reactions in Living Mammalian Cells Abstract: To overcome technical challenges associated with the use of DNA strand-displacement circuits in vivo, including degradation by cellular nucleases, researchers are increasingly turning to bio-orthogonal l-DNA. Although enhanced stability and improved performance of l-DNA-based circuits within living cells are often implied, direct experimental evidence has not been provided. Herein, we directly compare the functional stability and kinetics of d-DNA and l-DNA strand-displacement in live cells for the first time. We show that l-DNA strand-displacement reaction systems have minimal "leak", fast reaction kinetics, and prolonged stability inside living cells as compared to conventional d-DNA. Furthermore, using "heterochiral" strand-displacement, we demonstrate that biostable l-DNA reaction components can be easily interfaced with native DNA inside cells. Overall, our results strongly support the broader adoption of l-DNA in the field of DNA molecular circuitry, especially for in vivo applications.	0
Title: NosA, a transcription factor important in Aspergillus fumigatus stress and developmental response, rescues the germination defect of a laeA deletion Abstract: Aspergillus fumigatus is an increasingly serious pathogen of immunocompromised patients, causing the often fatal disease invasive aspergillosis (IA). One A. fumigatus virulence determinant of IA is LaeA, a conserved virulence factor in pathogenic fungi. To further understand the role of LaeA in IA, the expression profile of ΔlaeA was compared to wild type, and several transcription factors were found significantly misregulated by LaeA loss. One of the transcription factors up-regulated over 4-fold in the ΔlaeA strain was Afu4g09710, similar in sequence to Aspergillus nidulans NosA, which is involved in sexual development. Here we assessed loss of nosA (ΔnosA) and overexpression of nosA (OE::nosA) on A. fumigatus in both a wild type and ΔlaeA background. Based on the multiple alterations of physiological development of single and double mutants, we suggest that NosA mediates the decreased radial growth and delayed conidial germination observed in ΔlaeA strains, the former in a light dependent manner. The ΔnosA mutant showed increased virulence in the Galleria mellonella larvae model of disseminated aspergillosis, potentially due to its increased growth and germination rate. Furthermore, the A. fumigatus nosA allele was able to partially remediate sexual development in an A. nidulans ΔnosA background. Likewise, the A. nidulans nosA allele was able to restore the menadione sensitivity defect of the A. fumigatus ΔnosA strain, suggesting conservation of function of the NosA protein in these two species.	0
Title: Elucidation of the zinc-dependent regulation in Amycolatopsis japonicum enabled the identification of the ethylenediamine-disuccinate ([S,S]-EDDS) genes Abstract: The actinomycete Amycolatopsis japonicum produces the complexing agent ethylenediamine-disuccinate ([S,S]-EDDS), which is an isomer of the widely industrially applied ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA). In contrast to EDTA, [S,S]-EDDS is readily biodegradable and is therefore an alternative with a favourable environmental profile. Biotechnological production of [S,S]-EDDS, however, is not currently possible because its biosynthesis is inhibited by low-micromolar zinc concentrations. Here we illustrate the development of a new strategy for identifying a biosynthetic pathway that is based on the elucidation of transcriptional regulation and the screening for binding sites of the respective regulator that controls the [S,S]-EDDS biosynthesis genes. To achieve this, we identified the zinc uptake regulator Zur in A. japonicum and showed that it mediates the repression of the zinc uptake system ZnuABCAj . The Zur-binding motif, recognized by the zinc-bound Zur protein in the upstream region of znuABCAj , was used to screen the genome, leading to the identification of the aes genes. Transcriptional analysis and shift assays reveal specific zinc-responsive regulation of the aes genes by Zur, and gene inactivation shows their involvement in [S,S]-EDDS biosynthesis. Zur-mediated zinc repression of the [S,S]-EDDS biosynthesis genes is abolished in a Δzur mutant, which offers now the opportunity to develop a biotechnological process.	1
Title: A preliminary investigation of the Nostoc punctiforme proteome Abstract: Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 is a filamentous terrestrial cyanobacterium (prokaryote) that expresses several different phenotypes in response to environmental cues. When grown in nitrogen-deficient media the most abundant proteins in addition to phycobiliproteins were superoxide dismutase, ATP synthase, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. A methylated peptide from an akinete marker protein was also identified, suggesting that methylation could potentially play a regulatory role through signaling. C-phycocyanin alpha-chain was methylated at the C-terminal end of the protein and tandem mass spectrometric data also identified peptides that were deamidated. Since a significant number of putative polyketide/non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes are present in the annotated genome, an analysis of a methanolic extract of whole cells was also performed, and a series of nostopeptolides were identified.	1
Title: Characterization of a Legionella pneumophila relA insertion mutant and toles of RelA and RpoS in virulence gene expression Abstract: To investigate the involvement of RelA in the regulation of Legionella pneumophila virulence, a deletion substitution was constructed in the relA gene. The relA knockout resulted in an undetectable level of ppGpp in the cells during the stationary phase, but the original level was restored when the relA gene product was supplied on a plasmid. The effect of the relA mutation was examined with two systems that are known to be expressed during the stationary phase in L. pneumophila. Pigment production was found to be dependent on the relA gene product, and only one-half as much pigment was produced by the relA mutant as by the wild-type strain. Flagellum gene expression was also found to be dependent on the relA gene product, as determined with a flaA::lacZ fusion. However, the relA gene product was found to be dispensable for intracellular growth both in HL-60-derived human macrophages and in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii. To determine the involvement of the relA gene product in expression of L. pneumophila genes required for intracellular growth (icm/dot genes), nine icm::lacZ fusions were constructed, and expression of these fusions in the wild-type strain was compared with their expression in relA mutant strains. Expression of only one of the icm::lacZ fusions was moderately reduced in the relA mutant strain. Expression of the nine icm::lacZ fusions was also examined in a strain containing an insertion in the gene that codes for the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS, and similar results were obtained. We concluded that RelA is dispensable for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in the two hosts examined and that both RelA and RpoS play minor roles in L. pneumophila icm/dot gene expression.	0
Title: Isolation and identification of the Raoultella ornithinolytica-ZK4 degrading pyrethroid pesticides within soil sediment from an abandoned pesticide plant Abstract: We examined how Raoultella ornithinolytica-ZK4 degraded pyrethroid pesticides within soil sediment from an abandoned pesticide plant. Lambda-cypermethrin and deltamethrin are two pyrethroid insecticides with high insecticidal activity and a wide range of applications. However, their increased use has raised concerns regarding toxicity and accumulation. We isolated a strain of ZK4 (Raoultella ornithinolytica-ZK4) from soil taken from a channel that surrounded a pesticide plant. We used enzyme localization to study degrading bacteria ZK4. The ZK4 strain underwent intracellular enzyme degradation. The degradation rates of lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin were 55% and 53%, respectively. The optimum pH of the two kinds of pyrethroids in ZK4 was 6.5, and their optimum temperature was 37 °C. The intracellular degradation of the crude enzyme produced by the ZK4 strain had a pH of 6.0-8.0 and a temperature of 20-42 °C. The ZK4 strain genome contained 5310 genes with a total length of 4,864,494 bp. Sugar metabolism and exogenous chemical metabolism accounted for the largest proportion of metabolic activities. We used the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) alignment and found numbers for 4686 protein sequences, accounting for 88.25% of the total predicted protein. ZK4 degraded lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, and may serve as a reference for the preparation of future degrading microbial agents to assist with environmental restoration efforts.	0
Title: Automated Assembly of Starch and Glycogen Polysaccharides Abstract: Polysaccharides are Nature's most abundant biomaterials essential for plant cell wall construction and energy storage. Seemingly minor structural differences result in entirely different functions: cellulose, a β (1-4) linked glucose polymer, forms fibrils that can support large trees, while amylose, an α (1-4) linked glucose polymer forms soft hollow fibers used for energy storage. A detailed understanding of polysaccharide structures requires pure materials that cannot be isolated from natural sources. Automated Glycan Assembly provides quick access to trans-linked glycans analogues of cellulose, but the stereoselective installation of multiple cis-glycosidic linkages present in amylose has not been possible to date. Here, we identify thioglycoside building blocks with different protecting group patterns that, in concert with temperature and solvent control, achieve excellent stereoselectivity during the synthesis of linear and branched α-glucan polymers with up to 20 cis-glycosidic linkages. The molecules prepared with the new method will serve as probes to understand the biosynthesis and the structure of α-glucans.	0
Title: Fluorous synthesis of disubstituted pyrimidines Abstract: [reaction: see text] The fluorous synthesis of disubstituted pyrimidines is carried out by attaching 2,4-dichloro-6-methylpyrimidine with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol. The tagged substrate is substituted with 3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole followed by thioether oxidation and tag displacement with amines or thiols. The fluorous chain serves as a phase tag for intermediate and product purification over FluoroFlash SPE cartridges.	0
Title: Unusual chemistry in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic chondrochlorens Abstract: The antibiotic chondrochlorens A and B from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 incorporate several unusual structural features, notable among them a shared chloro-hydroxy-styryl functionality and the ethoxy group of chondrochloren B. Our analysis of the chondrochloren gene cluster by targeted gene inactivation coupled with assays in vitro has shed significant light on the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Chlorination of tyrosine occurs early in the pathway, likely on a peptidyl carrier protein-bound intermediate, whereas decarboxylation to the styryl moiety appears to be accomplished by an unprecedented oxidative decarboxylase. We also show that the chondrochloren B ethoxy group arises from initial incorporation by the polyketide synthase of hydroxy malonate as an extender unit, methylation in cis by an O-methyltransferase, followed by a second methylation. This report therefore constitutes a direct demonstration of the involvement of a radical S-adenosylmethionine methylase in bacterial secondary metabolism.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the ficellomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces ficellus Abstract: Ficellomycin is a peptide-like antibiotic which exhibits potent in vitro activity against Penicillium oxalicum and Staphylococcus aureus, even against strains resistant to most clinically used antibiotics. The gene cluster responsible for ficellomycin biosynthesis was cloned from Streptomyces ficellus and sequenced. It was found to contain 26 ORFs and is located within 30 kb of contiguous DNA. Targeted disruption of the encoding genes revealed that most were involved in the functional section of ficellomycin biosynthesis, such as peptide assembly, regulation, resistance, and biosynthesis of the precursor of ficellomycin 2-[4-guanidyl-1-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-yl] glycine (2-GAHG). Within the 2-GAHG synthesis pathway, a sulfate adenylyltransferase appears to be involved in the synthesis of the pharmaceutically important 1-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane ring moiety, which has been reported to cause DNA cross-linking or impairment of semiconservative DNA replication.	1
Title: Structural characterization of lacticin 3147, a two-peptide lantibiotic with synergistic activity Abstract: Lantibiotics are antibacterial peptides isolated from bacterial sources that exhibit activity toward Gram-positive organisms and are usually several orders of magnitude more potent than traditional antibiotics such as penicillin. They contain a number of unique structural features including dehydro amino acid and lanthionine (thioether) residues. Introduced following ribosomal translation of the parent peptide, these moieties render conventional methods of peptide analysis ineffective. We report herein a new method using nickel boride (Ni(2)B), in the presence of deuterium gas, to reduce dehydro side chains and reductively desulfurize lanthionine bridges found in lantibiotics. Using this approach, it is possible to identify and distinguish the original locations of dehydro side chains and lanthionine bridges by traditional peptide sequencing (Edman degradation) followed by mass spectrometry. The strategy was initially verified using nisin A, a structurally well characterized lantibiotic, and subsequently extended to the novel two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis DPC3147. The primary structures of both lacticin 3147 peptides were then fully assigned by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, showing that lacticin 3147 A1 has a specific lanthionine bridging pattern which resembles the globular type-B lantibiotic mersacidin, whereas the A2 peptide is a member of the elongated type-A lantibiotic class. Also obtained by NMR were solution conformations of both lacticin 3147 peptides, indicating that A1 may adopt a conformation similar to that of mersacidin and that the A2 peptide adopts alpha-helical structure. These results are the first of their kind for a synergistic lantibiotic pair (only four such pairs have been reported to date).	1
Title: Discovery and characterization of a cytochalasan biosynthetic cluster from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavipes CNL-338 Abstract: Cytochalasans are a large family of well-studied cytotoxic molecules isolated from fungi. Investigation into the organic extract of the marine-derived fungal strain Aspergillus flavipes CNL-338 led to the isolation of seven leucine-containing cytochalasans. Genome mining allowed for the identification of the ffs biosynthetic gene cluster, and genetic inactivation studies verified its involvement in cytochalasan biosynthesis. In addition, comparative analysis of key residues in the binding pocket of core cytochalasan biosynthetic enzymes revealed significant similarities among fungal adenylation domains despite differences in substrate preference. We report the identification of leucine-containing cytochalasans from the marine-derived A. flavipes CNL-338 and the characterization of the ffs biosynthetic cluster as verified by genetic inactivation studies.	1
Title: Endo-selective enyne ring-closing metathesis promoted by stereogenic-at-W mono-pyrrolide complexes Abstract: The utility of W-alkylidene complexes for enyne ring-closing metathesis is demonstrated in a direct comparison with Mo-based analogs. Tungsten complexes lead to less alkyne oligomerization and higher levels of endo-selectivity and enantioselectivity.	0
Title: Peptide-based, two-fluorophore, ratiometric probe for quantifying mobile zinc in biological solutions Abstract: Small-molecule fluorescent sensors are versatile agents for detecting mobile zinc in biology. Capitalizing on the abundance of validated mobile zinc probes, we devised a strategy for repurposing existing intensity-based sensors for quantitative applications. Using solid-phase peptide synthesis, we conjugated a zinc-sensitive Zinpyr-1 derivative and a zinc-insensitive 7-hydroxycoumarin derivative onto opposite ends of a rigid P9K peptide scaffold to create HcZ9, a ratiometric fluorescent probe for mobile zinc. A plate reader-based assay using HcZ9 was developed, the accuracy of which is comparable to that of atomic absorption spectroscopy. We investigated zinc accumulation in prostatic cells and zinc levels in human seminal fluid. When normal and tumorigenic cells are bathed in zinc-enriched media, cellular mobile zinc is buffered and changes slightly, but total zinc levels increase significantly. Quantification of mobile and total zinc levels in human seminal plasma revealed that the two are positively correlated with a Pearson's coefficient of 0.73.	0
Title: Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking Abstract: Thirst motivates animals to drink in order to maintain fluid balance. Thirst has conventionally been viewed as a homeostatic response to changes in blood volume or tonicity. However, most drinking behaviour is regulated too rapidly to be controlled by blood composition directly, and instead seems to anticipate homeostatic imbalances before they arise. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the subfornical organ (SFO) in the anticipatory regulation of thirst in mice. By monitoring deep-brain calcium dynamics, we show that thirst-promoting SFO neurons respond to inputs from the oral cavity during eating and drinking and then integrate these inputs with information about the composition of the blood. This integration allows SFO neurons to predict how ongoing food and water consumption will alter fluid balance in the future and then to adjust behaviour pre-emptively. Complementary optogenetic manipulations show that this anticipatory modulation is necessary for drinking in several contexts. These findings provide a neural mechanism to explain longstanding behavioural observations, including the prevalence of drinking during meals, the rapid satiation of thirst, and the fact that oral cooling is thirst-quenching.	0
Title: Molecular genetic characterization of the biosynthesis cluster of a prenylated isoindolinone alkaloid aspernidine A in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Aspernidine A is a prenylated isoindolinone alkaloid isolated from the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. A genome-wide kinase knockout library of A. nidulans was examined, and it was found that a mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, mpkA, deletion strain produces aspernidine A. Targeted gene deletions were performed in the kinase deletion background to identify the gene cluster for aspernidine A biosynthesis. Intermediates were isolated from mutant strains which provided information about the aspernidine A biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: Stereoselective synthesis of F-ring saturated estrone-derived inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling based on cyclopamine Abstract: Previous work in this laboratory established that the readily available F-ring aromatic analog of cyclopamine is a highly potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The synthesis and biological evaluation of two F-ring saturated analogs that are more potent than the F-ring aromatic structure are reported.	0
Title: Histone Tail Sequences Balance Their Role in Genetic Regulation and the Need To Protect DNA against Destruction in Nucleosome Core Particles Containing Abasic Sites Abstract: Abasic sites (AP) are produced 10 000 times per day in a single cell. Strand cleavage at AP is accelerated ≈100-fold within a nucleosome core particle (NCP) compared to free DNA. The lysine-rich N-terminal tails of histone proteins catalyze single-strand breaks through a mechanism used by base-excision-repair enzymes, despite the general dearth of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and histidine-the amino acids that are typically responsible for deprotonation of Schiff base intermediates. Incorporating glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or histidine proximal to lysine residues in histone N-terminal tails increases AP reactivity as much as sixfold. The rate acceleration is due to more facile DNA cleavage of Schiff-base intermediates. These observations raise the possibility that histone proteins could have evolved to minimize the presence of histidine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid in their lysine-rich N-terminal tails to guard against enhancing the toxic effects of DNA damage.	0
Title: Functional characterizations of novWUS involved in novobiocin biosynthesis from Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: NovW, novU, and novS gene products represent dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3,5 epimarase, C-methyltransferase and dTDP-glucose-4-ketoreductase involved in noviose biosynthetic pathway, respectively. We have expressed three genes to elucidate the functions of NovW, NovU, and NovS in Escherichia coli. NovW and NovU catalyze the formation of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-5-C-methyl-L-lyxo-hexose from dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose. NovS reduces the product formed from the reaction of NovW with dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose in the presence of NADH to result in dTDP-l-rhamnose. Furthermore, a pathway for the biosynthesis of noviose is proposed.	1
Title: Cognitive requirements of cumulative culture: teaching is useful but not essential Abstract: The cumulative nature of human culture is unique in the animal kingdom. Progressive improvements in tools and technologies have facilitated humanity's spread across the globe and shaped human evolution, but the cognitive mechanisms enabling cultural change remain unclear. Here we show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, cumulative improvements in tools are not dependent on specialised, high-fidelity social learning mechanisms. Participants were tasked with building a basket to carry as much rice as possible using a set of everyday materials and divided into treatment groups with differing opportunities to learn asocially, imitate, receive teaching or emulate by examining baskets made by previous chain members. Teaching chains produced more robust baskets, but neither teaching nor imitation were strictly necessary for cumulative improvements; emulation chains generated equivalent increases in efficacy despite exhibiting relatively low copying fidelity. People used social information strategically, choosing different materials to make their baskets if the previous basket in the chain performed poorly. Together, these results suggest that cumulative culture does not rest on high-fidelity social learning mechanisms alone. Instead, the roots of human cultural prowess may lie in the interplay of strategic social learning with other cognitive traits including the ability to reverse engineer artefacts through causal reasoning.	0
Title: Assessment of the microbial ecology of ruminal methanogens in cattle with different feed efficiencies Abstract: Cattle with high feed efficiencies (designated "efficient") produce less methane gas than those with low feed efficiencies (designated "inefficient"); however, the role of the methane producers in such difference is unknown. This study investigated whether the structures and populations of methanogens in the rumen were associated with differences in cattle feed efficiencies by using culture-independent methods. Two 16S rRNA libraries were constructed using approximately 800-bp amplicons generated from pooled total DNA isolated from efficient (n = 29) and inefficient (n = 29) animals. Sequence analysis of up to 490 randomly selected clones from each library showed that the methanogenic composition was variable: less species variation (22 operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) was detected in the rumens of efficient animals, compared to 27 OTUs in inefficient animals. The methanogenic communities in inefficient animals were more diverse than those in efficient ones, as revealed by the diversity indices of 0.84 and 0.42, respectively. Differences at the strain and genotype levels were also observed and found to be associated with feed efficiency in the host. No difference was detected in the total population of methanogens, but the prevalences of Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter sp. strain AbM4 were 1.92 (P < 0.05) and 2.26 (P < 0.05) times higher in inefficient animals, while Methanobrevibacter sp. strain AbM4 was reported for the first time to occur in the bovine rumen. Our data indicate that the methanogenic ecology at the species, strain, and/or genotype level in the rumen may play important roles in contributing to the difference in methane gas production between cattle with different feed efficiencies.	0
Title: Effect of clindamycin on the in vitro activity of amikacin and gentamicin against gram-negative bacilli Abstract: The in vitro effect of clindamycin on the inhibitory and bactericidal activity of amikacin (BB-K8) and gentamicin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined by the checkerboard technique in microtiter plates. Clindamycin (15 mug/ml) produced statistically significant increases in the minimal bactericidal concentrations of amikacin and gentamicin against E. coli and Klebsiellae at 2 and 4 h of incubation. The minimal bactericidal concentration against P. aeruginosa was not affected. Higher concentrations of clindamycin (20 to 25 mug/ml) reduced the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of amikacin and gentamicin for E. coli at 18 h of incubation. The synergistic bactericidal activity of amikacin and carbenicillin against E. coli, but not P. aeruginosa, was also inhibited slightly by clindamycin (15 mug/ml). The clinical implications of this inhibition of the early bactericidal in vitro activity of aminoglycosides by clindamycin remain to be determined. Although these in vitro results have not been studied in clinical infections, it is conceivable that slight interference in early bacterial killing could alter the outcome of infection in the immunosuppressed patient.	0
Title: Stabilization of Multimeric Proteins via Intersubunit Cyclization Abstract: Proteins with high catalytic efficiency and selectivity under mild conditions have long been appreciated by industrial and medicinal fields. These proteins, which are commonly multimeric, often possess low stability, impeding wider application. Currently, strategies to improve the stability of multimeric proteins concentrate on enhancing the interaction at internal interface of the subunits. In this report, we confirmed that the largely underestimated subunit terminal ends are as significant as the internal interface for protein stability. By connecting both the terminal ends and internal interface of subunits, the tetrameric Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) protein can been cyclized into a rigid form with significantly improved thermostability and resilience. The improvement in the temperature at which enzyme activity is reduced to 50% after a 15-min heat treatment (T5015) and melting temperature (Tm ) of the modified protein was 18°C and 23.3°C, respectively, which is superior to the results achieved by normal protein engineering. Our study provided a novel strategy to effectively improve the stability of multimeric proteins, which is suitable not only for the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family but also other classes of proteins with close terminal ends.IMPORTANCE Industrially interesting proteins are generally multimeric proteins; however, their applications are often restricted due to low stability caused by the natural tendency of subunit disassociation. Current approaches targeting this problem mainly focus on enhancing the internal interfaces of the subunits to avoid their disassociation. In this study, we identified and confirmed the external interface to be significant for improving the stability of multimeric proteins. By connecting the terminal ends and internal interface with disulfide bonds, we found that the multimeric protein LnADH cyclized into a robust monomeric-like form, resulting in superior thermostability compared to traditional protein engineering. This intersubunit cyclization approach is efficient and easy to perform, providing a novel method for engineering many important classes of multimeric proteins.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the polyether salinomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces albus XM211 Abstract: Salinomycin is widely used in animal husbandry as a food additive due to its antibacterial and anticoccidial activities. However, its biosynthesis had only been studied by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors. A strategy with degenerate primers based on the polyether-specific epoxidase sequences was successfully developed to clone the salinomycin gene cluster. Using this strategy, a putative epoxidase gene, slnC, was cloned from the salinomycin producer Streptomyces albus XM211. The targeted replacement of slnC and subsequent trans-complementation proved its involvement in salinomycin biosynthesis. A 127-kb DNA region containing slnC was sequenced, including genes for polyketide assembly and release, oxidative cyclization, modification, export, and regulation. In order to gain insight into the salinomycin biosynthesis mechanism, 13 gene replacements and deletions were conducted. Including slnC, 7 genes were identified as essential for salinomycin biosynthesis and putatively responsible for polyketide chain release, oxidative cyclization, modification, and regulation. Moreover, 6 genes were found to be relevant to salinomycin biosynthesis and possibly involved in precursor supply, removal of aberrant extender units, and regulation. Sequence analysis and a series of gene replacements suggest a proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of salinomycin. The information presented here expands the understanding of polyether biosynthesis mechanisms and paves the way for targeted engineering of salinomycin activity and productivity.	1
Title: Penicillin-binding proteins of multiply antibiotic-resistant South African strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae Abstract: Multiply drug-resistant South African pneumococci (with penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 12.5 microgram/ml) showed several types of major alterations in their penicillin-binding protein (PBP) pattern compared with that of a penicillin-susceptible laboratory strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae (R6; penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration = 0.006 microgram/ml). Genetic transformants were obtained by using South African pneumococcus (strain 8249) deoxyribonucleic acid as donor and the competent cells of strain R6 as recipient; seven classes of transformants with progressively higher penicillin resistance were isolated, and their PBPs were tested. The PBP patterns exhibited a gradual shift from a pattern similar to that of the recipient to a pattern resembling that of the donor strain as the level of penicillin resistance increased.	0
Title: Facile Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of anilines to azo compounds and hydrazines with diaziridinone under mild conditions Abstract: A mild and highly efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of anilines is described. Various primary and secondary anilines can be efficiently coupled under mild conditions to the corresponding azo compounds and hydrazines in high yields. This method provides a direct and practical access to these compounds and is also amenable to gram scale with no special precautions to exclude air or moisture.	0
Title: Codon randomization for rapid exploration of chemical space in thiopeptide antibiotic variants Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics exhibit a profound level of chemical diversity that is installed through cascades of posttranslational modifications on ribosomal peptides. Here, we present a technique to rapidly explore the chemical space of the thiopeptide GE37468 through codon randomization, yielding insights into thiopeptide maturation as well as structure and activity relationships. In this incarnation of the methodology, we randomized seven residues of the prepeptide-coding region, enabling the generation of 133 potential thiopeptide variants. Variant libraries were subsequently queried in two ways. First, high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to colony-level expressions to sample mutants that permitted full maturation of the antibiotic. Second, the activity of producing mutants was detected in an antibiotic overlay assay. In total, 29 of the 133 variants produced mature compound, 12 of which retained antibiotic activity and 1 that had improved activity.	0
Title: A Genomics-Based Approach Identifies a Thioviridamide-Like Compound with Selective Anticancer Activity Abstract: Thioviridamide is a structurally novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translational modified peptide (RiPP) produced by Streptomyces olivoviridis NA005001. It is characterized by a structure that features a series of thioamide groups and possesses potent antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines. Its unusual structure allied to its promise as an anticancer compound led us to investigate the diversity of thioviridamide-like pathways across sequenced bacterial genomes. We have isolated and characterized three diverse members of this family of natural products. This characterization is supported by transformation-associated recombination cloning and heterologous expression of one of these compounds, thiostreptamide S4. Our work provides an insight into the diversity of this rare class of compound and indicates that the unusual N-terminus of thioviridamide is not introduced biosynthetically but is instead introduced during acetone extraction. A detailed analysis of the biological activity of one of the newly discovered compounds, thioalbamide, indicates that it is highly cytotoxic to cancer cells, while exhibiting significantly less activity toward a noncancerous epithelial cell line.	1
Title: Different biosynthetic pathways to fosfomycin in Pseudomonas syringae and Streptomyces species Abstract: Fosfomycin is a wide-spectrum antibiotic that is used clinically to treat acute cystitis in the United States. The compound is produced by several strains of streptomycetes and pseudomonads. We sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for fosfomycin production in Pseudomonas syringae PB-5123. Surprisingly, the biosynthetic pathway in this organism is very different from that in Streptomyces fradiae and Streptomyces wedmorensis. The pathways share the first and last steps, involving conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) and 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-HPP) to fosfomycin, respectively, but the enzymes converting PnPy to 2-HPP are different. The genome of P. syringae PB-5123 lacks a gene encoding the PnPy decarboxylase found in the Streptomyces strains. Instead, it contains a gene coding for a citrate synthase-like enzyme, Psf2, homologous to the proteins that add an acetyl group to PnPy in the biosynthesis of FR-900098 and phosphinothricin. Heterologous expression and purification of Psf2 followed by activity assays confirmed the proposed activity of Psf2. Furthermore, heterologous production of fosfomycin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a fosmid encoding the fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from P. syringae PB-5123 confirmed that the gene cluster is functional. Therefore, two different pathways have evolved to produce this highly potent antimicrobial agent.	1
Title: Towards continuous industrial bioprocessing with solventogenic and acetogenic clostridia: challenges, progress and perspectives Abstract: The sustainable production of solvents from above ground carbon is highly desired. Several clostridia naturally produce solvents and use a variety of renewable and waste-derived substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass and gas mixtures containing H2/CO2 or CO. To enable economically viable production of solvents and biofuels such as ethanol and butanol, the high productivity of continuous bioprocesses is needed. While the first industrial-scale gas fermentation facility operates continuously, the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation is traditionally operated in batch mode. This review highlights the benefits of continuous bioprocessing for solvent production and underlines the progress made towards its establishment. Based on metabolic capabilities of solvent producing clostridia, we discuss recent advances in systems-level understanding and genome engineering. On the process side, we focus on innovative fermentation methods and integrated product recovery to overcome the limitations of the classical one-stage chemostat and give an overview of the current industrial bioproduction of solvents.	0
Title: Fluoroarene Separations in Metal-Organic Frameworks with Two Proximal Mg2+ Coordination Sites Abstract: Fluoroarenes are widely used in medicinal, agricultural, and materials chemistry, and yet their production remains a critical challenge in organic synthesis. Indeed, the nearly identical physical properties of these vital building blocks hinders their purification by traditional methods, such as flash chromatography or distillation. As a result, the Balz-Schiemann reaction is currently employed to prepare fluoroarenes instead of more atom-economical C-H fluorination reactions, which produce inseparable mixtures of regioisomers. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to this problem: the purification of mixtures of fluoroarenes using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we demonstrate that controlling the interaction of fluoroarenes with adjacent coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ centers within a MOF enables the separation of fluoroarene mixtures with unparalleled selectivities. Liquid-phase multicomponent equilibrium adsorption data and breakthrough measurements coupled with van der Waals-corrected density functional theory calculations reveal that the materials Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) and Mg2(m-dobdc) (m-dobdc4- = 2,4-dioxidobenzene-1,5-dicarboxylate) are capable of separating the difluorobenzene isomers from one another. Additionally, these frameworks facilitate the separations of fluoroanisoles, fluorotoluenes, and fluorochlorobenzenes. In addition to enabling currently unfeasible separations for the production of fluoroarenes, our results suggest that carefully controlling the interaction of isomers with not one but two strong binding sites within a MOF provides a general strategy for achieving challenging liquid-phase separations.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces cattleya NRRL 8057, a producer of antibiotics and fluorometabolites Abstract: Streptomyces cattleya, a producer of the antibiotics thienamycin and cephamycin C, is one of the rare bacteria known to synthesize fluorinated metabolites. The genome consists of two linear replicons. The genes involved in fluorine metabolism and in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic thienamycin were mapped on both replicons.	1
Title: Genetic, molecular, and biochemical basis of fungal tropolone biosynthesis Abstract: A gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the fungal tropolone stipitatic acid was discovered in Talaromyces stipitatus (Penicillium stipitatum) and investigated by targeted gene knockout. A minimum of three genes are required to form the tropolone nucleus: tropA encodes a nonreducing polyketide synthase which releases 3-methylorcinaldehyde; tropB encodes a FAD-dependent monooxygenase which dearomatizes 3-methylorcinaldehyde via hydroxylation at C-3; and tropC encodes a non-heme Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase which catalyzes the oxidative ring expansion to the tropolone nucleus via hydroxylation of the 3-methyl group. The tropA gene was characterized by heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae, whereas tropB and tropC were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified TropB and TropC proteins converted 3-methylorcinaldehyde to a tropolone in vitro. Finally, knockout of the tropD gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, indicated its place as the next gene in the pathway, probably responsible for hydroxylation of the 6-methyl group. Comparison of the T. stipitatus tropolone biosynthetic cluster with other known gene clusters allows clarification of important steps during the biosynthesis of other fungal compounds including the xenovulenes, citrinin, sepedonin, sclerotiorin, and asperfuranone.	1
Title: Identification of a new diterpene biosynthetic gene cluster that produces O-methylkolavelool in Herpetosiphon aurantiacus Abstract: Diterpenoids are usually found in plants and fungi, but are rare in bacteria. We have previously reported new diterpenes, named tuberculosinol and isotuberculosinol, which are generated from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene products Rv3377c and Rv3378c. No homologous gene was found at that time, but we recently found highly homologous proteins in the Herpetosiphon aurantiacus ATCC 23779 genome. Haur_2145 was a class II diterpene cyclase responsible for the conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate into kolavenyl diphosphate. Haur_2146, homologous to Rv3378c, synthesized (+)-kolavelool through the nucleophilic addition of a water molecule to the incipient cation formed after the diphosphate moiety was released. Haur_2147 afforded (+)-O-methylkolavelool from (+)-kolavelool, so this enzyme was an O-methyltransferase. This new diterpene was indeed detected in H. aurantiacus cells. This is the first report of the identification of a (+)-O-methylkolavelool biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: Multiplexed Photoactivation of mRNA with Single-Cell Resolution Abstract: We demonstrate sequential optical activation of two types of mRNAs in the same mammalian cell through the sequential photocleavage of small molecule caging groups ("photocages") tethered to the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of mRNAs. Synthetic photocages were conjugated onto target mRNA using RNA-TAG, an enzymatic site-specific RNA modification technique. Translation of mRNA was severely reduced upon conjugation of the photocages onto the 5'-UTR. However, subsequent photorelease of the cages from the mRNA transcript triggered activation of translation with single-cell spatiotemporal resolution. To achieve sequential photoactivation of two mRNAs in the same cell, we synthesized a pair of photocages that can be selectively cleaved from mRNA upon photoirradiation with different wavelengths of light. Sequential photoactivation of two mRNAs enabled precise optical control of translation of two unique transcripts. We believe that this modular approach to precisely and rapidly control gene expression will serve as a powerful tool in future biological studies that require controlling translation of multiple transcripts with high spatiotemporal resolution.	0
Title: Non-invasive assessment of coronary endothelial function in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus using isometric handgrip exercise-MRI: A feasibility study Abstract: Background:                       Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children and adolescents is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early detection of vascular dysfunction is key to patient management yet current assessment techniques are invasive and not suitable for pediatric patient populations. A novel approach using isometric handgrip exercise during magnetic resonance imaging (IHE-MRI) has recently been developed to evaluate coronary endothelial function non-invasively in adults. This project aimed to assess endothelium-dependent coronary arterial response to IHE-MRI in children with T1DM and in age matched healthy controls.                  Materials and methods:                       Healthy volunteers and children with T1DM (>5 years) were recruited. IHE-MRI cross-sectional coronary artery area measurements were recorded at rest and under stress. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed for comparison. Student's t-tests were used to compare results between groups.                  Results and discussion:                       Seven children with T1DM (3 female, median 14.8 years, mean 14.8 ± 1.9 years) and 16 healthy controls (7 female, median 14.8 years, mean 14.2 ± 2.4 years) participated. A significant increase in stress-induced cross-sectional coronary area was measured in controls (5.4 mm2 at rest to 6.39 mm2 under stress, 18.8 ± 10.7%, p = 0.0004). In contrast, mean area change in patients with T1DM was not significant (7.17 mm2 at rest to 7.59 mm2 under stress, 10.5% ± 28.1%, p = n.s.). There was no significant difference in the results for neither PWV nor CIMT between patients and controls, (5.3±1.5 m/s vs.4.8±0.7 m/s and 0.4±0.03mm vs.0.46 mm ± 0.03 respectively, both p = n.s.).                  Conclusions:                       Our pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using a totally non-invasive IHE-MRI technique in children and adolescents with and without T1DM. Preliminary results suggest a blunted endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotor function in children with T1DM (>5 years). Better knowledge and new methodologies may improve surveillance and care for T1DM patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.	0
Title: Generation of Fluorinated Amychelin Siderophores against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections by a Combination of Genome Mining and Mutasynthesis Abstract: Pioneering microbial genomic surveys have revealed numerous untapped biosynthetic gene clusters, unveiling the great potential of new natural products. Here, using a combination of genome mining, mutasynthesis, and activity screening in an infection model comprising Caenorhabditis elegans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified candidate virulence-blocking amychelin siderophore compounds from actinomycetes. Subsequently, we developed unreported analogs of these virulence-blocking siderophores with improved potency by exploiting an Amycolatopsis methanolica strain 239T chorismate to salicylate a biosynthetic subpathway for mutasynthesis. This allowed us to generate the fluorinated amychelin, fluoroamychelin I, which rescued C. elegans from P. aeruginosa-mediated killing with an EC50 value of 1.4 μM, outperforming traditional antibiotics including ceftazidime and meropenem. In general, this paper describes an efficient platform for the identification and production of classes of anti-microbial compounds with potential unique modes of action.	1
Title: Genomic-Led Discovery of a Novel Glycopeptide Antibiotic by Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129 Abstract: Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are last defense line drugs against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Natural GPAs teicoplanin and vancomycin, as well as semisynthetic oritavancin, telavancin, and dalbavancin, are currently approved for clinical use. Although these antibiotics remain efficient, emergence of novel GPA-resistant pathogens is a question of time. Therefore, it is important to investigate the natural variety of GPAs coming from so-called "rare" actinobacteria. Herein we describe a novel GPA producer-Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129. Its de novo sequenced and completely assembled genome harbors a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) similar to the dbv BGC of A40926, the natural precursor to dalbavancin. The strain produces a novel GPA, which we propose is an A40926 analogue lacking the carboxyl group on the N-acylglucosamine moiety. This structural difference correlates with the absence of dbv29-coding for an enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the N-acylglucosamine moiety. Introduction of dbv29 into N. coxensis led to A40926 production in this strain. Finally, we successfully applied dbv3 and dbv4 heterologous transcriptional regulators to trigger and improve A50926 production in N. coxensis, making them prospective tools for screening other Nonomuraea spp. for GPA production. Our work highlights genus Nonomuraea as a still untapped source of novel GPAs.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the earthy odorant geosmin by a bifunctional Streptomyces coelicolor enzyme Abstract: Geosmin is responsible for the characteristic odor of moist soil, as well as off-flavors in drinking water and foodstuffs. Geosmin is generated from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, 2) by an enzyme that is encoded by the SCO6073 gene in the soil organism Streptomyces coelicolor A32 (ref. 3). We have now shown that the recombinant N-terminal half of this protein catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent cyclization of FPP to germacradienol and germacrene D, while the highly homologous C-terminal domain, previously thought to be catalytically silent, catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent conversion of germacradienol to geosmin. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the N- and C-terminal domains each harbor a distinct, independently functioning active site. A mutation in the N-terminal domain of germacradienol-geosmin synthase of a catalytically essential serine to alanine results in the conversion of FPP to a mixture of sesquiterpenes that includes an aberrant product identified as isolepidozene, which was previously suggested to be an enzyme-bound intermediate in the cyclization of FPP to germacradienol.	1
Title: pcd mutants of Streptomyces clavuligerus still produce cephamycin C Abstract: Biosynthesis of cephamycin C in Streptomyces clavuligerus involves the initial conversion of lysine to alpha-aminoadipic acid. Lysine-6-aminotransferase and piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase carry out this two-step reaction, and genes encoding each of these enzymes are found within the cephamycin C gene cluster. However, while mutation of the lat gene causes complete loss of cephamycin production, pcd mutants still produce cephamycin at 30% to 70% of wild-type levels. Cephamycin production by pcd mutants could be restored to wild-type levels either by supplementation of the growth medium with alpha-aminoadipic acid or by complementation of the mutation with an intact copy of the pcd gene. Neither heterologous PCR nor Southern analyses showed any evidence for the presence of a second pcd gene. Furthermore, cell extracts from pcd mutants lack detectable PCD activity. Cephamycin production in the absence of detectable PCD activity suggests that S. clavuligerus must have some alternate means of producing the aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine needed for cephamycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Insects represent a link between food animal farms and the urban environment for antibiotic resistance traits Abstract: Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections result in higher patient mortality rates, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Extensive use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the animal industry represents great pressure for evolution and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on farms. Despite growing evidence showing that antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in food animals correlate with resistance in human pathogens, the proof for direct transmission of antibiotic resistance is difficult to provide. In this review, we make a case that insects commonly associated with food animals likely represent a direct and important link between animal farms and urban communities for antibiotic resistance traits. Houseflies and cockroaches have been shown to carry multidrug-resistant clonal lineages of bacteria identical to those found in animal manure. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated proliferation of bacteria and horizontal transfer of resistance genes in the insect digestive tract as well as transmission of resistant bacteria by insects to new substrates. We propose that insect management should be an integral part of pre- and postharvest food safety strategies to minimize spread of zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistance traits from animal farms. Furthermore, the insect link between the agricultural and urban environment presents an additional argument for adopting prudent use of antibiotics in the food animal industry.	0
Title: Bioinformatic Mapping of Opine-Like Zincophore Biosynthesis in Bacteria Abstract: Zinc is an essential nutrient in biological systems due to its structural or catalytic requirement in proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. To meet this cellular demand, microbes must acquire sufficient zinc from their environment. However, many environments have low zinc availability. One of the mechanisms used by bacteria to acquire zinc is through the production of small molecules known as zincophores. Similar to bacterial siderophores used for iron uptake, zincophores are synthesized by the bacterium and exported and then reimported as zincophore-zinc complexes. Thus far, only four zincophores have been described, including two from the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which they play a critical role in zinc acquisition during infection, and one in a soil bacterium. To determine what other microbes may produce zincophores, we used bioinformatic analyses to identify new zincophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and predict the diversity of molecules synthesized. Genome neighborhood network analysis identified approximately 250 unique zincophore-producing species from actinobacteria, firmicutes, proteobacteria, and fusobacteria. This indicates that zincophores are produced by diverse bacteria that inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. Many of the BGCs likely produce characterized zincophores, based on similarity to the characterized systems. However, this analysis also identified numerous BGCs that, based on the colocalization of additional modifying enzymes and sequence divergence of the biosynthetic enzymes, are likely to produce unique zincophores. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the zincophore biosynthetic landscape that will be invaluable for future research on these important small molecules.IMPORTANCE Bacteria must acquire essential nutrients, including zinc, from their environment. For bacterial pathogens, this necessitates overcoming the host metal-withholding response known as nutritional immunity. A novel type of zinc uptake mechanism that involves the bacterial production of a small zinc-scavenging molecule was recently described in the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia pestis, as well as the soil-associated bacterium Paenibacillus mucilaginosus This suggests that zincophores may be important for zinc acquisition in diverse environments. In this study, we sought to identify other zincophore-producing bacteria using bioinformatics. We identified almost 250 unique zincophore-producing species, including human and animal pathogens, as well as isolates from soil, rhizosphere, plant, and marine habitats. Crucially, we observed diversity at the amino acid and gene organization levels, suggesting that many of these species are producing unique zincophores. Together, our findings highlight the importance of zincophores for a broad array of bacteria living in diverse environments.	1
Title: Bidirectional transcription of lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes from Campylobacter jejuni Abstract: The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecules of Campylobacter jejuni are involved in virulence and induction of the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This study analysed the transcription of the LOS synthesis genes from the GBS-inducing C. jejuni strain HB 93-13 under microaerobic conditions. Fourteen consecutive genes Cj1132c, waaC, htrB, wlaNC, wlaND, cgtA, cgtB, cstII, neuB, neuC, neuA, wlaVA, wlaQA, and waaF were included. The results of rapid amplification of cDNA ends and single-stranded ligation of complementary ends showed initiation sites with potential promoter regions on both DNA strands in the Cj1132c/waaC, cgtB/cstII, and wlaQA/waaF strand-switch regions. Other termini without recognisable promoter region were also found throughout the LOS gene cluster, suggesting a low specificity of the polymerase during transcription. In addition, all gene junction regions were cloned into the shuttle vector pMW10 carrying the promoterless lacZ gene to identify functional promoter sites. Bidirectional active promoters were found in the strand-switch regions. The results of RT-PCR and cDNA blotting indicated that transcriptional linkage occurred between different operons, indicating a lack of transcription termination within the LOS gene cluster. Moreover, the results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR showed that both DNA strands were transcribed but transcription of the coding strand was at a higher rate. The results presented here provide an insight into transcription of the LOS synthesis gene cluster of C. jejuni.	1
Title: Fluorous supported modular synthesis of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides Abstract: The modular synthesis of heparan sulfate fragments is greatly facilitated by employing an anomeric aminopentyl linker protected by a benzyloxycarbonyl group modified by a perfluorodecyl tag, which made it possible to purify highly polar intermediates by fluorous solid phase extraction. This tagging methodology made it also possible to perform repeated glycosylations to drive reactions to completion.	0
Title: Evidence of a Ca(2+)-(*)NO-cGMP signaling pathway controlling zoospore biogenesis in the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii Abstract: The sporulation stage of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii culminates with the formation and release to the medium of a number of zoospores, which are motile cells responsible for the dispersal of the fungus. The presence in the sporulation solution of 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a potent and selective inhibitor of nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclases, completely prevented biogenesis of the zoospores. In addition, this compound was able to significantly reduce cGMP levels, which increase drastically during late sporulation, suggesting the existence of a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism for cGMP synthesis. Furthermore, increased levels of nitric oxide-derived products were detected during sporulation by fluorescence assays using DAF-2 DA, whose signal was drastically reduced in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). These results were confirmed by quantitative chemiluminescent determination of the intracellular levels of nitric oxide-derived products. A putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was detected throughout sporulation, and this enzyme activity decreased significantly when L-NAME and 1-[2-(Trifluoromethyl)phenyl]imidazole (TRIM) were added to the assays. NOS assays carried out in the presence of EGTA showed decreased enzyme activity, suggesting the involvement of calcium ions in enzyme activation. Additionally, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding putative guanylyl cyclases and a cGMP-phosphodiesterase were found in B. emersonii EST database (http://blasto.iq.usp.br), and the mRNA levels of the corresponding genes were observed to increase during sporulation. Altogether, data presented here revealed the presence and expression of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP phosphodiesterase genes in B. emersonii and provided evidence of a Ca(2+)-(*)NO-cGMP signaling pathway playing a role in zoospore biogenesis.	0
Title: Identification of a novel type of silk protein and regulation of its expression Abstract: The silk of lepidopteran insects has been studied extensively as proteins of two categories: the fibroins, which are produced in the posterior section of silk glands, and the sericins, which are secreted in the middle section. We now describe a third category that is named seroins to accentuate the fact that both the sericin- and the fibroin-producing cells participate in seroin secretion. Using a probe derived from the N-terminal sequences of a 23-kDa components of Galleria mellonella silk, we isolated silk gland-specific cDNA encoding 167 amino acids, of which 17 constitute the signal peptide. The following 14 residues match the N-terminal sequences of the 23- and 22.5-kDa silk proteines. The reaction of these proteins with concanavalin A and the presence of two glycosylation sites in the seroin peptide sequence indicate that seroin is secreted in two forms that both contain a mannose-rich sugar moiety. Seroin is distinguished from other silk proteins by high proline content (34 residues or 20.26% by weight), lack of cysteines, and the presence of two kinds of short amino acid repeats. The seroin gene is expressed in both the posterior and middle silk gland sections. The expression fluctuates during development in correlation with the feeding regime and the changes in hormone titers: seroin mRNA is high in the silk glands of feeding larvae, declines at ecdysis, reaches a maximum during cocoon spinning, and thereafter rapidly drops to an undetectable level. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the drop is caused by ecdysteroid hormones and is prevented by juvenile hormones. N-terminal sequencing of several silk proteins of Bombyx mori revealed that the 8- and 13-kDa proteins share 5 or 6 out of 10 identified amino acids with the N terminus of Galleria seroin and obviously represent seroin homologues. The result suggests that seroin-type proteins are a general component of lepidopteran silk.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of ebelactone A: isotopic tracer, advanced precursor and genetic studies reveal a thioesterase-independent cyclization to give a polyketide β-lactone Abstract: Macrocyclization of polyketides generates arrays of molecular architectures that are directly linked to biological activities. The four-membered ring in oxetanones (β-lactones) is found in a variety of bioactive polyketides (for example, lipstatin, hymeglusin and ebelactone), yet details of its molecular assembly have not been extensively elucidated. Using ebelactone as a model system, and its producer Streptomyces aburaviensis ATCC 31860, labeling with sodium [1-(13)C,(18)O2]propionate afforded ebelactone A that contains (18)O at all oxygen sites. The pattern of (13)C-(18)O bond retention defines the steps for ebelactone biosynthesis, and demonstrates that β-lactone ring formation occurs by attack of a β-hydroxy group onto the carbonyl moiety of an acyclic precursor. Reaction of ebelactone A with N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) gives the β-hydroxyacyl thioester, which cyclizes quantitatively to give ebelactone A in aqueous ethanol. The putative gene cluster encoding the polyketide synthase (PKS) for biosynthesis of 1 was also identified; notably the ebelactone PKS lacks a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain and no stand alone TE was found. Thus the formation of ebelactone is not TE dependent, supporting the hypothesis that cyclization occurs on the PKS surface in a process that is modeled by the chemical cyclization of the NAC thioester.	1
Title: Highly Selective Palladium-Catalyzed Hydroborylative Carbocyclization of Bisallenes to Seven-Membered Rings Abstract: A highly selective palladium-catalyzed hydroborylative carbocyclization of bisallenes to afford seven-membered rings has been established. This ring-closing coupling reaction showed good functional group compatibility with high chemo- and regioselectivity, as seven-membered ring 3 was the only product obtained. The extensive use of different linkers, including nitrogen, oxygen, malononitrile, and malonate, showed a broad substrate scope for this approach. A one-pot cascade reaction was realized by trapping the primary allylboron compound with an aldehyde, affording a diastereomerically pure alcohol and a quaternary carbon center by formation of a new C-C bond. A comprehensive mechanistic DFT investigation is also presented. The calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a concerted hydropalladation pathway from a Pd(0)-olefin complex rather than via a pathway involving a defined palladium hydride species. The reaction was significantly accelerated by the coordination of the pendant olefin, as well as the introduction of suitable substituents in the bridge, due to the Thorpe-Ingold effect.	0
Title: The role of +TIPs in directional tip expansion Abstract: Aspergillus nidulans is an ideal model to study nuclear migration and intracellular transport by dynein and kinesin owing to its long neuron-like hyphae, conserved transport mechanisms, and powerful genetics. In this organism, as in other filamentous fungi, microtubules have been implicated in patterning cell shape through polarized tip growth - the hallmark mode of growth that generates the elongated hyphae. Exactly how microtubules regulate tip growth is incompletely understood and remains a fascinating question for various cell types, such as pollen tubes and root hairs. Zeng et al. (2014) describe important new findings in A. nidulans regarding the role of EBA, the master regulator of microtubule plus end-tracking proteins, in specifying microtubule dynamics required for directional tip growth at the hyphal tip.	0
Title: Phosphine-Activated Lysine Analogues for Fast Chemical Control of Protein Subcellular Localization and Protein SUMOylation Abstract: The Staudinger reduction and its variants have exceptional compatibility with live cells but can be limited by slow kinetics. Herein we report new small-molecule triggers that turn on proteins through a Staudinger reduction/self-immolation cascade with substantially improved kinetics and yields. We achieved this through site-specific incorporation of a new set of azidobenzyloxycarbonyl lysine derivatives in mammalian cells. This approach allowed us to activate proteins by adding a nontoxic, bioorthogonal phosphine trigger. We applied this methodology to control a post-translational modification (SUMOylation) in live cells, using native modification machinery. This work significantly improves the rate, yield, and tunability of the Staudinger reduction-based activation, paving the way for its application in other proteins and organisms.	0
Title: Tetarimycin A, an MRSA-active antibiotic identified through induced expression of environmental DNA gene clusters Abstract: The propagation of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples in laboratory-grown bacteria provides a means to study natural products encoded in the genomes of uncultured bacteria. However, gene silencing often hampers the functional characterization of gene clusters captured on environmental DNA clones. Here we show that the overexpression of transcription factors found in sequenced environmental DNA-derived biosynthetic gene clusters, in conjunction with traditional culture-broth extract screening, can be used to identify new bioactive secondary metabolites from otherwise-silent gene clusters. Tetarimycin A, a tetracyclic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotic, was isolated from the culture-broth extract of Streptomyces albus cultures cotransformed with an environmentally derived type-II polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster and its pathway-specific Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) cloned under the control of the constitutive ermE* promoter.	1
Title: New gene cluster for lantibiotic streptin possibly involved in streptolysin S formation Abstract: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a serum-extractable and oxygen-stable hemolysin produced by Group A Streptococcus. A SLS-deficient mutant in which transposon Tn 916 was inserted in a locus distinct from the sag gene cluster [Nizet et al. (2000) Infect. Immun. 68, 4245-4254] was obtained by filter mating of the transposon-harbouring Enterococcus faecalis strain and Streptococcus pyogenes BL(T). This mutant, N22, had completely lost the hemolytic activity, in consequence of insertion of a single Tn 916 into a hitherto-unknown lantibiotic gene cluster composed of 10 open reading frames. The arrangement and sequence of this lantibiotic gene cluster were similar to those of nisin and subtilin, and so we designated this new lantibiotic as streptin. The bactericidal activity of streptin was abolished on treatment with trypsin or proteinase K. The different host range and nucleotide sequence clearly distinguished streptin from streptococcins. Streptin was not hemolytic and its bacteriocin activity was independent of carrier oligonucleotides effective for SLS. The fact that N22 also lost the anti-bacterial activity against indicator streptococci reveals that the factor(s) required for lantibiotic formation plays an important role in SLS formation as well.	1
Title: Rational domain swaps decipher programming in fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases and resurrect an extinct metabolite Abstract: The mechanism of programming of iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases remains one of the key unsolved problems of secondary metabolism. We conducted rational domain swaps between the polyketide synthases encoding the biosynthesis of the closely related compounds tenellin and desmethylbassianin. Expression of the hybrid synthetases in Aspergillus oryzae led to the production of reprogrammed compounds in which the changes to the methylation pattern and chain length could be mapped to the domain swaps. These experiments reveal for the first time the origin of programming in these systems. Domain swaps combined with coexpression of two cytochrome P450 encoding genes from the tenellin biosynthetic gene cluster led to the resurrection of the extinct metabolite bassianin.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of a gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythraeus) which is involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: A 7.3 kbp DNA fragment, encompassing the erythromycin (Em) resistance gene (ermE) and a portion of the gene cluster encoding the biosynthetic genes for erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) has been cloned in Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ702, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined using a modified dideoxy chain-termination procedure. In particular, we have examined the region immediately 5' of the resistance determinant, where the tandem promoters for ermE overlap the promoters for a divergently transcribed coding sequence (ORF). Disruption of this ORF using an integrational pIJ702-based plasmid vector gave mutants which were specifically blocked in erythromycin biosynthesis, and which accumulated 3-O-alpha-L-mycarosylerythronolide B: this behaviour is identical to that of previously described eryC1 mutants. The eryC1-gene product, a protein of subunit Mr 39,200, is therefore involved either as a structural or as a regulatory gene in the formation of the deoxyamino-sugar desosamine or in its attachment to the macrolide ring.	1
Title: Distinguishing reversible from irreversible virus capsid assembly Abstract: Capsids of spherical viruses may be constructed from hundreds or thousands of copies of the major capsid protein(s). These assembly reactions are poorly understood. Here we consider the predicted behavior for assembly where the component reactions have weak association energy and are reversible and compare them to essentially irreversible reactions. The comparisons are based on mass action calculations and the behavior predicted from kinetic simulations where assembly is described as a cascade of low order reactions. Reversible reactions are characterized by a pseudo-critical concentration, whereas irreversible reactions consume all free subunits. Irreversible reactions are more susceptible to kinetic traps comprised of numerous small intermediates. In the case where only the ultimate step is irreversible, very low concentrations of intermediates slow the completion of the reaction so that overall it closely matches the predictions for the reversible reactions that make up the majority of the cascade. Data in the literature strongly support the hypothesis that most viruses are held together by many weak interactions.	0
Title: Construction of Lasso Peptide Fusion Proteins Abstract: Lasso peptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) typified by an isopeptide-bonded macrocycle between the peptide N-terminus and an aspartate or glutamate side chain. The C-terminal portion of the peptide threads through the N-terminal macrocycle to give the characteristic lasso fold. Because of the inherent stability, both proteolytic and often thermal, of lasso peptides, we became interested in whether proteins could be fused to the free C-terminus of lasso peptides. Here, we demonstrate fusion of two model proteins, the artificial leucine zipper A1 and the superfolder variant of GFP, to the C-terminus of the lasso peptide astexin-1. Successful lasso cyclization of the N-terminus of these fusion proteins requires a flexible linker in between the C-terminus of the lasso peptide and the N-terminus of the protein of interest. The ability to fuse lasso peptides to a protein of interest is an important step toward phage and bacterial display systems for the high-throughput screening of lasso peptide libraries for new functions.	0
Title: Physicochemical Characterization of Polymer-Stabilized Coacervate Protocells Abstract: The bottom-up construction of cell mimics has produced a range of membrane-bound protocells that have been endowed with functionality and biochemical processes reminiscent of living systems. The contents of these compartments, however, experience semidilute conditions, whereas macromolecules in the cytosol exist in protein-rich, crowded environments that affect their physicochemical properties, such as diffusion and catalytic activity. Recently, complex coacervates have emerged as attractive protocellular models because their condensed interiors would be expected to mimic this crowding better. Here we explore some relevant physicochemical properties of a recently developed polymer-stabilized coacervate system, such as the diffusion of macromolecules in the condensed coacervate phase, relative to in dilute solutions, the buffering capacity of the core, the molecular organization of the polymer membrane, the permeability characteristics of this membrane towards a wide range of compounds, and the behavior of a simple enzymatic reaction. In addition, either the coacervate charge or the cargo charge is engineered to allow the selective loading of protein cargo into the coacervate protocells. Our in-depth characterization has revealed that these polymer-stabilized coacervate protocells have many desirable properties, thus making them attractive candidates for the investigation of biochemical processes in stable, controlled, tunable, and increasingly cell-like environments.	0
Title: Verbesinosides A-F, 15,27-cyclooleanane saponins from the American native plant Verbesina virginica Abstract: Verbesinosides A-F (1-6), six new 15,27-cyclooleanane-type triterpenoid saponins carrying different aromatic acyl moieties on the aglycon, were isolated from the leaves and flowers of Verbesina virginica. Their structures were established by interpretation of spectroscopic data and chemical methods. The representative major saponin, verbesinoside A (1), has the structure 21-trimethoxybenzoyl 15alpha,27-cycloolean-12-en-3beta,21beta-diol-28-oic acid 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside. This is the first report of triterpenoid saponins possessing the unique 15,27-cyclooleanane skeleton. The anisotropic effects of the aromatic acyl moieties on the triterpenoid skeleton are discussed.	0
Title: Insights in the glycosylation steps during biosynthesis of the antitumor anthracycline cosmomycin: characterization of two glycosyltransferase genes Abstract: Glycosylation pattern in cosmomycins is a distinctive feature among anthracyclines. These antitumor compounds possess two trisaccharide chains attached at C-7 and C-10, each of them with structural variability, mainly at the distal deoxysugar moieties. We have characterized a 14-kb chromosomal region from Streptomyces olindensis containing 13 genes involved in cosmomycin biosynthesis. Two of the genes, cosG and cosK, coding for glycosyltransferase were inactivated with the generation of five new derivatives. Structural elucidation of these compounds showed altered glycosylation patterns indicating the capability of both glycosyltransferases of transferring deoxysugars to both sides of the aglycone and the flexibility of CosK with respect to the deoxysugar donor. A model is proposed for the glycosylation steps during cosmomycins biosynthesis.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolide concanamycin A in Streptomyces neyagawaensis ATCC 27449 Abstract: The macrolide antibiotic concanamycin A has been identified as an exceptionally potent inhibitor of the vacuolar (V-type) ATPase. Such compounds have been mooted as the basis of a potential drug treatment for osteoporosis, since the V-ATPase is involved in the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption that underlies this common condition. To enable combinatorial engineering of altered concanamycins, the biosynthetic gene cluster governing the biosynthesis of concanamycin A has been cloned from Streptomyces neyagawaensis and shown to span a region of over 100 kbp of contiguous DNA. An efficient transformation system has been developed for S. neyagawaensis and used to demonstrate the role of the cloned locus in the formation of concanamycin A. Sequence analysis of the 28 ORFs in the region has revealed key features of the biosynthetic pathway, in particular the biosynthetic origin of portions of the backbone, which arise from the unusual polyketide building blocks ethylmalonyl-CoA and methoxymalonyl-ACP, and the origin of the pendant deoxysugar moiety 4'-O-carbamoyl-2'-deoxyrhamnose, as well as the presence of a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by six giant ORFs. Examination of the methoxymalonyl-specific acyltransferase (AT) domains has led to recognition of an amino acid sequence motif which can be used to distinguish methylmalonyl-CoA- from methoxymalonyl-ACP-specific AT domains in natural PKSs.	1
Title: Genetic locus encoding functions involved in biosynthesis and outer membrane localization of xanthomonadin in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Abstract: Xanthomonadins are membrane-bound, brominated, aryl-polyene pigments specific to the genus Xanthomonas. We have characterized a genetic locus (pig) from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae which contains four open reading frames (ORFs) that are essential for xanthomonadin production. Three of these ORFs are homologous to acyl carrier proteins, dehydratases, and acyl transferases, suggesting a type II polyketide synthase pathway for xanthomonadin biosynthesis. The fourth ORF has no homologue in the database. For the first time, we report that a putative cytoplasmic membrane protein encoded in the pig locus is required for outer membrane localization of xanthomonadin in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. We also report the identification of a novel 145-bp palindromic Xanthomonas repetitive intergenic consensus element that is present in two places in the pig locus. We estimate that more than 100 copies of this element might be present in the genome of X. oryzae pv. oryzae and other xanthomonads.	1
Title: The Integrity of the Intradimer Interface of the Hepatitis B Virus Capsid Protein Dimer Regulates Capsid Self-Assembly Abstract: During the hepatitis B virus lifecycle, 120 copies of homodimeric capsid protein assemble around a copy of reverse transcriptase and viral RNA and go on to produce an infectious virion. Assembly needs to be tightly regulated by protein conformational change to ensure symmetry, fidelity, and reproducibility. Here, we show that structures at the intradimer interface regulate conformational changes at the distal interdimer interface and so regulate assembly. A pair of interacting charged residues, D78 from each monomer, conspicuously located at the top of a four-helix bundle that forms the intradimer interface, were mutated to serine to disrupt communication between the two monomers. The mutation slowed assembly and destabilized the dimer to thermal and chemical denaturation. Mutant dimers showed evidence of transient partial unfolding based on the appearance of new proteolytically sensitive sites. Though the mutant dimer was less stable, the resulting capsids were as stable as the wildtype, based on assembly and thermal denaturation studies. Cryo-EM image reconstructions of capsid indicated that the subunits adopted an "open" state more usually associated with a free dimer and that the spike tips were either disordered or highly flexible. Molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic explanations for these results, suggesting that D78 stabilizes helix 4a, which forms part of the intradimer interface, by capping its N-terminus and hydrogen-bonding to nearby residues, whereas the D78S mutation disrupts these interactions, leading to partial unwinding of helix 4a. This in turn weakens the connection from helix 4 and the intradimer interface to helix 5, which forms the interdimer interface.	0
Title: Genetic and biochemical characterization of hyicin 3682, the first bacteriocin reported for Staphylococcus hyicus Abstract: Hyicin 3682, the first bacteriocin reported for Staphylococcus hyicus, is a BsaCOL variant produced by S. hyicus 3682, a strain isolated from bovine milk. Hyicin 3682 is found in the culture supernatant, is bactericidal and its producing strain exhibits a much broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity than the producing strain of BsaCOL against several Gram-positive bacteria, which include foodborne pathogens, food-spoilage microorganisms and bacterial species of medical and veterinary importance. Sequencing of the genome of S. hyicus 3682 provided the nucleotide sequence of the entire gene cluster involved in hyicin 3682 production, which seems to be located on pRJ109, the single plasmid carried by this strain. This gene cluster is expressed and consists of 8525bp and of eight genes (hyiA, hyiB, hyiC, hyiD, hyiP, hyiF, hyiE and hyiG) encoded on the same DNA strand. The mature lantibiotic exhibits 91% identity to BsaCOL and its molecular mass was found to be ∼26Da higher due to two amino acid substitutions. S. hyicus 3682 proved to be only partially immune to its cognate bacteriocin up to 1024 AU/ml. Therefore, hyicin 3682, the first Bsa variant reported in coagulase-negative staphylococci, does exhibit antimicrobial and siblicidal activities.	1
Title: Bacteriophage Tail-Tube Assembly Studied by Proton-Detected 4D Solid-State NMR Abstract: Obtaining unambiguous resonance assignments remains a major bottleneck in solid-state NMR studies of protein structure and dynamics. Particularly for supramolecular assemblies with large subunits (>150 residues), the analysis of crowded spectral data presents a challenge, even if three-dimensional (3D) spectra are used. Here, we present a proton-detected 4D solid-state NMR assignment procedure that is tailored for large assemblies. The key to recording 4D spectra with three indirect carbon or nitrogen dimensions with their inherently large chemical shift dispersion lies in the use of sparse non-uniform sampling (as low as 2 %). As a proof of principle, we acquired 4D (H)COCANH, (H)CACONH, and (H)CBCANH spectra of the 20 kDa bacteriophage tail-tube protein gp17.1 in a total time of two and a half weeks. These spectra were sufficient to obtain complete resonance assignments in a straightforward manner without use of previous solution NMR data.	0
Title: Genome mining and biosynthesis of the Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor beauveriolide I and III in Cordyceps militaris Abstract: Ascomycete fungi Cordyceps are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, and numerous investigations have been carried out to uncover their biological activities. However, primary researches on the physiological effects of Cordyceps were committed using crude extracts. At present, there are only a few compounds which were comprehensively characterized from Cordyceps, partial owing to the low production. In order to scientifically take advantage of Cordyceps, we used the strategy of genome mining to discover bioactive compounds from Cordyceps militaris. We found the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor beauveriolides in the genome of C. militaris, and produced the compounds by heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. Production of beauveriolide I and III also was detected in both ferment mycelia and fruiting bodies of C. militaris. The possible biosynthetic pathway was proposed. Our studies unveil the active compounds of C. militaris against atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and provide the enzyme resources for the biosynthesis of new cyclodepsipeptide molecules.	1
Title: Dual catalysis. Merging photoredox with nickel catalysis: coupling of α-carboxyl sp³-carbons with aryl halides Abstract: Over the past 40 years, transition metal catalysis has enabled bond formation between aryl and olefinic (sp(2)) carbons in a selective and predictable manner with high functional group tolerance. Couplings involving alkyl (sp(3)) carbons have proven more challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of photoredox catalysis and nickel catalysis provides an alternative cross-coupling paradigm, in which simple and readily available organic molecules can be systematically used as coupling partners. By using this photoredox-metal catalysis approach, we have achieved a direct decarboxylative sp(3)-sp(2) cross-coupling of amino acids, as well as α-O- or phenyl-substituted carboxylic acids, with aryl halides. Moreover, this mode of catalysis can be applied to direct cross-coupling of C(sp³)-H in dimethylaniline with aryl halides via C-H functionalization.	0
Title: Characterization of the SgcF epoxide hydrolase supporting an (R)-vicinal diol intermediate for enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: C-1027 is a chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic consisting of an apoprotein and the C-1027 chromophore. The C-1027 chromophore possesses four distinct structural moieties-an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a benzoxazolinate, and an (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine-the latter two of which are proposed to be appended to the enediyne core via a convergent biosynthetic strategy. Here we report the in vitro characterization of SgcF, an epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster that catalyzes regio- and stereospecific hydrolysis of styrene oxide, serving as an enediyne core epoxide intermediate mimic, to form a vicinal diol. Abolishment of C-1027 production in the DeltasgcF mutant strain Streptomyces globisporus SB1010 unambiguously establishes that sgcF plays an indispensable role in C-1027 biosynthesis. SgcF efficiently hydrolyzes (S)-styrene oxide, displaying an apparent K(m) of 0.6 +/- 0.1 mM and k(cat) of 48 +/- 1 min(-1), via attack at the alpha-position to exclusively generate the (R)-phenyl vicinal diol, consistent with the stereochemistry of the C-1027 chromophore. These findings support the role of SgcF in the proposed convergent pathway for C-1027 biosynthesis, unveiling an (R)-vicinal diol as a key intermediate. Interestingly, SgcF can also hydrolyze (R)-styrene oxide to afford preferentially the (R)-phenyl vicinal diol via attack at the beta-position, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency (apparent K(m) of 2.0 +/- 0.4 mM and k(cat) = 4.3 +/- 0.3 min(-1)). Although the latter activity unlikely contributes to C-1027 biosynthesis in vivo, such enantioconvergence arising from complementary regioselective hydrolysis of a racemic substrate could be exploited to engineer epoxide hydrolases with improved regio- and/or enantiospecificity.	1
Title: Activity-based protein profiling as a robust method for enzyme identification and screening in extremophilic Archaea Abstract: Archaea are characterized by a unique life style in often environmental extremes but their thorough investigation is currently hampered by a limited set of suitable in vivo research methodologies. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) may be used to sensitively detect either native or heterogeneously expressed active enzymes in living archaea even under these extreme conditions. In combination with the development of a genetically engineered archaeal screening strain, ABPP can furthermore be used in functional enzyme screenings from (meta)genome samples. We anticipate that our ABPP approach may therefore find application in basic archaeal research but also in the discovery of novel enzymes from (meta)genome libraries.	0
Title: Salinipyrone and Pacificanone Are Biosynthetic By-products of the Rosamicin Polyketide Synthase Abstract: Salinipyrones and pacificanones are structurally related polyketides from Salinispora pacifica CNS-237 that are proposed to arise from the same modular polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line. Genome sequencing revealed a large macrolide PKS gene cluster that codes for the biosynthesis of rosamicin A and a series of new macrolide antibiotics. Mutagenesis experiments unexpectedly correlated salinipyrone and pacificanone biosynthesis to the rosamicin octamodule Spr PKS. Remarkably, this bifurcated polyketide pathway illuminates a series of enzymatic domain- and module-skipping reactions that give rise to natural polyketide product diversity. Our findings enlarge the growing knowledge of polyketide biochemistry and illuminate potential challenges in PKS bioengineering.	1
Title: Genotyping-Guided Discovery of Persiamycin A From Sponge-Associated Halophilic Streptomonospora sp. PA3 Abstract: Microbial natural products have been a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical industry, but the supply of novel bioactive secondary metabolites has diminished due to extensive exploration of the most easily accessible sources, namely terrestrial Streptomyces species. The Persian Gulf is a unique habitat for marine sponges, which contain diverse communities of microorganisms including marine Actinobacteria. These exotic ecosystems may cradle rare actinomycetes with high potential to produce novel secondary metabolites. In this study, we harvested 12 different species of sponges from two locations in the Persian Gulf and isolated 45 symbiotic actinomycetes to assess their biodiversity and sponge-microbe relationships. The isolates were classified into Nocardiopsis (24 isolates), Streptomyces (17 isolates) and rare genera (4 isolates) by 16S rRNA sequencing. Antibiotic activity tests revealed that culture extracts from half of the isolates displayed growth inhibitory effects against seven pathogenic bacteria. Next, we identified five strains with the genetic potential to produce aromatic polyketides by genotyping ketosynthase genes responsible for synthesis of carbon scaffolds. The combined data led us to focus on Streptomonospora sp. PA3, since the genus has rarely been examined for its capacity to produce secondary metabolites. Analysis of culture extracts led to the discovery of a new bioactive aromatic polyketide denoted persiamycin A and 1-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-naphthoic acid. The genome harbored seven gene clusters involved in secondary metabolism, including a tetracenomycin-type polyketide synthase pathway likely involved in persiamycin formation. The work demonstrates the use of multivariate data and underexplored ecological niches to guide the drug discovery process for antibiotics and anticancer agents.	1
Title: Thiostrepton biosynthesis: prototype for a new family of bacteriocins Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics are a group of highly modified peptide metabolites. The defining scaffold for the thiopeptides is a macrocycle containing a dehydropiperidine or pyridine ring, dehydrated amino acids, and multiple thiazole or oxazole rings. Some members of the thiopeptides, such as thiostrepton, also contain either a quinaldic acid or indolic acid substituent derived from tryptophan. Although the amino acid precursors of these metabolites are well-established, the biogenesis of these complex peptides has remained elusive. Whole-genome scanning of Streptomyces laurentii permitted identification of a thiostrepton prepeptide, TsrA, and involvement of TsrA in thiostrepton biosynthesis was confirmed by mutagenesis. A gene cluster responsible for thiostrepton biosynthesis is reported, and the encoded gene products are discussed. The disruption of a gene encoding an amidotransferase, tsrT, led to the loss of thiostrepton production and the detection of a new metabolite, contributing further support to the identification of the tsr cluster. The tsr locus also appears to possess the gene products needed to convert tryptophan to the quinaldic acid moiety, and an aminotransferase was found to catalyze an early step in this pathway. This work establishes that the thiopeptides are a type of bacteriocin, a family of genetically encoded antimicrobial peptides, and are subjected to extensive posttranslational modification during maturation of the prepeptide.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of violacein biosynthesis by Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Chromobacterium violaceum presents a distinctive phenotypic characteristic, the production of a deep violet pigment named violacein. Although the physiological function of this pigment is not well understood, the sequencing of the genome of this bacterium has given some insight into the mechanisms and control of violacein production. It was found that erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), a precursor to aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, is produced by the non-oxidative portion of the hexose monophosphate pathway, since it lacks 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. All genes leading from E4P plus phosphoenolpyruvate to tryptophan are present in the genome. Nevertheless, these genes are not organized in an operon, as in E. coli, indicating that other mechanisms are involved in expression. The sequencing data also indicated the presence and organization of an operon for violacein biosynthesis. Three of the four gene products of this operon presented similarity with nucleotide-dependent monooxygenases and one with a limiting enzyme polyketide synthase. As previously suggested, genes encoding proteins involved in quorum sensing control by N-hexanoyl-homoserine-lactone, an autoinducer signal molecule, are present in the bacterial genome. These data should help guide strategies to increase violacein biosynthesis, a potentially useful molecule.	1
Title: Porous metal carboxylate boron imidazolate frameworks Abstract: Integrated Material for Efficient CO2 Storage A new family of porous materials with tunable gas sorption properties have been made by integrating metal carboxylates and boron imidazolates under hydro- or solvothermal conditions. One hydrothermally synthesized phase exhibits a very high volumetric CO2 storage capacity at 81 L/L (273K, 1atm).	0
Title: 1,8-Naphthalimide Derivative Dyes with Large Stokes Shifts for Targeting Live-Cell Mitochondria Abstract: An ideal fluorescent dye for staining cell organelles should have multiple properties including specificity, stability, biocompatibility, and a large Stokes shift. Tunable photophysical properties enable 1,8-naphthalimide to serve as an excellent fluorophore in biomedical applications. Many naphthalimide derivatives have been developed into drugs, sensors, and other dyes. In this study, a series of 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives targeting live cell mitochondria were synthesized. Among these probes, Mt-4 was characterized as the best one, with highly specific mitochondrial localization, low cytotoxicity, and a large Stokes shift. More importantly, Mt-4 stood out as a potential mitochondrial dye for living-cell experiments involving induced mitochondrial stress arising from the treatments because Mt-4 shows enhanced fluorescence in mitochondrial stress situations.	0
Title: Azaphilones biosynthesis complements the defence mechanism of Trichoderma guizhouense against oxidative stress Abstract: Filamentous fungi are known as producers of a large array of diverse secondary metabolites (SMs) that aid in securing their environmental niche. Here, we demonstrated that the SMs have an additional role in fungal defence against other fungi: Trichoderma guizhouense, a mycoparasite, is able to antagonize Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 (Foc4) by forming aerial hyphae that kill the host with hydrogen peroxide. At the same time, a gene cluster comprising two polyketide synthases is strongly expressed. Using functional genetics, we characterized this cluster and identified its products as azaphilones (termed as trigazaphilones). The trigazaphilones were found lacking of antifungal toxicity but exhibited high radical scavenging activities. The antioxidant property of trigazaphilones was in vivo functional under various tested conditions of oxidative stress. Thus, we conclude that the biosynthesis of trigazaphilones serves as a complementary antioxidant mechanism and defends T. guizhouense against the hydrogen peroxide that it produces to combat other fungi like Foc4.	1
Title: Genome mining in Streptomyces clavuligerus: expression and biochemical characterization of two new cryptic sesquiterpene synthases Abstract: Two presumptive terpene synthases of unknown biochemical function encoded by the sscg_02150 and sscg_03688 genes of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27074 were individually expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal-His₆-tag proteins, using codon-optimized synthetic genes. Incubation of recombinant SSCG_02150 with farnesyl diphosphate (1, FPP) gave (-)-δ-cadinene (2) while recombinant SSCG_03688 converted FPP to (+)-T-muurolol (3). Individual incubations of (-)-δ-cadinene synthase with [1,1-²H₂]FPP (1a), (1S)-[1-²H]-FPP (1b), and (1R)-[1-²H]-FPP (1c) and NMR analysis of the resulting samples of deuterated (-)-δ-cadinene supported a cyclization mechanism involving the intermediacy of nerolidyl diphosphate (4) leading to a helminthogermacradienyl cation 5. Following a 1,3-hydride shift of the original H-1(si) of FPP, cyclization and deprotonation will give (-)-δ-cadinene. Similar incubations with recombinant SSCG_03688 supported an analogous mechanism for the formation of (+)-T-muurolol (3), also involving a 1,3-hydride shift of the original H-1(si) of FPP.	1
Title: Genetic modulation of the overexpression of tailoring genes eryK and eryG leading to the improvement of erythromycin A purity and production in Saccharopolyspora erythraea fermentation Abstract: Erythromycin A (Er-A) is the most potent and clinically important member in the Er family produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Er-B and Er-C, which are biologically much less active and cause greater side effects than Er-A, serve as the intermediates for Er-A biosynthesis and impurities in fermentation processes of many industrial strains. In this study, systematical modulation of the amounts of tailoring enzymes EryK (a P450 hydroxylase) and EryG (an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase) was carried out by genetic engineering in S. erythraea, including alterations of gene copy number ratio and organization and integrating the locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. Introduction of additional eryK and eryG genes into S. erythraea showed significant impacts on their transcription levels and enhanced the biotransformation process from Er-D to Er-A with gene dose effects. At the eryK/eryG copy number ratio of 3:2 as well as their resultant transcript ratio of around 2.5:1 to 3.0:1, Er-B and Er-C were nearly completely eliminated and accordingly converted to Er-A, and the Er titer was improved by around 25% in the recombinant strain ZL1004 (genotype PermK*-K-K-G + PermE*-K + PermA*-G) and ZL1007 (genotype PermK*-K-G-K + PermE*-K + PermA*-G). This study may contribute to the continuous efforts toward further evaluation of the Er-producing system, with the aims of improving Er-A purity and production at the fermentation stage and lowering the production costs and environmental concerns in industry.	1
Title: Discovery of a Phosphonoacetic Acid Derived Natural Product by Pathway Refactoring Abstract: The activation of silent natural product gene clusters is a synthetic biology problem of great interest. As the rate at which gene clusters are identified outpaces the discovery rate of new molecules, this unknown chemical space is rapidly growing, as too are the rewards for developing technologies to exploit it. One class of natural products that has been underrepresented is phosphonic acids, which have important medical and agricultural uses. Hundreds of phosphonic acid biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified encoding for unknown molecules. Although methods exist to elicit secondary metabolite gene clusters in native hosts, they require the strain to be amenable to genetic manipulation. One method to circumvent this is pathway refactoring, which we implemented in an effort to discover new phosphonic acids from a gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. strain NRRL F-525. By reengineering this cluster for expression in the production host Streptomyces lividans, utility of refactoring is demonstrated with the isolation of a novel phosphonic acid, O-phosphonoacetic acid serine, and the characterization of its biosynthesis. In addition, a new biosynthetic branch point is identified with a phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which was used to identify additional phosphonic acid gene clusters that share phosphonoacetic acid as an intermediate.	1
Title: Bacterial disease resistance in Arabidopsis through flagellin perception Abstract: Plants and animals recognize microbial invaders by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as flagellin. However, the importance of flagellin perception for disease resistance has, until now, not been demonstrated. Here we show that treatment of plants with flg22, a peptide representing the elicitor-active epitope of flagellin, induces the expression of numerous defence-related genes and triggers resistance to pathogenic bacteria in wild-type plants, but not in plants carrying mutations in the flagellin receptor gene FLS2. This induced resistance seems to be independent of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling. Wild-type and fls2 mutants both display enhanced resistance when treated with crude bacterial extracts, even devoid of elicitor-active flagellin, indicating the existence of functional perception systems for PAMPs other than flagellin. Although fls2 mutant plants are as susceptible as the wild type when bacteria are infiltrated into leaves, they are more susceptible to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 when it is sprayed on the leaf surface. Thus, flagellin perception restricts bacterial invasion, probably at an early step, and contributes to the plant's disease resistance.	0
Title: Biosynthetic characterization and chemoenzymatic assembly of the cryptophycins. Potent anticancer agents from cyanobionts Abstract: The lichen cyanobacterial symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 are prolific producers of natural products, generating >25 derivatives of the cryptophycin class of secondary metabolites. Cryptophycin 1, the prototypic member of the class, is a potent tubulin-depolymerizing agent, and several semisynthetic derivatives are being developed as anticancer therapeutics. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the cryptophycin metabolic pathway by stable-isotope labeling experiments and through cloning, sequencing, and annotating the cryptophycin biosynthetic gene cluster. A comparative secondary metabolomic analysis based on polyketide (PK)/non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters from the phylogenetically related, non-cryptophycin producing cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, was used to identify the cryptophycin biosynthetic genes that encompass approximately 40 kb within the lichen symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genome. The pathway encodes a collinear set of enzymes, including three modular PK synthases, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules, and an integrated adenylation/ketoreductase didomain for elaboration of the leucic acid subunit. In addition, genes encoding key tailoring steps, including a FAD-dependent halogenase and CYP450 epoxidase, were identified. The inherent flexibility of the cryptophycin biosynthetic enzymes was harnessed to generate a suite of new analogues by altering the pool of PK starter units and selected amino acid extender groups. Characterization of the cryptophycin CYP450 enabled development of the first stereospecific synthesis of cryptophycin 2, through a tandem chemoenzymatic synthesis from the natural seco-cryptophycin 4 chain elongation intermediate.	1
Title: Prevalence of hicAB, lav, traA, and hifBC among Haemophilus influenzae middle ear and throat strains Abstract: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important cause of illness among children. To further understand the role of laterally transferred genes in NTHi colonization and otitis media, the prevalence of hicAB, lav, tnaA, and hifBC was determined among 44 middle ear and 35 throat NTHi isolates by dot-blot hybridization.	0
Title: Genetically engineered production of 1,1'-bis-valienamine and validienamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus and their conversion to valienamine Abstract: The antifungal agent validamycin A is an important crop protectant and the source of valienamine, the precursor of the antidiabetic drug voglibose. Inactivation of the valN gene in the validamycin A producer, Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008, resulted in a mutant strain that produces new secondary metabolites 1,1'-bis-valienamine and validienamycin. The chemical structures of 1,1'-bis-valienamine and validienamycin were elucidated by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with mass spectrometry and bioconversion employing a glycosyltransferase enzyme, ValG. 1,1'-Bis-valienamine and validienamycin exhibit a moderate antifungal activity against Pellicularia sasakii. Chemical degradation of 1,1'-bis-valienamine using N-bromosuccinimide followed by purification of the products with ion-exchange column chromatography only resulted in valienamine, whereas parallel treatments of validoxylamine A, the aglycon of validamycin A, resulted in an approximately 1:1 mixture of valienamine and validamine, underscoring the advantage of 1,1'-bis-valienamine over validoxylamine A as a commercial source of valienamine.	0
Title: Purine metabolite inosine is an adrenergic neurotrophic substance for cultured chicken sympathetic neurons Abstract: Purines are ubiquitous endogenous cellular metabolites that have been postulated as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the nervous system. Recently, we showed that a low-molecular-mass component present in liver-conditioned medium selectively enhances the adrenergic properties of dissociated chicken sympathetic neurons in culture. We report here that this substance is inosine, a purine metabolite. Indeed, analysis of the low-molecular-mass fraction of liver-conditioned medium by HPLC shows that the neurotrophic activity coelutes with and has the same absorption spectrum as inosine. Inosine increases incorporation of [3H]leucine into neuronal protein and stimulates catecholamine, but not acetylcholine, production by the sympathetic neurons in a dose-dependent fashion (half-maximal stimulation at 10(-6) M). This effect can be blocked by 5 x 10(-6) M dipyridamole, an inhibitor of nucleoside transport. Inosine therefore appears to be capable of modulating adrenergic phenotypic expression in cultured sympathetic neurons by acting via an as-yet-unknown intracellular pathway.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and secretion of the microbial sulfated peptide RaxX and binding to the rice XA21 immune receptor Abstract: The rice immune receptor XA21 is activated by the sulfated microbial peptide required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity X (RaxX) produced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Mutational studies and targeted proteomics revealed that the RaxX precursor peptide (proRaxX) is processed and secreted by the protease/transporter RaxB, the function of which can be partially fulfilled by a noncognate peptidase-containing transporter component B (PctB). proRaxX is cleaved at a Gly-Gly motif, yielding a mature peptide that retains the necessary elements for RaxX function as an immunogen and host peptide hormone mimic. These results indicate that RaxX is a prokaryotic member of a previously unclassified and understudied group of eukaryotic tyrosine sulfated ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). We further demonstrate that sulfated RaxX directly binds XA21 with high affinity. This work reveals a complete, previously uncharacterized biological process: bacterial RiPP biosynthesis, secretion, binding to a eukaryotic receptor, and triggering of a robust host immune response.	1
Title: Harnessing the synthetic capabilities of glycopeptide antibiotic tailoring enzymes: characterization of the UK-68,597 biosynthetic cluster Abstract: In this study, a draft genome sequence of Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 53533 was assembled, and an 81-kb biosynthetic cluster for the unusual sulfated glycopeptide UK-68,597 was identified. Glycopeptide antibiotics are important in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Glycopeptides contain heptapeptide backbones that are modified by many tailoring enzymes, including glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, methyltransferases, and halogenases, generating extensive chemical and functional diversity. Several tailoring enzymes in the cluster were examined in vitro for their ability to modify glycopeptides, resulting in the synthesis of novel molecules. Tailoring enzymes were also expressed in the producer of the glycopeptide aglycone A47934, generating additional chemical diversity. This work characterizes the biosynthetic program of UK-68,597 and demonstrates the capacity to expand glycopeptide chemical diversity by harnessing the unique chemistry of tailoring enzymes.	1
Title: Analysis of a new cluster of genes involved in the synthesis of the unique volatile organic compound sodorifen of Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 Abstract: The rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 emits the novel and unique volatile sodorifen (C16H26), which has a polymethylated bicyclic structure. Transcriptome analysis revealed that gene SOD_c20750 (annotated as terpene cyclase) is involved in the biosynthesis of sodorifen. Here we show that this gene is located in a small cluster of four genes (SOD_c20750 - SOD_c20780), and the analysis of the knockout mutants demonstrated that SOD_c20760 (annotated as methyltransferase) and SOD_c20780 (annotated as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) isomerase) are needed for the biosynthesis of sodorifen, while a sodorifen-negative phenotype was not achieved with the SOD_c20770 (annotated as deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) synthase) mutant. Altogether, the function of this new gene cluster was assigned to the biosynthesis of this structurally unusual volatile compound sodorifen.	1
Title: L-Rhamnose-containing supramolecular nanofibrils as potential immunosuppressive materials Abstract: An l-rhamnose-based hydrogelator self-assembles to form nanofibrils, which, in contrast to the properties of monomeric l-rhamnose, suppress the antibody response of mice to phycoerythrin (PE), a fluorescent protein antigen. As the first example of the supramolecular assemblies of a saccharide to suppress immunity, this work illustrates a new approach of immunomodulation.	0
Title: Generation of new landomycins by combinatorial biosynthetic manipulation of the LndGT4 gene of the landomycin E cluster in S. globisporus Abstract: A 3 kb DNA fragment from the Streptomyces globisporus 1912 landomycin E (LaE) biosynthetic gene cluster (lnd) was completely sequenced. Three open reading frames were identified, lndGT4, lndZ4, and lndZ5, whose probable translation products resemble a glycosyltransferase, a reductase, and a hydroxylase, respectively. Studies of generated mutants from disruption and complementation experiments involving the lndGT4 gene allowed us to determine that LndGT4 controls the terminal L-rhodinose sugar attachment during LaE biosynthesis and that LndZ4/LndZ5 are responsible for the unique C11-hydroxylation of the landomycins. Generation of the novel landomycins F, G, and H in the course of these studies provided evidence for the flexibility of lnd glycosyltransferases toward their acceptor substrates and a basis for initial structure-activity relationships within the landomycin family of antibiotics.	1
Title: How Phosphorylation and ATPase Activity Regulate Anion Flux though the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR, ABCC7), mutations of which cause cystic fibrosis, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and works as a channel for small anions, such as chloride and bicarbonate. Anion channel activity is known to depend on phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and CFTR-ATPase activity. Whereas anion channel activity has been extensively investigated, phosphorylation and CFTR-ATPase activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the two processes can be measured in a label-free and non-invasive manner in real time in live cells, stably transfected with CFTR. This study reveals three key findings. (i) The major contribution (≥90%) to the total CFTR-related ATP hydrolysis rate is due to phosphorylation by PKA and the minor contribution (≤10%) to CFTR-ATPase activity. (ii) The mutant CFTR-E1371S that is still conductive, but defective in ATP hydrolysis, is not phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation requires a functional nucleotide binding domain and occurs in the post-hydrolysis transition state. (iii) CFTR-ATPase activity is inversely related to CFTR anion flux. The present data are consistent with a model in which CFTR is in a closed conformation with two ATPs bound. The open conformation is induced by ATP hydrolysis and corresponds to the post-hydrolysis transition state that is stabilized by phosphorylation and binding of chloride channel potentiators.	0
Title: Chlorizidine, a cytotoxic 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one-containing alkaloid from a marine Streptomyces sp Abstract: Cultivation of an obligate marine Streptomyces strain has provided the cytotoxic natural product chlorizidine A. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the metabolite is composed of a chlorinated 2,3-dihydropyrrolizine ring attached to a chlorinated 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one. The carbon stereocenter in the dihydropyrrolizine is S-configured. Remarkably, the 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one moiety has no precedence in the field of natural products. The presence of this ring system, which was demonstrated to undergo facile nucleophilic substitution reactions at the activated carbonyl group, is essential to the molecule's cytotoxicity against HCT-116 human colon cancer cells.	1
Title: Discovery and Biosynthesis of Neoenterocins Indicate a Skeleton Rearrangement of Enterocin Abstract: Two polyketides neoenterocins A (1) and B (2), featuring a neighboring dicarbonyl motif and a furan-containing 5/6 ring system, were isolated from the enterocin producer Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 11863. Heterologous expression, gene disruptions, and isotope feeding experiments indicated that 1 and 2 were derived from the enterocin biosynthetic gene cluster. However, 2 was demonstrated as an artifact from enterocin via a unique skeleton rearrangement.	1
Title: Peroxisome biogenesis in Hansenula polymorpha: different mutations in genes, essential for peroxisome biogenesis, cause different peroxisomal mutant phenotypes Abstract: In Hansenula polymorpha, different monogenic recessive mutations mapped in either of two previously identified genes, PER1 and PER3, produced different peroxisomal mutant phenotypes. Among five per1 mutants, four showed a Pim- phenotype: the cells contained few small peroxisomes while the bulk of the matrix enzymes resided in the cytosol. One of these mutants, per1-124 had an enhanced rate of peroxisome proliferation. The fifth mutant completely lacked peroxisomes (Per- phenotype). Of seven per3 mutants, four displayed a Pim- phenotype, two others a Per- phenotype, while one mutant showed pH-dependent growth on methanol and was affected in oligomerization of peroxisomal matrix protein. Thus, the protein products of both PER1 and PER3 genes appear to be essential in different aspects of peroxisome assembly/proliferation.	0
Title: Combined Amperometry and Electrochemical Cytometry Reveal Differential Effects of Cocaine and Methylphenidate on Exocytosis and the Fraction of Chemical Release Abstract: Amperometry with nanotip electrodes has been applied to show cocaine and methylphenidate not only trigger declines in vesicle content and exocytotic catecholamine release in a model cell line but also differentially change the fraction of transmitter released from each individual vesicle. In addition, cocaine accelerates exocytotic release dynamics while they remain unchanged after methylphenidate treatment. The parameters from pre-spike feet for the two drugs are also in opposition, suggesting this aspect of release is affected differentially. As cocaine and methylphenidate are psychostimulants with similar pharmacologic action but have opposite effects on cognition, these results might provide a missing link between the regulation of exocytosis and vesicles and the effect of this regulation on cognition, learning, and memory. A speculative chemical mechanism of the effect of these drugs on vesicle content and exocytosis is presented.	0
Title: Ca2+ dysregulation in Ryr1(I4895T/wt) mice causes congenital myopathy with progressive formation of minicores, cores, and nemaline rods Abstract: Ryr1(I4895T/wt) (IT/+) mice express a knockin mutation corresponding to the human I4898T EC-uncoupling mutation in the type 1 ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1), which causes a severe form of central core disease (CCD). IT/+ mice exhibit a slowly progressive congenital myopathy, with neonatal respiratory stress, skeletal muscle weakness, impaired mobility, dorsal kyphosis, and hind limb paralysis. Lesions observed in myofibers from diseased mice undergo age-dependent transformation from minicores to cores and nemaline rods. Early ultrastructural abnormalities include sarcomeric misalignment, Z-line streaming, focal loss of cross-striations, and myofibrillar splitting and intermingling that may arise from defective myofibrillogenesis. However, manifestation of the disease phenotype is highly variable on a Sv129 genomic background. Quantitative RT-PCR shows an equimolar ratio of WT and mutant Ryr1 transcripts within IT/+ myofibers and total RyR1 protein expression levels are normal. We propose a unifying theory in which the cause of core formation lies in functional heterogeneity among RyR1 tetramers. Random combinations of normal and either leaky or EC-uncoupled RyR subunits would lead to spatial differences in Ca(2+) transients; the resulting heterogeneity of contraction among myofibrils would lead to focal, irreversible tearing and shearing, which would, over time, enlarge to form minicores, cores, and nemaline rods. The IT/+ mouse line is proposed to be a valid model of RyR1-related congenital myopathy, offering high potential for elucidation of the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle disorders arising from impaired EC coupling.	0
Title: Synthesis of demissidine by a ring fragmentation 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition approach Abstract: A synthesis of the steroidal alkaloid demissidine from epiandrosterone is reported. A ring fragmentation reaction that efficiently ruptured the D-ring of a diazo ester derivative of epiandrosterone to provide an aldehyde tethered ynoate product was key to this sequence. Incorporation of the indolizidine framework was achieved by an azomethine ylide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.	0
Title: X-ray diffraction "fingerprinting" of DNA structure in solution for quantitative evaluation of molecular dynamics simulation Abstract: Solution state x-ray diffraction fingerprinting is demonstrated as a method for experimentally assessing the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Fourier transforms of coordinate data from MD simulations are used to produce reciprocal space "fingerprints" of atomic pair distance correlations that are characteristic of the ensemble and are the direct numerical analogues of experimental solution x-ray diffraction (SXD). SXD experiments and MD simulations were carried out to test the ability of experiment and simulation to resolve sequence-dependent modifications in helix conformation for B-form DNA. SXD experiments demonstrated that solution-state poly(AT) and poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA sequences exist in ensembles close to canonical B-form and B'-form structures, respectively. In contrast, MD simulations analyzed in terms of SXD fingerprints are shown to deviate from experiment, most significantly for poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA. Compared with experiment, MD simulation shortcomings were found to include both mismatches in simulated conformer structures and number population within the ensembles. This work demonstrates an experimental approach for quantitatively evaluating MD simulations and other coordinate models to simulate biopolymer structure in solution and suggests opportunities to use solution diffraction data as experimental benchmarks for developing supramolecular force fields optimized for a range of in situ applications.	0
Title: Oxepin Formation in Fungi Implies Specific and Stereoselective Ring Expansion Abstract: Oxepinamides are fungal oxepine-pyrimidinone-ketopiperazine derivatives. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of oxepinamide D in Aspergillus ustus by gene deletion, heterologous expression, feeding experiments, and enzyme assays. We demonstrated that the cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyzed highly specific and stereoselective oxepin ring formation.	1
Title: NMR studies of the phosphotransfer domain of the histidine kinase CheA from Escherichia coli: assignments, secondary structure, general fold, and backbone dynamics Abstract: Multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques were applied to study the phosphotransfer domain, residues 1-134, of the histidine kinase CheA, from Escherichia coli, which contains the site of autophosphorylation, His48. Assignments of the backbone amide groups and side chain protons are nearly complete. Our studies show that this protein fragment consists of five alpha-helices (A-E) connected by turns. Analysis of NOE distance restraints provided by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-1H and three-dimensional (3D) 15N-edited NOESY spectra using model building and structure calculations indicates that the five helices form an antiparallel helix bundle with near-neighbor connectivity. The amino-terminal four helices are proposed to be arranged in a right-handed manner with helix E packing against helices C and D. From ideal hydrophobic helical packing and structure calculations, the site of autophosphorylation, His48, is nearly fully exposed to the solvent. We measured the NMR relaxation properties of the backbone 15N nuclei using inverse detected two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The protein backbone dynamics studies show that CheA1-134 is formed into a tight and compact structure with very limited flexibilities both in helices and turns. Structural implications of titration and phosphorylation experiments are briefly discussed.	0
Title: Ligand-promoted alkylation of C(sp3)-H and C(sp2)-H bonds Abstract: 9-Methylacridine was identified as a generally effective ligand to promote a Pd(II)-catalyzed C(sp(3))-H and C(sp(2))-H alkylation of simple amides with various alkyl iodides. This alkylation reaction was applied to the preparation of unnatural amino acids and geometrically controlled tri- and tetrasubstituted acrylic acids.	0
Title: New insights into the genetic organization of the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster in Chromobacterium violaceum no. 968 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of FK228, an FDA-approved anticancer natural product, was identified and sequenced previously. The genetic organization of this gene cluster has now been delineated through systematic gene deletion and transcriptional analysis. As a result, the gene cluster is redefined to contain 12 genes: depA through depJ, depM, and a newly identified pathway regulatory gene, depR.	1
Title: Optimizing glycosyltransferase specificity via "hot spot" saturation mutagenesis presents a catalyst for novobiocin glycorandomization Abstract: A comprehensive two-phase "hot spot" saturation mutagenesis strategy for the rapid evolution of glycosyltransferase (GT) specificity for nonnatural acceptors is described. Specifically, the application of a high-throughput screen (based on the fluorescent acceptor umbelliferone) was used to identify key amino acid hot spots that contribute to GT proficiency and/or promiscuity. Saturation mutagenesis of the corresponding hot spots facilitated the utilization of a lower-throughput screen to provide OleD prodigy capable of efficiently glycosylating the nonnatural acceptor novobiocic acid with an array of unique sugars. Incredibly, even in the absence of a high-throughput screen for novobiocic acid glycosylation, this approach rapidly led to improvements in the desired catalytic activity of several hundred-fold.	0
Title: Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 produces enantio-pyochelin, the optical antipode of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin Abstract: The siderophore pyochelin is made by a thiotemplate mechanism from salicylate and two molecules of cysteine. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the first cysteine residue is converted to its D-isoform during thiazoline ring formation whereas the second cysteine remains in its L-configuration, thus determining the stereochemistry of the two interconvertible pyochelin diastereoisomers as 4'R, 2''R, 4''R (pyochelin I) and 4'R, 2''S, 4''R (pyochelin II). Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 was found to make a different stereoisomeric mixture, which promoted growth under iron limitation in strain CHA0 and induced the expression of its biosynthetic genes, but was not recognized as a siderophore and signaling molecule by P. aeruginosa. Reciprocally, pyochelin promoted growth and induced pyochelin gene expression in P. aeruginosa, but was not functional in P. fluorescens. The structure of the CHA0 siderophore was determined by mass spectrometry, thin-layer chromatography, NMR, polarimetry, and chiral HPLC as enantio-pyochelin, the optical antipode of the P. aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin. Enantio-pyochelin was chemically synthesized and confirmed to be active in CHA0. Its potential biosynthetic pathway in CHA0 is discussed.	1
Title: The structure of manumycin. II. Derivatives Abstract: Derivatives of manumycin (1) were obtained by acetylation and reduction, respectively, and characterized by their spectroscopic data. Structure-activity relationships of the antibiotic were discussed.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Heterologous Expression of Cacaoidin, the First Member of the Lanthidin Family of RiPPs Abstract: Cacaoidin is produced by the strain Streptomyces cacaoi CA-170360 and represents the first member of the new lanthidin (class V lanthipeptides) RiPP family. In this work, we describe the complete identification, cloning and heterologous expression of the cacaoidin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows unique RiPP genes whose functions were not predicted by any bioinformatic tool. We also describe that the cacaoidin pathway is restricted to strains of the subspecies Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. cacaoi found in public genome databases, where we have also identified the presence of other putative class V lanthipeptide pathways. This is the first report on the heterologous production of a class V lanthipeptide.	1
Title: Insecticidal Specificity of Cry1Ah to Helicoverpa armigera Is Determined by Binding of APN1 via Domain II Loops 2 and 3 Abstract: Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ah protein is highly toxic against Helicoverpa armigera but shows no toxicity against Bombyx mori larvae. In contrast, the closely related Cry1Ai toxin showed the opposite phenotype: high activity against B. mori but no toxicity against H. armigera. Analysis of binding of Cry1Ah to brush border membrane vesicle (BBMV) proteins from H. armigera and B. mori by surface plasmon resonance revealed association of toxin binding with insect specificity. Pulldown experiments identified aminopeptidase N1 (APN1) as a Cry1Ah binding protein that was not observed in the assays using B. mori BBMV proteins. The APN1 Cry1Ah binding region was narrowed to the region from A548 to S798 (fragment H3) by expressing four different APN1 fragments in Escherichia coli and analyzing Cry1Ah binding by ligand blot. Binding competition experiments of Cry1Ah to APN1 fragment H3 using synthetic peptides corresponding to four predicted domain II loop regions showed that loop 2 and loop 3 have additive effects on binding to APN1 fragment H3. Moreover, switching of loop 2 and loop 3 regions from Cry1Ah to Cry1Ai toxins showed that loop 2 and loop 3 are both involved in specificity and toxicity against H. armigera IMPORTANCE: Domain II loop regions have been shown to be involved in binding to larval gut proteins mediating insect specificity. The modification of loop regions is a direct and effective method to construct new Cry toxin variants to increase toxicity or modify specificity. Our results show that the exchange of loop regions from one toxin into another is a successful scheme for modification of B. thuringiensis Cry toxin specificity.	0
Title: Sources of diversity in bactobolin biosynthesis by Burkholderia thailandensis E264 Abstract: A series of deletion mutants in the recently identified bactobolin biosynthetic pathway defined the roles of several key biosynthetic enzymes and showed how promiscuity in three enzyme systems allows this cluster to produce multiple products. Studies on the deletion mutants also led to four new bactobolin analogs that provide additional structure-activity relationships for this interesting antibiotic family.	1
Title: Characterization of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of anticancer agent FK228 in Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968 Abstract: A gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of anticancer agent FK228 has been identified, cloned, and partially characterized in Chromobacterium violaceum no. 968. First, a genome-scanning approach was applied to identify three distinctive C. violaceum no. 968 genomic DNA clones that code for portions of nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase. Next, a gene replacement system developed originally for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was adapted to inactivate the genomic DNA-associated candidate natural product biosynthetic genes in vivo with high efficiency. Inactivation of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-encoding gene completely abolished FK228 production in mutant strains. Subsequently, the entire FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and sequenced. This gene cluster is predicted to encompass a 36.4-kb DNA region that includes 14 genes. The products of nine biosynthetic genes are proposed to constitute an unusual hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line including accessory activities for the biosynthesis of FK228. In particular, a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase is proposed to catalyze disulfide bond formation between two sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues as the final step in FK228 biosynthesis. Acquisition of the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster and acclimation of an efficient genetic system should enable genetic engineering of the FK228 biosynthetic pathway in C. violaceum no. 968 for the generation of structural analogs as anticancer drug candidates.	1
Title: The ABC transporter gene in the sirodesmin biosynthetic gene cluster of Leptosphaeria maculans is not essential for sirodesmin production but facilitates self-protection Abstract: Epipolythiodioxopiperazine toxins are secreted by a range of fungi, including Leptosphaeria maculans, which produces sirodesmin, and Aspergillus fumigatus, which produces gliotoxin. The L. maculans biosynthetic gene cluster for sirodesmin includes an ABC transporter gene, sirA. Disruption of this gene led to increased secretion of sirodesmin into the medium and an altered ratio of sirodesmin to its immediate precursor. The transcription pattern of a peptide synthetase that catalyses an early step in sirodesmin biosynthesis was elevated in the sirA mutant by 47% over a 7-day period. This was consistent with the finding that the transporter mutant had elevated sirodesmin levels. Despite increased production of sirodesmin, the sirA mutant was more sensitive to both sirodesmin and gliotoxin. The putative gliotoxin transporter gene, gliA, (a major facilitator superfamily transporter) from A. fumigatus complemented the tolerance of the L. maculans sirA mutant to gliotoxin, but not to sirodesmin. The results indicate that SirA contributes to self-protection against sirodesmin in L. maculans and suggest a transporter other than SirA is primarily responsible for efflux of endogenously produced sirodesmin.	1
Title: Salicylic acid, yersiniabactin, and pyoverdin production by the model phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000: synthesis, regulation, and impact on tomato and Arabidopsis host plants Abstract: A genetically tractable model plant pathosystem, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 on tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana hosts, was used to investigate the role of salicylic acid (SA) and iron acquisition via siderophores in bacterial virulence. Pathogen-induced SA accumulation mediates defense in these plants, and DC3000 contains the genes required for the synthesis of SA, the SA-incorporated siderophore yersiniabactin (Ybt), and the fluorescent siderophore pyoverdin (Pvd). We found that DC3000 synthesizes SA, Ybt, and Pvd under iron-limiting conditions in culture. Synthesis of SA and Ybt by DC3000 requires pchA, an isochorismate synthase gene in the Ybt genomic cluster, and exogenous SA can restore Ybt production by the pchA mutant. Ybt was also produced by DC3000 in planta, suggesting that Ybt plays a role in DC3000 pathogenesis. However, the pchA mutant did not exhibit any growth defect or altered virulence in plants. This lack of phenotype was not attributable to plant-produced SA restoring Ybt production, as the pchA mutant grew similarly to DC3000 in an Arabidopsis SA biosynthetic mutant, and in planta Ybt was not detected in pchA-infected wild-type plants. In culture, no growth defect was observed for the pchA mutant versus DC3000 for any condition tested. Instead, enhanced growth of the pchA mutant was observed under stringent iron limitation and additional stresses. This suggests that SA and Ybt production by DC3000 is costly and that Pvd is sufficient for iron acquisition. Further exploration of the comparative synthesis and utility of Ybt versus Pvd production by DC3000 found siderophore-dependent amplification of ybt gene expression to be absent, suggesting that Ybt may play a yet unknown role in DC3000 pathogenesis.	1
Title: Use of a phosphonate methyltransferase in the identification of the fosfazinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Natural product discovery has been boosted by genome mining approaches, but compound purification is often still challenging. We report an enzymatic strategy for "stable isotope labeling of phosphonates in extract" (SILPE) that facilitates their purification. We used the phosphonate methyltransferase DhpI involved in dehydrophos biosynthesis to methylate a variety of phosphonate natural products in crude spent medium with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled S-adenosyl methionine. Mass-guided fractionation then allowed straightforward purification. We illustrate its utility by purifying a phosphonate that led to the identification of the fosfazinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. This unusual natural product contains a hydrazide linker between a carboxylic acid and a phosphonic acid. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene cluster provides insights into how such a structure might be assembled.	1
Title: Elucidation of DnaE as the Antibacterial Target of the Natural Product, Nargenicin Abstract: Resistance to existing classes of antibiotics drives the need for discovery of novel compounds with unique mechanisms of action. Nargenicin A1, a natural product with limited antibacterial spectrum, was rediscovered in a whole-cell antisense assay. Macromolecular labeling in both Staphylococcus aureus and an Escherichia coli tolC efflux mutant revealed selective inhibition of DNA replication not due to gyrase or topoisomerase IV inhibition. S. aureus nargenicin-resistant mutants were selected at a frequency of ∼1 × 10(-9), and whole-genome resequencing found a single base-pair change in the dnaE gene, a homolog of the E. coli holoenzyme α subunit. A DnaE single-enzyme assay was exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by nargenicin, and other in vitro characterization studies corroborated DnaE as the target. Medicinal chemistry efforts may expand the spectrum of this novel mechanism antibiotic.	1
Title: In vitro Cas9-assisted editing of modular polyketide synthase genes to produce desired natural product derivatives Abstract: One major bottleneck in natural product drug development is derivatization, which is pivotal for fine tuning lead compounds. A promising solution is modifying the biosynthetic machineries of middle molecules such as macrolides. Although intense studies have established various methodologies for protein engineering of type I modular polyketide synthase(s) (PKSs), the accurate targeting of desired regions in the PKS gene is still challenging due to the high sequence similarity between its modules. Here, we report an innovative technique that adapts in vitro Cas9 reaction and Gibson assembly to edit a target region of the type I modular PKS gene. Proof-of-concept experiments using rapamycin PKS as a template show that heterologous expression of edited biosynthetic gene clusters produced almost all the desired derivatives. Our results are consistent with the promiscuity of modular PKS and thus, our technique will provide a platform to generate rationally designed natural product derivatives for future drug development.	1
Title: Calcium is sufficient but not necessary for activation of sheep platelet cytosolic phospholipase A2 Abstract: In this study we demonstrate that: (1) although the major phospholipase A2 present in sheep platelets is activated by calcium ions, it can effectively catalyze hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester linkage in phospholipids in the absence of calcium; (2) expression of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity can be induced by NaCl utilizing purified (but not crude) cytosolic enzyme; and (3) calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity is regulated by a reconstitutable cytosolic protein. Collectively, these results underscore the fundamental catalytic differences between extracellular and intracellular calcium-dependent phospholipases A2 and demonstrate that calcium is sufficient, but not necessary, for the activation of this class of intracellular phospholipases A2.	0
Title: Purification and genetic characterization of gassericin E, a novel co-culture inducible bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri EV1461 isolated from the vagina of a healthy woman Abstract: Background:                       Lactobacillus gasseri is one of the dominant Lactobacillus species in the vaginal ecosystem. Some strains of this species have a high potential for being used as probiotics in order to maintain vaginal homeostasis, since they may confer colonization resistance against pathogens in the vagina by direct inhibition through production of antimicrobial compounds, as bacteriocins. In this work we have studied bacteriocin production of gassericin E (GasE), a novel bacteriocin produced by L. gasseri EV1461, a strain isolated from the vagina of a healthy woman, and whose production was shown to be promoted by the presence of certain specific bacteria in co-culture. Biochemical and genetic characterization of this novel bacteriocin are addressed.                  Results:                       We found that the inhibitory spectrum of L. gasseri EV1461 was broad, being directed to species both related and non-related to the producing strain. Interestingly, L. gasseri EV1461 inhibited the grown of pathogens usually associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). The antimicrobial activity was due to the production of a novel bacteriocin, gassericin E (GasE). Production of this bacteriocin in broth medium only was achieved at high cell densities. At low cell densities, bacteriocin production ceased and only was restored after the addition of a supernatant from a previous bacteriocin-producing EV1461 culture (autoinduction), or through co-cultivation with several other Gram-positive strains (inducing bacteria). DNA sequence of the GasE locus revealed the presence of two putative operons which could be involved in biosynthesis and immunity of this bacteriocin (gaeAXI), and in regulation, transport and processing (gaePKRTC). The gaePKR encodes a putative three-component regulatory system, involving an autoinducer peptide (GaeP), a histidine protein kinase (GaeK) and a response regulator (GaeR), while the gaeTC encodes for an ABC transporter (GaeT) and their accessory protein (GaeC), involved in transport and processing of the bacteriocin. The gaeAXI, encodes for the bacteriocin gassericin E (GasE), a putative peptide bacteriocin (GaeX), and their immunity protein (GaeI).                  Conclusions:                       The origin of the strain (vagina of healthy woman) and its ability to produce bacteriocins with inhibitory activity against vaginal pathogens may be an advantage for using L. gasseri EV1461 as a probiotic strain to fight and/or prevent bacterial infections as bacterial vaginosis (BV), since it could be better adapted to live and compete into the vaginal environment.	1
Title: Functional characterization of the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster of Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 Abstract: Industrial strain improvement via classical mutagenesis is a black box approach. In an attempt to learn from and understand the mutations introduced, we cloned and characterized the amplified region of industrial penicillin production strains. Upon amplification of this region Penicillium chrysogenum is capable of producing an increased amount of antibiotics, as was previously reported [Barredo, J.L., Diez, B., Alvarez, E., Martín, J.F., 1989a. Large amplification of a 35-kb DNA fragment carrying two penicillin biosynthetic genes in high yielding strains of Penicillium chrysogenum. Curr. Genet. 16, 453-459; Newbert, R.W., Barton, B., Greaves, P., Harper, J., Turner, G., 1997. Analysis of a commercially improved Penicillium chrysogenum strain series, involvement of recombinogenic regions in amplification and deletion of the penicillin gene cluster. J. Ind. Microbiol. 19, 18-27]. Bioinformatic analysis of the central 56.9kb, present as six direct repeats in the strains analyzed in this study, predicted 15 Open Reading Frames (ORFs). Besides the three penicillin biosynthetic genes (pcbAB, pcbC and penDE) only one ORF has an orthologue of known function in the database: the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ERG25. Surprisingly, many genes known to encode direct or indirect steps beta-lactam biosynthesis like phenyl acetic acid CoA ligase and transporters are not present. Detailed analyses reveal a detectable transcript for most of the predicted ORFs under the conditions tested. We have studied the role of these in relation to penicillin production and amplification of the biosynthetic gene cluster. In contrast to what was expected, the genes encoding the three penicillin biosynthetic enzymes alone are sufficient to restore full beta-lactam synthesis in a mutant lacking the complete region. Therefore, the role of the other 12 ORFs in this region seems irrelevant for penicillin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Semisynthetic Macrocyclic Lipo-lanthipeptides Display Antimicrobial Activity Against Bacterial Pathogens Abstract: A large number of antimicrobial peptides depend on intramolecular disulfide bonds for their biological activity. However, the relative instability of disulfide bonds has limited the potential of some of these peptides to be developed into therapeutics. Conversely, peptides containing intramolecular (methyl)lanthionine-based bonds, lanthipeptides, are highly stable under a broader range of biological and physical conditions. Here, the class-II lanthipeptide synthetase CinM, from the cinnamycin gene cluster, was employed to create methyllanthionine stabilized analogues of disulfide-bond-containing antimicrobial peptides. The resulting analogues were subsequently modified in vitro by adding lipid tails of variable lengths through chemical addition. Finally, the created compounds were characterized by MIC tests against several relevant pathogens, killing assays, membrane permeability assays, and hemolysis assays. It was found that CinM could successfully install methyllanthionine bonds at the intended positions of the analogues and that the lipidated macrocyclic core peptides have bactericidal activity against tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy assays revealed that the lipidated compounds disrupt the bacterial membrane and lyse bacterial cells, hinting toward a potential mode of action. Notably, the semisynthesized macrocyclic lipo-lanthipeptides show low hemolytic activity. These results show that the methods developed here extend the toolbox for novel antimicrobial development and might enable the further development of novel compounds with killing activity against relevant pathogenic bacteria.	0
Title: Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface Abstract: Understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.	0
Title: The regulation and biosynthesis of antimycins Abstract: Antimycins (>40 members) were discovered nearly 65 years ago but the discovery of the gene cluster encoding antimycin biosynthesis in 2011 has facilitated rapid progress in understanding the unusual biosynthetic pathway. Antimycin A is widely used as a piscicide in the catfish farming industry and also has potent killing activity against insects, nematodes and fungi. The mode of action of antimycins is to inhibit cytochrome c reductase in the electron transport chain and halt respiration. However, more recently, antimycin A has attracted attention as a potent and selective inhibitor of the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Remarkably, this inhibition is independent of the main mode of action of antimycins such that an artificial derivative named 2-methoxyantimycin A inhibits Bcl-xL but does not inhibit respiration. The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL family of proteins are over-produced in cancer cells that are resistant to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy agents, so antimycins have great potential as anticancer drugs used in combination with existing chemotherapeutics. Here we review what is known about antimycins, the regulation of the ant gene cluster and the unusual biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. III. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of N-(aromatic heterocyclic substituted)azetidin-2-ones Abstract: The relationship between structure and antibacterial activity among monocyclic beta-lactams having a pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, or a tetrazolyl group at N-1 position was investigated. N-(Tetrazol-5-yl)azetidin-2-ones were found to posses excellent activity.	0
Title: Identification of the tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. 307-9 Abstract: The structurally intriguing bicyclic ketal moiety of tirandamycin is common to several acyl-tetramic acid antibiotics, and is a key determinant of biological activity. We have identified the tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from the environmental marine isolate Streptomyces sp. 307-9, thus providing the first genetic insight into the biosynthesis of this natural product scaffold. Sequence analysis revealed a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster with a colinear domain organization, which is entirely consistent with the core structure of the tirandamycins. We also identified genes within the cluster that encode candidate tailoring enzymes for elaboration and modification of the bicyclic ketal system. Disruption of tamI, which encodes a presumed cytochrome P450, led to a mutant strain deficient in production of late stage tirandamycins that instead accumulated tirandamycin C, an intermediate devoid of any post assembly-line oxidative modifications.	1
Title: Mutational analysis reveals that all tailoring region genes are required for production of polyketide antibiotic mupirocin by pseudomonas fluorescens: pseudomonic acid B biosynthesis precedes pseudomonic acid A Abstract: The Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin biosynthetic cluster encodes six proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis and 26 single polypeptides proposed to perform largely tailoring functions. In-frame deletions in the tailoring open reading frames demonstrated that all are required for mupirocin production. A bidirectional promoter region was identified between mupF, which runs counter to other open reading frames and its immediate neighbor macpC, implying the 74-kb cluster consists of two transcriptional units. mupD/E and mupJ/K must be cotranscribed as pairs for normal function implying co-assembly during translation. MupJ and K belong to a widely distributed enzyme pair implicated, with MupH, in methyl addition. Deletion of mupF, a putative ketoreductase, produced a mupirocin analogue with a C-7 ketone. Deletion of mupC, a putative dienoyl CoA reductase, generated an analogue whose structure indicated that MupC is also implicated in control of the oxidation state around the tetrahydropyran ring of monic acid. Double mutants with DeltamupC and DeltamupO, DeltamupU, DeltamupV, or DeltamacpE produced pseudomonic acid B but not pseudomonic acid A, as do the mupO, U, V, and macpE mutants, indicating that MupC must work after MupO, U, and V.	1
Title: The ADEP Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 Reveals an Accessory clpP Gene as a Novel Antibiotic Resistance Factor Abstract: The increasing threat posed by multiresistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the discovery of novel antibacterials with unprecedented modes of action. ADEP1, a natural compound produced by Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010, is the prototype for a new class of acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics. ADEP antibiotics deregulate the proteolytic core ClpP of the bacterial caseinolytic protease, thereby exhibiting potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens. ADEP1 and derivatives, here collectively called ADEP, have been previously investigated for their antibiotic potency against different species, structure-activity relationship, and mechanism of action; however, knowledge on the biosynthesis of the natural compound and producer self-resistance have remained elusive. In this study, we identified and analyzed the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010, which comprises two NRPSs, genes necessary for the biosynthesis of (4S,2R)-4-methylproline, and a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) for the assembly of highly reduced polyenes. While no resistance factor could be identified within the gene cluster itself, we discovered an additional clpP homologous gene (named clpPADEP) located further downstream of the biosynthetic genes, separated from the biosynthetic gene cluster by several transposable elements. Heterologous expression of ClpPADEP in three ADEP-sensitive Streptomyces species proved its role in conferring ADEP resistance, thereby revealing a novel type of antibiotic resistance determinant.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) represent a promising new class of potent antibiotics and, at the same time, are valuable tools to study the molecular functioning of their target, ClpP, the proteolytic core of the bacterial caseinolytic protease. Here, we present a straightforward purification procedure for ADEP1 that yields substantial amounts of the pure compound in a time- and cost-efficient manner, which is a prerequisite to conveniently study the antimicrobial effects of ADEP and the operating mode of bacterial ClpP machineries in diverse bacteria. Identification and characterization of the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 enables future bioinformatics screenings for similar gene clusters and/or subclusters to find novel natural compounds with specific substructures. Most strikingly, we identified a cluster-associated clpP homolog (named clpPADEP) as an ADEP resistance gene. ClpPADEP constitutes a novel bacterial resistance factor that alone is necessary and sufficient to confer high-level ADEP resistance to Streptomyces across species.	1
Title: Evaluation of housekeeping genes in Listeria monocytogenes as potential internal control references for normalizing mRNA expression levels in stress adaptation models using real-time PCR Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen that can tolerate a wide range of stress conditions. However, its stress adaptation processes are still poorly understood. Real-time-based quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) provides a tool to probe gene expression changes underlying stress adaptation. But, a limitation to study mRNA levels by real-time qRT-PCR is that validated reference genes are required for normalization. Such genes are currently lacking for experimental models that may be applied to evaluate stress-related gene expression changes in L. monocytogenes. Therefore, five housekeeping genes (HKG) were studied as potential reference genes. Their expression stability was evaluated across 16 L. monocytogenes strains. Three experimental models designed to assess gene expression changes induced by cold, acid and high NaCl concentration stress adaptation were applied. The 16S rRNA gene was consistently the most stably expressed HKG across the different L. monocytogenes strains under all the experimental conditions. While the expressions of beta-glucosidase (bglA), Glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (gap), RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) and Ribosomal protein L4 (rplD) was stable amongst the different L. monocytogenes strains, they were prone to significant variations under the different stress adaptation models.	0
Title: Effect of cultivation mode on bacterial and fungal communities of Dendrobium catenatum Abstract: Background:                       The orchid growth and development often associate with microbes. However, the interaction between plant performance and microbial communities within and surrounding plants is less understood. Dendrobium catenatum, which used to be an endangered orchid species, has become a billion dollar industry in China. Simulated natural cultivation modes, such as living tree epiphytic (LT) and cliff epiphytic (CE) cultivations, improve the production or quality of D. catenatum and contribute to the development of D. catenatum industry. In a previous study, morphological characteristics, anatomical structure, and main bioactive components (polysaccharides and ethanol-soluble extractives) of D. catenatum grown under LT and CE significantly differed from a facility cultivation mode, pot (PO) cultivation, were observed. Whether cultivation mode affects bacterial and fungal communities of D. catenatum, thereby affecting the chemical quality of this plant, need to be explored.                  Results:                       Both three plant organs (leaf, stem, and root) and cultivating substrates obtained under three cultivation modes: living tree epiphytic (LT), cliff epiphytic (CE), and pot (PO) cultivation were examined by adopting high-throughput sequencing methods. Subsequently, bacterial and fungal correlations with D. catenatum main chemical components, stem polysaccharides and ethanol-soluble extractives and leaf phenols and flavonoids, were elucidated. The results showed that microbial communities of the plants and substrates are both influenced by the cultivation mode. However, the plants and their cultivating substrates exhibited different patterns of bacterial and fungal composition, with clearly distinguished dominant bacterial groups, but shared dominance among fungal groups. Bacteria and fungi differed in abundance, diversity, and community structure, depending on the cultivation environment and plant organ. Both bacterial and fungal communities were affected by cultivation mode and plant organ. In both plants and substrates, PO bacterial and fungal community structure differed significantly from those of LT and CE modes. Bacterial and fungal community structure differed significantly between roots and the other two plant organs examined (stems and leaves). Several bacteria and fungi were positively correlated with main chemical components in D. catenatum.                  Conclusions:                       The findings indicate that microbial communities of the plants and substrates were both influenced by the cultivation mode and plant organ, and some of them were positively correlated with main chemical components in D. catenatum. The research would enhance our understanding of interactions between Dendrobium and the microbial environment, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of improved D. catenatum cultivation methods.	0
Title: Characterization of the Ohmyungsamycin Biosynthetic Pathway and Generation of Derivatives with Improved Antituberculosis Activity Abstract: The cyclic depsipeptides ohmyungsamycin (OMS) A (1) and B (2), isolated from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SNJ042, contain two non-proteinogenic amino acid residues, β-hydroxy-l-phenylalanine (β-hydroxy-l-Phe) and 4-methoxy-l-tryptophan (4-methoxy-l-Trp). Draft genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. SNJ042 revealed the OMS biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene and three genes for amino acid modification. By gene inactivation and analysis of the accumulated products, we found that OhmL, encoding a P450 gene, is an l-Phe β-hydroxylase. Furthermore, OhmK, encoding a Trp 2,3-dioxygenase homolog, and OhmJ, encoding an O-methyltransferase, are suggested to be involved in hydroxylation and O-methylation reactions, respectively, in the biosynthesis of 4-methoxy-l-Trp. In addition, the antiproliferative and antituberculosis activities of the OMS derivatives dehydroxy-OMS A (4) and demethoxy-OMS A (6) obtained from the mutant strains were evaluated in vitro. Interestingly, dehydroxy-OMS A (4) displayed significantly improved antituberculosis activity and decreased cytotoxicity compared to wild-type OMS A.	1
Title: The chejuenolide biosynthetic gene cluster harboring an iterative trans-AT PKS system in Hahella chejuensis strain MB-1084 Abstract: Hahella chejuensis MB-1084 is a Gram-negative marine bacterial strain that produces unusual 17-membered carbocyclic tetraenes, chejuenolide A and B. Two fosmid clones responsible for chejuenolide production were identified from the genomic DNA library of the MB-1084 strain. Systematic inactivation of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the sequenced region defines the boundaries of the chejuenolide (che) biosynthetic gene cluster (24.9 kbp) that encodes one non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid protein, three modular PKSs, two PKS domains, and an amine oxidase homolog. Based on the results, we found that the che PKSs have non-canonical features such as trans-AT system and insufficient number of KS domains (five KS domains) for chejuenolide production (requires eight rounds of Claisen condensation reaction). Heterologous expression of the che PKSs in the E. coli BAP1 strain provides strong evidence of the iterative characteristic of the modular PKSs. Additionally, the phylogenetic relatedness of the KS domains of che PKSs and other trans-AT PKSs was analyzed to propose a possible pathway for chejuenolide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of four clustered and coregulated genes associated with fumonisin biosynthesis in Fusarium verticillioides Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins that cause several fatal animal diseases, including cancer in rats and mice. These toxins are produced by several Fusarium species, including the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, and can accumulate in maize infected with the fungus. We have identified four F. verticillioides genes (FUM6, FUM7, FUM8, and FUM9) adjacent to FUM5, a previously identified polyketide synthase gene that is required for fumonisin biosynthesis. Gene disruption analysis revealed that FUM6 and FUM8 are required for fumonisin production and Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of all four recently identified genes is correlated with fumonisin production. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the predicted FUM6 translation product is most similar to cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-P450 reductase fusion proteins and the predicted products of FUM7, FUM8, and FUM9 are most similar to type III alcohol dehydrogenases, class-II alpha-aminotransferases, and dioxygenases, respectively. Together, these data are consistent with FUM5 through FUM9 being part of a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in F. verticillioides.	1
Title: Intracellular targeting of ascomycetous catalase-peroxidases (KatG1s) Abstract: Bifunctional catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) are heme oxidoreductases widely spread among bacteria, archaea and among lower eukaryotes. In fungi, two KatG groups with different localization have evolved, intracellular (KatG1) and extracellular (KatG2) proteins. Here, the cloning, expression analysis and subcellular localization of two novel katG1 genes from the soil fungi Chaetomium globosum and Chaetomium cochliodes are reported. Whereas, the metalloenzyme from Ch. globosum is expressed constitutively, Ch. cochliodes KatG1 reveals a slight increase in expression after induction of oxidative stress by cadmium ions and hydrogen peroxide. The intronless open reading frames of both Sordariomycetes katG1 genes as well as of almost all fungal katG1s possess two peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2). Peroxisomal localization of intracellular eukaryotic catalase-peroxidases was verified by organelle separation and immunofluorescence microscopy. Co-localization with the peroxisomal enzyme 3-ketoacyl-CoA-thiolase was demonstrated for KatGs from Magnaporthe grisea, Chaetomium globosum and Chaetomium cochliodes. The physiological role of fungal catalase-peroxidases is discussed.	0
Title: Immunoactive peptides, FK-156 and FK-565. II. Restoration of host resistance to microbial infection in immunosuppressed mice Abstract: The immunoactive peptides, FK-156 and its analogue, FK-565 were evaluated in various models of mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, hydrocortisone, mitomycin C, carrageenan and tumor cells. Treatment with FK-156 (subcutaneous) and FK-565 (oral) markedly restored host defense ability against microbial infection. The therapeutic effect of ticarcillin or gentamicin alone against pseudomonal infection in cyclophosphamide- and hydrocortisone-treated mice and tumor-bearing mice was much lower than in normal mice. The therapeutic effect of these antibiotics against pseudomonal infection in immunosuppressed mice was enhanced markedly by combined use with FK-156. The killing ability of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes of the immunosuppressed mice was also markedly enhanced by dosing with FK-156.	0
Title: Molecular determinants for the interaction of human neutrophil alpha defensin 1 with its propeptide Abstract: Human neutrophil alpha-defensins (HNPs) are cationic antimicrobial peptides that are synthesized in vivo as inactive precursors (proHNPs). Activation requires proteolytic excision of their anionic N-terminal inhibitory pro peptide. The pro peptide of proHNP1 also interacts specifically with and inhibits the antimicrobial activity of HNP1 inter-molecularly. In the light of the opposite net charges segregated in proHNP1, functional inhibition of the C-terminal defensin domain by its propeptide is generally thought to be of electrostatic nature. Using a battery of analogs of the propeptide and of proHNP1, we identified residues in the propeptide region important for HNP1 binding and inhibition. Only three anionic residues in the propeptide, Glu(15), Asp(20) and Glu(23), were modestly important for interactions with HNP1. By contrast, the hydrophobic residues in the central part of the propeptide, and the conserved hydrophobic motif Val(24)Val(25)Val(26)Leu(28) in particular, were critical for HNP1 binding and inhibition. Neutralization of all negative charges in the propeptide only partially activated the bactericidal activity of proHNP1. Our data indicate that hydrophobic forces have a dominant role in mediating the interactions between HNP1 and its propeptide--a finding largely contrasting the commonly held view that the interactions are of an electrostatic nature.	0
Title: Nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes pesL and pes1 are essential for Fumigaclavine C production in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The identity of metabolites encoded by the majority of nonribosomal peptide synthetases in the opportunistic pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, remains outstanding. We found that the nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthetases PesL and Pes1 were essential for fumigaclavine C biosynthesis, the end product of the complex ergot alkaloid (EA) pathway in A. fumigatus. Deletion of either pesL (ΔpesL) or pes1 (Δpes1) resulted in complete loss of fumigaclavine C biosynthesis, relatively increased production of fumitremorgins such as TR-2, fumitremorgin C and verruculogen, increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2), and increased sensitivity to the antifungals, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Deletion of pesL resulted in severely reduced virulence in an invertebrate infection model (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that NRP synthesis plays an essential role in mediating the final prenylation step of the EA pathway, despite the apparent absence of NRP synthetases in the proposed EA biosynthetic cluster for A. fumigatus. Liquid chromatography/diode array detection/mass spectrometry analysis also revealed the presence of fumiquinazolines A to F in both A. fumigatus wild-type and ΔpesL strains. This observation suggests that alternative NRP synthetases can also function in fumiquinazoline biosynthesis, since PesL has been shown to mediate fumiquinazoline biosynthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we provide here the first direct link between EA biosynthesis and virulence, in agreement with the observed toxicity associated with EA exposure. Finally, we demonstrate a possible cluster cross-talk phenomenon, a theme which is beginning to emerge in the literature.	1
Title: Characterization of the Aspergillus ochraceoroseus aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Production of carcinogenic aflatoxins has been reported from members of Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nidulantes and a newly proposed Aspergillus section Ochraceorosei that consists of Aspergillus ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii. Unlike members of section Flavi, A. ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii have been shown to accumulate both aflatoxin (AF) and the aflatoxin precursor sterigmatocystin (ST). Alhough morphologically distinct from A. nidulans, molecular characterization of A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST genes and physiological characteristics of AF/ST production indicated that A. ochraceoroseus is more closely related to A. nidulans than to A. flavus. Knowing that the A. nidulans ST gene cluster is organized differently from the A. flavus AF gene cluster, we determined the genetic organization of the AF/ST biosynthetic cluster in A. ochraceoroseus. Sequencing of overlapping lambda clones and genomic PCR fragments obtained by gene-walking techniques demonstrated that the A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST gene cluster is organized much like the A. nidulans ST gene cluster except that the region from aflN to aflW is located directly upstream of aflC and in reverse orientation such that aflW represents the distal end and aflY the proximal end of the cluster. The A. ochraceoroseus cluster genes demonstrated 62-76% nucleotide identity to their A. nidulans ST cluster gene homologs. Transformation of an A. nidulans aflR mutant with the A. ochraceoroseus aflR restored ST production in A. nidulans transformants. PCR amplification of A. rambellii genomic DNA demonstrated that the AF/ST gene cluster is organized in the same manner as that of A. ochraceoroseus.	1
Title: The NDP-sugar co-substrate concentration and the enzyme expression level influence the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases: cloning and characterization of deoxysugar biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces fradiae is the principal producer of urdamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a polyketide-derived aglycone, which is glycosylated with four sugar components, 2x D-olivose (first and last sugar of a C-glycosidically bound trisaccharide chain at the 9-position), and 2x L-rhodinose (in the middle of the trisaccharide chain and at the 12b-position). Limited information is available about both the biosynthesis of D-olivose and L-rhodinose and the influence of the concentration of both sugars on urdamycin biosynthesis.                  Results:                       To further investigate urdamycin biosynthesis, a 5.4 kb section of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced. Five new open reading frames (ORFs) (urdZ3, urdQ, urdR, urdS, urdT) could be identified each one showing significant homology to deoxysugar biosynthetic genes. We inactivated four of these newly allocated ORFs (urdZ3, urdQ, urdR, urdS) as well as urdZ1, a previously found putative deoxysugar biosynthetic gene. Inactivation of urdZ3, urdQ and urdZ1 prevented the mutant strains from producing L-rhodinose resulting in the accumulation of mainly urdamycinone B. Inactivation of urdR led to the formation of the novel urdamycin M, which carries a C-glycosidically attached D-rhodinose at the 9-position. The novel urdamycins N and O were detected after overexpression of urdGT1c in two different chromosomal urdGT1c deletion mutants. The mutants lacking urdS and urdQ accumulated various known diketopiperazines.                  Conclusions:                       Analysis of deoxysugar biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed a widely common biosynthetic pathway leading to D-olivose and L-rhodinose. Several enzymes responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. The pathway had to be modified compared to earlier suggestions. Two glycosyltransferases normally involved in the C-glycosyltransfer of D-olivose at the 9-position (UrdGT2) and in conversion of 100-2 to urdamycin G (UrdGT1c) show relaxed substrate specificity for their activated deoxysugar co-substrate and their alcohol substrate, respectively. They can transfer activated D-rhodinose (instead of D-olivose) to the 9-position, and attach L-rhodinose to the 4A-position normally occupied by a D-olivose unit, respectively.	1
Title: Identification of a bioactive 51-membered macrolide complex by activation of a silent polyketide synthase in Streptomyces ambofaciens Abstract: There is a constant need for new and improved drugs to combat infectious diseases, cancer, and other major life-threatening conditions. The recent development of genomics-guided approaches for novel natural product discovery has stimulated renewed interest in the search for natural product-based drugs. Genome sequence analysis of Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC23877 has revealed numerous secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, including a giant type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster, which is composed of 25 genes (nine of which encode PKSs) and spans almost 150 kb, making it one of the largest polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters described to date. The metabolic product(s) of this gene cluster are unknown, and transcriptional analyses showed that it is not expressed under laboratory growth conditions. The constitutive expression of a regulatory gene within the cluster, encoding a protein that is similar to Large ATP binding of the LuxR (LAL) family proteins, triggered the expression of the biosynthetic genes. This led to the identification of four 51-membered glycosylated macrolides, named stambomycins A-D as metabolic products of the gene cluster. The structures of these compounds imply several interesting biosynthetic features, including incorporation of unusual extender units into the polyketide chain and in trans hydroxylation of the growing polyketide chain to provide the hydroxyl group for macrolide formation. Interestingly, the stambomycins possess promising antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines. Database searches identify genes encoding LAL regulators within numerous cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters in actinomycete genomes, suggesting that constitutive expression of such pathway-specific activators represents a powerful approach for novel bioactive natural product discovery.	1
Title: Chemoenzymatic synthesis of bifunctional polyubiquitin substrates for monitoring ubiquitin chain remodeling Abstract: Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins is one of the most pervasive post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Target proteins are often modified with polymeric ubiquitin chains of defined lengths and linkages that may further undergo dynamic changes in composition in response to cellular signals. Biochemical characterization of the enzymes responsible for building and destroying ubiquitin chains is often thwarted by the lack of methods for preparation of the appropriate substrates containing probes for biochemical or biophysical studies. We have discovered that a yeast ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (Yuh1) also catalyzes transamidation reactions that can be exploited to prepare site-specifically modified polyubiquitin chains produced by thiol-ene chemistry. We have used this chemoenzymatic approach to prepare dual-functionalized ubiquitin chains containing fluorophore and biotin modifications. These dual-functionalized ubiquitin chains enabled the first real-time assay of ubiquitin chain disassembly by a human deubiquitinase (DUB) enzyme by single molecule fluorescence microscopy. In summary, this work provides a powerful new tool for elucidating the mechanisms of DUBs and other ubiquitin processing enzymes.	0
Title: Molecular mode of action of the antifungal beta-amino acid BAY 10-8888 Abstract: BAY 10-8888 is a cyclic beta-amino acid that is related to cispentacin and that has antifungal activity. Candida albicans cells accumulated BAY 10-8888 intracellularly to a concentration about 200 that in the medium when grown in media with a variety of nitrogen sources. In complex growth medium, BAY 10-8888 transport activity was markedly reduced and was paralleled by a decrease in its antifungal activity. Uptake of BAY 10-8888 was mediated by an H+-coupled amino acid transporter with specificity for branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) and showed a KT (Michaelis constant of the transport reaction) of 0.95 mM and a Vmax of 18.9 nmol x min-1 x 10(7) cells-1. Similar to the transport of natural amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transport of BAY 10-8888 into the cell was unidirectional. Efflux occurred by diffusion and was not carrier mediated. Inside the cell BAY 10-8888 inhibited specifically isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cell growth. Intracellular isoleucine reversed BAY 10-8888-induced growth inhibition. BAY 10-8888 was not incorporated into proteins. BAY 10-8888 inhibited isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase with the same concentration dependency as protein biosynthesis in intact cells assuming 200-fold accumulation.	0
Title: Genomic clustering of cyanogenic glucoside biosynthetic genes aids their identification in Lotus japonicus and suggests the repeated evolution of this chemical defence pathway Abstract: Cyanogenic glucosides are amino acid-derived defence compounds found in a large number of vascular plants. Their hydrolysis by specific β-glucosidases following tissue damage results in the release of hydrogen cyanide. The cyanogenesis deficient1 (cyd1) mutant of Lotus japonicus carries a partial deletion of the CYP79D3 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is responsible for the first step in cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis. The genomic region surrounding CYP79D3 contains genes encoding the CYP736A2 protein and the UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT85K3. In combination with CYP79D3, these genes encode the enzymes that constitute the entire pathway for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis. The biosynthetic genes for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis are also co-localized in cassava (Manihot esculenta) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), but the three gene clusters show no other similarities. Although the individual enzymes encoded by the biosynthetic genes in these three plant species are related, they are not necessarily orthologous. The independent evolution of cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in several higher plant lineages by the repeated recruitment of members from similar gene families, such as the CYP79s, is a likely scenario.	1
Title: Natural products from environmental DNA hosted in Ralstonia metallidurans Abstract: Metagenomic studies designed to access new small molecules from the heterologous expression of environmental DNA have focused on the use of two model systems, Escherichia coli and Streptomyces spp., as heterologous hosts. Accessing the biosynthetic potential of DNA extracted from the bacteria present in environmental samples will require the development of a more diverse collection of model bacterial hosts that can be used for screening environmental DNA libraries. In this study the bacterium Ralstonia metallidurans was explored as a heterologous host. Here we report the isolation and characterization of both novel and known metabolites from pigmented and antibacterially active clones found in R. metallidurans based environmental DNA libraries. The clones found in this study do not confer the production of clone-specific metabolites to E. coli, validating R. metallidurans as an orthogonal expression host that can be used to expand the number of metabolites found in future metagenomic discovery efforts.	1
