Title: Plasticity and evolution of aeruginosin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria Abstract: Aeruginosins are bioactive oligopeptides that are produced in high structural diversity by strains of the bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera Microcystis and Planktothrix. A hallmark of aeruginosins is the unusual Choi moiety central to the tetrapeptides, while other positions are occupied by variable moieties in individual congeners. Here we report on three aeruginosin synthetase gene clusters (aer) of Microcystis aeruginosa (strains PCC 7806, NIES-98, and NIES-843). The analysis and comparison the aer gene clusters provide the first insight into the molecular basis of biosynthetic and structural plasticity in aeruginosin pathways. Major parts of the aer gene clusters are highly similar in all strains, particularly the genes coding for the first three nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules except for the region coding for the second adenylation domain. However, the gene clusters differ largely in genes coding for tailoring enzymes such as halogenases and sulfotransferases, reflecting structural peculiarities in aeruginosin congeners produced by the individual strains. Significant deviations were further observed in the C-terminal NRPS modules, suggesting two distinct release mechanisms. The architecture of the gene clusters is in agreement with the particular aeruginosin variants that are produced by individual strains, the structures of two of which (aeruginosins 686 A and 686 B) were elucidated. The aer gene clusters of Microcystis and Planktothrix are proposed to originate from a common ancestor and to have evolved to their present-day diversity largely through horizontal gene transfer and recombination events.	1
Title: Ribosomally synthesized thiopeptide antibiotics targeting elongation factor Tu Abstract: We identified the thiomuracins, a novel family of thiopeptides produced by a rare-actinomycete bacterium typed as a Nonomuraea species, via a screen for inhibition of growth of the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Thiopeptides are a class of macrocyclic, highly modified peptides that are decorated by thiazoles and defined by a central six-membered heterocyclic ring system. Mining the genomes of thiopeptide-producing strains revealed the elusive biosynthetic route for this class of antibiotics. The thiopeptides are chromosomally encoded, ribosomally synthesized proteins, and isolation of gene clusters for production of thiomuracin and the related thiopeptide GE2270A revealed the post-translational machinery required for maturation. The target of the thiomuracins was identified as bacterial Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu). In addition to potently inhibiting a target that is unexploited by marketed human therapeutics, the thiomuracins have a low propensity for selecting for antibiotic resistance and confer no measurable cross-resistance to antibiotics in clinical use.	1
Title: A theoretical study of the structure of parathyroid hormone Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the tertiary and secondary structure of parathyroid hormone was conducted. By combining interpretations from this analysis with chemical data available in the literature, certain structural features of the hormone are consistently predicted. The proposed model for the hormone contains two domains dominated by hydrophobic clustering of critical residues within each domain and separated by an exposed linker region. In the prediction of two domains with a linker region, the model is similar to that proposed by Fiskin et al. [Fiskin, A.M., Cohn, D.M. & Peterson, G.S. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8261-8268], but it differs significantly in other respects. The proposed structural features are apparent in the bovine, human, and porcine species of hormone.	0
Title: Collisional and Coulombic unfolding of gas-phase proteins: high correlation to their domain structures in solution Abstract: The three-dimensional structures adopted by proteins are predicated by their many biological functions. Mass spectrometry has played a rapidly expanding role in protein structure discovery, enabling the generation of models for both proteins and their higher-order assemblies. While important coursed-grained insights have been generated, relatively few examples exist where mass spectrometry has been successfully applied to the characterization of protein tertiary structure. Here, we demonstrate that gas-phase unfolding can be used to determine the number of autonomously folded domains within monomeric proteins. Our ion mobility-mass spectrometry data highlight a strong, positive correlation between the number of protein unfolding transitions observed in the gas phase and the number of known domains within a group of sixteen proteins ranging from 8-78 kDa. This correlation and its potential uses for structural biology is discussed.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic genes for 10,11-dehydrocurvularin, a heat shock response-modulating anticancer fungal polyketide from Aspergillus terreus Abstract: 10,11-Dehydrocurvularin is a prevalent fungal phytotoxin with heat shock response and immune-modulatory activities. It features a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid lactone polyketide framework with structural similarities to resorcylic acid lactones like radicicol or zearalenone. A genomic locus was identified from the dehydrocurvularin producer strain Aspergillus terreus AH-02-30-F7 to reveal genes encoding a pair of iterative polyketide synthases (A. terreus CURS1 [AtCURS1] and AtCURS2) that are predicted to collaborate in the biosynthesis of 10,11-dehydrocurvularin. Additional genes in this locus encode putative proteins that may be involved in the export of the compound from the cell and in the transcriptional regulation of the cluster. 10,11-Dehydrocurvularin biosynthesis was reconstituted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by heterologous expression of the polyketide synthases. Bioinformatic analysis of the highly reducing polyketide synthase AtCURS1 and the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 highlights crucial biosynthetic programming differences compared to similar synthases involved in resorcylic acid lactone biosynthesis. These differences lead to the synthesis of a predicted tetraketide starter unit that forms part of the 12-membered lactone ring of dehydrocurvularin, as opposed to the penta- or hexaketide starters in the 14-membered rings of resorcylic acid lactones. Tetraketide N-acetylcysteamine thioester analogues of the starter unit were shown to support the biosynthesis of dehydrocurvularin and its analogues, with yeast expressing AtCURS2 alone. Differential programming of the product template domain of the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 results in an aldol condensation with a different regiospecificity than that of resorcylic acid lactones, yielding the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid scaffold characterized by an S-type cyclization pattern atypical for fungal polyketides.	1
Title: A putative polyketide synthase/peptide synthetase from Magnaporthe grisea signals pathogen attack to resistant rice Abstract: Isolates of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea that carry the gene encoding Avirulence Conferring Enzyme1 (ACE1) are specifically recognized by rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars carrying the resistance gene Pi33. This recognition enables resistant plants to activate a defense response. ACE1 was isolated by map-based cloning and encodes a putative hybrid between a polyketide synthase and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, enzymes involved in microbial secondary metabolism. ACE1 is expressed exclusively during fungal penetration of host leaves, the time point at which plant defense reactions are triggered. Ace1 appears to be localized in the cytoplasm of the appressorium. Mutation of the putative catalytic site of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain of Ace1 abolishes recognition of the fungus by resistant rice. This suggests that Ace1 biosynthetic activity is required for avirulence. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the fungal signal recognized by resistant rice plants is the secondary metabolite whose synthesis depends on Ace1.	1
Title: Targeted Gene Inactivations Expose Silent Cytochalasans in Magnaporthe grisea NI980 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster encoding the phytotoxin pyrichalasin H 5 was discovered in Magnaporthe grisea NI980, and the late-stage biosynthetic pathway of 5 was fully elucidated using targeted gene inactivations resulting in the isolation of 13 novel cytochalasans. This study reveals that the nonproteinogenic amino acid O-methyltyrosine is the true precursor of 5, and other cryptic cytochalasans and mutasynthesis experiments produce novel halogenated pyrichalasin H analogues.	1
Title: Excess leucine intake induces serine dehydratase in rat liver Abstract: We have hypothesized that rat liver serine dehydratase (SDH) is induced in response to the amount of surplus amino acids from dietary protein. In the present study, we found that excess leucine intake strongly induced SDH activity in the liver but not in the kidney of rats. The increase in activity was accompanied by increases in the levels of SDH mRNA. On the other hand, isoleucine and valine had little effect on SDH induction. These results support our hypothesis and suggest that leucine is a signal for SDH induction.	0
Title: Direct observation of an enamine intermediate in amine catalysis Abstract: An enamine intermediate is believed to be the central feature of biological catalysts, such as aldolases and small molecule amine organocatalysts. Despite decades of investigation of naturally occurring aldolase enzymes and recent studies on designed aldolase antibodies and organocatalysts, direct structural observation of an enamine intermediate has proven to be rare. Herein, we report the observation of a stable enamine intermediate in the crystal structure of an aldolase antibody 33F12 in complex with a 1,3-diketone derivative. This enamine complex structure provides strong evidence that fewer residues are essential for amine catalysis within the hydrophobic environments of this catalytic antibody than speculated for natural aldolase enzymes and should serve to guide future studies aimed at the rational design of these types of catalysts, as well as organocatalysts. Indeed, enamine catalysis in proteins might be more simplistic than previously imagined.	0
Title: Catalytic analysis of the validamycin glycosyltransferase (ValG) and enzymatic production of 4''-epi-validamycin A Abstract: ValG is a glycosyltransferase (GT) that is responsible for the glucosylation of validoxylamine A to validamycin A. To explore the potential utilization of ValG as a tool for the production of validamycin analogues, a number of nucleotidyldiphosphate-sugars were evaluated as alternative substrates for ValG. The results indicated that in addition to its natural substrate, UDP-glucose, ValG also efficiently utilized UDP-galactose as sugar donor and resulted in the production of an unnatural compound, 4''-epi-validamycin A. The new compound demonstrated a moderate growth inhibitory activity against the plant fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani (= Pellicularia sasakii). A comparative analysis of ValG with its homologous proteins revealed that ValG contains an unusual DTG motif, in place of the DXD motif proposed for metal ion binding and/or NDP-sugar binding and commonly found in other glycosyltransferases. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DTG motif of ValG to DCD altered its preferences for metal ion binding, but did not seem to affect its substrate specificity.	0
Title: Resorcylic acid lactones: naturally occurring potent and selective inhibitors of MEK Abstract: A resorcylic acid lactone, L-783,277, isolated from a Phoma sp. (ATCC 74403) which came from the fruitbody of Helvella acetabulum, is a potent and specific inhibitor of MEK (Map kinase kinase). L-783,277 inhibits MEK with an IC50 value of 4 nM. It weakly inhibits Lck and is inactive against Raf, PKA and PKC. L-783,277 is an irreversible inhibitor of MEK and is competitive with respect to ATP. L-783,290, the trans-isomer of L-783,277, was isolated from the same culture and evaluated together with several semi-synthetic resorcylic acid lactone analogs. A preliminary structure-activity relationship is presented. Several independent cell-based assays have been carried out to study the biological activities of these resorcylic acid lactone compounds and a brief result summary from these studies is presented.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of a novel diterpene gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungal secondary metabolites are a rich source of medically useful compounds due to their pharmaceutical and toxic properties. Sequencing of fungal genomes has revealed numerous secondary metabolite gene clusters, yet products of many of these biosynthetic pathways are unknown since the expression of the clustered genes usually remains silent in normal laboratory conditions. Therefore, to discover new metabolites, it is important to find ways to induce the expression of genes in these otherwise silent biosynthetic clusters. We discovered a novel secondary metabolite in Aspergillus nidulans by predicting a biosynthetic gene cluster with genomic mining. A Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-type transcription factor, PbcR, was identified, and its role as a pathway-specific activator for the predicted gene cluster was demonstrated. Overexpression of pbcR upregulated the transcription of seven genes in the identified cluster and led to the production of a diterpene compound, which was characterized with GC/MS as ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene. A change in morphology was also observed in the strains overexpressing pbcR. The activation of a cryptic gene cluster by overexpression of its putative Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-type transcription factor led to discovery of a novel secondary metabolite in Aspergillus nidulans. Quantitative real-time PCR and DNA array analysis allowed us to predict the borders of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Furthermore, we identified a novel fungal pimaradiene cyclase gene as well as genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. None of these genes have been previously implicated in the biosynthesis of terpenes in Aspergillus nidulans. These results identify the first Aspergillus nidulans diterpene gene cluster and suggest a biosynthetic pathway for ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene.	1
Title: Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity of Fe-N-C Catalysts by Phosphorus Incorporation Abstract: Nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon materials hosting single-atom iron (Fe-N-C) are major non-precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The nitrogen-coordinated Fe sites are described as the first coordination sphere. As opposed to the good performance in ORR, that in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely poor due to the sluggish O-O coupling process, thus hampering the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn)-air batteries. Herein, we succeed in boosting the OER activity of Fe-N-C by additionally incorporating phosphorus atoms into the second coordination sphere, here denoted as P/Fe-N-C. The resulting material exhibits excellent OER activity in 0.1 M KOH with an overpotential as low as 304 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Even more importantly, they exhibit a remarkably small ORR/OER potential gap of 0.63 V. Theoretical calculations using first-principles density functional theory suggest that the phosphorus enhances the electrocatalytic activity by balancing the *OOH/*O adsorption at the FeN4 sites. When used as an air cathode in a rechargeable Zn-air battery, P/Fe-N-C delivers a charge-discharge performance with a high peak power density of 269 mW cm-2, highlighting its role as the state-of-the-art bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.	0
Title: Interaction of kanamycin A and kanamycin B with phospholipids Abstract: It has been suggested that the aminoglycoside drugs are ototoxic because they contain amine groups that interact with membrane phospholipids. The interaction of kanamycin A and kanamycin B with vesicles containing various phospholipids was assessed from studies of vesicle aggregation and of the fluorescence of the probes 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) added to the system. Kanamycin B, with 5 amino groups, showed a stronger interaction with the acidic phospholipids than kanamycin A, with only 4 amino groups. The evidence indicated that the interaction was an ionic one involving the charged groups of both components with penetration of the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayers. Of all the phospholipids tested polyphosphoinositide showed the greatest ability to interact with the kanamycins, supporting the proposal that interaction with this phospholipid may be the basis of the ototoxicity of aminoglycosides.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Streptomyces sp. Tü 6176: Characterization of the Nataxazole Biosynthesis Pathway Abstract: Streptomyces sp. Tü 6176 produces the cytotoxic benzoxazole nataxazole. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of this organism predicts the presence of 38 putative secondary-metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, including those involved in the biosynthesis of AJI9561 and its derivative nataxazole, the antibiotic hygromycin B, and ionophores enterobactin and coelibactin. The nataxazole biosynthesis gene cluster was identified and characterized: it lacks the O-methyltransferase gene required to convert AJI9561 into nataxazole. This O-methyltransferase activity might act as a resistance mechanism, as AJI9561 shows antibiotic activity whereas nataxazole is inactive. Moreover, heterologous expression of the nataxazole biosynthesis gene cluster in S. lividans JT46 resulted in the production of AJI9561. Nataxazole biosynthesis requires the shikimate pathway to generate 3-hydroxyanthranilate and an iterative type I PKS to generate 6-methylsalicylate. Production of nataxazole was improved up to fourfold by disrupting one regulatory gene in the cluster. An additional benzoxazole, 5-hydroxynataxazole is produced by Streptomyces sp. Tü 6176. 5-Hydroxynataxazole derives from nataxazole by the activity of an as yet unidentified oxygenase; this implies cross-talk between the nataxazole biosynthesis pathway and an unknown pathway.	1
Title: A new genome-mining tool redefines the lasso peptide biosynthetic landscape Abstract: Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products are attractive for genome-driven discovery and re-engineering, but limitations in bioinformatic methods and exponentially increasing genomic data make large-scale mining of RiPP data difficult. We report RODEO (Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online), which combines hidden-Markov-model-based analysis, heuristic scoring, and machine learning to identify biosynthetic gene clusters and predict RiPP precursor peptides. We initially focused on lasso peptides, which display intriguing physicochemical properties and bioactivities, but their hypervariability renders them challenging prospects for automated mining. Our approach yielded the most comprehensive mapping to date of lasso peptide space, revealing >1,300 compounds. We characterized the structures and bioactivities of six lasso peptides, prioritized based on predicted structural novelty, including one with an unprecedented handcuff-like topology and another with a citrulline modification exceptionally rare among bacteria. These combined insights significantly expand the knowledge of lasso peptides and, more broadly, provide a framework for future genome-mining efforts.	1
Title: Three-component asymmetric catalytic Ugi reaction--concinnity from diversity by substrate-mediated catalyst assembly Abstract: The first chiral catalyst for the three-component Ugi reaction was identified as a result of a screen of a large set of different BOROX catalysts. The BOROX catalysts were assembled in situ from a chiral biaryl ligand, an amine, water, BH3·SMe2, and an alcohol or phenol. The catalyst screen included 13 different ligands, 12 amines, and 47 alcohols or phenols. The optimal catalyst system (LAP 8-5-47) provided α-amino amides from an aldehyde, a secondary amine, and an isonitrile with excellent asymmetric induction. The catalytically active species is proposed to be an ion pair that consists of the chiral boroxinate anion and an iminium cation.	0
Title: Stabilizing the Oxygen Lattice and Reversible Oxygen Redox Chemistry through Structural Dimensionality in Lithium-Rich Cathode Oxides Abstract: Lattice-oxygen redox (l-OR) has become an essential companion to the traditional transition-metal (TM) redox charge compensation to achieve high capacity in Li-rich cathode oxides. However, the understanding of l-OR chemistry remains elusive, and a critical question is the structural effect on the stability of l-OR reactions. Herein, the coupling between l-OR and structure dimensionality is studied. We reveal that the evolution of the oxygen-lattice structure upon l-OR in Li-rich TM oxides which have a three-dimensional (3D)-disordered cation framework is relatively stable, which is in direct contrast to the clearly distorted oxygen-lattice framework in Li-rich oxides which have a two-dimensional (2D)/3D-ordered cation structure. Our results highlight the role of structure dimensionality in stabilizing the oxygen lattice in reversible l-OR, which broadens the horizon for designing high-energy-density Li-rich cathode oxides with stable l-OR chemistry.	0
Title: Parametric instability of optical non-Hermitian systems near the exceptional point Abstract: In contrast to Hermitian systems, the modes of non-Hermitian systems are generally nonorthogonal. As a result, the power of the system signal depends not only on the mode amplitudes but also on the phase shift between them. In this work, we show that it is possible to increase the mode amplitudes without increasing the power of the signal. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the system is at the exceptional point, any infinitesimally small change in the system parameters increases the mode amplitudes. As a result, the system becomes unstable with respect to such perturbation. We show such instability by using the example of two coupled waveguides in which loss prevails over gain and all modes are decaying. This phenomenon enables compensation for losses in dissipative systems and opens a wide range of applications in optics, plasmonics, and optoelectronics, in which loss is an inevitable problem and plays a crucial role.	0
Title: Biosynthetic origin of the antibiotic cyclocarbamate brabantamide A (SB-253514) in plant-associated Pseudomonas Abstract: Within the framework of our genome-based program to discover new antibiotic lipopeptides from Pseudomonads, brabantamides A-C were isolated from plant-associated Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52. Brabantamides A-C displayed moderate to high in vitro activities against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Their shared structure is unique in that they contain a 5,5-bicyclic carbamate scaffold. Here, the biosynthesis of brabantamide A (SB-253514) was studied by a combination of bioinformatics, feeding experiments with isotopically labelled precursors and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes encoded in the biosynthetic pathway. The studies resulted in the deduction of all biosynthetic building blocks of brabantamide A and revealed an unusual feature of this metabolite: its biosynthesis occurs via an initially formed linear di-lipopeptide that is subsequently rearranged by a novel FAD-dependent Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase.	1
Title: Cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation is required for polyketide macrolactonization in stambomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Many polyketide antibiotics contain macrolactones that arise from polyketide synthase chain release via thioesterase (TE) domain-catalyzed macrolactonization. The hydroxyl groups utilized in such macrolactonization reactions typically derive from reduction of β-ketothioester intermediates in polyketide chain assembly. The stambomycins are a group of novel macrolide antibiotics with promising anticancer activity that we recently discovered via rational activation of a silent polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces ambofaciens. Here we report that the hydroxyl group utilized for formation of the macrolactone in the stambomycins is derived from cytochrome P450-catalyzed hydroxylation of the polyketide chain rather than keto reduction during chain assembly. This is a novel mechanism for macrolactone formation in polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis.	1
Title: The Silicon-Hydrogen Exchange Reaction: A Catalytic σ-Bond Metathesis Approach to the Enantioselective Synthesis of Enol Silanes Abstract: The use of chiral enol silanes in fundamental transformations such as Mukaiyama aldol, Michael, and Mannich reactions as well as Saegusa-Ito dehydrogenations has enabled the chemical synthesis of enantiopure natural products and valuable pharmaceuticals. However, accessing these intermediates in high enantiopurity has generally required the use of either stoichiometric chiral precursors or stoichiometric chiral reagents. We now describe a catalytic approach in which strongly acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPi) catalyze highly enantioselective interconversions of ketones and enol silanes. These "silicon-hydrogen exchange reactions" enable access to enantiopure enol silanes via tautomerizing σ-bond metatheses, either in a deprotosilylative desymmetrization of ketones with allyl silanes as the silicon source or in a protodesilylative kinetic resolution of racemic enol silanes with a carboxylic acid as the silyl acceptor.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn5-induced mutants of Pseudomonas perfectomarina defective in nitrous oxide respiration Abstract: Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of Pseudomonas perfectomarina with the plasmid pSUP2021 [(pBR325-Mob(RP4))::Tn5] and the chromosomally integrated RP4 plasmid in Escherichia coli as the donor, produced three distinct groups of mutants that were defective in nitrous oxide respiration. One group of mutants lacked the structural protein of N2O reductase, the second synthesized a copper-free apoprotein; and a third group expressed a low level of intact enzyme. The mutants provided evidence for N2O being the immediate precursor of dinitrogen in denitrification and documented the essentiality of the copper enzyme. Synthesis of N2O reductase depended strongly on the growth conditions, with N2O-grown cells expressing the lowest level of enzyme. Regulatory responses of mutants elicited by nitrate or oxygen were unaltered when compared with wild-type behavior.	0
Title: Fungal Dirigent Protein Controls the Stereoselectivity of Multicopper Oxidase-Catalyzed Phenol Coupling in Viriditoxin Biosynthesis Abstract: Paecilomyces variotii produces the antibacterial and cytotoxic ( M)-viriditoxin (1) together with a trace amount of its atropisomer ( P)-viriditoxin 1'. Elucidation of the biosynthesis by heterologous pathway reconstruction in Aspergillus nidulans identified the multicopper oxidase (MCO) VdtB responsible for the regioselective 6,6'-coupling of semiviriditoxin (10), which yielded 1 and 1' at a ratio of 1:2. We further uncovered that VdtD, an α/β hydrolase-like protein lacking the catalytic serine, directs the axial chirality of the products. Using recombinant VdtB and VdtD as cell-free extracts from A. nidulans, we demonstrated that VdtD acts like a dirigent protein to control the stereoselectivity of the coupling catalyzed by VdtB to yield 1 and 1' at a ratio of 20:1. Furthermore, we uncovered a unique Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) VdtE that could transform the alkyl methylketone side chain to methyl ester against the migratory aptitude.	1
Title: Mild and rapid hydroxylation of aryl/heteroaryl boronic acids and boronate esters with N-oxides Abstract: Aryl and heteroaryl boronic acids and boronate esters are rapidly, often within minutes, transformed into the corresponding phenols by N-oxides in an open flask at ambient temperature. This transformation has broad compatibility with a variety of functional groups.	0
Title: Unified Biosynthetic Origin of the Benzodipyrrole Subunits in CC-1065 Abstract: CC-1065 is the first characterized member of a family of naturally occurring antibiotics including yatakemycin and duocarmycins with exceptionally potent antitumor activity. CC-1065 contains three benzodipyrroles (1a-, 1b-, and 1c-) of which the 1a-subunit is remarkable by being composed of a cyclopropane ring, and the mechanism for the biological formation of benzodipyrrole rings remains elusive. Previously, biosynthetic studies of CC-1065 were limited to radioactively labeled precursor feeding experiments, which showed that tyrosine (Tyr) and serine (Ser) were incorporated into the two benzodipyrrole (1b- and 1c-) subunits via the same mode but that this was different from the key cyclopropabenzodipyrrole (1a-) subunit with N1-C2-C3 derived from Ser. Herein, the biosynthetic gene cluster of CC-1065 has been cloned, analyzed, and characterized by a series of gene inactivations. Significantly, a key intermediate bearing a C7-OH group derived from a Δc10C mutant exhibited improved cytotoxicity. Moreover, this data inspired us to suspect that the 1a-subunit might employ the same precursor incorporation mode as the 1b- and 1c-subunits. Subsequently, 13C-labeled Tyr feeding experiments confirmed that the N1-C2-C3 is originated from Tyr via DOPA as an intermediate. Collectively, a biosynthetic pathway of benzodipyrrole is proposed featuring a revised and unified precursor incorporation mode, which implicates an oxidative cyclization strategy for the assembly of benzodipyrrole. This work sets the stage for further study of enzymatic mechanisms and combinatorial biosynthesis for new DNA alkylating analogues.	1
Title: Molecular Genetic Characterization of an Anthrabenzoxocinones Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Sp. FJS31-2 for the Biosynthesis of BE-24566B and Zunyimycin Ale Abstract: Genome mining is an effective tool used to discover novel natural products from actinomycetes. Genome sequence analysis of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 revealed the presence of one putative type II polyketide gene cluster (ABX), which may correspond to type II polyketide products including BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives. The addition of natural humus acid successfully activated the biosynthsis of the abx gene cluster. BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives, named zunyimycin A, were also detected. The targeted deletion of the polyketide skeleton synthesis genes such as abxp, abxk, and abxs was performed in the wild strain to identify the gene cluster for BE-24566B biosynthesis.	1
Title: Specificity of the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade for ubiquitin C-terminal sequences identified by phage display Abstract: Ubiquitin (UB) is a protein modifier that regulates many essential cellular processes. To initiate protein modification by UB, the E1 enzyme activates the C-terminal carboxylate of UB to launch its transfer through the E1-E2-E3 cascade onto target proteins. In this study, we used phage display to profile the specificity of the two human E1 enzymes, Ube1 and Uba6, toward the C-terminal sequence of UB ending with (71)LRLRGG(76). Phage selection revealed that while Arg72 of UB is absolutely required for E1 recognition, UB residues at positions 71, 73, and 74 can be replaced with bulky aromatic side chains, and Gly75 of UB can be changed to Ser, Asp, and Asn for efficient E1 activation. We have thus found that the E1 enzymes have substantial promiscuity regarding the UB C-terminal sequence. The UB variants from phage selection can also be transferred from E1 to E2 enzymes; however, they are blocked from further transfer to the E3 enzymes. This suggests that the C-terminal sequence of UB is important for its discharge from E2 and subsequent transfer to E3. In addition, we observed that the Leu73Phe and Leu73Tyr single mutants of UB are resistant to cleavage by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), although they can be assembled by the E1-E2-E3 cascade into poly-UB chains, thus indicating differences in UB C-terminal specificities between the E1 and DUBs. Consequently these UB mutants may provide stability to UB polymers attached to cellular proteins and facilitate the elucidation of the biological signals encoded in the UB chains.	0
Title: Expression, purification and preliminary diffraction studies of CmlS Abstract: CmlS, a flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) present in the chloramphenicol-biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces venezuelae, directs the dichlorination of an acetyl group. The reaction mechanism of CmlS is of considerable interest as it will help to explain how the FDH family can halogenate a wide range of substrates through a common mechanism. The protein has been recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method was used to produce crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction. Data were collected to 2.0 A resolution. The crystal belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 208.1, b = 57.7, c = 59.9 A, beta = 97.5 degrees .	1
Title: Enzyme-catalyzed macrocyclization of long unprotected peptides Abstract: A glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalyzed macrocyclization reaction for peptides up to 40 amino acids in length is reported. GST catalyzes the selective S(N)Ar reaction between an N-terminal glutathione (GSH, γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) tag and a C-terminal perfluoroaryl-modified cysteine on the same polypeptide chain. Cyclic peptides ranging from 9 to 24 residues were quantitatively produced within 2 h in aqueous pH = 8 buffer at room temperature. The reaction was highly selective for cyclization at the GSH tag, enabling the combination of GST-catalyzed ligation with native chemical ligation to generate a large 40-residue peptide macrocycle.	0
Title: When it is hard to get to with genetics--planar cell polarity under a chemical scalpel Abstract: Planar cell polarity (PCP) has been under genetic dissection for decades. More and more fundamental developmental processes have been found relying on PCP signaling. However, mechanisms of how PCP signaling generates asymmetry is still unknown. A recent paper in Chemistry & Biology (Sundberg et al., 2011) represents the efforts to decipher the intracellular code of polarity signaling.	0
Title: A Luminescence-Based Coupled Enzyme Assay Enables High-Throughput Quantification of the Bacterial Second Messenger 3'3'-Cyclic-Di-AMP Abstract: Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems, which are found ubiquitously throughout nature, allow organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the second messenger, cyclic di-(3',5')-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c-di-AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c-di-AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c-di-AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase-based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high-throughput quantification of 3'3'-c-di-AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3'3'-cGAMP. These findings establish CDA-Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c-di-AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.	0
Title: Resolving DNA at efficiencies of more than a million plates per meter using bare narrow open capillaries without sieving matrices Abstract: We report a novel approach for effectively separating DNA molecules in free solution. The method uses a bare narrow open capillary without any sieving matrices to resolve a wide size-range of DNA fragments at efficiencies of more than a million plates per meter routinely.	0
Title: Structure of trichamide, a cyclic peptide from the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum, predicted from the genome sequence Abstract: A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a new small cyclic peptide, dubbed trichamide, was discovered in the genome of the global, bloom-forming marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM101 because of striking similarities to the previously characterized patellamide biosynthesis cluster. The tri cluster consists of a precursor peptide gene containing the amino acid sequence for mature trichamide, a putative heterocyclization gene, an oxidase, two proteases, and hypothetical genes. Based upon detailed sequence analysis, a structure was predicted for trichamide and confirmed by Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Trichamide consists of 11 amino acids, including two cysteine-derived thiazole groups, and is cyclized by an N C terminal amide bond. As the first natural product reported from T. erythraeum, trichamide shows the power of genome mining in the prediction and discovery of new natural products.	1
Title: Antimicrobial activity of clioquinol and nitroxoline: a scoping review Abstract: Clioquinol and nitroxoline, two drugs with numerous pharmacological properties fallen into disuse for many decades. The first was considered dangerous due to contraindications and the second mainly because was taken as ineffective, despite its known antibacterial activity. In the last decades, the advances in pharmaceutical chemistry, molecular biology, toxicology and genetics allowed to better understand the cellular action of these compounds, some toxicological issues and/or activity scopes. Thus, a new opportunity for these drugs to be considered as potential antimicrobial agents has arisen. This review contemplates the trajectory of clioquinol and nitroxoline from their emergence to the present day, emphasizing the new studies that indicate the possibility of reintroduction for specific cases.	0
Title: Efficient in vivo synthesis of lasso peptide pseudomycoidin proceeds in the absence of both the leader and the leader peptidase Abstract: Bacterial lasso peptides are made from linear ribosomally synthesized precursors by specific cleavage at the leader-core junction site of the precursor by a dedicated protease recognizing the leader, followed by cyclisation of the newly formed N-terminus of the core part with a side chain of the internal aspartic or glutamic residue catalyzed by a macrolactam synthetase. The resulting structure has a tail that is threaded and fixed inside the cycle formed. Here, we characterize a new lasso peptide, pseudomycoidin, encoded by Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442. The most surprising and unique feature of pseudomycoidin is that it can be produced in vivo from the ribosomally synthesized core part by a macrolactam synthetase, in the absence of the leader protease. The minimalism of the pseudomycoidin synthesis system makes it a powerful model to generate pseudomycoidin-based lasso-peptide libraries and to study the poorly understood process of lasso formation. We detected two additional pseudomycoidin modifications: phosphorylation of a terminal residue that was previously observed in another lasso peptide, followed by glycosylation, which was not observed heretofore. We speculate that these bulky C-terminal modifications may help maintain the threaded lasso topology of the compound synthesized by the macrolactam synthetase.	0
Title: Chaetoglobosins and azaphilones from Chaetomium globosum associated with Apostichopus japonicus Abstract: Increasing attention has recently been focused on complex symbiotic associations, for instance coral and its symbionts. Sea cucumber, harboring diverse fungi, has also attracted more and more attention for their functional diversity. Here, secondary metabolites produced by Chaetomium globosum associated with sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, were investigated using gene mining with third-generation sequencing technology (PacBio SMRT). Nine compounds, including one new compound cytoglobosin X (1), were isolated from cultures of Chaetomium globosum. Compound 1 was identified based on NMR data, HRESIMS, and ECD, and the absolute configurations were identified as 3S, 4R, 7S, 8R, 9R, 16S, 19S, 20S, and 23S. In an antimicrobial assay, compound 4 showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with MICs of 47.3 and 94.6 μM, respectively. Our results suggest that the microbiomes associated with sea cucumber could be an important resource for biodiversity and structural novelty, and the bioactive compounds may protect the host from pathogen microbial.	1
Title: REVERSAL OF d-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL GROWTH BY ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Reversal of d-cycloserine inhibition of bacterial growth by alanine. J. Bacteriol. 84:154-156. 1962.-Reversal of the antibacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidone by alanine in bacterial cultures actively growing on chemically defined media was compared in cultures requiring exogenous alanine and those capable of its synthesis. dl-Alanine was the most effective reversal agent in Pediococcus cerevisiae, an alanine-requiring organism, and d-alanine was effective in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, organisms synthesizing alanine. With all three cultures, l-alanine was the least effective reversal agent.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Ether-Bridge Formation in Nargenicin Macrolides Abstract: The nargenicin family of antibiotics are macrolides containing a rare ether-bridged cis-decalin motif. Several of these compounds are highly active against multi-drug resistant organisms. Despite the identification of the first members of this family almost 40 years ago, the genetic basis for the production of these molecules and the enzyme responsible for formation of the oxa bridge, remain unknown. Here, the 85 kb nargenicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from a human pathogenic Nocardia arthritidis isolate and this locus is solely responsible for nargenicin production. Further investigation of this locus revealed a putative iron-α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, which was found to be responsible for the formation of the ether bridge from the newly identified deoxygenated precursor, 8,13-deoxynargenicin. Uncovering the nargenicin biosynthetic locus provides a molecular basis for the rational bioengineering of these interesting antibiotic macrolides.	1
Title: Mutational analyses of HAMP helices suggest a dynamic bundle model of input-output signalling in chemoreceptors Abstract: To test the gearbox model of HAMP signalling in the Escherichia coli serine receptor, Tsr, we generated a series of amino acid replacements at each residue of the AS1 and AS2 helices. The residues most critical for Tsr function defined hydrophobic packing faces consistent with a four-helix bundle. Suppression patterns of helix lesions conformed to the predicted packing layers in the bundle. Although the properties and patterns of most AS1 and AS2 lesions were consistent with both proposed gearbox structures, some mutational features specifically indicate the functional importance of an x-da bundle over an alternative a-d bundle. These genetic data suggest that HAMP signalling could simply involve changes in the stability of its x-da bundle. We propose that Tsr HAMP controls output signals by modulating destabilizing phase clashes between the AS2 helices and the adjoining kinase control helices. Our model further proposes that chemoeffectors regulate HAMP bundle stability through a control cable connection between the transmembrane segments and AS1 helices. Attractant stimuli, which cause inward piston displacements in chemoreceptors, should reduce cable tension, thereby stabilizing the HAMP bundle. This study shows how transmembrane signalling and HAMP input-output control could occur without the helix rotations central to the gearbox model.	0
Title: Simple photometric assay of beta-lactamase activity Abstract: A simple photometric assay of beta-lactamase activity was developed. The method is based on a decrease in optical density at 620 nm caused by the formation of a penicilloic acid-iodine complex. The enzymatic reaction is instantaneously stopped by the addition of a concentrated iodine-tungstate solution. Data showing the time and concentration dependence of the reaction are presented. By varying both the time of the assay and the concentration of the enzyme, substrates of widely different V(max) values could be assayed. The assay is compared with other methods of determining beta-lactamase activity.	0
Title: The gene PatG involved in the biosynthesis pathway of patulin, a food-borne mycotoxin, encodes a 6-methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase Abstract: Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by fungal genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium and Byssochlamys. It induces neurological, gastrointestinal and immunological effects, which is why patulin belongs to a short list of mycotoxins whose level in food is regulated in many countries around the world. Recently, a cluster gathering 15 genes involved in the biosynthesis of patulin has been identified in Aspergillus clavatus, but so far, only 4 genes encoding 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase, m-cresol hydroxylase, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol hydroxylase and isoepoxydon dehydrogenase have been characterized. Previous studies have shown the involvement of a decarboxylase in the transformation of 6-methylsalicylic acid, the first stable patulin precursor, into m-cresol. In this study a putative decarboxylase gene, PatG, was identified in the genome sequence of A. clavatus. This gene is located near two P450 cytochrome genes PatH and PatI responsible respectively for the hydroxylation of m-cresol and m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. This decarboxylase encoded by PatG (ACLA_093620) consists of 325 amino acids. The search for putative conserved domain revealed that the gene product belongs to the AminoCarboxyMuconate Semialdehyde Decarboxylase (ACMSD) related protein family. This family includes decarboxylases such as the γ-resorcylate decarboxylase or o-pyrocatechuate decarboxylase. The substrates of these enzymes display strong structural similarities with 6-methylsalicylic acid. PatG was strongly expressed during patulin production whereas it was very weakly expressed in non-patulin permissive conditions. The coding sequence was used to enable heterologous expression of functional enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of decarboxylase was confirmed by Western blot. The bioconversion assays showed that PATG catalyzed the decarboxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid into m-cresol. These results confirm for the first time that 6-methylsalicylic acid is the substrate for PATG, the 6-methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase. With this study, the four genes involved in the four first steps of patulin biosynthesis pathway (acetate→gentisyl alcohol) are now identified.	1
Title: Interchenar retrotransfer of aureothin intermediates in an iterative polyketide synthase module Abstract: The course of the enigmatic iterative use of a polyketide synthase module was deduced from targeted domain inactivation in the aureothin assembly line. Mutational analyses revealed that the N-terminus of AurA is not involved in the iteration process, ruling out an ACP-ACP shuttle. Furthermore, an AurA(KS°, ACP°)-AurA(AT(0)) heterodimer proved to be nonfunctional, whereas aureothin production was restored in a ΔaurA mutant complemented with AurA(KS°)-AurA(ACP°). This finding supports a model according to which the ACP-bound polyketide intermediate is transferred back to the KS domain on the opposite PKS strand.	1
Title: Genomics-guided discovery of thailanstatins A, B, and C As pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors and antiproliferative agents from Burkholderia thailandensis MSMB43 Abstract: Mining the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis MSMB43 revealed a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster resembling that of FR901464 (4), a prototype spliceosome inhibitor produced by Pseudomonas sp. No. 2663. Transcriptional analysis revealed a cultivation condition in which a regulatory gene of the cryptic gene cluster is adequately expressed. Consequently, three new compounds, named thailanstatins A (1), B (2), and C (3), were isolated from the fermentation broth of B. thailandensis MSMB43. Thailanstatins are proposed to be biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway. They differ from 4 by lacking an unstable hydroxyl group and by having an extra carboxyl moiety; those differences endow thailanstatins with a significantly greater stability than 4 as tested in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. In vitro assays showed that thailanstatins inhibit pre-mRNA splicing as potently as 4, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the single to sub-μM range. Cell culture assays indicated that thailanstatins also possess potent antiproliferative activities in representative human cancer cell lines, with half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations in the single nM range. This work provides new chemical entities for research and development and new structure-activity information for chemical optimization of related spliceosome inhibitors.	1
Title: Gene cluster in Micromonospora echinospora ATCC15835 for the biosynthesis of the gentamicin C complex Abstract: Gentamicin is a 4,6-disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotic complex synthesised by some members of the actinomycete genus Micromonospora. In a search for the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster we identified, using a cosmid library approach, a region of the M. echinospora ATCC15835 chromosome that encodes homologues of aminoglycoside biosynthesis genes including gntB-a close homologue of the 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase gene (btrC) from butirosin-producing Bacillus circulans. Insertional inactivation was achieved by homologous recombination with an internal gntB fragment-containing suicide plasmid, delivered by conjugal transfer from Escherichia coli. gntB disruptants were gentamicin nonproducing mutants as assayed by an ELISA antibiotic detection system, proving the association of gntB (or a downstream region) with gentamicin biosynthesis. The function of some open reading frames within the cluster, predicted by nucleotide database homology searching, is discussed with regards to their potential roles in gentamicin biosynthesis. The discovery of this genetic region represents the first report of a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of a 4,6-disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotic.	1
Title: A highly efficient microwave-assisted suzuki coupling reaction of aryl perfluorooctylsulfonates with boronic acids Abstract: [reaction: see text] A new strategy to improve the efficiency of Suzuki coupling reactions is introduced by combining fast microwave reaction with easy fluorous separation. Aryl perfluorooctylsulfonates derived from the corresponding phenols are coupled with aryl boronic acids to form biaryls under general microwave conditions. Both intermediates and products are purified by solid-phase extraction over FluoroFlash silica gel. Application of this tagging strategy to multistep synthesis of biaryl-substituted hydantoin is also described.	0
Title: Oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory control phenomenon in Paracoccus denitrificans plasma membrane Abstract: Changes in respiratory activity, transmembrane electric potential, and ATP synthesis as induced by additions of limited amounts of ADP and P(i) to tightly coupled inverted (inside-out) Paracoccus denitrificans plasma membrane vesicles were traced. The pattern of the changes was qualitatively the same as those observed for coupled mitochondria during the classical State 4-State 3-State 4 transition. Bacterial vesicles devoid of energy-dependent permeability barriers for the substrates of oxidation and phosphorylation were used as a simple experimental model to investigate two possible mechanisms of respiratory control: (i) in State 4 phosphoryl transfer potential (ATP/ADP × P(i)) is equilibrated with proton-motive force by reversibly operating F(1)·F(o)-ATPase (thermodynamic control); (ii) in State 4 apparent "equilibrium" is reached by unidirectional operation of proton motive force-activated F(1)·F(o)-ATP synthase. The data support the kinetic mechanism of the respiratory control phenomenon.	0
Title: Rapid Purification of Human Bispecific Antibodies via Selective Modulation of Protein A Binding Abstract: Methods to rapidly generate high quality bispecific antibodies (BsAb) having normal half-lives are critical for therapeutic programs. Here, we identify 3 mutations (T307P, L309Q, and Q311R or "TLQ") in the Fc region of human IgG1 which disrupt interaction with protein A while enhancing interaction with FcRn. The mutations are shown to incrementally alter the pH at which a mAb elutes from protein A affinity resin. A BsAb comprised of a TLQ mutant and a wild-type IgG1 can be efficiently separated from contaminating parental mAbs by differential protein A elution starting from either a) purified parental mAbs, b) in-supernatant crossed parental mAbs, or c) co-transfected mAbs. We show that the Q311R mutation confers enhanced FcRn interaction in vitro, and Abs harboring either the Q311R or TLQ mutations have serum half-lives as long as wild-type human IgG1. The mutant Abs have normal thermal stability and Fcγ receptor interactions. Together, the results lead to a method for high-throughput generation of BsAbs suitable for in vivo studies.	0
Title: Characterization of vaginal microbial communities in adult healthy women using cultivation-independent methods Abstract: The normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. Thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the aetiology of these diseases. Common wisdom is that lactobacilli dominate the normal vaginal microflora of post-pubertal women. However, this conclusion is based on methods that require cultivation of microbial populations; an approach that is known to yield a biased and incomplete assessment of microbial community structure. In this study cultivation-independent methods were used to analyse samples collected from the mid-vagina of five normal healthy Caucasian women between the ages of 28 and 44. Total microbial community DNA was isolated following resuspension of microbial cells from vaginal swabs. To identify the constituent numerically dominant populations in each community 16S rRNA gene libraries were prepared following PCR amplification using the 8f and 926r primers. From each library, the DNA sequences of approximately 200 16S rRNA clones were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. The diversity and kinds of organisms that comprise the vaginal microbial community varied among women. Species of Lactobacillus appeared to dominate the communities in four of the five women. However, the community of one woman was dominated by Atopobium sp., whereas a second woman had appreciable numbers of Megasphaera sp., Atopobium sp. and Leptotrichia sp., none of which have previously been shown to be common members of the vaginal ecosystem. Of the women whose communities were dominated by lactobacilli, there were two distinct clusters, each of which consisted of a single species. One class consisted of two women with genetically divergent clones that were related to Lactobacillus crispatus, whereas the second group of two women had clones of Lactobacillus iners that were highly related to a single phylotype. These surprising results suggest that culture-independent methods can provide new insights into the diversity of bacterial species found in the human vagina, and this information could prove to be pivotal in understanding risk factors for various infectious diseases.	0
Title: Direct pathway cloning of the sodorifen biosynthetic gene cluster and recombinant generation of its product in E. coli Abstract: Background:                       Serratia plymuthica WS3236 was selected for whole genome sequencing based on preliminary genetic and chemical screening indicating the presence of multiple natural product pathways. This led to the identification of a putative sodorifen biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The natural product sodorifen is a volatile organic compound (VOC) with an unusual polymethylated hydrocarbon bicyclic structure (C16H26) produced by selected strains of S. plymuthica. The BGC encoding sodorifen consists of four genes, two of which (sodA, sodB) are homologs of genes encoding enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway and are thought to enhance the amounts of available farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the precursor of sodorifen. Proceeding from FPP, only two enzymes are necessary to produce sodorifen: an S-adenosyl methionine dependent methyltransferase (SodC) with additional cyclisation activity and a terpene-cyclase (SodD). Previous analysis of S. plymuthica found sodorifen production titers are generally low and vary significantly among different producer strains. This precludes studies on the still elusive biological function of this structurally and biosynthetically fascinating bacterial terpene.                  Results:                       Sequencing and mining of the S. plymuthica WS3236 genome revealed the presence of 38 BGCs according to antiSMASH analysis, including a putative sodorifen BGC. Further genome mining for sodorifen and sodorifen-like BGCs throughout bacteria was performed using SodC and SodD as queries and identified a total of 28 sod-like gene clusters. Using direct pathway cloning (DiPaC) we intercepted the 4.6 kb candidate sodorifen BGC from S. plymuthica WS3236 (sodA-D) and transformed it into Escherichia coli BL21. Heterologous expression under the control of the tetracycline inducible PtetO promoter firmly linked this BGC to sodorifen production. By utilizing this newly established expression system, we increased the production yields by approximately 26-fold when compared to the native producer. In addition, sodorifen was easily isolated in high purity by simple head-space sampling.                  Conclusions:                       Genome mining of all available genomes within the NCBI and JGI IMG databases led to the identification of a wealth of sod-like pathways which may be responsible for producing a range of structurally unknown sodorifen analogs. Introduction of the S. plymuthica WS3236 sodorifen BGC into the fast-growing heterologous expression host E. coli with a very low VOC background led to a significant increase in both sodorifen product yield and purity compared to the native producer. By providing a reliable, high-level production system, this study sets the stage for future investigations of the biological role and function of sodorifen and for functionally unlocking the bioinformatically identified putative sod-like pathways.	1
Title: Collinone, a new recombinant angular polyketide antibiotic made by an engineered Streptomyces strain Abstract: Large chromosomal DNA fragments containing different parts of the putative rubromycin polyketide synthase gene cluster were cloned and functionally expressed in S. coelicolor CH999. Expression of these clones yielded 5 approximately 10 metabolites that were not detected in S. collinus culture extracts. This paper focusses on one of the new metabolites, termed collinone, that was isolated in large quantities and purified for spectroscopic structure determination and biological screening assays. Collinone is a heavily oxidized angular hexacyclic compound containing an unusual 1,4,5,8(2H,3H)-anthracenetetrone moiety previously only reported to be present in antibiotics SF2446A1, A2, A3, B1 and B2 isolated from Streptomyces sp. SF2446. Structure analysis of collinone indicates a tridecaketide with a 26 carbon backbone. The basic benz[a]naphthacene ring system of collinone is angular, similar to the aglycones of the well-known angucycline and angucyclinone antibiotics. While collinone showed antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, no antifungal or significant antiviral activities were detected. Collinone could be a good starting point to obtain new bioactive angucyclin(on)e-like compounds by further genetic engineering of its pathway.	1
Title: Mechanistic insight with HBCH2CoA as a probe to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthases Abstract: Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthases catalyze the polymerization of 3-(R)-hydroxybutyrate coenzyme A (HBCoA) to produce polyoxoesters of 1-2 MDa. A substrate analogue HBCH2CoA, in which the S in HBCoA is replaced with a CH2 group, was synthesized in 13 steps using a chemoenzymatic approach in a 7.5% overall yield. Kinetic studies reveal it is a competitive inhibitor of a class I and a class III PHB synthases, with Kis of 40 and 14 μM, respectively. To probe the elongation steps of the polymerization, HBCH2CoA was incubated with a synthase acylated with a [(3)H]-saturated trimer-CoA ([(3)H]-sTCoA). The products of the reaction were shown to be the methylene analogue of [(3)H]-sTCoA ([(3)H]-sT-CH2-CoA), saturated dimer-([(3)H]-sD-CO2H), and trimer-acid ([(3)H]-sT-CO2H), distinct from the expected methylene analogue of [(3)H]-saturated tetramer-CoA ([(3)H]-sTet-CH2-CoA). Detection of [(3)H]-sT-CH2-CoA and its slow rate of formation suggest that HBCH2CoA may be reporting on the termination and repriming process of the synthases, rather than elongation.	0
Title: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varing and Rare Heterocycles[] * Abstract: A metabolome-guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A, which features a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacyclines A-D display an isoxazole substructure, intriguingly myxofacyclines E and F were found to contain 4-pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2-dihydropyrol-3-one moiety. In addition to a full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycle in these natural products.	1
Title: Quantification of ERK Kinase Activity in Biological Samples Using Differential Sensing Abstract: The understanding of complex biological systems requires an ability to evaluate interacting networks of genes, proteins, and cellular reactions. Enabling technologies that support the rapid quantification of these networks will facilitate the development of biological models and help to identify treatment targets and to assess treatment plans. The biochemical process of protein phosphorylation, which underlies almost all aspects of cell signaling, is typically evaluated by immunoblotting procedures (Western blot) or more recently proteomics procedures, which provide qualitative estimates of the concentration of proteins and their modifications in cells. However, protein modifications are difficult to correlate with activity, and while immunoblotting and proteomics approaches have the potential to be quantitative, they require a complex series of steps that diminish reproducibility. Here, a complementary approach is presented that allows for the rapid quantification of a protein kinase activity in cell lysates and tumor samples. Using the activity of cellular ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) as a test case, an array sensing approach that utilizes a library of differential peptide-based biosensors and chemometric tools was used to rapidly quantify nanograms of active ERK in micrograms of unfractionated cell lysates and tumor extracts. This approach has the potential both for high-throughput and for quantifying the activities of multiple protein kinases in a single biological sample. The critical advantages of this differential sensing approach over others are that it removes the need for the addition of exogenous inhibitors to suppress the activities of major off-target kinases and allows us to quantitate the amount of active kinase in tested samples rather than measuring the changes in its activity upon induction or inhibition.	0
Title: Application of the prenatal BACs-on-Beads™ assay for rapid prenatal detection of sex chromosome mosaicism Abstract: The prenatal BACs-on-Beads™ (BoBs) assay was introduced for rapid detection of abnormalities of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y and specific nine significant microdeletion syndromes. The ability of prenatal BoBs to detect mosaicism ranged from 20 to 40%. However, there have been no prenatal studies of sex chromosome mosaicism in prenatal BoBs. Therefore, the present study was performed with an aim to uncover the detection level of sex chromosome mosaicism that application of prenatal BoBs assay, and then to assess the sensitivity of prenatal BoBs assay, thereby improving the prenatal diagnostic accuracy. A total of 31 samples of amniotic fluid (AF) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) for prenatal diagnosis were collected, and the results were confirmed through karyotyping, single nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNP-array) and copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq). 23 cases of sex chromosome mosaicism were prompted abnormal by prenatal BoBs, the minimum detection level of mosaicism was about 6% as detected by karyotype. The overall sensitivity of prenatal BoBs in the detection of sex chromosome mosaicism was 74.2% (23/31). This study evaluated the effectiveness of prenatal BoBs for detecting sex chromosome mosaicism in prenatal diagnosis, and the results will provide valuable information for genetic counseling.	0
Title: Characterization of hepatitis B virus capsids by resistive-pulse sensing Abstract: We report characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids by resistive-pulse sensing through single track-etched conical nanopores formed in poly(ethylene terephthalate) membranes. The pores were ∼40 nm in diameter at the tip, and the pore surface was covalently modified with triethylene glycol to reduce surface charge density, minimize adsorption of the virus capsids, and suppress electroosmotic flow in the pore. The HBV capsids were assembled in vitro from Cp149, the assembly domain of HBV capsid protein. Assembled T = 3 (90 Cp149 dimer) and T = 4 (120 dimer) capsids are 31 and 36 nm in diameter, respectively, and were easily discriminated by monitoring the change in current as capsids passed through an electrically biased pore. The ratio of the number of T = 3 to T = 4 capsids transiting a pore did not reflect actual concentrations, but favored transport of smaller T = 3 capsids. These results combined with longer transit times for the T = 4 capsids indicated that the capsids must overcome an entropic barrier to enter a pore.	0
Title: Artificially Linked Ubiquitin Dimers Characterised Structurally and Dynamically by NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: As one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotic cells, ubiquitylation plays vital roles in many cellular processes, such as protein degradation, DNA metabolism, and cell differentiation. Substrate proteins can be tagged by distinct types of polymeric ubiquitin (Ub) chains, which determine the eventual fate of the modified protein. A facile, click chemistry based approach for the efficient generation of linkage-defined Ub chains, including Ub dimers, was recently established. Within these chains, individual Ub moieties are connected through a triazole linkage, rather than the natural isopeptide bond. Herein, it is reported that the conformation of an artificially K48-linked Ub dimer resembles that of the natively linked dimer, with respect to structural and dynamic characteristics, as demonstrated by means of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Thus, it is proposed that artificially linked Ub dimers, as generated by this approach, represent potent tools for studying the inherently different properties and functions of distinct Ub chains.	0
Title: Development of a simvastatin selection marker for a hyperthermophilic acidophile, Sulfolobus islandicus Abstract: We report here a novel selectable marker for the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. The marker cassette is composed of the sac7d promoter and the hmg gene coding for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (P(sac7d)-hmg), which confers simvastatin resistance to this crenarchaeon. The basic plasmid vector pSSR was constructed by substituting the pyrEF gene of the expression vector pSeSD for P(sac7d)-hmg with which the Sulfolobus expression plasmids pSSRlacS, pSSRAherA, and pSSRNherA were constructed. Characterization of Sulfolobus transformants carrying pSSRlacS indicated that the plasmid was properly maintained under selection. High-level expression of the His(6)-tagged HerA helicase was obtained with the cells harboring pSSRAherA. The establishment of two efficient selectable markers (pyrEF and hmg) was subsequently exploited for genetic analysis. A herA merodiploid strain of S. islandicus was constructed using pyrEF marker and used as the host to obtain pSSRNherA transformant with simvastatin selection. While the gene knockout (ΔherA) cells generated from the herA merodiploid cells failed to form colonies in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), the mutant cells could be rescued by expression of the gene from a plasmid (pSSRNherA), because their transformants formed colonies on a solid medium containing 5-FOA and simvastatin. This demonstrates that HerA is essential for cell viability of S. islandicus. To our knowledge, this is the first application of an antibiotic selectable marker in genetic study for a hyperthermophilic acidophile and in the crenarchaeal lineage.	0
Title: A chemical and genetic approach to the mode of action of fumagillin Abstract: Previous mode of action studies identified methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2) as the target of the antiangiogenic natural product fumagillin and its drug candidate analog, TNP-470. We report here that TNP-470-mediated MetAP-2 inhibition blocks noncanonical Wnt signaling, which plays a critical role in development, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this finding, antisense MetAP-2 morpholino oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish embryos phenocopies gastrulation defects seen in noncanonical Wnt5 loss-of-function zebrafish mutants. MetAP-2 inhibition or depletion blocks signaling downstream of the Wnt receptor Frizzled, but upstream of Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II, RhoA, and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase. Moreover, we demonstrate that TNP-470 does not block the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Thus, TNP-470 selectively regulates noncanonical over canonical Wnt signaling and provides a unique means to explore and dissect the biological systems mediated by these pathways.	0
Title: The biosynthetic pathway of the aminonucleoside antibiotic puromycin, as deduced from the molecular analysis of the pur cluster of Streptomyces alboniger Abstract: The pur cluster which encodes the puromycin biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces alboniger was subcloned as a 13-kilobase fragment in plasmid pIJ702 and expressed in an apparently regulated manner in the heterologous host Streptomyces lividans. The sequencing of a 9.1-kilobase DNA fragment completed the sequence of pur. This permitted identification of seven new open reading frames in the order: napH, pur7, pur10, pur6, pur4, pur5, and pur3. The latter is followed by the known pac, dmpM, and pur8 genes. Nine open reading frames are transcribed rightward as a unit in opposite direction to that of the pur8 gene which is expressed as a monocistronic transcript from the right-most end. napH encodes the known N-acetylpuromycin N-acetylhydrolase. The deduced products from other open reading frames present similarities to: NTP pyrophosphohydrolases (pur7), several oxidoreductases (pur10), the putative LmbC protein of the lincomycin biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces lincolnensis (pur6), S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (pur5), a variety of presumed aminotransferases (pur4), and several monophosphatases (pur3). According to these similarities and to previous biochemical work, a puromycin biosynthetic pathway has been deduced. No cluster-associated regulatory gene was found. However, both pur10 and pur6 genes contain a TTA codon, which suggests that they are translationally controlled by the bldA gene product, a specific tRNA(Leu).	1
Title: Coumarin formation in novobiocin biosynthesis: beta-hydroxylation of the aminoacyl enzyme tyrosyl-S-NovH by a cytochrome P450 NovI Abstract: Background:                       Coumarin group antibiotics, such as novobiocin, coumermycin A1 and clorobiocin, are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. These antibiotics have been isolated from various Streptomyces species and all possess a 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin moiety as their structural core. Prior labeling experiments on novobiocin established that the coumarin moiety was derived from L-tyrosine, probably via a beta-hydroxy-tyrosine (beta-OH-Tyr) intermediate. Recently the novobiocin gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides was cloned and sequenced and allows analysis of the biosynthesis of the coumarin at the biochemical level using overexpressed and purified proteins.                  Results:                       Two open reading frames (ORFs), NovH and NovI, from the novobiocin producer S. spheroides have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized for tyrosine activation and oxygenation which are the initial steps in coumarin formation. The 65 kDa NovH has two predicted domains, an adenylation (A) and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), reminiscent of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Purified NovH catalyzes L-tyrosyl-AMP formation by its A domain, can be posttranslationally phosphopantetheinylated on the PCP domain, and accumulates the covalent L-tyrosyl-S-enzyme intermediate on the holo PCP domain. The second enzyme in the pathway, NovI, is a 45 kDa heme protein that functions as a cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase with specificity for the tyrosyl-S-NovH acyl enzyme. The product beta-OH-tyrosyl-S-NovH was detected by alkaline release and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radioactive [3H]beta-OH-Tyr and by mass spectrometry. Also detected was 4-OH-benzaldehyde, a retro aldol breakdown product of beta-OH-Tyr. The amino acid released was (3R,2S)-3-OH-Tyr by comparison with authentic standards.                  Conclusions:                       This work establishes that NovH and NovI are responsible for the formation of a beta-OH-Tyr intermediate that is covalently tethered to NovH in novobiocin biosynthesis. Comparable A-PCP/P450 pairs for amino acid beta-hydroxylation are found in various biosynthetic gene clusters, such as ORF19/ORF20 in the chloroeremomycin cluster for tyrosine, CumC/CumD in the coumermycin A1 cluster for tyrosine, and NikP1/NikQ in the nikkomycin cluster for histidine. This phenomenon of covalent docking of the amino acid in a kinetically stable thioester linkage prior to chemical modification by downstream tailoring enzymes, could represent a common strategy for controlling the partitioning of the amino acid for incorporation into secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the terpene phenalinolactone in Streptomyces sp. Tü6071: analysis of the gene cluster and generation of derivatives Abstract: Phenalinolactones are terpene glycosides with antibacterial activity. A striking structural feature is a highly oxidized gamma-butyrolactone of elusive biosynthetic origin. To investigate the genetic basis of the phenalinolactones biosynthesis, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding gene cluster from the producer strain Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. Spanning a 42 kbp region, 35 candidate genes could be assigned to putatively encode biosynthetic, regulatory, and resistance-conferring functions. Targeted gene inactivations were carried out to specifically manipulate the phenalinolactones pathway. The inactivation of a sugar methyltransferase gene and a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase gene led to the production of modified phenalinolactone derivatives. The inactivation of a Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene disrupted the biosynthetic pathway within gamma-butyrolactone formation. The structure elucidation of the accumulating intermediate indicated that pyruvate is the biosynthetic precursor of the gamma butyrolactone moiety.	1
Title: Early steps in carotenoid biosynthesis: sequences and transcriptional analysis of the crtI and crtB genes of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and overexpression and reactivation of crtI in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides Abstract: In the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the desaturation of phytoene has already been implicated in the assembly of the light-harvesting 2 complex (H.P. Lang and C.N. Hunter, Biochem. J. 298:197-205, 1994). The phytoene synthase and desaturase enzymes mediate the first steps specific for carotenoid biosynthesis up to and including the synthesis of the colored carotenoid neurosporene. In this report, we present the DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the genes encoding these proteins, namely, crtB and crtI, from R. sphaeroides and present evidence for the existence of a crtIB operon. Both genes have been shown to possess putative puc and puf operon-like promoter sequences, and oxygen regulation and the point of initiation of the crtI transcript have been demonstrated. The complete crtI gene has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides and shown to catalyze three desaturations of phytoene to give neurosporene. This activity was shown to be ATP dependent, and the cofactor requirement was investigated by using a spectroscopic assay for in vitro carotenogenic activity. Although the crtI and crtB genes have been sequenced from a number of different organisms, the transcriptional organization and regulation of these genes have not been analyzed in detail. In this report, we have located the transcription initiation point and have shown that R. sphaeroides possesses an oxygen-regulated CrtI-type phytoene desaturase gene that forms a transcriptional operon with crtB.	1
Title: Characterization and visualization of rat and guinea pig brain kappa opioid receptors: evidence for kappa 1 and kappa 2 opioid receptors Abstract: kappa opioid receptors (kappa receptors) have been characterized in homogenates of guinea pig and rat brain under in vitro binding conditions. kappa receptors were labeled by using the tritiated prototypic kappa opioid ethylketocyclazocine under conditions in which mu and delta opioid binding was suppressed. In the case of guinea pig brain membranes, a single population of high-affinity kappa opioid receptor sites (kappa sites; Kd = 0.66 nM, Bmax = 80 fmol/mg of protein) was observed. In contrast, in the case of rat brain, two populations of kappa sites were observed--high-affinity sites at low density (Kd = 1.0 nM, Bmax = 16 fmol/mg of protein) and low-affinity sites at high density (Kd = 13 nM, Bmax = 111 fmol/mg of protein). To test the hypothesis that the high- and low-affinity kappa sites represent two distinct kappa receptor subtypes, a series of opioids were tested for their abilities to compete for binding to the two sites. U-69,593 and Cambridge 20 selectively displaced the high-affinity kappa site in both guinea pig and rat tissue, but were inactive at the rat-brain low-affinity site. Other kappa opioid drugs, including U-50,488, ethylketocyclazocine, bremazocine, cyclazocine, and dynormphin (1-17), competed for binding to both sites, but with different rank orders of potency. Quantitative light microscopy in vitro autoradiography was used to visualize the neuroanatomical pattern of kappa receptors in rat and guinea pig brain. The distribution patterns of the two kappa receptor subtypes of rat brain were clearly different. The pattern of rat high-affinity kappa sites paralleled that of guinea pig in the caudate-putamen, mid-brain, central gray substance of cerebrum, and substantia nigra; interspecies differences were apparent throughout most of the rest of the brain. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence for the presence of two kappa receptor subtypes; the U-69,593-sensitive, high-affinity kappa 1 site predominates in guinea pig brain, and the U-69,593-insensitive, low-affinity kappa 2 site predominates in rat brain.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of diazepinomicin/ECO-4601, a Micromonospora secondary metabolite with a novel ring system Abstract: The novel microbial metabolite diazepinomicin/ECO-4601 (1) has a unique tricyclic dibenzodiazepinone core, which was unprecedented among microbial metabolites. Labeled feeding experiments indicated that the carbocyclic ring and the ring nitrogen of tryptophan could be incorporated via degradation to the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, forming ring A and the nonamide nitrogen of 1. Genomic analysis of the biosynthetic locus indicated that the farnesyl side chain was mevalonate derived, the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid moiety could be formed directly from chorismate, and the third ring was constructed via 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid. Successful incorporation of 4,6-D2-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid into ring A of 1 via feeding experiments supports the genetic analysis and the allocation of the locus to this biosynthesis. These studies highlight the enzymatic complexity needed to produce this structural type, which is rare in nature.	1
Title: Analysis of the tetronomycin gene cluster: insights into the biosynthesis of a polyether tetronate antibiotic Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tetronomycin (TMN), a polyether ionophoric antibiotic that contains four different types of ring, including the distinctive tetronic acid moiety, has been cloned from Streptomyces sp. NRRL11266. The sequenced tmn locus (113 234 bp) contains six modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and a further 27 open-reading frames. Based on sequence comparison to related biosynthetic gene clusters, the majority of these can be assigned a plausible role in TMN biosynthesis. The identity of the cluster, and the requirement for a number of individual genes, especially those hypothesised to contribute a glycerate unit to the formation of the tetronate ring, were confirmed by specific gene disruption. However, two large genes that are predicted to encode together a multifunctional PKS of a highly unusual type seem not to be involved in this pathway since deletion of one of them did not alter tetronomycin production. Unlike previously characterised polyether PKS systems, oxidative cyclisation appears to take place on the modular PKS rather than after transfer to a separate carrier protein, while tetronate ring formation and concomitant chain release share common mechanistic features with spirotetronate biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Title: G-quadruplexes as versatile scaffolds for catalysis Abstract: DNA is receiving attention as a useful biomaterial in a broad range of research fields beyond its classical role as a biopolymer for storage and delivery of genetic information. Based on its chemical and thermal stability and easy accessibility, a series of DNA-based hybrid catalysts have been developed and successfully applied to various asymmetric reactions in water. Besides the canonical Watson-Crick duplex, the G-quadruplex structure has been actively exploited as horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzymes via specific complexation with hemin. G-quadruplexes also provide a fascinating scaffold to develop a switchable catalytic system. This review summarizes the beginning, progress, and prospects of the noncanonical DNA-based hybrid catalysts, focusing on the G-quadruplexes as versatile scaffolds for catalysis.	0
Title: Bacterial responses to photo-oxidative stress Abstract: Singlet oxygen is one of several reactive oxygen species that can destroy biomolecules, microorganisms and other cells. Traditionally, the response to singlet oxygen has been termed photo-oxidative stress, as light-dependent processes in photosynthetic cells are major biological sources of singlet oxygen. Recent work identifying a core set of singlet oxygen stress response genes across various bacterial species highlights the importance of this response for survival by both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic cells. Here, we review how bacterial cells mount a transcriptional response to photo-oxidative stress in the context of what is known about bacterial stress responses to other reactive oxygen species.	0
Title: Toblerols: Cyclopropanol-Containing Polyketide Modulators of Antibiosis in Methylobacteria Abstract: Trans-AT polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of biosynthetically versatile modular type I PKSs that generate bioactive polyketides of impressive structural diversity. In this study, we detected, in the genome of several bacteria a cryptic, architecturally unusual trans-AT PKS gene cluster which eluded automated PKS prediction. Genomic mining of one of these strains, the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, revealed unique epoxide- and cyclopropanol-containing polyketides named toblerols. Relative and absolute stereochemistry were determined by NMR experiments, chemical derivatization, and the comparison of CD data between the derivatized natural product and a synthesized model compound. Biosynthetic data suggest that the cyclopropanol moiety is generated by carbon-carbon shortening of a more extended precursor. Surprisingly, a knock-out strain impaired in polyketide production showed strong inhibitory activity against other methylobacteria in contrast to the wild-type producer. The activity was inhibited by complementation with toblerols, thus suggesting that these compounds modulate an as-yet unknown methylobacterial antibiotic.	1
Title: Oryzines A & B, Maleidride Congeners from Aspergillus oryzae and Their Putative Biosynthesis Abstract: Aspergillus oryzae is traditionally used in East Asia for the production of food and brewing. In addition, it has been developed into a suitable host for the heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic genes and gene clusters, enabling the functional analysis of the encoded enzymes. A. oryzae shares a 99.5% genome homology with Aspergillus flavus, but their secondary metabolomes differ significantly and various compounds unique to A. oryzae have been reported. While using A. oryzae as a host for heterologous expression experiments we discovered two new metabolites in extracts of A. oryzae M-2-3 with an unusual maleidride backbone, which were named oryzine A and B. Their structures were elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Their structural relationships with known maleidrides implied involvement of a citrate synthase (CS) and a polyketide (PKS) or fatty acid synthase (FAS) in their biosynthesis. Analysis of the A. oryzae genome revealed a single putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) consistent with the hypothetical biosynthesis of the oryzines. These findings increase knowledge of the chemical potential of A. oryzae and are the first attempt to link a novel product of this fungus with genomic data.	1
Title: Hybrid phase ligation for efficient synthesis of histone proteins Abstract: We introduce a hybrid solid-solution phase ligation approach that combines the efficiency of solid phase ligation with solution phase ligation in the total synthesis of modified histone proteins. A two linker strategy allows analysis throughout work on the solid phase and maximizes yields through cleavage at an external Rink, while an internal HMBA linker allows the native carboxyl terminus for any protein sequence. We demonstrate this approach for two histone proteins: triple-acetylated H4-K5ac, K12ac, K91ac and CENP-A-K124ac.	0
Title: Design and synthesis of chiral and regenerable [2.2]paracyclophane-based NAD(P)H models and application in biomimetic reduction of flavonoids Abstract: With the rapid development of biomimetic asymmetric reduction, the demand for efficient chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models is growing rapidly. Herein, a new class of [2.2]paracyclophane-based chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models (CYNAMs) was designed and synthesized. The first enantioselective biomimetic reduction of tetrasubstituted alkene flavonoids has been successfully realized through enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation, giving chiral flavanones with up to 99% yield and 99% ee.	0
Title: Multiplexed metagenome mining using short DNA sequence tags facilitates targeted discovery of epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors Abstract: In molecular evolutionary analyses, short DNA sequences are used to infer phylogenetic relationships among species. Here we apply this principle to the study of bacterial biosynthesis, enabling the targeted isolation of previously unidentified natural products directly from complex metagenomes. Our approach uses short natural product sequence tags derived from conserved biosynthetic motifs to profile biosynthetic diversity in the environment and then guide the recovery of gene clusters from metagenomic libraries. The methodology is conceptually simple, requires only a small investment in sequencing, and is not computationally demanding. To demonstrate the power of this approach to natural product discovery we conducted a computational search for epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors within 185 globally distributed soil metagenomes. This led to the identification of 99 unique epoxyketone sequence tags, falling into 6 phylogenetically distinct clades. Complete gene clusters associated with nine unique tags were recovered from four saturating soil metagenomic libraries. Using heterologous expression methodologies, seven potent epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors (clarepoxcins A-E and landepoxcins A and B) were produced from these pathways, including compounds with different warhead structures and a naturally occurring halohydrin prodrug. This study provides a template for the targeted expansion of bacterially derived natural products using the global metagenome.	1
Title: The posttranslational modification cascade to the thiopeptide berninamycin generates linear forms and altered macrocyclic scaffolds Abstract: Berninamycin is a member of the pyridine-containing thiopeptide class of antibiotics that undergoes massive posttranslational modifications from ribosomally generated preproteins. Berninamycin has a 2-oxazolyl-3-thiazolyl-pyridine core embedded in a 35-atom macrocycle rather than typical trithiazolylpyridine cores embedded in 26-atom and 29-atom peptide macrocycles. We describe the cloning of an 11-gene berninamycin cluster from Streptomyces bernensis UC 5144, its heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK24 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712, and detection of variant and incompletely processed scaffolds. Posttranslational maturation in S. lividans of both the wild-type berninamycin prepeptide (BerA) and also a T3A mutant generates macrocyclic compounds as well as linear variants, which have failed to form the pyridine and the macrocycle. Expression of the gene cluster in S. venezuelae generates a variant of the 35-atom skeleton of berninamycin, containing a methyloxazoline in the place of a methyloxazole within the macrocyclic framework.	1
Title: Kinetic properties of polymorphic variants and pathogenic mutants in human cystathionine gamma-lyase Abstract: Human cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CGL) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, which functions in the transsulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine. In addition, CGL is one of two major enzymes that can catalyze the formation of hydrogen sulfide, an important gaseous signaling molecule. Recently, several mutations in CGL have been described in patients with cystathioninuria, a rare but poorly understood genetic disease. Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism in CGL, c.1364G>T that converts serine at position 403 to isoleucine, has been linked to elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we have characterized the pathogenic T67I and Q240E missense mutations and the polymorphic variants at amino acid residues 403 using kinetic and spectrophotometric methods. We report that the polymorphism does not influence the cofactor content of the enzyme or its steady-state kinetic properties. In contrast, the T67I mutant exhibits a 3.5-fold decrease in V max compared to that of wild-type CGL, while the Q240E mutant exhibits a 70-fold decrease in V max. The K Ms for cystathionine for both pathogenic mutants are comparable to that of wild type CGL. The PLP content of the T67I and Q240E mutants were about 4-fold and 80-fold lower than that of wild-type enzyme, respectively. Preincubation of the T67I mutant with PLP restored activity to wild-type levels while the same treatment resulted in only partial restoration of activity of the Q240E mutant. These results reveal that both mutations weaken the affinity for PLP and suggest that cystathionuric patients with these mutations should be responsive to pyridoxine therapy.	0
Title: Two related pyrrolidinedione synthetase loci in Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349 produce divergent metabolites Abstract: Equisetin synthetase (EqiS), from the filamentous fungus Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349, was initially assigned on the basis of genetic knockout and expression analysis. Increasing inconsistencies in experimental results led us to question this assignment. Here, we sequenced the F. heterosporum genome, revealing two hybrid polyketide-peptide proteins that were candidates for the equisetin synthetase. The surrounding genes in both clusters had the needed auxiliary genes that might be responsible for producing equisetin. Genetic mutation, biochemical analysis, and recombinant expression in the fungus enabled us to show that the initially assigned EqiS does not produce equisetin but instead produces a related 2,4-pyrrolidinedione, fusaridione A, that was previously unknown. Fusaridione A is methylated in the 3-position of the pyrrolidinedione, which has not otherwise been found in natural products, leading to spontaneous reverse-Dieckmann reactions. A newly described gene cluster, eqx, is responsible for producing equisetin.	1
Title: Conformational Behaviour of Azasugars Based on Mannuronic Acid Abstract: A set of mannuronic-acid-based iminosugars, consisting of the C-5-carboxylic acid, methyl ester and amide analogues of 1deoxymannorjirimicin (DMJ), was synthesised and their pH-dependent conformational behaviour was studied. Under acidic conditions the methyl ester and the carboxylic acid adopted an "inverted" 1 C4 chair conformation as opposed to the "normal" 4 C1 chair at basic pH. This conformational change is explained in terms of the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents and it parallels the behaviour of the mannuronic acid ester oxocarbenium ion. Because of this solution-phase behaviour, the mannuronic acid ester azasugar was examined as an inhibitor for a Caulobacter GH47 mannosidase that hydrolyses its substrates by way of a reaction itinerary that proceeds through a 3 H4 transition state. No binding was observed for the mannuronic acid ester azasugar, but sub-atomic resolution data were obtained for the DMJ⋅CkGH47 complex, showing two conformations-3 S1 and 1 C4 -for the DMJ inhibitor.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the polyene macrolide antibiotic reedsmycins from a marine-derived Streptomyces strain Abstract: Background:                       Polyene antibiotics are important as antifungal medicines albeit with serious side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Reedsmycin (RDM) A (1), produced by marine-derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819, is a non-glycosylated polyene macrolide antibiotic with antifungal activity comparable to that of clinically used nystatin. To elucidate its biosynthetic machinery, herein, the rdm biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and characterized.                  Results:                       The rdm cluster is located within a 104 kb DNA region harboring 21 open reading frames (ORFs), among which 15 ORFs were designated as rdm genes. The assembly line for RDM A is proposed on the basis of module and domain analysis of the polyketide synthetases (PKSs) RdmGHIJ, which catalyze 16 rounds of decarboxylative condensation using malonyl-CoA as the starter unit (loading module), two methylmalonyl-CoA (module 1 and 2), and fourteen malonyl-CoA (module 3-16) as extender units successively. However, the predicted substrate specificity of AT0 in the loading module is methylmalonyl-CoA instead of malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, the rdm cluster contains a five-gene regulation system RdmACDEF, which is different from other reported polyene gene clusters. In vivo experiments demonstrated the XRE family regulator RdmA and the PAS/LuxR family regulator RdmF function in negative and positive manner, respectively. Notably, inactivation of rdmA and overexpression of rdmF led to increased production of RDM A by ~ 2.0-fold and ~ 2.5-fold, reaching yields of 155.3 ± 1.89 and 184.8 ± 9.93 mg/L, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       Biosynthesis of RDM A is accomplished on a linear assembly line catalyzed by Rdm PKSs harboring a unique AT0 under the control of a complex regulatory system. These findings enable generation of new biologically active RDM derivatives at high yield and with improved properties by engineered biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genome Mining of the Lipopeptide Biosynthesis of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 in Combination with Mass Spectrometry: Discovery of the Lipoheptapeptide Paenilipoheptin Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa strains are qualified for agro-biotechnological uses such as plant growth promotion and for biocontrol strategies against deleterious phytopathogenic competitors in the soil depending on their attractive arsenal of bioactive compounds. Moreover, they are potent producers of antibiotics for medical applications. To identify new products of such organisms, genome mining strategies in combination with mass spectrometry are the methods of choice. Herein, we performed such studies with the Paenibacillus strain E681. Bioinformatic evaluation of its genome sequence revealed four gene clusters A-D encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Accordingly, four lipopeptide families were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Clusters A and D codify the well known fusaricidins and polymyxins. A yet-unknown lipoheptapeptide was discovered and structurally characterized by de novo sequencing by using MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF MS. It was designated as paenilipoheptin. From structure predictions we infer that the production of this agent is encoded by gene cluster C. Gene cluster B encodes the synthesis of tridecaptins, a family of open-chain lipotridecapeptides. Strain E681 produces new subspecies of such compounds (tridecaptins E) showing variations both in their fatty-acid part as well as in their peptide part.	1
Title: The Pseudomonas siderophore quinolobactin is synthesized from xanthurenic acid, an intermediate of the kynurenine pathway Abstract: To cope with iron deficiency fluorescent pseudomonads produce pyoverdines which are complex peptidic siderophores that very efficiently scavenge iron. In addition to pyoverdine some species also produce other siderophores. Recently, it was shown that Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400 produces the siderophore quinolobactin, an 8-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-quinoline carboxylic acid (Mossialos, D., Meyer, J.M., Budzikiewicz, H., Wolff, U., Koedam, N., Baysse, C., Anjaiah, V., and Cornelis, P. (2000) Appl Environ Microbiol 66: 487-492). The entire quinolobactin biosynthetic, transport and uptake gene cluster, consisting out of two operons comprising 12 open reading frames, was cloned and sequenced. Based on the genes present and physiological complementation assays a biosynthetic pathway for quinolobactin is proposed. Surprisingly, this pathway turned out to combine genes derived from the eukaryotic tryptophan-xanthurenic acid branch of the kynurenine pathway and from the pathway for the biosynthesis of pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylic acid) from P. stutzeri, PDTC. These results clearly show the involvement of the tryptophan-kynurenine-xanthurenic acid pathway in the synthesis of an authentic quinoline siderophore.	1
Title: Unearthing a sesterterpene biosynthetic repertoire in the Brassicaceae through genome mining reveals convergent evolution Abstract: Sesterterpenoids are a rare terpene class harboring untapped chemodiversity and bioactivities. Their structural diversity originates primarily from the scaffold-generating sesterterpene synthases (STSs). In fungi, all six known STSs are bifunctional, containing C-terminal trans-prenyltransferase (PT) and N-terminal terpene synthase (TPS) domains. In plants, two colocalized PT and TPS gene pairs from Arabidopsis thaliana were recently reported to synthesize sesterterpenes. However, the landscape of PT and TPS genes in plant genomes is unclear. Here, using a customized algorithm for systematically searching plant genomes, we reveal a suite of physically colocalized pairs of PT and TPS genes for the biosynthesis of a large sesterterpene repertoire in the wider Brassicaceae. Transient expression of seven TPSs from A. thaliana, Capsella rubella, and Brassica oleracea in Nicotiana benthamiana yielded fungal-type sesterterpenes with tri-, tetra-, and pentacyclic scaffolds, and notably (-)-ent-quiannulatene, an enantiomer of the fungal metabolite (+)-quiannulatene. Protein and structural modeling analysis identified an amino acid site implicated in structural diversification. Mutation of this site in one STS (AtTPS19) resulted in premature termination of carbocation intermediates and accumulation of bi-, tri-, and tetracyclic sesterterpenes, revealing the cyclization path for the pentacyclic sesterterpene (-)-retigeranin B. These structural and mechanistic insights, together with phylogenetic analysis, suggest convergent evolution of plant and fungal STSs, and also indicate that the colocalized PT-TPS gene pairs in the Brassicaceae may have originated from a common ancestral gene pair present before speciation. Our findings further provide opportunities for rapid discovery and production of sesterterpenes through metabolic and protein engineering.	1
Title: Triterpenes from Pholiota populnea as Cytotoxic Agents and Chemosensitizers to Overcome Multidrug Resistance of Cancer Cells Abstract: The detailed mycochemical analysis of the n-hexane extract of Pholiota populnea led to the isolation of four new lanostane diesters, named pholiols A-D (1-4), together with an acyclic triterpene, (3S,6E,10E,14E,18E,22S)-2,3,22,23-tetrahydroxy-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-6,10,14,18-tetracosatetraene (5), ergosterol (6), and 3β-hydroxyergosta-7,22-diene (7). The isolation was carried out by multistep flash chromatography, and the structures were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR and MS measurements. The isolated metabolites (1-6) were investigated for cytotoxic activity against Colo205 and Colo320 colon adenocarcinoma and nontumoral MRC-5 cell lines. Among the tested compounds, ergosterol (6) showed substantial cytotoxic activity against all cell lines with IC50 values of 4.9 μM (Colo 205), 6.5 μM (Colo 320), and 0.50 μM (MRC) with no tumor cell selectivity. A P-glycoprotein efflux pump modulatory test on resistant Colo320 cells revealed that pholiols A (1) and B (2) and linear triterpene polyol 5 have the capacity to inhibit the efflux-pump overexpressed in the cells. Moreover, the drug interactions of triterpenes with doxorubicin were studied by the checkerboard method on Colo 320 cells. Pholiols B (2) and D (4) interacted in synergistic and acyclic triterpene 5 in a very strong synergistic manner; the combination index (CI) values at 50% of the growth inhibition dose (ED50) were found to be 0.348, 0.660, and 0.082, respectively. Our results indicate that P. populnea is a promising source for finding new triterpenes with significant chemosensitizing activity on cancer cells.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the genes responsible for the production of the cyclic lipopeptide arthrofactin by Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 Abstract: Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 produces an effective biosurfactant named arthrofactin, which is a cyclic lipopeptide synthesized by a mega complex composed of three nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In order to gain insight into the control mechanism of arthrofactin production, a Tn5 mutant library was constructed and screened for arthrofactin-deficient mutants. Along with a number of mutations that occurred in the arthrofactin synthetase operon, three other mutants harbored distinct Tn5 insertions in the genes encoding SyrF-like protein (arfF), heat shock protein (htpG), and (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase (spoT). Epistasis analyses revealed that spoT functions early in the arthrofactin production pathway. We also found that spoT affects MIS38 swarming, biofilm formation, and the cell morphology.	1
Title: Selection of Non- Saccharomyces Wine Yeasts for the Production of Leavened Doughs Abstract: Background:                       Non-conventional yeasts (NCY) (i.e., non-Saccharomyces) may be used as alternative starters to promote biodiversity and quality of fermented foods and beverages (e.g., wine, beer, bakery products).                  Methods:                       A total of 32 wine-associated yeasts (Campania region, Italy) were genetically identified and screened for decarboxylase activity and leavening ability. The best selected strains were used to study the leavening kinetics in model doughs (MDs). A commercial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as the control. The volatile organic profiles of the inoculated MDs were analyzed by solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS).                  Results:                       Most of strains belonged to the NCY species Hanseniaspora uvarum, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia kudriavzevii, Torulaspora delbruekii, and Zygotorulaspora florentina, while a few strains were S. cerevisiae. Most strains of H. uvarum lacked decarboxylase activity and showed a high leaving activity after 24 h of incubation that was comparable to the S. cerevisiae strains. The selected H. uvarum strains generated a different flavor profile of the doughs compared to the S. cerevisiae strains. In particular, NCY reduced the fraction of aldehydes that were potentially involved in oxidative phenomena.                  Conclusions:                       The use of NCY could be advantageous in the bakery industry, as they can provide greater diversity than S. cerevisiae-based products, and may be useful in reducing and avoiding yeast intolerance.	0
Title: Discovery of a novel (+)-γ-lactamase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 6 by rational genome mining Abstract: A novel (+)-γ-lactamase used for the resolution of racemic γ-lactam from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 6 was found as a result of sequence-structure guided genome mining. It consists of 409 amino acids, only 49% of which are identical to the amino acid sequences of the known (+)-γ-lactamase from Sulfolobus solfataricus. This is only the third (+)-γ-lactamase gene to be reported.	0
Title: Thalassosamide, a Siderophore Discovered from the Marine-Derived Bacterium Thalassospira profundimaris Abstract: Here we describe the rapid identification and prioritization of novel active marine natural products using an improved dereplication strategy. During the course of our screening of marine natural product libraries, a new cyclic trihydroxamate compound, thalassosamide, was discovered from the α-proteobacterium Thalassospira profundimaris. Its structure was determined by 2D NMR and MS/MS experiments, and the absolute configuration of the lysine-derived units was established by Marfey's analysis, whereas that of C-9, 9', and 9″ was determined via the circular dichroism data of the [Rh2(OCOCF3)4] complex and DFT NMR calculations. Thalassosamide showed moderate in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	0
Title: Applications of gene replacement technology to Streptomyces clavuligerus strain development for clavulanic acid production Abstract: Cephamycin C production was blocked in wild-type cultures of the clavulanic acid-producing organism Streptomyces clavuligerus by targeted disruption of the gene (lat) encoding lysine epsilon-aminotransferase. Specific production of clavulanic acid increased in the lat mutants derived from the wild-type strain by 2- to 2.5-fold. Similar beneficial effects on clavulanic acid production were noted in previous studies when gene disruption was used to block the production of the non-clavulanic acid clavams produced by S. clavuligerus. Therefore, mutations in lat and in cvm1, a gene involved in clavam production, were introduced into a high-titer industrial strain of S. clavuligerus to create a double mutant with defects in production of both cephamycin C and clavams. Production of both cephamycin C and non-clavulanic acid clavams was eliminated in the double mutant, and clavulanic acid titers increased about 10% relative to those of the parental strain. This represents the first report of the successful use of genetic engineering to eliminate undesirable metabolic pathways in an industrial strain used for the production of an antibiotic important in human medicine.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster from Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The indole-diterpene paxilline is a potent tremorgenic mammalian mycotoxin and a known inhibitor of maxi-K ion channels. The gene cluster responsible for paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli was identified by mapping four large plasmid-induced chromosome deletions. The cluster is predicted to lie within a 50 kb region of chromosome Va and to contain 17 genes, including a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase (paxG), two FAD-dependent monooxygenases (paxM and N), two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (paxP and Q), a dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT) synthase (paxD) and two possible transcription factors (paxR and paxS), which contain a Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding motif. Targeted replacement of paxG confirmed that it is essential for paxilline biosynthesis but dispensable for growth. The GGPP for primary metabolism is predicted to be provided by a second GGPP synthase (ggs1) that was cloned, sequenced and mapped to chromosome IV. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression of paxG, paxM and paxP in submerged liquid cultures of P. paxilli increased dramatically with the onset of paxilline biosynthesis. In contrast, the expression of beta-tubulin (tub2) and ggs1 was not induced. This is the first description of the molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster.	1
Title: A feed-forward signalling circuit controls bacterial virulence through linking cyclic di-GMP and two mechanistically distinct sRNAs, ArcZ and RsmB Abstract: Dickeya dadantii is a plant pathogen that causes soft rot disease on vegetable and potato crops. To successfully cause infection, this pathogen needs to coordinately modulate the expression of genes encoding several virulence determinants, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), type III secretion system (T3SS) and flagellar motility. Here, we uncover a novel feed-forward signalling circuit for controlling virulence. Global RNA chaperone Hfq interacts with an Hfq-dependent sRNA ArcZ and represses the translation of pecT, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. We demonstrate that the ability of ArcZ to be processed to a 50 nt 3'- end fragment is essential for its regulation of pecT. PecT down-regulates PCWDE and the T3SS by repressing the expression of a global post-transcriptional regulator- (RsmA-) associated sRNA encoding gene rsmB. In addition, we show that the protein levels of two cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), GcpA and GcpL, are repressed by Hfq. Further studies show that both DGCs are essential for the Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional regulation on RsmB. Overall, our report provides new insights into the interplays between ubiquitous signalling transduction systems that were most studied independently and sheds light on multitiered regulatory mechanisms for a precise disease regulation in bacteria.	0
Title: Modified 'one amino acid-one codon' engineering of high GC content TaqII-coding gene from thermophilic Thermus aquaticus results in radical expression increase Abstract: Background:                       An industrial approach to protein production demands maximization of cloned gene expression, balanced with the recombinant host's viability. Expression of toxic genes from thermophiles poses particular difficulties due to high GC content, mRNA secondary structures, rare codon usage and impairing the host's coding plasmid replication.TaqII belongs to a family of bifunctional enzymes, which are a fusion of the restriction endonuclease (REase) and methyltransferase (MTase) activities in a single polypeptide. The family contains thermostable REases with distinct specificities: TspGWI, TaqII, Tth111II/TthHB27I, TspDTI and TsoI and a few enzymes found in mesophiles. While not being isoschizomers, the enzymes exhibit amino acid (aa) sequence homologies, having molecular sizes of ~120 kDa share common modular architecture, resemble Type-I enzymes, cleave DNA 11/9 nt from the recognition sites, their activity is affected by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).                  Results:                       We describe the taqIIRM gene design, cloning and expression of the prototype TaqII. The enzyme amount in natural hosts is extremely low. To improve expression of the taqIIRM gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli), we designed and cloned a fully synthetic, low GC content, low mRNA secondary structure taqIIRM, codon-optimized gene under a bacteriophage lambda (λ) PR promoter. Codon usage based on a modified 'one amino acid-one codon' strategy, weighted towards low GC content codons, resulted in approximately 10-fold higher expression of the synthetic gene. 718 codons of total 1105 were changed, comprising 65% of the taqIIRM gene. The reason for we choose a less effective strategy rather than a resulting in high expression yields 'codon randomization' strategy, was intentional, sub-optimal TaqII in vivo production, in order to decrease the high 'toxicity' of the REase-MTase protein.                  Conclusions:                       Recombinant wt and synthetic taqIIRM gene were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The modified 'one amino acid-one codon' method tuned for thermophile-coded genes was applied to obtain overexpression of the 'toxic' taqIIRM gene. The method appears suited for industrial production of thermostable 'toxic' enzymes in E. coli. This novel variant of the method biased toward increasing a gene's AT content may provide economic benefits for industrial applications.	0
Title: Microbial 5'-nucleotidases: their characteristics, roles in cellular metabolism, and possible practical applications Abstract: 5'-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides to their respective nucleosides and phosphate. Most 5'-nucleotidases have broad substrate specificity and are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving phosphorus from not only mononucleotide phosphate molecules but also a variety of other phosphorylated metabolites. 5'-Nucleotidases are widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life and found in different cellular locations. The well-studied vertebrate 5'-nucleotidases play an important role in cellular metabolism. These enzymes are involved in purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways, nucleic acid repair, cell-to-cell communication, signal transduction, control of the ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools, etc. Although the first evidence of microbial 5'-nucleotidases was obtained almost 60 years ago, active studies of genetic control and the functions of microbial 5'-nucleotidases started relatively recently. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about microbial 5'-nucleotidases with a focus on their diversity, cellular localizations, molecular structures, mechanisms of catalysis, physiological roles, and activity regulation and approaches to identify new 5'-nucleotidases. The possible applications of these enzymes in biotechnology are also discussed.Key points• Microbial 5'-nucleotidases differ in molecular structure, hydrolytic mechanism, and cellular localization.• 5'-Nucleotidases play important and multifaceted roles in microbial cells.• Microbial 5'-nucleotidases have wide range of practical applications.	0
Title: Direct interaction of the mouse cytomegalovirus m152/gp40 immunoevasin with RAE-1 isoforms Abstract: Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are ubiquitous species-specific viruses that establish acute, persistent, and latent infections. Both human and mouse CMVs encode proteins that inhibit the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by downregulating cellular ligands for the NK cell activating receptor, NKG2D. The MCMV glycoprotein m152/gp40 downregulates the surface expression of RAE-1 to prevent NK cell control in vivo. So far, it is unclear if there is a direct interaction between m152 and RAE-1 and, if so, if m152 interacts differentially with the five identified RAE-1 isoforms, which are expressed as two groups in MCMV-susceptible or -resistant mouse strains. To address these questions, we expressed and purified the extracellular domains of RAE-1 and m152 and performed size exclusion chromatography binding assays as well as analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize these interactions quantitatively. We further evaluated the role of full-length and naturally glycosylated m152 and RAE-1 in cotransfected HEK293T cells. Our results confirmed that m152 binds RAE-1 directly, relatively tightly (K(d) < 5 microM), and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The binding is quantitatively different depending on particular RAE-1 isoforms, corresponding to the susceptibility to downregulation by m152. A PLWY motif found in RAE-1beta, although contributing to its affinity for m152, does not influence the affinity of RAE-1gamma or RAE-1delta, suggesting that other differences contribute to the RAE-1-m152 interaction. Molecular modeling of the different RAE-1 isoforms suggests a potential site for the m152 interaction.	0
Title: Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) to unlock natural product biosynthetic potential Abstract: Specialized metabolites from bacteria are an important source of inspiration for drug development. The genes required for the biosynthesis of such metabolites in bacteria are usually organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Using modern bioinformatic tools, the wealth of genomic data can be scanned for such BGCs and the expected products can often structurally be predicted in silico. This facilitates the directed discovery of putatively novel bacterial metabolites. However, the production of these molecules often requires genetic manipulation of the BGC for activation or the expression of the pathway in a heterologous host. The latter necessitates the transplantation of the BGC into a suitable expression system. To achieve this goal, powerful cloning strategies based on in vivo homologous recombination have recently been developed. This includes LCHR and LLHR in E. coli as well as TAR cloning in yeast. Here, we present Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) as an efficient complementary BGC capturing strategy that relies on long-amplicon PCR and in vitro DNA assembly. This straightforward approach facilitates full pathway assembly, BGC refactoring and direct transfer into any vector backbone in vitro. The broad applicability and efficiency of DiPaC is demonstrated by the discovery of a new phenazine from Serratia fonticola, the first heterologous production of anabaenopeptins from Nostoc punctiforme and the transfer of the native erythromycin BGC from Saccharopolyspora erythraea into Streptomyces. Due to its simplicity, we envisage DiPaC to become an essential method for BGC cloning and metabolic pathways construction with significant applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and biotechnology.	1
Title: Microbial community composition and diversity in rice straw digestion bioreactors with and without dairy manure Abstract: Anaerobic digestion (AD) uses a range of substrates to generate biogas, including energy crops such as globally abundant rice straw (RS). Unfortunately, RS is high in lignocellulosic material and has high to C:N ratios (~80:1), which makes it (alone) a comparatively poor substrate for AD. Co-digestion with dairy manure (DM) has been promoted as a method for balancing C:N ratios to improve RS AD whilst also treating another farm waste and co-producing a potentially useful fertiliser. However, past co-digestion studies have not directly compared RS AD microbial communities with and without DM additions, which has made it hard to assess all impacts of DM addition to RS AD processes. Here, four RS:DM ratios were contrasted in identical semi-continuous-fed AD bioreactors, and 100% RS was found to produce the highest specific methane yields (112 mL CH4/g VS/day; VS, volatile solids), which is over double yields achieved in the reactor with the highest DM content (30:70 RS:DM by mass; 48 mL CH4/g VS/day). To underpin these data, microbial communities were sequenced and characterised across the four reactors. Dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the 100% RS unit were Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes, whereas the 30:70 RS:DM unit was dominated by Proteobacteria/Spirochaetes, suggesting major microbial community shifts occur with DM additions. However, community richness was lowest with 100% RS (despite higher specific yields), suggesting particular OTUs may be more important to yields than microbial diversity. Further, ambient VFA and VS levels were significantly higher when no DM was added, suggesting DM-amended reactors may cope better with higher organic loading rates (OLR). Results show that RS AD without DM addition is feasible, although co-digestion with DM will probably allow higher OLRs, resulting in great RS throughput in farm AD units.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the salinosporamide A polyketide synthase substrate chloroethylmalonyl-coenzyme A from S-adenosyl-L-methionine Abstract: Polyketides are among the major classes of bioactive natural products used to treat microbial infections, cancer, and other diseases. Here we describe a pathway to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA as a polyketide synthase building block in the biosynthesis of salinosporamide A, a marine microbial metabolite whose chlorine atom is crucial for potent proteasome inhibition and anticancer activity. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is converted to 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-ClDA) in a reaction catalyzed by a SAM-dependent chlorinase as previously reported. By using a combination of gene deletions, biochemical analyses, and chemical complementation experiments with putative intermediates, we now provide evidence that 5'-ClDA is converted to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA in a 7-step route via the penultimate intermediate 4-chlorocrotonyl-CoA. Because halogenation often increases the bioactivity of drugs, the availability of a halogenated polyketide building block may be useful in molecular engineering approaches toward polyketide scaffolds.	1
Title: Light control of cellular processes by using photocaged abscisic acid Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) was chemically modified with a photocaging group to promote photo-induced protein dimerization. This photocontrolled chemically induced dimerization (CID) method based on caged ABA enables dose-dependent light regulation of cellular processes, including transcription, protein translocation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal remodeling, without the need to perform extensive protein engineering. Caged ABA can be easily modified to respond to different wavelengths of light. Consequently, this strategy should be applicable to the design of light-regulated protein dimerization systems and potentially be used orthogonally with other light-controlled CID systems.	0
Title: A gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces resistomycificus; exploring polyketide cyclization beyond linear and angucyclic patterns Abstract: Resistomycin is a pentacyclic polyketide metabolite of Streptomyces resistomycificus that exhibits a variety of pharmacologically relevant properties. While virtually all bacterial aromatic polyketides can be grouped into linear and angular polyphenols, resistomycin has a unique "discoid" ring system. We have successfully identified the entire gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis by heterologously expressing a pooled cosmid library and screening for the fluorescence of the metabolite produced. The rem gene cluster exhibits several unusual features of the type II PKS involved, most remarkably a putative MCAT with highest homology to AT domains from modular PKSs. In addition, we provide the first insight into the molecular basis of a unique mode of cyclization giving rise to a discoid polyketide.	1
Title: Bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters encoding the anti-cancer haterumalide class of molecules: biogenesis of the broad spectrum antifungal and anti-oomycete compound, oocydin A Abstract: Haterumalides are halogenated macrolides with strong antitumor properties, making them attractive targets for chemical synthesis. Unfortunately, current synthetic routes to these molecules are inefficient. The potent haterumalide, oocydin A, was previously identified from two plant-associated bacteria through its high bioactivity against plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. In this study, we describe oocydin A (ooc) biosynthetic gene clusters identified by genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and chemical analysis in four plant-associated enterobacteria of the Serratia and Dickeya genera. Disruption of the ooc gene cluster abolished oocydin A production and bioactivity against fungi and oomycetes. The ooc gene clusters span between 77 and 80 kb and encode five multimodular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase cassette and three flavin-dependent tailoring enzymes. The presence of two free-standing acyltransferase proteins classifies the oocydin A gene cluster within the growing family of trans-AT PKSs. The amino acid sequences and organization of the PKS domains are consistent with the chemical predictions and functional peculiarities associated with trans-acyltransferase PKS. Based on extensive in silico analysis of the gene cluster, we propose a biosynthetic model for the production of oocydin A and, by extension, for other members of the haterumalide family of halogenated macrolides exhibiting anti-cancer, anti-fungal, and other interesting biological properties.	1
Title: Preprosubtilisin Carlsberg processing and secretion is blocked after deletion of amino acids 97-101 in the mature part of the enzyme Abstract: During an investigation into the substrate specificity and processing of subtilisin Carlsberg from Bacillus licheniformis, two major independent findings were made: (i) as has been shown previously, a stretch of five amino acids (residues 97-101 of the mature enzyme) that loops out into the binding cleft is involved in substrate binding by subtilisin Carlsberg. In order to see whether this loop element also determines substrate specificity, the coding region for these five amino acids was deleted from the cloned gene for subtilisin Carlsberg by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly the resulting mutant preproenzyme (P42c, Mr = 42 kDa) was not processed to the mature form (Mr = 30 kDa) and was not released into the medium by a protease-deficient B. subtilis host strain; rather, it accumulated in the cell membrane. This result demonstrates that the integrity of this loop element, which is very distant from the processing cleavage sites in the preproenzyme, is required for secretion of subtilisin Carlsberg. (ii) In culture supernatants from B. subtilis harbouring the cloned wild-type subtilisin Carlsberg gene the transient appearance (at 0-3 h after onset of stationary phase) of a processing intermediate (P38c, Mr = 38 kDa) of this protease could be demonstrated. P38c very probably represents a genuine proform of subtilisin Carlsberg.	0
Title: Efficient synthesis of biazoles by aerobic oxidative homocoupling of azoles catalyzed by a copper(I)/2-pyridonate catalytic system Abstract: A highly efficient and convenient CuCl/2-pyridonate catalytic system for oxidative homocoupling of azoles affording a biazole product has been developed. With this system, a variety of biazoles have been effectively synthesized in good to excellent yields in the presence of a very small amount of copper catalyst (1.0 mol%). It was feasible to employ air as a green oxidant.	0
Title: Cell-specific RNA aptamer against human CCR5 specifically targets HIV-1 susceptible cells and inhibits HIV-1 infectivity Abstract: The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages that serves as a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. Loss of CCR5 is associated with resistance to HIV-1. Here, we combine the live-cell-based SELEX with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate CCR5 RNA aptamers capable of specifically targeting HIV-1 susceptible cells (as small interfering RNA [siRNA] delivery agent) and inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity (as antiviral agent) via block of the CCR5 required for HIV-1 to enter cells. One of the best candidates, G-3, efficiently bound and was internalized into human CCR5-expressing cells. The G-3 specifically neutralized R5 virus infection in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in vivo generated human CD4(+) T cells with a nanomolar inhibitory concentration 50%. G-3 was also capable of transferring functional siRNAs to CCR5-expressing cells. Collectively, the cell-specific, internalizing, CCR5-targeted aptamers and aptamer-siRNA conjugates offer promise for overcoming some of the current challenges of drug resistance in HIV-1 by providing cell-type- or tissue-specific delivery of various therapeutic moieties.	0
Title: Suppressive effect of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3) on D-galactosamine-induced IL-18 expression and hepatitis in rats Abstract: We investigated in this study the effect of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3) and its fractions on D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced IL-18 expression and hepatitis in rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with MGN-3 or fractions of the MGN-3 hydrolysate, or with saline 1 h before administering D-GalN (400 mg/kg B.W.). The serum transaminase activities, IL-18 mRNA expression level in the liver and IL-18 concentration in the serum were determined 24 h after injecting D-GalN. Both the oral and intraperitoneal administration of MGN-3 (20 mg/kg B.W.) alleviated D-GalN-induced hepatic injury under these experimental conditions. The low-molecular-weight fraction (LMW) of MGN-3 showed the strongest protective effect on D-GalN-induced liver injury, its main sugar component being glucose. Moreover, the D-GalN-induced IL-18 expression was significantly reduced by treating with MGN-3 and LMW. The results suggest that MGN-3 and LMW could provide significant protection against D-GalN liver injury, and that IL-18 might be involved in their protective influence.	0
Title: Fungal Highly Reducing Polyketide Synthases Biosynthesize Salicylaldehydes That Are Precursors to Epoxycyclohexenol Natural Products Abstract: Fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases (HRPKSs) are highly programmed multidomain enzymes that synthesize reduced polyketide structures. Recent reports indicated salicylaldehydes are synthesized by HRPKS biosynthetic gene clusters, which are unexpected based on known enzymology of HRPKSs. Using genome mining of a Trichoderma virens HRPKS gene cluster that encodes a number of redox enzymes, we uncover the strategy used by HRPKS pathways in the biosynthesis of aromatic products such as salicylaldehyde 4, which can be oxidatively modified to the epoxycyclohexanol natural product trichoxide 1. We show selective β-hydroxyl groups in the linear HRPKS product are individually reoxidized to β-ketones by short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, which enabled intramolecular aldol condensation and aromatization. Our work expands the chemical space of natural products accessible through HRPKS pathways.	1
Title: Nonoptimal codon usage influences protein structure in intrinsically disordered regions Abstract: Synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies in most genomes. Codon usage has been proposed to play a role in regulating translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding. The relationship between codon usage and protein structures and the in vivo role of codon usage in eukaryotic protein folding is not clear. Here, we show that there is a strong codon usage bias in the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Importantly, we found genome-wide correlations between codon choices and predicted protein secondary structures: Nonoptimal codons are preferentially used in intrinsically disordered regions, and more optimal codons are used in structured domains. The functional importance of such correlations in vivo was confirmed by structure-based codon manipulation of codons in the Neurospora circadian clock gene frequency (frq). The codon optimization of the predicted disordered, but not well-structured regions of FRQ impairs clock function and altered FRQ structures. Furthermore, the correlations between codon usage and protein disorder tendency are conserved in other eukaryotes. Together, these results suggest that codon choices and protein structures co-evolve to ensure proper protein folding in eukaryotic organisms.	0
Title: Alloying at a Subnanoscale Maximizes the Synergistic Effect on the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Abstract: Bonding dissimilar elements to provide synergistic effects is an effective way to improve the performance of metal catalysts. However, as the properties become more dissimilar, achieving synergistic effects effectively becomes more difficult due to phase separation. Here we describe a comprehensive study on how subnanoscale alloying is always effective for inter-elemental synergy. Thirty-six combinations of both bimetallic subnanoparticles (SNPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) were studied systematically using atomic-resolution imaging and catalyst benchmarking based on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results revealed that SNPs always produce greater synergistic effects than NPs, the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr. The atomic-scale miscibility and the associated modulation of electronic states at the subnanoscale were much different from those at the nanoscale, which was observed by annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.	0
Title: Imidazole Ketone Erastin Induces Ferroptosis and Slows Tumor Growth in a Mouse Lymphoma Model Abstract: Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that can be induced by inhibition of the cystine-glutamate antiporter, system xc-. Among the existing system xc- inhibitors, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE) is a potent, metabolically stable inhibitor of system xc- and inducer of ferroptosis potentially suitable for in vivo applications. We investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of IKE in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenograft model and demonstrated that IKE exerted an antitumor effect by inhibiting system xc-, leading to glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, and the induction of ferroptosis biomarkers both in vitro and in vivo. Using untargeted lipidomics and qPCR, we identified distinct features of lipid metabolism in IKE-induced ferroptosis. In addition, biodegradable polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were employed to aid in IKE delivery and exhibited reduced toxicity compared with free IKE in a DLBCL xenograft model.	0
Title: Specific Identification of Glycoproteins Bearing the Tn Antigen in Human Cells Abstract: Glycoproteins contain a wealth of valuable information regarding the development and disease status of cells. In cancer cells, some glycans (such as the Tn antigen) are highly up-regulated, but this remains largely unknown for glycoproteins with a particular glycan. Herein, an innovative method combining enzymatic and chemical reactions was first designed to enrich glycoproteins with the Tn antigen. Using synthetic glycopeptides with O-GalNAc (the Tn antigen) or O-GlcNAc, we demonstrated that the method is selective for glycopeptides with O-GalNAc and can distinguish between these two modifications. The diagnostic ions from the tagged O-GalNAc further confirmed the effectiveness of the method and confidence in the identification of glycopeptides with the Tn antigen by mass spectrometry. Using this method, we identified 96 glycoproteins with the Tn antigen in Jurkat cells. The method can be extensively applied in biological and biomedical research.	0
Title: A structure-guided approach to creating covalent FGFR inhibitors Abstract: The fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4) represent promising therapeutic targets in a number of cancers. We have developed the first potent and selective irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, which we named FIIN-1 that forms a covalent bond with cysteine 486 located in the P loop of the FGFR1 ATP binding site. We demonstrated that the inhibitor potently inhibits Tel-FGFR1-transformed Ba/F3 cells (EC(50) = 14 nM) as well as numerous FGFR-dependent cancer cell lines. A biotin-derivatized version of the inhibitor, FIIN-1-biotin, was shown to covalently label FGFR1 at Cys486. FIIN-1 is a useful probe of FGFR-dependent cellular phenomena and may provide a starting point of the development of therapeutically relevant irreversible inhibitors of wild-type and drug-resistant forms of FGFR kinases.	0
Title: Horizontal gene cluster transfer increased hallucinogenic mushroom diversity Abstract: Secondary metabolites are a heterogeneous class of chemicals that often mediate interactions between species. The tryptophan-derived secondary metabolite, psilocin, is a serotonin receptor agonist that induces altered states of consciousness. A phylogenetically disjunct group of mushroom-forming fungi in the Agaricales produce the psilocin prodrug, psilocybin. Spotty phylogenetic distributions of fungal compounds are sometimes explained by horizontal transfer of metabolic gene clusters among unrelated fungi with overlapping niches. We report the discovery of a psilocybin gene cluster in three hallucinogenic mushroom genomes, and evidence for its horizontal transfer between fungal lineages. Patterns of gene distribution and transmission suggest that synthesis of psilocybin may have provided a fitness advantage in the dung and late wood-decay fungal niches, which may serve as reservoirs of fungal indole-based metabolites that alter behavior of mycophagous and wood-eating invertebrates. These hallucinogenic mushroom genomes will serve as models in neurochemical ecology, advancing the (bio)prospecting and synthetic biology of novel neuropharmaceuticals.	1
Title: Conversion of viridicatic acid to crustosic acid by cytochrome P450 enzyme-catalysed hydroxylation and spontaneous cyclisation Abstract: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are considered nature's most versatile catalysts and play a crucial role in regio- and stereoselective oxidation reactions on a broad range of organic molecules. The oxyfunctionalisation of unactivated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds, in particular, represents a key step in the biosynthesis of many natural products as it provides substrates with increased reactivity for tailoring reactions. In this study, we investigated the function of the P450 enzyme TraB in the terrestric acid biosynthetic pathway. We firstly deleted the gene coding for the DNA repair subunit protein Ku70 by using split marker-based deletion plasmids for convenient recycling of the selection marker to improve gene targeting in Penicillium crustosum. Hereby, we reduced ectopic DNA integration and facilitated genetic manipulation in P. crustosum. Afterward, gene deletion in the Δku70 mutant of the native producer P. crustosum and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans with precursor feeding proved the involvement of TraB in the formation of crustosic acid by catalysing the essential hydroxylation reaction of viridicatic acid. KEY POINTS: •Deletion of Ku70 by using split marker approach for selection marker recycling. •Functional identification of the cytochrome P450 enzyme TraB. •Fulfilling the reaction steps in the terrestric acid biosynthesis.	0
Title: Identification of the actinorhodin monomer and its related compound from a deletion mutant of the actVA-ORF4 gene of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: An oxygenated derivative of dihydrokalafungin (DHK) was isolated from a deletion mutant of the actVA-ORF4 gene involved in the biosynthesis of a dimeric benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) antibiotic, actinorhodin (ACT), in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Spectroscopic analysis elucidated its structure as 8-hydroxy-DHK, corresponding to the monomeric unit of ACT. Further metabolite analysis identified its related compound, clearly derived from the reduction of 8-hydroxy-DHK. The structures of these metabolites indicate the essential role of ActVA-ORF4 in ACT biosynthesis, specifically in dimerization of a BIQ intermediate via C-C bond formation.	1
Title: Elucidation of sevadicin, a novel non-ribosomal peptide secondary metabolite produced by the honey bee pathogenic bacterium Paenibacillus larvae Abstract: American foulbrood (AFB) caused by the bee pathogenic bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is the most devastating bacterial disease of honey bees worldwide. From AFB-dead larvae, pure cultures of P. larvae can normally be cultivated indicating that P. larvae is able to defend its niche against all other bacteria present. Recently, comparative genome analysis within the species P. larvae suggested the presence of gene clusters coding for multi-enzyme complexes, such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The products of these enzyme complexes are known to have a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial activities. We here present our results on antibacterial activity exhibited by vegetative P. larvae and the identification and analysis of a novel antibacterially active P. larvae tripeptide (called sevadicin; Sev) produced by a NRPS encoded by a gene cluster found in the genome of P. larvae. Identification of Sev was ultimately achieved by comparing the secretome of wild-type P. larvae with knockout mutants of P. larvae lacking production of Sev. Subsequent mass spectrometric studies, enantiomer analytics and chemical synthesis revealed the sequence and configuration of the tripeptide, D-Phe-D-ALa-Trp, which was shown to have antibacterial activity. The relevance of our findings is discussed in respect to host-pathogen interactions.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the siderophore rhodochelin requires the coordinated expression of three independent gene clusters in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 Abstract: In this work we report the isolation, structural characterization, and the genetic analysis of the biosynthetic origin of rhodochelin, a unique mixed-type catecholate-hydroxamate siderophore isolated from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. Rhodochelin structural elucidation was accomplished via MS(n)- and NMR-analysis and revealed the tetrapeptide to contain an unusual ester bond between an L-δ-N-formyl-δ-N-hydroxyornithine moiety and the side chain of a threonine residue. Gene deletions within three putative biosynthetic gene clusters abolish rhodochelin production, proving that the ORFs responsible for rhodochelin biosynthesis are located in different chromosomal loci. These results demonstrate the efficient cross-talk between distantly located secondary metabolite gene clusters and outline new insights into the comprehension of natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: The evolution of three siderophore biosynthetic clusters in environmental and host-associating strains of Pantoea Abstract: For many pathogenic members of the Enterobacterales, siderophores play an important role in virulence, yet the siderophores of the host-associating members of the genus Pantoea remain unexplored. We conducted a genome-wide survey of environmental and host-associating strains of Pantoea to identify known and candidate siderophore biosynthetic clusters. Our analysis identified three clusters homologous to those of enterobactin, desferrioxamine, and aerobactin that were prevalent among Pantoea species. Using both phylogenetic and comparative genomic approaches, we demonstrate that the enterobactin-like cluster was present in the common ancestor of all Pantoea, with evidence for three independent losses of the cluster in P. eucalypti, P. eucrina, and the P. ananatis-P. stewartii lineage. The desferrioxamine biosynthetic cluster, previously described and characterized in Pantoea, was horizontally acquired from its close relative Erwinia, with phylogenetic evidence that these transfer events were ancient and occurred between ancestral lineages. The aerobactin cluster was identified in three host-associating species groups, P. septica, P. ananatis, and P. stewartii, with strong evidence for horizontal acquisition from human-pathogenic members of the Enterobacterales. Our work identifies and describes the key siderophore clusters in Pantoea, shows three distinct evolutionary processes driving their diversification, and provides a foundation for exploring the roles that these siderophores may play in human opportunistic infections.	1
Title: Discovery of the Tyrobetaine Natural Products and Their Biosynthetic Gene Cluster via Metabologenomics Abstract: Natural products (NPs) are a rich source of medicines, but traditional discovery methods are often unsuccessful due to high rates of rediscovery. Genetic approaches for NP discovery are promising, but progress has been slow due to the difficulty of identifying unique biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and poor gene expression. We previously developed the metabologenomics method, which combines genomic and metabolomic data to discover new NPs and their BGCs. Here, we utilize metabologenomics in combination with molecular networking to discover a novel class of NPs, the tyrobetaines: nonribosomal peptides with an unusual trimethylammonium tyrosine residue. The BGC for this unusual class of compounds was identified using metabologenomics and computational structure prediction data. Heterologous expression confirmed the BGC and suggests an unusual mechanism for trimethylammonium formation. Overall, the discovery of the tyrobetaines shows the great potential of metabologenomics combined with molecular networking and computational structure prediction for identifying interesting biosynthetic reactions and novel NPs.	1
Title: Transformation of Metalaxyl by the Fungus Syncephalastrum racemosum Abstract: The fungus Syncephalastrum racemosum (Cohn) Schroeter was found to transform the fungicide metalaxyl [N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methyl ester] in pure culture. After 21 days of incubation in a basal medium amended with 5 mug of metalaxyl per ml, more than 80% of the compound was transformed by the fungus. The transformation rates decreased as the concentrations of metalaxyl increased from 5 to 100 mug/ml. No transformation was observed when the concentration of metalaxyl was higher than 200 mug/ml. Two isomeric metabolites and a mixture of two other isomeric metabolites were isolated from the organic extract of the growth medium and identified as N-(2-methyl-6-hydroxymethylphenyl)-N- and N-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methyl ester and N-(3-hydroxy- and N-(5-hydroxy-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methyl ester according to their mass-spectral and nuclear magnetic resonance-spectral characteristics. Benzylic hydroxylation of the methyl side chains and/or aromatic hydroxylation appeared to be the major reactions involved in the metabolism of metalaxyl.	0
Title: Engineered urdamycin glycosyltransferases are broadened and altered in substrate specificity Abstract: Combinatorial biosynthesis is a promising technique used to provide modified natural products for drug development. To enzymatically bridge the gap between what is possible in aglycon biosynthesis and sugar derivatization, glycosyltransferases are the tools of choice. To overcome limitations set by their intrinsic specificities, we have genetically engineered the protein regions governing nucleotide sugar and acceptor substrate specificities of two urdamycin deoxysugar glycosyltransferases, UrdGT1b and UrdGT1c. Targeted amino acid exchanges reduced the number of amino acids potentially dictating substrate specificity to ten. Subsequently, a gene library was created such that only codons of these ten amino acids from both parental genes were independently combined. Library members displayed parental and/or a novel specificity, with the latter being responsible for the biosynthesis of urdamycin P that carries a branched saccharide side chain hitherto unknown for urdamycins.	1
Title: Variation suggestive of horizontal gene transfer at a lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthetic locus in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the bacterial leaf blight pathogen of rice Abstract: Background:                       In animal pathogenic bacteria, horizontal gene transfer events (HGT) have been frequently observed in genomic regions that encode functions involved in biosynthesis of the outer membrane located lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As a result, different strains of the same pathogen can have substantially different lps biosynthetic gene clusters. Since LPS is highly antigenic, the variation at lps loci is attributed to be of advantage in evading the host immune system. Although LPS has been suggested as a potentiator of plant defense responses, interstrain variation at lps biosynthetic gene clusters has not been reported for any plant pathogenic bacterium.                  Results:                       We report here the complete sequence of a 12.2 kb virulence locus of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encoding six genes whose products are homologous to functions involved in LPS biosynthesis and transport. All six open reading frames (ORFs) have atypical G+C content and altered codon usage, which are the hallmarks of genomic islands that are acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The lps locus is flanked by highly conserved genes, metB and etfA, respectively encoding cystathionine gamma lyase and electron transport flavoprotein. Interestingly, two different sets of lps genes are present at this locus in the plant pathogens, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac). The genomic island is present in a number of Xoo strains from India and other Asian countries but is not present in two strains, one from India (BXO8) and another from Nepal (Nepal624) as well as the closely related rice pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoor). TAIL-PCR analysis indicates that sequences related to Xac are present at the lps locus in both BXO8 and Nepal624. The Xoor strain has a hybrid lps gene cluster, with sequences at the metB and etfA ends, being most closely related to sequences from Xac and the tomato pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato respectively.                  Conclusion:                       This is the first report of hypervariation at an lps locus between different strains of a plant pathogenic bacterium. Our results indicate that multiple HGT events have occurred at this locus in the xanthomonad group of plant pathogens.	1
Title: Squaramide-catalyzed enantioselective Michael addition of diphenyl phosphite to nitroalkenes Abstract: Simple catalyst, high enantioselectivities. An easily prepared squaramide catalyst promotes highly enantioselective Michael addition reactions of diphenyl phosphite to a broad range of nitroalkenes, including those bearing acidic protons or sterically demanding aliphatic substituents. The methodology provides facile access to chiral β-nitro phosphonates, which are precursors to biologically active β-amino phosphonic acids.	0
Title: Biomimetic synthesis of the tetracyclic core of berkelic acid Abstract: Acid-catalyzed condensation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid 3 with ketal aldehyde 14 in methanol at 25 degrees C, followed by CH2N2 esterification, gave a 4:1:4:1 mixture of diastereomers 15b-18b in 60% yield. Equilibration of this mixture with TFA in CDCl3 provided tetracycle 15b (83% yield) with the complete skeleton of berkelic acid. A similar condensation at 0 degrees C afforded 15b-18b and a reduction product 19b, which was probably formed by a 1,5-hydride shift.	0
Title: Reconstitution of diphthine synthase activity in vitro Abstract: Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin, is a unique posttranslational modification on eukaryotic and archaeal translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). Although diphthamide modification was discovered three decades ago, in vitro reconstitution of diphthamide biosynthesis using purified proteins has not been reported. The proposed biosynthesis pathway of diphthamide involves three steps. Our laboratory has recently showed that in Pyrococcus horikoshii (P. horikoshii), the first step uses a [4Fe-4S] enzyme PhDph2 to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to form a C−C bond. The second step is the trimethylation of an amino group to form the diphthine intermediate. This step is catalyzed by a methyltransferase called diphthine synthase or Dph5. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of the second step using P. horikoshii Dph5 (PhDph5). Our results demonstrate that PhDph5 is sufficient to catalyze the mono-, di-, and trimethylation of P. horikoshii EF2 (PhEF2). Interestingly, the trimethylated product from the PhDph5-catalyzed reaction can easily eliminate the trimethylamino group. The potential implication of this unexpected finding on the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway is discussed.	0
Title: Role for vitamin B(12) in light induction of gene expression in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: A light-inducible promoter (P(B)) drives the carB operon (carotenoid genes) of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. A gene encoding a regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis was identified by studying mutant strains carrying a transcriptional fusion to P(B) and deletions in three candidate genes. Our results prove that the identified gene, named carA, codes for a repressor of the P(B) promoter in the dark. They also show that the carA gene product does not participate in the light activation of two other promoters connected with carotenoid synthesis or its regulation in M. xanthus. CarA is a novel protein consisting of a DNA-binding domain of the family of MerR helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulators, directly joined to a cobalamin-binding domain. In support of this, we report here that the presence of vitamin B(12) or some other cobalamin derivatives is absolutely required for activation of the P(B) promoter by light.	1
Title: Evolution of combinatorial diversity in trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase assembly lines across bacteria Abstract: Trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are bacterial multimodular enzymes that biosynthesize diverse pharmaceutically and ecologically important polyketides. A notable feature of this natural product class is the existence of chemical hybrids that combine core moieties from different polyketide structures. To understand the prevalence, biosynthetic basis, and evolutionary patterns of this phenomenon, we developed transPACT, a phylogenomic algorithm to automate global classification of trans-AT PKS modules across bacteria and applied it to 1782 trans-AT PKS gene clusters. These analyses reveal widespread exchange patterns suggesting recombination of extended PKS module series as an important mechanism for metabolic diversification in this natural product class. For three plant-associated bacteria, i.e., the root colonizer Gynuella sunshinyii and the pathogens Xanthomonas cannabis and Pseudomonas syringae, we demonstrate the utility of this computational approach for uncovering cryptic relationships between polyketides, accelerating polyketide mining from fragmented genome sequences, and discovering polyketide variants with conserved moieties of interest. As natural combinatorial hybrids are rare among the more commonly studied cis-AT PKSs, this study paves the way towards evolutionarily informed, rational PKS engineering to produce chimeric trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides.	1
Title: Design of high-activity mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase against (-)-cocaine: structural and energetic factors affecting the catalytic efficiency Abstract: The present study was aimed to explore the correlation between the protein structure and catalytic efficiency of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mutants against (-)-cocaine by modeling the rate-determining transition state (TS1), i.e., the transition state for the first step of chemical reaction process, of (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by various mutants of human BChE in comparison with the wild type. Molecular modeling of the TS1 structures revealed that mutations on certain nonactive site residues can indirectly affect the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (-)-cocaine through enhancing or weakening the overall hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of (-)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. Computational insights and predictions were supported by the catalytic activity data obtained from wet experimental tests on the mutants of human BChE, including five new mutants reported for the first time. The BChE mutants with at least ∼1000-fold improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine compared to the wild-type BChE are all associated with the TS1 structures having stronger overall hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of (-)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. The combined computational and experimental data demonstrate a reasonable correlation relationship between the hydrogen-bonding distances in the TS1 structure and the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (-)-cocaine.	0
Title: Bypassing AMPK phosphorylation Abstract: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a signaling hub to balance energy supply with demand. Phosphorylation of activation loop Thr172 has been considered as an essential step in AMPK activation. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Scott and colleagues show that the small molecule direct AMPK activator, A-769662, bypasses this phosphorylation event and acts synergistically with AMP on naive AMPK.	0
Title: Comparative metabolomics and structural characterizations illuminate colibactin pathway-dependent small molecules Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for synthesis of the unknown molecule "colibactin" has been identified in mutualistic and pathogenic Escherichia coli. The pathway endows its producer with a long-term persistence phenotype in the human bowel, a probiotic activity used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and a carcinogenic activity under host inflammatory conditions. To date, functional small molecules from this pathway have not been reported. Here we implemented a comparative metabolomics and targeted structural network analyses approach to identify a catalog of small molecules dependent on the colibactin pathway from the meningitis isolate E. coli IHE3034 and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The structures of 10 pathway-dependent small molecules are proposed based on structural characterizations and network relationships. The network will provide a roadmap for the structural and functional elucidation of a variety of other small molecules encoded by the pathway. From the characterized small molecule set, in vitro bacterial growth inhibitory and mammalian CNS receptor antagonist activities are presented.	1
Title: The PhoB regulatory system modulates biofilm formation and stress response in El Tor biotype Vibrio cholerae Abstract: The PhoBR regulatory system is required for the induction of multiple genes under conditions of phosphate limitation. Here, we examine the role of PhoB in biofilm formation and environmental stress response in Vibrio cholerae of the El Tor biotype. Deletion of phoB or hapR enhanced biofilm formation in a phosphate-limited medium. Planktonic and redispersed biofilm cells of the DeltaphoB mutant did not differ from wild type for the expression of HapR, suggesting that PhoB negatively affects biofilm formation through an HapR-independent pathway. The DeltaphoB mutant exhibited elevated expression of exopolysaccharide genes vpsA and vpsL compared with the wild type. Deletion of hapR enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsT, but had no effect on the expression of vpsR. In contrast, deletion of phoB enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsR, but had no effect on the expression of hapR and vpsT. The DeltaphoB mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild type and with an isogenic DeltarpoS mutant. Conversely, the DeltaphoB mutant was more resistant to acidic conditions and high osmolarity compared with the wild type and with an isogenic DeltarpoS mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that phosphate limitation induces V. cholerae to adopt a free-swimming life style in which PhoB modulates environmental stress response in a manner that differs from the general stress response regulator RpoS.	0
Title: Wild-type Escherichia coli producing microcins B17, D93, J25, and L; cloning of genes for microcin L production and immunity Abstract: For the first time, an Escherichia coli strain producing four microcins (Mcc), B17, D93, J25, and L, and showing immunity to Mcc V was isolated and characterized. Each of the gene clusters encoding the production of Mcc B17, D93, and L was cloned separately. The gene cluster for Mcc L was cloned within a 13.5-kb HindIII-SalI fragment, which includes the Mcc V immunity gene, cvi.	1
Title: A molecular platinum cluster junction: a single-molecule switch Abstract: We present a theoretical study of electron transport through single-molecule junctions incorporating a Pt(6) metal cluster bound within an organic framework. The insertion of this molecule between a pair of electrodes leads to a fully atomically engineered nanometallic device with high conductance at the Fermi level and two sequential high on/off switching states. The origin of this property can be traced back to the existence of a degenerate HOMO consisting of two asymmetric orbitals with energies close to the Fermi level of the metal leads. The degeneracy is broken when the molecule is contacted to the leads, giving rise to two resonances that become pinned to the Fermi level and display destructive interference.	0
Title: The dishwasher rubber seal acts as a reservoir of bacteria in the home environment Abstract: Background:                       In modern lifestyles, people make their everyday tasks easier by using household appliances, for example dishwashers. Previous studies showed massive contamination of dishwasher rubber seals with fungi, thus bacterial community, able to survive under harsh conditions, remain undetermined.                  Methods:                       Bacteria that colonise the extreme environment of household dishwasher rubber seals were investigated using cultivation-dependent and metagenomic approaches. All bacterial isolates were tested for resistance to seven selected antibiotics. Same time bacterial diversity of tap water, connected to the dishwashers was investigated.                  Results:                       All 30 dishwashers investigated were colonised by various bacteria. Cultivation approaches resulted in 632 bacterial isolates in total, belonging to four phyla, eight classes, 40 genera and 74 species. The majority were Gram-positive, as solely Firmicutes (dominated by the Bacillus cereus group) and Actinobacteria. Gammaproteobacteria were primarily represented by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Metagenomic assessment of the bacterial biodiversity of the dishwasher rubber seals confirmed the predominance of Gram-positive bacteria, as primarily Actinobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, and by pathogenic species such as Escherichia sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter sp.. Metagenomic assessment of bacterial biodiversity in the tap water connected to dishwashers revealed predominance of Gram-negative bacteria, in particular Proteobacteria, mainly represented by Tepidimonas sp.. Actinobacteria showed low numbers while no Firmicutes were detected in the tap water. The bacterial diversity of tap water was also lower, 23 genera compared to 39 genera on dishwasher rubber seals. Only 13 out of 49 genera identified by metagenomics approach was found in both environments, of those Gordonia was enriched while half of 13 genera were depleted in dishwashers compared to tap water.                  Conclusions:                       These data indicate that colonisation of dishwasher rubber seals probably depends primarily on the bacterial input from the dirty vessels, and much less on the bacteria in the tap water. Based on the antibiotic resistance data, the dishwasher rubber seal bacterial isolates do not represent a serious threat for the spread of antibiotic resistance into the household environment. Nevertheless dishwashers cannot be ignored as potential sources of human infections, in particular for immuno-compromised individuals.	0
Title: Identification and Characterization of Mycemycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Streptomyces olivaceus FXJ8.012 and Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.235 Abstract: Mycemycins A-E are new members of the dibenzoxazepinone (DBP) family, derived from the gntR gene-disrupted deep sea strain Streptomyces olivaceus FXJ8.012Δ1741 and the soil strain Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.235. In this paper, we report the identification of the gene clusters and pathways' inference for mycemycin biosynthesis in the two strains. Bioinformatics analyses of the genome sequences of S. olivaceus FXJ8.012Δ1741 and S. sp. FXJ1.235 predicted two divergent mycemycin gene clusters, mym and mye, respectively. Heterologous expression of the key enzyme genes of mym and genetic manipulation of mye as well as a feeding study in S. sp. FXJ1.235 confirmed the gene clusters and led to the proposed biosynthetic pathways for mycemycins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on DBP biosynthetic gene clusters and pathways.	1
Title: Palmitoylome profiling reveals S-palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3 Abstract: Identification of immune effectors and the post-translational modifications that control their activity is essential for dissecting mechanisms of immunity. Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is post-translationally regulated by S-palmitoylation. Large-scale profiling of palmitoylated proteins in a dendritic cell line using a chemical reporter strategy revealed over 150 lipid-modified proteins with diverse cellular functions, including innate immunity. We discovered that S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 on membrane-proximal cysteines controls its clustering in membrane compartments and its antiviral activity against influenza virus. The sites of S-palmitoylation are highly conserved among the IFITM family of proteins in vertebrates, which suggests that S-palmitoylation of these immune effectors may be an ancient post-translational modification that is crucial for host resistance to viral infections. The S-palmitoylation and clustering of IFITM3 will be important for elucidating its mechanism of action and for the design of antiviral therapeutics.	0
Title: Formation and attachment of the deoxysugar moiety and assembly of the gene cluster for caprazamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Caprazamycins are antimycobacterials produced by Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2. Previously, cosmid cpzLK09 was shown to direct the biosynthesis of caprazamycin aglycones, but not of intact caprazamycins. Sequence analysis of cpzLK09 identified 23 genes involved in the formation of the caprazamycin aglycones and the transfer and methylation of the sugar moiety, together with genes for resistance, transport, and regulation. In this study, coexpression of cpzLK09 in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 with pRHAM, containing all the required genes for dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthesis, led to the production of intact caprazamycins. In vitro studies showed that Cpz31 is responsible for the attachment of the l-rhamnose to the caprazamycin aglycones, generating a rare acylated deoxyhexose. An l-rhamnose gene cluster was identified elsewhere on the Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2 genome, and its involvement in caprazamycin formation was demonstrated by insertional inactivation of cpzDIII. The l-rhamnose subcluster was assembled with cpzLK09 using Red/ET-mediated recombination. Heterologous expression of the resulting cosmid, cpzEW07, led to the production of caprazamycins, demonstrating that both sets of genes are required for caprazamycin biosynthesis. Knockouts of cpzDI and cpzDV in the l-rhamnose subcluster confirmed that four genes, cpzDII, cpzDIII, cpzDIV, and cpzDVI, are sufficient for the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moiety. The presented recombineering strategy may provide a useful tool for the assembly of biosynthetic building blocks for heterologous production of microbial compounds.	1
Title: A Dinuclear Mechanism Implicated in Controlled Carbene Polymerization Abstract: Carbene polymerization provides polyolefins that cannot be readily prepared from olefin monomers; however, controlled and living carbene polymerization has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a new class of initiators, (π-allyl)palladium carboxylate dimers, which polymerize ethyl diazoacetate, a carbene precursor in a controlled and quasi-living manner, with nearly quantitative yields, degrees of polymerization >100, molecular weight dispersities 1.2-1.4, and well-defined, diversifiable chain ends. This method also provides block copolycarbenes that undergo microphase segregation. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analysis supports a new dinuclear mechanism for this process.	0
Title: Identification of the C-Glycoside Synthases during Biosynthesis of the Pyrazole-C-Nucleosides Formycin and Pyrazofurin Abstract: C-Nucleosides are characterized by a C-C rather than a C-N linkage between the heterocyclic base and the ribofuranose ring. While the biosynthesis of pseudouridine-C-nucleosides has been studied, less is known about the pyrazole-C-nucleosides such as the formycins and pyrazofurin. Herein, genome screening of Streptomyces candidus NRRL 3601 led to the discovery of the pyrazofurin biosynthetic gene cluster pyf. In vitro characterization of gene product PyfQ demonstrated that it is able to catalyze formation of the C-glycoside carboxyhydroxypyrazole ribonucleotide (CHPR) from 4-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Similarly, ForT, the PyfQ homologue in the formycin pathway, can catalyze the coupling of 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and PRPP to form carboxyaminopyrazole ribonucleotide. Finally, PyfP and PyfT are shown to catalyze amidation of CHPR to pyrazofurin 5'-phosphate thereby establishing the latter stages of both pyrazofurin and formycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Electronic and Steric Control of n→π* Interactions: Stabilization of the α-Helix Conformation without a Hydrogen Bond Abstract: The preferred conformations of peptides and proteins are dependent on local interactions that bias the conformational ensemble. The n→π* interaction between consecutive carbonyls promotes compact conformations, including the α-helix and polyproline II helix. In order to further understand the n→π* interaction and to develop methods to promote defined conformational preferences through acyl N-capping motifs, a series of peptides was synthesized in which the electronic and steric properties of the acyl group were modified. Using NMR spectroscopy, van't Hoff analysis of enthalpies, X-ray crystallography, and computational investigations, we observed that more electron-rich donor carbonyls (pivaloyl, iso-butyryl, propionyl) promote stronger n→π* interactions and more compact conformations than acetyl or less electron-rich donor carbonyls (methoxyacetyl, fluoroacetyl, formyl). X-ray crystallography indicates a strong, electronically tunable preference for the α-helix conformation, as observed directly on the φ and ψ torsion angles. Electron-donating acyl groups promote the α-helical conformation, even in the absence of the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the α-helix. In contrast, electron-withdrawing acyl groups led to more extended conformations. More sterically demanding groups can promote trans amide bonds independent of the electronic effect on n→π* interactions. Chloroacetyl groups additionally promote n→π* interactions through the interaction of the chlorine lone pair with the proximal carbonyl π*. These data provide additional support for an important role of n→π* interactions in the conformational ensemble of disordered or unfolded proteins. Moreover, this work suggests that readily incorporated acyl N-capping motifs that modulate n→π* interactions may be employed rationally to promote conformational biases in peptides, with potential applications in molecular design and medicinal chemistry.	0
Title: Engineering acetyl-CoA supply and ERG9 repression to enhance mevalonate production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: Mevalonate is a key precursor in isoprenoid biosynthesis and a promising commodity chemical. Although mevalonate is a native metabolite in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its production is challenged by the relatively low flux toward acetyl-CoA in this yeast. In this study we explore different approaches to increase acetyl-CoA supply in S. cerevisiae to boost mevalonate production. Stable integration of a feedback-insensitive acetyl-CoA synthetase (Se-acsL641P) from Salmonella enterica and the mevalonate pathway from Enterococcus faecalis results in the production of 1,390 ± 10 mg/l of mevalonate from glucose. While bifid shunt enzymes failed to improve titers in high-producing strains, inhibition of squalene synthase (ERG9) results in a significant enhancement. Finally, increasing coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis by overexpression of pantothenate kinase (CAB1) and pantothenate supplementation further increased production to 3,830 ± 120 mg/l. Using strains that combine these strategies in lab-scale bioreactors results in the production of 13.3 ± 0.5 g/l, which is ∼360-fold higher than previously reported mevalonate titers in yeast. This study demonstrates the feasibility of engineering S. cerevisiae for high-level mevalonate production.	0
Title: High divergence of the precursor peptides in combinatorial lanthipeptide biosynthesis Abstract: Lanthionine-containing peptides (lanthipeptides) are a rapidly growing family of polycyclic peptide natural products belonging to the large class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). These compounds are widely distributed in taxonomically distant species, and their biosynthetic systems and biological activities are diverse. A unique example of lanthipeptide biosynthesis is the prochlorosin synthetase ProcM from the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9313, which transforms up to 29 different precursor peptides (ProcAs) into a library of lanthipeptides called prochlorosins (Pcns) with highly diverse sequences and ring topologies. Here, we show that many ProcM-like enzymes from a variety of bacteria have the capacity to carry out post-translational modifications on highly diverse precursor peptides, providing new examples of natural combinatorial biosynthesis. We also demonstrate that the leader peptides come from different evolutionary origins, suggesting that the combinatorial biosynthesis is tied to the enzyme and not a specific type of leader peptide. For some precursor peptides encoded in the genomes, the leader peptides apparently have been truncated at the N-termini, and we show that these N-terminally truncated peptides are still substrates of the enzymes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that about two-thirds of the ProcA N-terminal sequence is not essential for ProcM activity. Our results also highlight the potential of exploring this class of natural products by genome mining and bioengineering.	0
Title: Electron spin echo studies of the copper complexes of conalbumin Abstract: Electron spin echo envelope spectroscopy was used to probe the two metal binding sites of Cu(II)-conalbumin. The echo envelope spectrum of Cu(II)-conalbumin-oxalate, with metal ion at either one or both of the binding sites, contains lines arising from the interaction of the electron spin of Cu(II) with bound imidazole, demonstrating histidine ligation to the metal ion. The 13C superhyperfine interaction of bound [13C]oxalate, obtained from the ratio of the electron spin echo envelopes of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[13C]oxalate to that of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[12C]oxalate, is about twice the free precession frequency and indicates a contact interaction between 13C and Cu(II). This study indicates that oxalate is directly coordinated to the metal ion. Over the pH range 7.0 to 10.0, where Cu(II)-conalbumin binds carbonate as an associated anion, the echo envelope spectrum indicates that at least one imidazole ligand is coordinated to Cu(II). Below pH 6.0 and above pH 11.0, imidazole coordination is not observed.	0
Title: A type I/type III polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic pathway for the structurally unique ansa compound kendomycin Abstract: Kendomycin is a bioactive polyketide that is produced by various Streptomyces strains. It displays strong antibiotic activities against a wide range of bacteria and exhibits remarkable cytotoxic effects on the growth of several human cancer cell lines. In this study we cloned the corresponding biosynthetic locus from the producer Streptomyces violaceoruber (strain 3844-33C). Our analysis shows that a mixed type I/type III polyketide synthase pathway is responsible for the formation of the fully carbogenic macrocyclic scaffold of kendomycin, which is unprecedented among all of the ansa compounds that have been isolated so far. Heterologous expression of a gene set in Streptomyces coelicolor shows that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid is an intermediate in the starter unit biosynthesis that is initiated by the type III polyketide synthase. The identification of the kendomycin biosynthetic gene cluster sets the stage to study a novel chain termination mechanism by a type I PKS that leads to carbocycle formation and provides the starting material for the heterologous expression of the entire pathway, and the production of novel derivatives by genetic engineering.	1
Title: Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in six full-scale wastewater treatment bioreactors Abstract: In this study, dideoxy sequencing and 454 high-throughput sequencing were used to analyze diversities of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes and the 16S rRNA genes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in six municipal wastewater treatment plants. The results showed that AOB amoA genes were quite diverse in different wastewater treatment plants while the 16S rRNA genes were relatively conserved. Based on the observed complexity of amoA and 16S rRNA genes, most of the AOB can be assigned to the Nitrosomonas genus, with Nitrosomonas ureae, Nitrosomonas oligotropha, Nitrosomonas marina, and Nitrosomonas aestuarii being the four most dominant species. From the sequences of the AOA amoA genes, most AOA observed in this study belong to the CGI.1b group, i.e., the soil lineage. The AOB amoA and 16S rRNA genes were quantified by quantitative PCR and 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing, respectively. Although the results from the two approaches show some disconcordance, they both indicated that the abundance of AOB in activated sludge was very low.	0
Title: The genome of tolypocladium inflatum: evolution, organization, and expression of the cyclosporin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The ascomycete fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, a pathogen of beetle larvae, is best known as the producer of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin. The draft genome of T. inflatum strain NRRL 8044 (ATCC 34921), the isolate from which cyclosporin was first isolated, is presented along with comparative analyses of the biosynthesis of cyclosporin and other secondary metabolites in T. inflatum and related taxa. Phylogenomic analyses reveal previously undetected and complex patterns of homology between the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that encodes for cyclosporin synthetase (simA) and those of other secondary metabolites with activities against insects (e.g., beauvericin, destruxins, etc.), and demonstrate the roles of module duplication and gene fusion in diversification of NRPSs. The secondary metabolite gene cluster responsible for cyclosporin biosynthesis is described. In addition to genes necessary for cyclosporin biosynthesis, it harbors a gene for a cyclophilin, which is a member of a family of immunophilins known to bind cyclosporin. Comparative analyses support a lineage specific origin of the cyclosporin gene cluster rather than horizontal gene transfer from bacteria or other fungi. RNA-Seq transcriptome analyses in a cyclosporin-inducing medium delineate the boundaries of the cyclosporin cluster and reveal high levels of expression of the gene cluster cyclophilin. In medium containing insect hemolymph, weaker but significant upregulation of several genes within the cyclosporin cluster, including the highly expressed cyclophilin gene, was observed. T. inflatum also represents the first reference draft genome of Ophiocordycipitaceae, a third family of insect pathogenic fungi within the fungal order Hypocreales, and supports parallel and qualitatively distinct radiations of insect pathogens. The T. inflatum genome provides additional insight into the evolution and biosynthesis of cyclosporin and lays a foundation for further investigations of the role of secondary metabolite gene clusters and their metabolites in fungal biology.	1
Title: Presence of non-oral bacteria in the oral cavity Abstract: A homeostatic balance exists between the resident microbiota in the oral cavity and the host. Perturbations of the oral microbiota under particular conditions can contribute to the growth of non-oral pathogens that are hard to kill because of their higher resistance to antimicrobials, raising the probability of treatment failure and reinfection. The presence of these bacteria in the oral cavity has been proven to be associated with several oral diseases such as periodontitis, caries, and gingivitis, and systemic diseases of importance in clinical medicine such as cystic fibrosis, HIV, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is still controversial whether these species are merely transient members or unique to the oral cavity. Mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between the oral microbiota and non-oral pathogens can also occur, though the mechanisms used by these bacteria are not clear. Therefore, this review presents an overview of the current knowledge about the presence of non-oral bacteria in the oral cavity, their relationship with systemic and oral diseases, and their interactions with oral bacteria.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyenoyltetramic acid alpha-lipomycin Abstract: The gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 produces the acyclic polyene antibiotic alpha-lipomycin. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster (lip gene cluster) was cloned and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of a 74-kb region revealed the presence of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs), 22 of them belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus that encodes an eight-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins. In addition, one ORF shows homology to those for nonribosomal peptide synthetases, indicating that alpha-lipomycin belongs to the classification of hybrid peptide-polyketide natural products. Furthermore, the lip cluster includes genes responsible for the formation and attachment of d-digitoxose as well as ORFs that resemble those for putative regulatory and export functions. We generated biosynthetic mutants by insertional gene inactivation. By analysis of culture extracts of these mutants, we could prove that, indeed, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipomycin had been cloned, and additionally we gained insight into an unusual biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: ANTAGONISM OF D-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF MYCOBACTERIAL GROWTH BY D-ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Antagonism of d-cycloserine inhibition of mycobacterial growth by d-alanine. J. Bacteriol. 85:1217-1220. 1963.-Reversal of the antimycobacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidinone (d-cycloserine) by alanine in two species of mycobacteria actively growing on chemically defined media was compared. In both instances, d-alanine was the most effective reversal agent. The specificity with which the d isomer reversed the antimycobacterial activity of d-cycloserine was more pronounced than that observed with other species of bacteria. Mycobactin, a growth factor for certain mycobacteria, showed no reversal activity.	0
Title: Inhibitory effect of FK-565 alone and in combination with zidovudine on retroviral infection by Friend leukemia virus in mice Abstract: The effects of route and starting time of administration on FK-565 inhibition of splenomegaly by Friend leukemia virus (FLV) were studied in mice, and the concomitant effect of FK-565 in allowing reduction of zidovudine dosage was estimated. FK-565 inhibited splenomegaly in intravenous and oral doses of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg, but time of initial dosing had little effect on this inhibition. When 0.01 or 1 mg/kg of FK-565 was given intravenously with intraperitoneal doses of 0.63, 2.5, 10 and 40m g/kg of zidovudine, the inhibition rate of splenomegaly at all doses was markedly and dose-dependently higher than when either drug was given alone, and the concomitant use of FK-565 with zidovudine enabled a 16-fold reduction of the dose of zidovudine. The survival rate and survival time after infection with massive amounts of FLV were higher when FK-565 1 mg/kg and zidovudine 20 mg/kg were given in combination than when either drug was given alone. Inhibition of FLV splenomegaly was reflected in the prolonged survival time of the infected mice.	0
Title: Heme protects Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus from calprotectin-induced iron starvation Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are opportunistic bacterial pathogens that cause severe infections in immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. Both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus require iron to infect the mammalian host. To obtain iron, these pathogens may rely on siderophore-mediated ferric iron uptake, ferrous iron uptake, or heme uptake at different points during infection. The preferred iron source depends on environmental conditions, including the presence of iron-sequestering host-defense proteins. Here, we investigate how the presence of heme, a highly relevant iron source during infection, affects bacterial responses to iron withholding by the innate immune protein calprotectin (CP). Prior work has shown that P. aeruginosa is starved of iron in the presence of CP. We report that P. aeruginosa upregulates expression of heme uptake machinery in response to CP. Furthermore, we show that heme protects P. aeruginosa from CP-mediated inhibition of iron uptake and iron-starvation responses. We extend our study to a second bacterial pathogen, S. aureus, and demonstrate that CP also inhibits iron uptake and induces iron-starvation responses by this pathogen. Similarly to P. aeruginosa, we show that heme protects S. aureus from CP-mediated inhibition of iron uptake and iron-starvation responses. These findings expand our understanding of microbial responses to iron sequestration by CP and highlight the importance of heme utilization for bacterial adaptation to host iron-withholding strategies.	0
Title: Spiropyran-based photochromic polymer nanoparticles with optically switchable luminescence Abstract: Polymer nanoparticles of 40-400 nm diameter with spiropyran-merocyanine dyes incorporated into their hydrophobic cavities have been prepared; in contrast to their virtually nonfluorescent character in most environments, the merocyanine forms of the encapsulated dyes are highly fluorescent. Spiro-mero photoisomerization is reversible, allowing the fluorescence to be switched "on" and "off" by alternating UV and visible light. Immobilizing the dye inside hydrophobic pockets of nanoparticles also improves its photostability, rendering it more resistant than the same dyes in solution to fatigue effects arising from photochemical switching. The photophysical characteristics of the encapsulated fluorophores differ dramatically from those of the same species in solution, making nanoparticle-protected hydrophobic fluorophores attractive materials for potential applications such as optical data storage and switching and biological fluorescent labeling. To evaluate the potential for biological tagging, these optically addressable nanoparticles have been delivered into living cells and imaged with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD.	0
Title: N-methylation of the amide bond by methyltransferase asm10 in ansamitocin biosynthesis Abstract: Ansamitocins are potent antitumor agents produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum. As deduced from their structures, an N-methylation on the amide bond is required among the various modifications. The protein encoded by asm10 belongs to the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family. Through gene inactivation and complementation, asm10 was proved to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 is a 33.0 kDa monomer, as determined by gel filtration. By using N-desmethyl-ansamitocin P-3 as substrate, the optimal temperature and pH for Asm10 catalysis were determined to be 32 °C and 10.0, respectively. Asm10 also showed broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl-ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. Through site-directed mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were confirmed to be essential for its catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM. The characterization of this unique N-methyltransferase has enriched the toolbox for engineering N-methylated derivatives from both natural and synthetic compounds; this will allow known potential drugs to be modified.	0
Title: Molecular characterization and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor antibiotic mitomycin C from Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 2564 Abstract: Background:                       The mitomycins are natural products that contain a variety of functional groups, including aminobenzoquinone- and aziridine-ring systems. Mitomycin C (MC) was the first recognized bioreductive alkylating agent, and has been widely used clinically for antitumor therapy. Precursor-feeding studies showed that MC is derived from 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), D-glucosamine, L-methionine and carbamoyl phosphate. A genetically linked AHBA biosynthetic gene and MC resistance genes were identified previously in the MC producer Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 2564. We set out to identify other genes involved in MC biosynthesis.                  Results:                       A cluster of 47 genes spanning 55 kilobases of S. lavendulae DNA governs MC biosynthesis. Fourteen of 22 disruption mutants did not express or overexpressed MC. Seven gene products probably assemble the AHBA intermediate through a variant of the shikimate pathway. The gene encoding the first presumed enzyme in AHBA biosynthesis is not, however, linked within the MC cluster. Candidate genes for mitosane nucleus formation and functionalization were identified. A putative MC translocase was identified that comprises a novel drug-binding and export system, which confers cellular self-protection on S. lavendulae. Two regulatory genes were also identified.                  Conclusions:                       The overall architecture of the MC biosynthetic gene cluster in S. lavendulae has been determined. Targeted manipulation of a putative MC pathway regulator led to a substantial increase in drug production. The cloned genes should help elucidate the molecular basis for creation of the mitosane ring system, as well efforts to engineer the biosynthesis of novel natural products.	1
Title: Identification of a sodium chloride-regulated promoter in Lactococcus lactis by single-copy chromosomal fusion with a reporter gene Abstract: An integration vector, pORI13, was developed to screen in Lactococcus lactis for expression signals induced by changes in the environment and to assay transcriptional activity of genes in single copy. The plasmid carries a promoterless Escherichia coli lacZ gene preceded by a start codon, a lactococcal ribosome binding site, and a multiple cloning site. Chromosomal Sau3AI fragments of L. lactis MG1363 DNA were cloned in pORI13 using a RepA+ E. coli as host. The resulting bank of plasmids was used for Campbell-type integration into the chromosome of L. lactis MG1363. The relatively large size of the chromosomal fragments used increases the chance of retaining complete genes in the targeted region. Screening of integrants in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl resulted in the isolation of a clone (NS3) in which expression of lacZ was dependent on the concentration of chloride ions.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the 4-methyloxazoline-containing nonribosomal peptides, JBIR-34 and -35, in Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 Abstract: JBIR-34 and -35 produced by Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 are nonribosomal peptides that possess an unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety. Through draft genome sequencing, cosmid cloning, and gene disruption, the JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis gene cluster (fmo cluster) was identified; it encodes 20 proteins including five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Disruption of one of these NRPS genes (fmoA3) resulted in no JBIR-34 and -35 production and accumulation of 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid. Stable isotope-feeding experiments indicated that the methyl group of the methyloxazoline ring is derived from alanine rather than methionine. A recombinant FmoH protein, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, catalyzed conversion of α-methyl-l-serine into d-alanine (the reverse reaction of α-methyl-l-serine synthesis catalyzed by FmoH in vivo). Taken together, we concluded that α-methyl-l-serine synthesized from d-alanine is incorporated into JBIR-34 and -35 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. We also propose the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35.	1
Title: HPLC-based activity profiling: discovery of piperine as a positive GABA(A) receptor modulator targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site Abstract: A plant extract library was screened for GABA(A) receptor activity making use of a two-microelectrode voltage clamp assay on Xenopus laevis oocytes. An ethyl acetate extract of black pepper fruits [Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) 100 microg/mL] potentiated GABA-induced chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors (composed of alpha(1), beta(2), and gamma(2S) subunits) by 169.1 +/- 2.4%. With the aid of an HPLC-based activity profiling approach, piperine (5) was identified as the main active compound, together with 12 structurally related less active or inactive piperamides (1-4, 6-13). Identification was achieved by on-line high-resolution mass spectrometry and off-line microprobe 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, using only milligram amounts of extract. Compound 5 induced a maximum potentiation of the chloride currents by 301.9 +/- 26.5% with an EC(50) of 52.4 +/- 9.4 microM. A comparison of the modulatory activity of 5 and other naturally occurring piperamides enabled insights into structural features critical for GABA(A) receptor modulation. The stimulation of chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors by compound 5 was not antagonized by flumazenil (10 microM). These data show that piperine (5) represents a new scaffold of positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulators targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site.	0
Title: Quantitative analysis of Penicillium chrysogenum Wis54-1255 transformants overexpressing the penicillin biosynthetic genes Abstract: The low penicillin-producing, single gene copy strain Wis54-1255 was used to study the effect of overexpressing the penicillin biosynthetic genes in Penicillium chrysogenum. Transformants of Wis54-1255 were obtained with the amdS expression-cassette using the four combinations: pcbAB, pcbC, pcbC-penDE, and pcbAB-pcbC-penDE of the three penicillin biosynthetic genes. Transformants showing an increased penicillin production were investigated during steady-state continuous cultivations with glucose as the growth-limiting substrate. The transformants were characterized with respect to specific penicillin productivity, the activity of the two pathway enzymes delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS) and isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) and the intracellular concentration of the metabolites: delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV), bis-delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (bisACV), isopenicillin N (IPN), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione disulphide (GSSG). Transformants with the whole gene cluster amplified showed the largest increase in specific penicillin productivity (r(p))-124% and 176%, respectively, whereas transformation with the pcbC-penDE gene fragment resulted in a decrease in r(p) of 9% relative to Wis54-1255. A marked increase in r(p) is clearly correlated with a balanced amplification of both the ACVS and IPNS activity or a large amplification of either enzyme activity. The increased capacity of a single enzyme occurs surprisingly only in the transformants where all the three biosynthetic genes are overexpressed but is not found within the group of pcbAB or pcbC transformants. The indication of the pcbAB and pcbC genes being closely regulated in fungi might explain why high-yielding strains of P. chrysogenum have been found to contain amplifications of a large region including the whole penicillin gene cluster and not single gene amplifications. Measurements of the total ACV concentration showed a large span of variability, which reflected the individual status of enzyme overexpression and activity found in each strain. The ratio ACV:bisACV remained constant, also at high ACV concentrations, indicating no limitation in the capacity of the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (TR) system, which is assumed to keep the pathway intermediate LLD-ACV in its reduced state. The total GSH pool was at a constant level of approx. 5.7 mM in all cultivations.	1
Title: Detection of antimicrobial resistance-associated proteins by titanium dioxide-facilitated intact bacteria mass spectrometry Abstract: Titanium dioxide-modified target plates were developed to enhance intact bacteria analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The plates were designed to photocatalytically destroy the bacterial envelope structure and improve the ionization efficiency of intracellular components, thereby promoting the measurable mass range and the achievable detection sensitivity. Accordingly, a method for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance-associated proteins, conferring bacterial resistance against antimicrobial drugs, was established by mass spectrometric fingerprinting of intact bacteria without the need for any sample pre-treatment. With this method, the variations in resistance proteins' expression levels within bacteria were quickly measured from the relative peak intensities. This approach of resistance protein detection directly from intact bacteria by mass spectrometry is useful for fast discrimination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from their non-resistant counterparts whilst performing species identification. Also, it could be used as a rapid and convenient way for initial determination of the underlying resistance mechanisms.	0
Title: Rh(I)-catalyzed Pauson-Khand-type cycloaddition reaction of ene-vinylidenecyclopropanes with carbon monoxide (CO) Abstract: An intramolecular Pauson-Khand type cycloaddition reaction of ene-vinylidenecyclopropanes with carbon monoxide has been established by using [Rh(COD)Cl](2) as the catalyst. The reaction was found to be highly efficient in solvents of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane to give excellent yields of 90-99%. The reaction provides easy access to a series of fused 6,5-ring structures containing spiro-cyclopropane units that are useful for drug design and development. A mechanism of this cycloaddition process has been proposed accounting for structures of resulting products that were unambiguously assigned by X-ray diffractional analysis.	0
Title: Botcinic acid biosynthesis in Botrytis cinerea relies on a subtelomeric gene cluster surrounded by relics of transposons and is regulated by the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor BcBoa13 Abstract: Botcinic acid is a phytotoxic polyketide involved in the virulence of the gray mold fungus Botrytis cinerea. Here, we aimed to investigate the specific regulation of the cluster of Bcboa genes that is responsible for its biosynthesis. Our analysis showed that this cluster is located in a subtelomeric genomic region containing alternating G + C/A + T-balanced regions, and A + T-rich regions made from transposable elements that underwent RIP (Repeat-Induced Point mutation). Genetic analyses demonstrated that BcBoa13, a putative Zn2Cys6 transcription factor, is a nuclear protein with a major positive regulatory role on the expression of other Bcboa1-to-Bcboa12 genes, and botcinic acid production. In conclusion, the structure and the regulation of the botcinic acid gene cluster show similar features with the cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the other known phytotoxin produced by B. cinerea, i.e., the sesquiterpene botrydial. Both clusters contain a gene encoding a pathway-specific Zn2Cys6 positive regulator, and both are surrounded by relics of transposons which raise some questions about the role of these repeated elements in the evolution and regulation of the secondary metabolism gene clusters in Botrytis.	1
Title: A whole-genome shotgun optical map of Yersinia pestis strain KIM Abstract: Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plagues (also known as black death) and has been responsible for recurrent devastating pandemics throughout history. To further understand this virulent bacterium and to accelerate an ongoing sequencing project, two whole-genome restriction maps (XhoI and PvuII) of Y. pestis strain KIM were constructed using shotgun optical mapping. This approach constructs ordered restriction maps from randomly sheared individual DNA molecules directly extracted from cells. The two maps served different purposes; the XhoI map facilitated sequence assembly by providing a scaffold for high-resolution alignment, while the PvuII map verified genome sequence assembly. Our results show that such maps facilitated the closure of sequence gaps and, most importantly, provided a purely independent means for sequence validation. Given the recent advancements to the optical mapping system, increased resolution and throughput are enabling such maps to guide sequence assembly at a very early stage of a microbial sequencing project.	0
Title: Molecular mechanism for loss of nodulation properties of Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: Of 18 Rhizobium trifolii strains tested, 12 showed a high frequency of loss of nodulation ability after incubation in cultures at elevated temperatures. A correlation between loss of nodulation ability and loss of a large plasmid was demonstrated for R. trifolii. In some nonnodulating (Nod-) mutants, deletions occurred instead of total elimination of the plasmid molecule. The maximum curing effect was observed in bacteria incubated at 35 degrees C. After 4 or more days of incubation at this temperature, the viability of bacteria decreased markedly, and the number of nonnodulating mutants increased significantly. At the elevated temperature DNA synthesis was stopped completely after 2 h, whereas protein synthesis proceeded for a few days. Microscopic observations showed that during the first 3 days of incubation at the elevated temperature, the bacterial cells increased markedly in size. These large irregular cells then divided and produced Nod- clones. Nonnodulating clones did not result from the selection of temperature-resistant mutants. The presence of P-group plasmids in Rhizobium strains strongly inhibited the loss of nodulation ability during incubation at 35 degrees C. The observed phenomenon did not result from integrative suppression. It is possible that a product(s) of the genes of R-plasmids acts as a stabilizing agent on the replication process of the indigenous Rhizobium plasmids.	0

Title: Repetitive DNA sequences cotranscribed with developmentally regulated Dictyostelium discoideum mRNAs Abstract: We have isolated a clone of Dictyostelium discoideum genomic DNA, pB41-6, that contains sequences that are reiterated and interspersed in the genome. The expression of these reiterated sequences is developmentally regulated, and they appear to be linked only to developmentally regulated mRNAs. We have used clone pB41-6 to isolate a set of complementary cDNA clones. Analysis of two selected clones indicates that they encode developmentally regulated mRNA species and, by means of the repetitive elements they contain, hybridize to many developmentally regulated mRNAs. In addition, we have defined two families of mRNA species carrying these repetitive sequences: one is induced at 5.5 hr of development and the other is induced between 5.5 and 15 hr of development. Since most of the mRNA species that have sequences complementary to clone pB41-6 accumulate in a coordinated fashion during development, these sequences may play an important regulatory role in the developmental program of Dictyostelium.	0
Title: Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation Abstract: Recent advances in peroxidase-mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high-resolution and subcellular compartment-specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2 O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence-independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.	0
Title: Structure of a complex of the ATPase SecA and the protein-translocation channel Abstract: Most proteins are secreted from bacteria by the interaction of the cytoplasmic SecA ATPase with a membrane channel, formed by the heterotrimeric SecY complex. Here we report the crystal structure of SecA bound to the SecY complex, with a maximum resolution of 4.5 ångström (A), obtained for components from Thermotoga maritima. One copy of SecA in an intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis is bound to one molecule of the SecY complex. Both partners undergo important conformational changes on interaction. The polypeptide-cross-linking domain of SecA makes a large conformational change that could capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, and by the coordinated tightening and widening of SecA's clamp above the SecY pore. SecA binding generates a 'window' at the lateral gate of the SecY channel and it displaces the plug domain, preparing the channel for signal sequence binding and channel opening.	0
Title: Effects of plant biomass, plant diversity, and water content on bacterial communities in soil lysimeters: implications for the determinants of bacterial diversity Abstract: Soils may comprise tens of thousands to millions of bacterial species. It is still unclear whether this high level of diversity is governed by functional redundancy or by a multitude of ecological niches. In order to address this question, we analyzed the reproducibility of bacterial community composition after different experimental manipulations. Soil lysimeters were planted with four different types of plant communities, and the water content was adjusted. Group-specific phylogenetic fingerprinting by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed clear differences in the composition of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia populations in soils without plants compared to that of populations in planted soils, whereas no influence of plant species composition on bacterial diversity could be discerned. These results indicate that the presence of higher plant species affects the species composition of bacterial groups in a reproducible manner and even outside of the rhizosphere. In contrast, the environmental factors tested did not affect the composition of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Archaea, and Firmicutes populations. One-third (52 out of 160) of the sequence types were found to be specifically and reproducibly associated with the absence or presence of plants. Unexpectedly, this was also true for numerous minor constituents of the soil bacterial assemblage. Subsequently, one of the low-abundance phylotypes (beta10) was selected for studying the interdependence under particular experimental conditions and the underlying causes in more detail. This so-far-uncultured phylotype of the Betaproteobacteria species represented up to 0.18% of all bacterial cells in planted lysimeters compared to 0.017% in unplanted systems. A cultured representative of this phylotype exhibited high physiological flexibility and was capable of utilizing major constituents of root exudates. Our results suggest that the bacterial species composition in soil is determined to a significant extent by abiotic and biotic factors, rather than by mere chance, thereby reflecting a multitude of distinct ecological niches.	0
Title: Pathway redesign for deoxyviolacein biosynthesis in Citrobacter freundii and characterization of this pigment Abstract: Violacein (Vio) is an important purple pigment with many potential bioactivities. Deoxyviolacein, a structural analog of Vio, is always synthesized in low concentrations with Vio in wild-type bacteria. Due to deoxyviolacein's low production and difficulties in isolation and purification, little has been learned regarding its function and potential applications. This study was the first effort in developing a stable and efficient biosynthetic system for producing pure deoxyviolacein. A recombinant plasmid with vioabce genes was constructed by splicing using an overlapping extension-polymerase chain reaction, based on the Vio-synthesizing gene cluster of vioabcde, originating from Duganella sp. B2, and was introduced into Citrobacter freundii. With the viod gene disrupted in the Vio synthetic pathway, Vio production was completely abolished and the recombinant C. freundii synthesized only deoxyviolacein. Interestingly, vioe gene expression was strongly stimulated in the viod-deleted recombinant strain, indicating that viod disruptions could potentially induce polar effects upon the downstream vioe gene within this small operon. Deoxyviolacein production by this strain reached 1.9 g/L in shaker flasks. The product exhibited significant acid/alkali and UV resistance as well as significant inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation at low concentrations of 0.1-1 μM. These physical characteristics and antitumor activities of deoxyviolacein contribute to illuminating its potential applications.	1
Title: Cadasides, Calcium-Dependent Acidic Lipopeptides from the Soil Metagenome That Are Active against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria Abstract: The growing threat of antibiotic resistance necessitates the discovery of antibiotics that are active against resistant pathogens. Calcium-dependent antibiotics are a small family of structurally diverse acidic lipopeptides assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that are known to display various modes of action against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here we use NRPS adenylation (AD) domain sequencing to guide the identification, recovery, and cloning of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster from a soil metagenome. Heterologous expression of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster led to the production of cadasides A (1) and B (2), a subfamily of acidic lipopeptides that is distinct from previously characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics in terms of both overall structure and acidic residue rich peptide core. The cadasides inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis in the presence of high concentrations of calcium. Interestingly, sequencing of AD domains from diverse soils revealed that sequences predicted to arise from cadaside-like gene clusters are predominantly found in soils containing high levels of calcium carbonate.	1
Title: Experimental and Computational Analysis of Protein Stabilization by Gly-to-d-Ala Substitution: A Convolution of Native State and Unfolded State Effects Abstract: The rational and predictable enhancement of protein stability is an important goal in protein design. Most efforts target the folded state, however stability is the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states thus both are suitable targets. Strategies directed at the unfolded state usually seek to decrease chain entropy by introducing cross-links or by replacing glycines. Cross-linking has led to mixed results. Replacement of glycine with an l-amino acid, while reducing the entropy of the unfolded state, can introduce unfavorable steric interactions in the folded state, since glycine is often found in conformations that require a positive φ angle such as helical C-capping motifs or type I' and II″ β-turns. l-Amino acids are strongly disfavored in these conformations, but d-amino acids are not. However, there are few reported examples and conflicting results have been obtained when glycines are replaced with d-Ala. We critically examine the effect of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions on protein stability using experimental approaches together with molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. The data, together with a survey of high resolution structures, show that the vast majority of proteins can be stabilized by substitution of C-capping glycines with d-Ala. Sites suitable for substitutions can be identified via sequence alignment with a high degree of success. Steric clashes in the native state due to the new side chain are rarely observed, but are likely responsible for the destabilizing or null effect observed for the small subset of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions which are not stabilizing. Changes in backbone solvation play less of a role. Favorable candidates for d-Ala substitution can be identified using a rapid algorithm based on molecular mechanics.	0
Title: Structure and mechanism of the magnesium-independent aromatic prenyltransferase CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: CloQ is an aromatic prenyltransferase from the clorobiocin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans. It is involved in the synthesis of the prenylated hydroxybenzoate moiety of the antibiotic, specifically catalyzing the attachment of a dimethylallyl moiety to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Herein, we report the crystal structure of CloQ and use it as a framework for interpreting biochemical data from both wild-type and variant proteins. CloQ belongs to the aromatic prenyltransferase family, which is characterized by an unusual core fold comprising five consecutive ααββ elements that form a central 10-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel. The latter delineates a solvent-accessible cavity where substrates bind and catalysis takes place. This cavity has well-defined polar and nonpolar regions, which have distinct roles in substrate binding and facilitate a Friedel-Crafts-type mechanism. We propose that the juxtaposition of five positively charged residues in the polar region circumvents the necessity for a Mg(2+), which, by contrast, is a strict requirement for the majority of prenyltransferases characterized to date. Our structure of CloQ complexed with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate reveals the formation of a covalent link between the substrate and Cys215 to yield a thiohemiketal species. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we show that this link is not essential for enzyme activity in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CloQ will accept alternative substrates and, therefore, has the capacity to generate a range of prenylated compounds. Since prenylation is thought to enhance the bioactivity of many natural products, CloQ offers considerable promise as a biocatalyst for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of novel compounds with therapeutic potential.	1
Title: Prediction of RNA binding proteins comes of age from low resolution to high resolution Abstract: Networks of protein-RNA interactions is likely to be larger than protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction networks because RNA transcripts are encoded tens of times more than proteins (e.g. only 3% of human genome coded for proteins), have diverse function and localization, and are controlled by proteins from birth (transcription) to death (degradation). This massive network is evidenced by several recent experimental discoveries of large numbers of previously unknown RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Meanwhile, more than 400 non-redundant protein-RNA complex structures (at 25% sequence identity or less) have been deposited into the protein databank. These sequences and structural resources for RBPs provide ample data for the development of computational techniques dedicated to RBP prediction, as experimentally determining RNA-binding functions is time-consuming and expensive. This review compares traditional machine-learning based approaches with emerging template-based methods at several levels of prediction resolution ranging from two-state binding/non-binding prediction, to binding residue prediction and protein-RNA complex structure prediction. The analysis indicates that the two approaches are complementary and their combinations may lead to further improvements.	0
Title: The RAD17 Promoter Sequence Contains a Potential Tail-Dependent G-Quadruplex That Downregulates Gene Expression upon Oxidative Modification Abstract: Our laboratory has recently proposed that the oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG) in G-rich promoter regions of DNA repair genes can serve as a regulatory mechanism of gene transcription. These regions also have the potential to fold into G-quadruplexes (G4). The human RAD17 promoter sequence has such a region in the template strand of the gene. In this work, the potential G-quadruplex sequence (PQS) of the RAD17 gene promoter was analyzed in different sequence contexts. With two extra nucleotides of the native sequence on either side of the G4, the structure was found to fold into a hybrid-like G4, similar to the hybrid-1 fold that the human telomere sequence can adopt. With only one nucleotide on either side of the PQS, the topology of the structure was observed to be mixed, and without extra nucleotides on the ends, the sequence adopted a parallel fold. Next, the sequence was studied with synthetic incorporation of the oxidative modification OG into specific sites and installed into the promoter of plasmids with a luciferase gene. These plasmids were transfected into a human cell line to observe the effect of the G4s on transcription. The RAD17 PQS was found to decrease luciferase expression with the presence of OG that is consistent with RAD17 expression under oxidative stress. This serves as an example of how oxidative modification could affect transcription in the context of a G4.	0
Title: The Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Andrastin A in Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: Penicillium roqueforti is a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. In addition, this fungus produces several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound andrastin A, a promising antitumoral compound. However, to date the genomic cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this compound in P. roqueforti has not been described. In this work, we have sequenced and annotated a genomic region of approximately 29.4 kbp (named the adr gene cluster) that is involved in the biosynthesis of andrastin A in P. roqueforti. This region contains ten genes, named adrA, adrC, adrD, adrE, adrF, adrG, adrH, adrI, adrJ and adrK. Interestingly, the adrB gene previously found in the adr cluster from P. chrysogenum, was found as a residual pseudogene in the adr cluster from P. roqueforti. RNA-mediated gene silencing of each of the ten genes resulted in significant reductions in andrastin A production, confirming that all of them are involved in the biosynthesis of this compound. Of particular interest was the adrC gene, encoding for a major facilitator superfamily transporter. According to our results, this gene is required for the production of andrastin A but does not have any role in its secretion to the extracellular medium. The identification of the adr cluster in P. roqueforti will be important to understand the molecular basis of the production of andrastin A, and for the obtainment of strains of P. roqueforti overproducing andrastin A that might be of interest for the cheese industry.	1
Title: A versatile synthetic route for the preparation of titanium metal-organic frameworks Abstract: Exploitation of new titanium metal-organic frameworks (Ti-MOFs) with high crystallinity has been attracting great attention due to their vast application potential in photocatalysis. Herein a versatile synthetic strategy, namely, High Valence Metathesis and Oxidation (HVMO), is developed to synthesize a series of Ti-MOFs with predesigned topologies and structures. The crystallinity of these Ti-MOFs was well maintained throughout, as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption measurements. Significantly, there were only a few examples of Ti-MOFs, not to mention a general synthetic strategy for various kinds of Ti-MOFs in the literature. This contribution also illustrates the intriguing potential of Ti-MOF platforms in photocatalysis.	0
Title: Application guide for omics approaches to cell signaling Abstract: Research in signal transduction aims to identify the functions of different signaling pathways in physiological and pathological states. Traditional techniques using biochemical, genetic or cell biological approaches have made important contributions to our understanding of cellular signaling. However, the single-gene approach does not take into account the full complexity of cell signaling. With the availability of omics techniques, great progress has been made in understanding signaling networks. Omics approaches can be classified into two categories: 'molecular profiling', including genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and interactome profiling; and 'molecular perturbation', including genetic and functional perturbations.	0
Title: Carboxyl formation from methyl via triple hydroxylations by XiaM in xiamycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The P450 enzyme XiaM was identified as a candidate to form the C-24 carboxyl group in xiamycin A (1). Alteration of medium composition led to the discovery of four new compounds from the ΔxiaM and the ΔxiaK (encoding an aromatic ring hydroxylase) mutants. Biotransformation experiments revealed that XiaM was capable of converting a methyl group to a carboxyl group through diol and aldehyde intermediates.	1
Title: Characterization of potential drug targets farnesyl diphosphate synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in Schistosoma mansoni Abstract: Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide, with over 200,000 deaths annually. Currently, praziquantel is the only drug available against schistosomiasis. We report here that Schistosoma mansoni farnesyl diphosphate synthase (SmFPPS) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (SmGGPPS) are potential drug targets for the treatment of schistosomiasis. We expressed active, recombinant SmFPPS and SmGGPPS for subsequent kinetic characterization and testing against a variety of bisphosphonate inhibitors. Recombinant SmFPPS was found to be a soluble 44.2-kDa protein, while SmGGPPS was a soluble 38.3-kDa protein. Characterization of the substrate utilization of the two enzymes indicates that they have overlapping substrate specificities. Against SmFPPS, several bisphosphonates had 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the low micromolar to nanomolar range; these inhibitors had significantly less activity against SmGGPPS. Several lipophilic bisphosphonates were active against ex vivo adult worms, with worm death occurring over 4 to 6 days. These results indicate that FPPS and GGPPS could be of interest in the context of the emerging resistance to praziquantel in schistosomiasis therapy.	0
Title: New lactimidomycin congeners shed insight into lactimidomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces amphibiosporus Abstract: Lactimidomycin (LTM, 1) is a macrolide antitumor antibiotic with a glutarimide side chain from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC53964. To further develop LTM and related analogues as drug candidates we have (i) improved LTM production by approximately 20 fold, (ii) identified three new metabolites (2-4) possibly involved in the LTM biosynthetic pathway; (iii) found 3 to be identical with a previously identified isomigrastatin precursor, (iv) determined the absolute stereochemistry of LTM, and (v) produced new LTM rearrangement products 2a-d and 4a-d.	1
Title: Genome Mining of Streptomyces mobaraensis DSM40847 as a Bleomycin Producer Providing a Biotechnology Platform To Engineer Designer Bleomycin Analogues Abstract: Streptomyces mobaraensis DSM40847 has been identified by genome mining and confirmed to be a new bleomycin (BLM) producer. Manipulation of BLM biosynthesis in S. mobaraensis has been demonstrated, as exemplified by the engineered production of 6'-deoxy-BLM A2, providing a biotechnology platform for BLM biosynthesis and engineering. Comparison of DNA cleavage efficiency and kinetics among 6'-deoxy-BLM A2 and selected analogues supports the wisdom of altering the disaccharide moiety to fine-tune BLM activity.	1
Title: Discovery of Structurally Diverse Small-Molecule Compounds with Broad Antiviral Activity against Enteroviruses Abstract: Antiviral drugs do not currently exist for the treatment of enterovirus infections, which are often severe and potentially life-threatening. We conducted high-throughput molecular screening and identified a structurally diverse set of compounds that inhibit the replication of coxsackievirus B3, a commonly encountered enterovirus. These compounds did not interfere with the function of the viral internal ribosome entry site or with the activity of the viral proteases, but they did drastically reduce the synthesis of viral RNA and viral proteins in infected cells. Sequence analysis of compound-resistant mutants suggests that the viral 2C protein is targeted by most of these compounds. These compounds demonstrated antiviral activity against a panel of the most commonly encountered enteroviruses and thus represent potential leads for the development of broad-spectrum anti-enteroviral drugs.	0
Title: Alpha-1-antitrypsin interacts with gp41 to block HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T lymphocytes Abstract: Background:                       Study of a clinic case reveals that alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is related to CD4+ T cell count decline and AIDS progression, suggesting that AAT might be an endogenous inhibitor of HIV/AIDS. Previous study shows that AAT inhibits HIV-1 replication in infected host cells and the C-terminus fragment of AAT, VIRIP, interferes with HIV-1 infection. However, it is still unclear whether and how intact AAT inhibits HIV-1 infection. It is also unknown what the mechanism of AAT is and which critical step(s) are involved.                  Results:                       In the present study, the C-terminus of AAT (C) was synthesized. C terminus-truncated AAT (ΔAAT) was also prepared by digesting AAT with metalloproteinase. Primary CD4+ T cells were then co-cultured with HIV-1 with the presence or absence of AAT/C/ΔAAT to detect cis-infection of HIV-1. The interaction between AAT/C/ΔAAT and gp120/gp41 was also measured. Meanwhile, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity and viral DNA integration were also detected in these lymphocytes. The results demonstrated that AAT and C, not ΔAAT, inhibited HIV-1 entry by directly interacting with gp41. Meanwhile, AAT, C and ΔAAT could not directly interfere with the steps of viral RNA reverse transcription and viral DNA integration.                  Conclusion:                       AAT inhibits HIV-1 entry by directly interacting with gp41 through its C-terminus and thereby inhibits HIV-1 infection.	0
Title: Polyketide-chain branching by an enzymatic Michael addition Abstract: A new "branch" for polyketide synthases was discovered in the biosynthesis of the antimitotic rhizoxin complex in the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica. Genetic engineering and the structural elucidation of pathway intermediates revealed that a complex polyketide chain is branched at the beta position by an unprecedented conjugate addition of an acetyl building block to an acryloyl precursor (see scheme).	1
Title: IspG-catalyzed positional isotopic exchange in methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate of the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway: mechanistic implications Abstract: H(2)(18)O under the bridge: Recently, the deoxyxylulose phosphate (DXP) pathway was discovered to be a second pathway supplying isoprenoid biosynthetic precursors. One of steps is an IspG-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation of methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to 4-hydroxyl-3-methyl-2-(E)-1-diphosphate (HMBPP). Using [2-(13) C,(18) O]-MEcPP, we detected the positional isotopic exchange for the bridging oxygen in MEcPP.	0
Title: Poly(hydroxyalkanoic acid) Biosynthesis in Ectothiorhodospirashaposhnikovii: Characterization and Reactivity of a Type III PHA Synthase Abstract: Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii is able to accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) photoautotrophically during nitrogen-limited growth. The activity of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase in the cells correlates with PHB accumulation. PHA synthase samples collected during the light period do not show a lag phase during in vitro polymerization. Synthase samples collected in the dark period displays a significant lag phase during in vitro polymerization. The lag phase can be eliminated by reacting the PHA synthase with the monomer, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HBCoA). The PHA synthase genes (phaC and phaE) were cloned by screening a genomic library for PHA accumulation in E. coli cells. The PHA synthase expressed in the recombinant E. coli cells was purified to homogeneity. Both sequence analysis and biochemical studies indicated that this PHA synthase consists of two subunits, PhaE and PhaC and, therefore, belongs to the type III PHA synthases. Two major complexes were identified in preparations of purified PHA synthase. The large complex appears to be composed of 12 PhaC subunits and 12 PhaE subunits (dodecamer), whereas the small complex appears to be composed of 6 PhaC and 6 PhaE subunits (hexamer). In dilute aqueous solution, the synthase is predominantly composed of hexamer and has low activity accompanied with a significant lag period at the initial stage of reaction. The percentage of dodecameric complex increases with increasing salt concentration. The dodecameric complex has a greatly increased specific activity for the polymerization of 3HBCoA and a negligible lag period. The results from in vitro polymerizations of 3HBCoA suggest that the PHA synthase from E. shaposhnikovii may catalyze a living polymerization and demonstrate that two PhaC and two PhaE subunits comprise a single catalytic site in the synthase complex.	1
Title: High Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity of an Anomalous Ruthenium Catalyst Abstract: Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a critical process due to its fundamental role in electrocatalysis. Practically, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media is of great importance for the conversion of renewable energy to hydrogen fuel via photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, both mechanistic exploration and materials development for HER under alkaline conditions are very limited. Precious Pt metal, which still serves as the state-of-the-art catalyst for HER, is unable to guarantee a sustainable hydrogen supply. Here we report an anomalously structured Ru catalyst that shows 2.5 times higher hydrogen generation rate than Pt and is among the most active HER electrocatalysts yet reported in alkaline solutions. The identification of new face-centered cubic crystallographic structure of Ru nanoparticles was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging, and its formation mechanism was revealed by spectroscopic characterization and theoretical analysis. For the first time, it is found that the Ru nanocatalyst showed a pronounced effect of the crystal structure on the electrocatalytic activity tested under different conditions. The combination of electrochemical reaction rate measurements and density functional theory computation shows that the high activity of anomalous Ru catalyst in alkaline solution originates from its suitable adsorption energies to some key reaction intermediates and reaction kinetics in the HER process.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster for tryptophan dimers in deep sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 Abstract: Tryptophan dimers (TDs) are an important class of natural products with diverse bioactivities and share conserved biosynthetic pathways. We report the identification of a partial gene cluster (spm) responsible for the biosynthesis of a class of unusual TDs with non-planar skeletons including spiroindimicins (SPMs), indimicins (IDMs), and lynamicins (LNMs) from the deep-sea derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. Bioinformatics analysis, targeted gene disruptions, and heterologous expression studies confirmed the involvement of the spm gene cluster in the biosynthesis of SPM/IDM/LNMs, and revealed the indispensable roles for the halogenase/reductase pair SpmHF, the amino acid oxidase SpmO, and the chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) synthase SpmD, as well as the positive regulator SpmR and the putative transporter SpmA. However, the spm gene cluster was unable to confer a heterologous host the ability to produce SPM/IDM/LNMs. In addition, the P450 enzyme SpmP and the monooxygenase SpmX2 were found to be non-relevant to the biosynthesis of SPM/IDM/LNMs. Sequence alignment and structure modeling suggested the lack of key conserved amino acid residues in the substrate-binding pocket of SpmP. Furthermore, feeding experiments in the non-producing ΔspmO mutant revealed several biosynthetic precursors en route to SPMs, indicating that key enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of SPMs should be encoded by genes outside of the identified spm gene cluster. Finally, the biosynthetic pathways of SPM/IDM/LNMs are proposed to lay a basis for further insights into their intriguing biosynthetic machinery.	1
Title: Photovoltaic performance of an ultrasmall band gap polymer Abstract: A conjugated polymer (PBTTQ) that consists of alternating electron-rich bithiophene and electron-deficient thiadiazoloquinoxaline units was synthesized via Yamamoto polymerization with Ni(cod)(2) and provides a band gap of 0.94 eV. This represents one of the smallest band gaps obtained for a soluble conjugated polymer. When applied in a bulk heterojunction solar cell together with [84]PCBM as the electron acceptor, the polymer affords a response up to 1.3 microm.	0
Title: Efficient Room-Temperature Activation of Methane by TaN(+) under C-N Coupling Abstract: The thermal reaction of diatomic tantalum nitride cation [TaN](+) with methane has been explored using FT-ICR mass spectrometry complemented by high-level quantum chemical calculation; based on this combined experimental/computational approach, mechanistic aspects of this novel, highly efficient C-N coupling process have been uncovered. In distinct contrast to [TaN](+) , its lighter congeners [VN](+) and [NbN](+) are inert towards methane under ambient conditions, and the origins of the remarkably variable efficiencies of the three metal nitrides are uncovered by CCSD(T) calculations.	0
Title: Control of Protein Activity and Gene Expression by Cyclofen-OH Uncaging Abstract: The use of light to control the expression of genes and the activity of proteins is a rapidly expanding field. Whereas many of these approaches use fusion between a light-activable protein and the protein of interest to control the activity of the latter, it is also possible to control the activity of a protein by uncaging a specific ligand. In that context, controlling the activation of a protein fused to the modified estrogen receptor (ERT) by uncaging its ligand cyclofen-OH has emerged as a generic and versatile method to control the activation of proteins quantitatively, quickly, and locally in a live organism. We present that approach and its uses in a variety of physiological contexts.	0
Title: Identification and properties of the genes encoding microcin E492 and its immunity protein Abstract: The gene coding for the immunity protein (mceB) and the structural gene of microcin E492 (mceA), a low-molecular-weight channel-forming bacteriocin produced by a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been characterized. The microcin gene codes for a precursor protein of either 99 or 103 amino acids. Protein sequencing of the N-terminal region of microcin E492 unequivocally identified this gene as the microcin structural gene and indicated that this microcin is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved at either amino acid 15 or 19, at a site resembling the double-glycine motif. The gene encoding the 95-amino-acid immunity protein (mceB) was identified by cloning the DNA segment that encodes only this polypeptide into an expression vector and demonstrating the acquisition of immunity to microcin E492. As expected, the immunity protein was found to be associated with the inner membrane. Analysis of the DNA sequence indicates that these genes belong to the same family as microcin 24, and they do not share structural motifs with any other known channel-forming bacteriocin. The organization of the microcin- and immunity protein-encoding genes suggests that they are coordinately expressed.	1
Title: A New Critical Conformational Determinant of Multidrug Efflux by an MFS Transporter Abstract: Secondary multidrug (Mdr) transporters utilize ion concentration gradients to actively remove antibiotics and other toxic compounds from cells. The model Mdr transporter MdfA from Escherichia coli exchanges dissimilar drugs for protons. The transporter should open at the cytoplasmic side to enable access of drugs into the Mdr recognition pocket. Here we show that the cytoplasmic rim around the Mdr recognition pocket represents a previously overlooked important regulatory determinant in MdfA. We demonstrate that increasing the positive charge of the electrically asymmetric rim dramatically inhibits MdfA activity and sometimes even leads to influx of planar, positively charged compounds, resulting in drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that unlike the mutants with the electrically modified rim, the membrane-embedded wild-type MdfA exhibits a significant probability of an inward-closed conformation, which is further increased by drug binding. Since MdfA binds drugs from its inward-facing environment, these results are intriguing and raise the possibility that the transporter has a sensitive, drug-induced conformational switch, which favors an inward-closed state.	0
Title: Hypotension, autonomic failure, and cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice overexpressing the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor Abstract: alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D)) are regulators of systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow. Whereas vasoconstrictory action of the alpha(1A) and alpha(1D) subtypes is thought to be mainly responsible for this activity, the role of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1B)AR) in this process is controversial. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress either wild type or constitutively active alpha(1B)ARs. Transgenic expression was under the control of the isogenic promoter, thus assuring appropriate developmental and tissue-specific expression. Cardiovascular phenotypes displayed by transgenic mice included myocardial hypertrophy and hypotension. Indicative of cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mice displayed an increased heart to body weight ratio, which was confirmed by the echocardiographic finding of an increased thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall. Functional deficits included an increased isovolumetric relaxation time, a decreased heart rate, and cardiac output. Transgenic mice were hypotensive and exhibited a decreased pressor response. Vasoconstrictory regulation by alpha(1B)AR was absent as shown by the lack of phenylephrine-induced contractile differences between ex vivo mesenteric artery preparations. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels were also reduced in transgenic mice, suggesting a loss of sympathetic nerve activity. Reduced catecholamine levels together with basal hypotension, bradycardia, reproductive problems, and weight loss suggest autonomic failure, a phenotype that is consistent with the multiple system atrophy-like neurodegeneration that has been reported previously in these mice. These results also suggest that this receptor subtype is not involved in the classic vasoconstrictory action of alpha(1)ARs that is important in systemic regulation of blood pressure.	0
Title: Primary amino acid and DNA sequences of gassericin T, a lactacin F-family bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 Abstract: A broad-spectral bacteriocin, named gassericin T, produced by Lactobacillus gasseri SBT 2055 (from human feces) was isolated to homogeneity from the culture supernatant by hydrophobic chromatography. By SDS-PAGE and in situ activity assay, the purified gassericin T migrated as a single band with bacteriocin activity and molecular size of 5,400. A 2.9-kbp HindIII-HindIII fragment of chromosome DNA was hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe designed from the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of gassericin T and was cloned. Six ORFs including the structural gene of gassericin T were deduced by computer analysis and the data bases. The structural gene of gassericin T (gatA) was identified as the fourth ORF, which encoded a protein composed of 75 amino acids that included the GG motif of the cleavage site. Chemical sequencing analysis of the complete amino acid sequence showed that gassericin T (57 amino acids) had a disulfide bond in the molecule and no modified amino acid residues, making it a class II bacteriocin. The gassericin T had 60% sequence similarity to mature LafA (57 amino acids, lactacin F, bacteriocins produced by L. johnsonii VPI11088), and the sequences around the processing site and C-terminal area were well conserved. The fifth ORF was designated as gatX, encoded as a peptide composed of 65 amino acids containing the GG motif of the putative cleavage site, however mature GatX and its antibacterial activity were not detected in the culture supernatant. GatX has higher similarity with LafX than with lactobin A (50 amino acids) belonging to the first lactacin F-family. These results indicated that gassericin T belongs to the hydrophobic class II bacteriocins and the most vicinal lactacin F-family.	1
Title: The Isolation of Pyrroloformamide Congeners and Characterization of Their Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Dithiolopyrrolones are microbial natural products containing a disulfide or thiosulfonate bridge embedded in a unique bicyclic structure. By interfering with zinc ion homeostasis in living cells, they show strong antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens, as well as potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. In the current study, two new dithiolopyrrolones, pyrroloformamide C (3) and pyrroloformamide D (4), were isolated from Streptomyces sp. CB02980, together with the known pyrroloformamides 1 and 2. The biosynthetic gene cluster for pyrroloformamides was identified from Streptomyces sp. CB02980, which shared high sequence similarity with those of dithiolopyrrolones, including holomycin and thiolutin. Gene replacement of pyfE, which encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), abolished the production of 1-4. Overexpression of pyfN, a type II thioesterase gene, increased the production of 1 and 2. Genome neighborhood network analysis of the characterized and orphan gene clusters of dithiolopyrrolones revealed a unified mechanism for their biosynthesis, involving an iterative-acting NRPS and a set of conserved tailoring enzymes for the bicyclic core formation.	1
Title: Demethylation of methylarsonic acid by a microbial community Abstract: Arsenic is one of the most widespread environmental carcinogens and has created devastating human health problems worldwide, yet little is known about mechanisms of biotransformation in contaminated regions. Methylarsonic acid [MAs(V)], extensively utilized as an herbicide, is largely demethylated to more toxic inorganic arsenite, which causes environmental problems. To understand the process of demethylation of methylarsenicals, soil samples commonly used on Florida golf courses were studied. Several soil extracts were found to demethylate MAs(V) to inorganic arsenite [As(III)]. From these extracts, a bacterial isolate was capable of reducing MAs(V) to MAs(III) but not of demethylating to As(III). A second bacterial isolate was capable of demethylating MAs(III) to As(III) but not of reducing MAs(V). A mixed culture could carry out the complete process of reduction and demethylation, demonstrating that demethylation of MAs(V) to As(III) is a two-step process. Analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the two organisms identified the MAs(V)-reducing and the MAs(III)-demethylating isolates as belong to Burkholderia and Streptomyces species respectively. This is the first report of a novel pathway of degradation of a methylarsenical herbicide by sequential reduction and demethylation in a microbial soil community, which we propose plays a significant role in the arsenic biogeocycle.	0
Title: The KtrA and KtrE subunits are required for Na+-dependent K+ uptake by KtrB across the plasma membrane in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The Na+-dependent K+ uptake KtrABE system is essential for the adaptation of Synechocystis to salinity stress and high osmolality. While KtrB forms the K+-translocating pore, the role of the subunits KtrA and KtrE for Ktr function remains elusive. Here, we characterized the role of KtrA and KtrE in Ktr-mediated K+ uptake and in modulating Na+ dependency. Expression of KtrB alone in a K+ uptake-deficient Escherichia coli strain conferred low K+ uptake activity that was not stimulated by Na+. Coexpression of both KtrA and KtrE with KtrB increased the K+ transport activity in a Na+-dependent manner. KtrA and KtrE were found to be localized to the plasma membrane in Synechocystis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to analyze the role of single charged residues in KtrB for Ktr function. Replacing negatively charged residues facing the extracellular space with residues of the opposite charge increased the apparent Km for K+ in all cases. However, none of the mutations eliminated the Na+ dependency of Ktr-mediated K+ transport. Mutations of residues on the cytoplasmic side had larger effects on K+ uptake activity than those of residues on the extracellular side. Further analysis revealed that replacement of R262, which is well conserved among Ktr/Trk/HKT transporters in the third extracellular loop, by Glu abolished transport activity. The atomic-scale homology model indicated that R262 might interact with E247 and D261. Based on these data, interaction of KtrA and KtrE with KtrB increased the K+ uptake rate and conferred Na+ dependency.	0
Title: Genome and proteome of Listeria monocytogenes phage PSA: an unusual case for programmed + 1 translational frameshifting in structural protein synthesis Abstract: PSA is a temperate phage isolated from Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A. We report its complete nucleotide sequence, which consists of a linear 37 618 bp DNA featuring invariable, 3'-protruding single stranded (cohesive) ends of 10 nucleotides. The physical characteristics were confirmed by partial denaturation mapping and electron microscopy of DNA molecules. Fifty-seven open reading frames were identified on the PSA genome, which are apparently organized into three major transcriptional units, in a life cycle-specific order. Functional assignments could be made to 33 gene products, including structural proteins, lysis components, DNA packaging proteins, lysogeny control functions and replication proteins. Bioinformatics demonstrated relatedness of PSA to phages infecting lactic acid bacteria and other low G + C Gram-positives, but revealed only few similarities to Listeria phage A118. Virion proteins were analysed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, which enabled identification of major capsid and tail proteins, a tape measure and a putative portal. These analyses also revealed an unusual form of translational frameshifting, which occurs during decoding of the mRNAs specifying the two major structural proteins. Frameshifting yields different length forms of Cps (gp5) and Tsh (gp10), featuring identical N-termini but different C-termini. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of tryptic peptide fragments was used to identify the modified C-termini of the longer protein species, by demonstration of specific sequences resulting from + 1 programmed translational frameshifting. A slippery sequence with overlapping proline codons near the 3' ends of both genes apparently redirects the ribosomes and initiates the recoding event. Two different cis-acting factors, a shifty stop and a pseudoknot, presumably stimulate frameshifting efficiency. PSA represents the first case of + 1 frameshifting among dsDNA phages, and appears to be the first example of a virus utilizing a 3' pseudoknot to stimulate such an event.	0
Title: Hyperreactivity of Blood Leukocytes in Patients with NAFLD to Ex Vivo Lipopolysaccharide Treatment Is Modulated by Metformin and Phosphatidylcholine but Not by Alpha Ketoglutarate Abstract: Introduction and aims:                       Toll-like receptor 4 and proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We investigated IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα production and toll-like receptor 4 in both--obese and lean patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who met different sets of metabolic syndrome criteria and linked the results with the disease burden.                  Materials and methods:                       95 subjects were divided into four groups depending on the following criteria: presence or absence of metabolic syndrome and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, glucose tolerance (prediabetes or normoglycemia) and BMI value (obese or lean). We determined the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and monocyte toll-like receptor 4 expression in fresh blood as well as in blood cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide with or without metformin, alphaketoglutarate or phosphatidylcholine supplementation.                  Results:                       The blood leukocytes of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide treatment and produce elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to ex vivo treatment with lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, they overexpress toll-like receptor-4. Hyperreactivity was typical mainly for obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease together with metabolic syndrome and decreased with the severity of disease. Metformin was the most effective in attenuation of hyperreactivity in all groups of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but in obese patients the effectiveness of metformin was weaker than in lean. The reduction of cytokine level by metformin was accompanied by the decrease in toll-like receptor-4 expression. phosphatidylcholine also attenuated hyperreactivity to lipopolysaccharide but mainly in obese patients. Alpha ketoglutarate did not modulate cytokines' level and toll-like receptor 4 expression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients.                  Conclusions:                       Metformin and phosphatidylcholine attenuated lipopolysaccharide induced toll-like receptor 4 overexpression and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines; however, their efficacy depended on combined presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome and obesity.	0
Title: Revisiting and revising the purinosome Abstract: Some metabolic pathway enzymes are known to organize into multi-enzyme complexes for reasons of catalytic efficiency, metabolite channeling, and other advantages of compartmentalization. It has long been an appealing prospect that de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes form such a complex, termed the "purinosome." Early work characterizing these enzymes garnered scarce but encouraging evidence for its existence. Recent investigations led to the discovery in human cell lines of purinosome bodies-cytoplasmic puncta containing transfected purine biosynthesis enzymes, which were argued to correspond to purinosomes. New discoveries challenge both the functional and physiological relevance of these bodies in favor of protein aggregation.	0
Title: Draft Genome Sequences of Marine Isolates of Thalassomonas viridans and Thalassomonas actiniarum Abstract: Thalassomonas viridans and Thalassomonas actiniarum are aerobic Gram-negative bacilli which belong to a genus that has not received much attention, even though, as demonstrated here by the sequencing of their genomes, they are quite different from their closest relatives in current databases. Their genomes are relatively large at 7.7 and 7.4 Mb, respectively. This brief report describes the first draft genomes for any Thalassomonas species.	1
Title: Genetic analyses of the putative O and K antigen gene clusters of pandemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus Abstract: Pandemic V. parahaemolyticus strains have rapidly changed their serotypes, but its determinants, especially K antigen, and the genes involved in serotype have been an open question. The purpose of this study was to gain insights into these points. Although V. parahaemolyticus is known to be lacking O-side chain on its lipopolysaccharide, and O antigens are thought to be represented by core OS, the genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 strain RIMD2210633 suggests that this bacterium potentially synthesizes O-side chain. To explore possible relatedness between this O-side chain biosynthesis gene cluster, which is similar in the serotypes of Vibrio cholerae, and of V. parahaemolyticus, we amplified both core OS and O-side chain gene clusters of the strains belonging to various serotypes of V. parahaemolyticus by long PCR and performed PCR RFLP analyses. The results of our RFLP analyses suggest that the core OS biosynthesis gene cluster is related to the O antigens of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus and that the putative O-side chain gene cluster is related to K antigens of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus. We then determined the sequence of these regions of a pandemic O4:K68 strain, and compared it with the corresponding sequence of RIMD2210633. In addition, PCR analysis showed the putative O4 and K68 antigen gene clusters are unique to the strains belonging to the O4 and K68 serotype respectively. The data implies that the pandemic O4:K68 V. parahaemolyticus strain emerged from the pandemic O3:K6 strain by replacement of the putative O and K antigen gene clusters.	1
Title: Heat-shock response transcriptional program enables high-yield and high-quality recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli Abstract: The biosynthesis of soluble, properly folded recombinant proteins in large quantities from Escherichia coli is desirable for academic research and industrial protein production. The basal E. coli protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network capacity is often insufficient to efficiently fold overexpressed proteins. Herein we demonstrate that a transcriptionally reprogrammed E. coli proteostasis network is generally superior for producing soluble, folded, and functional recombinant proteins. Reprogramming is accomplished by overexpressing a negative feedback deficient heat-shock response transcription factor before and during overexpression of the protein-of-interest. The advantage of transcriptional reprogramming versus simply overexpressing select proteostasis network components (e.g., chaperones and co-chaperones, which has been explored previously) is that a large number of proteostasis network components are upregulated at their evolved stoichiometry, thus maintaining the system capabilities of the proteostasis network that are currently incompletely understood. Transcriptional proteostasis network reprogramming mediated by stress-responsive signaling in the absence of stress should also be useful for protein production in other cells.	0
Title: Algal p-coumaric acid induces oxidative stress and siderophore biosynthesis in the bacterial symbiont Phaeobacter inhibens Abstract: The marine alpha-proteobacterium Phaeobacter inhibens engages in intermittent symbioses with microalgae. The symbiosis is biphasic and concludes in a parasitic phase, during which the bacteria release algaecidal metabolites in response to algal p-coumaric acid (pCA). The cell-wide effects of pCA on P. inhibens remain unknown. Herein, we report a microarray-based transcriptomic study and find that genes related to the oxidative stress response and secondary metabolism are upregulated most, while those associated with energy production and motility are downregulated in the presence of pCA. Among genes upregulated is a previously unannotated biosynthetic gene cluster and, using a combination of gene deletions and metabolic profiling, we show that it gives rise to an unreported siderophore, roseobactin. The simultaneous production of algaecides and roseobactin in the parasitic phase allows the bacteria to take up any iron that is released from dying algal cells, thereby securing a limited micronutrient.	1
Title: A chemical and genetic approach to the mode of action of fumagillin Abstract: Previous mode of action studies identified methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2) as the target of the antiangiogenic natural product fumagillin and its drug candidate analog, TNP-470. We report here that TNP-470-mediated MetAP-2 inhibition blocks noncanonical Wnt signaling, which plays a critical role in development, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this finding, antisense MetAP-2 morpholino oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish embryos phenocopies gastrulation defects seen in noncanonical Wnt5 loss-of-function zebrafish mutants. MetAP-2 inhibition or depletion blocks signaling downstream of the Wnt receptor Frizzled, but upstream of Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II, RhoA, and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase. Moreover, we demonstrate that TNP-470 does not block the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Thus, TNP-470 selectively regulates noncanonical over canonical Wnt signaling and provides a unique means to explore and dissect the biological systems mediated by these pathways.	0
Title: Post-translational modification in microviridin biosynthesis Abstract: Cyanobacteria are prolific producers of bioactive natural products that mostly belong to the nonribosomal peptide and polyketide classes. We show here how a linear precursor peptide of microviridin K, a new member of the microviridin class of peptidase inhibitors, is processed to become the mature tricyclic peptidase inhibitor. The microviridin (mvd) biosynthetic gene cluster of P. agardhii comprises six genes encoding microviridin K, an apparently unexpressed second microviridin, two RimK homologues, an acetyltransferase, and an ABC transporter. We have over-expressed three enzymes of this pathway and have demonstrated their biochemical function in vitro through chemical degradation and mass spectrometry. We show that a prepeptide undergoes post-translational modification through cross-linking by ester and amide bond formation by the RimK homologues MvdD and MvdC, respectively. In silico analysis of the mvd gene cluster suggests the potential for widespread occurrence of microviridin-like compounds in a broad range of bacteria.	1
Title: Identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic compound glidobactin from a soil bacterium Abstract: Glidobactins (syn. cepafungins) are a family of structurally related cytotoxic compounds that were isolated from the soil bacterial strain K481-B101 (ATCC 53080; DSM 7029) originally assigned to Polyangium brachysporum and, independently, from an undefined species related to Burkholderia cepacia. Glidobactins are acylated tripeptide derivatives that contain a 12-membered ring structure consisting of the two unique non-proteinogenic amino acids erythro-4-hydroxy-l-lysine and 4(S)-amino-2(E)-pentenoic acid. Here we report the cloning and functional analysis of a gene cluster (glbA-glbH) involved in glidobactin synthesis from K481-B101, which according to its 16S rRNA sequence belongs to the Burkholderiales. The putative encoded proteins include a mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase whose structure and architecture allowed to build a biosynthetic pathway model explaining the biosynthesis of the unique peptide part of glidobactins. Intriguingly, among the more than 600 bacterial strains whose genome sequence is currently available, homologous gene clusters were found in Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causing agent of melioidosis, and in the insect pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens, strongly suggesting that these organisms are capable to synthesize compounds similar to glidobactins. In addition, a glb gene cluster that was inactivated by transposon-mediated rearrangements was also present in Burkholderia mallei, a very close relative of B. pseudomallei and the causing agent of glanders in horse-like animals.	1
Title: Sulfonium Acids Loaded onto an Unusual Thiotemplate Assembly Line Construct the Cyclopropanol Warhead of a Burkholderia Virulence Factor Abstract: Pathogenic bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause severe infectious diseases such as glanders and melioidosis. Malleicyprols were identified as important bacterial virulence factors, yet the biosynthetic origin of their cyclopropanol warhead has remained enigmatic. By a combination of mutational analysis and metabolomics we found that sulfonium acids, dimethylsulfoniumpropionate (DMSP) and gonyol, known as osmolytes and as crucial components in the global organosulfur cycle, are key intermediates en route to the cyclopropanol unit. Functional genetics and in vitro analyses uncover a specialized pathway to DMSP involving a rare prokaryotic SET-domain methyltransferase for a cryptic methylation, and show that DMSP is loaded onto the NRPS-PKS hybrid assembly line by an adenylation domain dedicated to zwitterionic starter units. Then, the megasynthase transforms DMSP into gonyol, as demonstrated by heterologous pathway reconstitution in E. coli.	1
Title: Overview of genomic and bioinformatic resources for Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: Zymoseptoria tritici (syn. Mycosphaerella graminicola, Septoria tritici) is a haploid fungus belonging to the class Dothideomycetes. It is the causal agent of septoria leaf blotch - one of the world's most significant diseases of wheat. Here we review the genomic and bioinformatic resources that have been generated for Z. tritici. These include the whole-genome reference assembly for isolate IPO323, genome resequencing of alternate isolates, mitochondrial genome sequences, transcriptome sequences and expression data, and annotations of gene structure and function. We also highlight important advances in our fundamental knowledge of genome evolution and its effects on adaptation and pathogenicity in Z. tritici that have been facilitated by these resources.	0
Title: Metagenome mining reveals polytheonamides as posttranslationally modified ribosomal peptides Abstract: It is held as a paradigm that ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins contain only l-amino acids. We demonstrate a ribosomal origin of the marine sponge-derived polytheonamides, exceptionally potent, giant natural-product toxins. Isolation of the biosynthetic genes from the sponge metagenome revealed a bacterial gene architecture. Only six candidate enzymes were identified for 48 posttranslational modifications, including 18 epimerizations and 17 methylations of nonactivated carbon centers. Three enzymes were functionally validated, which showed that a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme is responsible for the unidirectional epimerization of multiple and different amino acids. Collectively, these complex alterations create toxins that function as unimolecular minimalistic ion channels with near-femtomolar activity. This study broadens the biosynthetic scope of ribosomal systems and creates new opportunities for peptide and protein bioengineering.	1
Title: Structure-activity relationship studies of the two-component lantibiotic haloduracin Abstract: The lantibiotic haloduracin consists of two posttranslationally processed peptides, Halalpha and Halbeta, which act in synergy to provide bactericidal activity. An in vitro haloduracin production system was used to examine the biological impact of disrupting individual thioether rings in each peptide. Surprisingly, the Halalpha B ring, which contains a highly conserved CTLTXEC motif, was expendable. This motif has been proposed to interact with haloduracin's predicted target, lipid II. Exchange of the glutamate residue in this motif for alanine or glutamine completely abolished antibacterial activity. This study also established that Halalpha-Ser26 and Halbeta-Ser22 escape dehydration, requiring revision of the Halbeta structure previously proposed. Extracellular proteases secreted by the producer strain can remove the leader peptide, and the Halalpha cystine that is dispensable for bioactivity protects Halalpha from further proteolytic degradation.	1
Title: Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of a d-Tryptophan-Containing Lasso Peptide, MS-271 Abstract: MS-271, produced by Streptomyces sp. M-271, is a lasso peptide natural product comprising 21 amino acid residues with a d-tryptophan at its C terminus. Because lasso peptides are ribosomal peptides, the biosynthesis of MS-271, especially the mechanism of d-Trp introduction, is of great interest. The MS-271 biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by draft genome sequencing of the MS-271 producer, and it was revealed that the precursor peptide contains all 21 amino acid residues including the C-terminal tryptophan. This suggested that the d-Trp residue is introduced by epimerization. Genes for modification enzymes such as a macrolactam synthetase (mslC), precursor peptide recognition element (mslB1), cysteine protease (mslB2), disulfide oxidoreductases (mslE, mslF), and a protein of unknown function (mslH) were found in the flanking region of the precursor peptide gene. Although obvious epimerase genes were absent in the cluster, heterologous expression of the putative MS-271 cluster in Streptomyces lividans showed that it contains all the necessary genes for MS-271 production including a gene for a new peptide epimerase. Furthermore, a gene-deletion experiment indicated that MslB1, -B2, -C and -H were indispensable for MS-271 production and that some interactions of the biosynthetic enzymes were essential for the biosynthesis of MS-271.	1
Title: A biaryl-linked tripeptide from Planomonospora reveals a widespread class of minimal RiPP gene clusters Abstract: Microbial natural products impress by their bioactivity, structural diversity, and ingenious biosynthesis. While screening the less exploited actinobacterial genus Planomonospora, two cyclopeptides were discovered, featuring an unusual Tyr-His biaryl bridging across a tripeptide scaffold, with the sequences N-acetyl-Tyr-Tyr-His and N-acetyl-Tyr-Phe-His. Planomonospora genomes pointed toward a ribosomal synthesis of the cyclopeptide from a pentapeptide precursor encoded by 18-bp bytA, to our knowledge the smallest coding gene ever reported. Closely linked to bytA is bytO, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase likely responsible for biaryl installment. In Streptomyces, the bytAO segment was sufficient to direct production of the crosslinked N-acetylated Tyr-Tyr-His tripeptide. Bioinformatic analysis of related cytochrome P450 monooxygenases indicated that they constitute a widespread family of enzymes, and the corresponding genes are closely linked to 5-amino acid coding sequences in approximately 200 (actino)bacterial genomes, all with potential for biaryl linkage between amino acids 1 and 3. We propose the named biarylitides this family of RiPPs.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of andalusicin: N-terminally dimethylated class III lantibiotic from Bacillus thuringiensis sv. andalousiensis Abstract: Lanthipeptides, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), can be divided into five classes based on their structures and biosynthetic pathways. Class I and II lanthipeptides have been well characterized, whereas less is known about members of the other three classes. Here, we describe a new family of class III lanthipeptides from Firmicutes. Members of the family are distinguished by the presence of a single carboxy-terminal labionin. We identified and characterized andalusicin, a representative of this family. Andalusicin bears two methyl groups at the α-amino terminus, a post-translational modification that has not previously been identified in class III lanthipeptides. Mature andalusicin A shows bioactivity against various Gram-positive bacteria, an activity that is highly dependent on the α-N dimethylation.	1
Title: Determining the extremes of the cellular NAD(H) level by using an Escherichia coli NAD(+)-auxotrophic mutant Abstract: NAD (NAD(+)) and its reduced form (NADH) are omnipresent cofactors in biological systems. However, it is difficult to determine the extremes of the cellular NAD(H) level in live cells because the NAD(+) level is tightly controlled by a biosynthesis regulation mechanism. Here, we developed a strategy to determine the extreme NAD(H) levels in Escherichia coli cells that were genetically engineered to be NAD(+) auxotrophic. First, we expressed the ntt4 gene encoding the NAD(H) transporter in the E. coli mutant YJE001, which had a deletion of the nadC gene responsible for NAD(+) de novo biosynthesis, and we showed NTT4 conferred on the mutant strain better growth in the presence of exogenous NAD(+). We then constructed the NAD(+)-auxotrophic mutant YJE003 by disrupting the essential gene nadE, which is responsible for the last step of NAD(+) biosynthesis in cells harboring the ntt4 gene. The minimal NAD(+) level was determined in M9 medium in proliferating YJE003 cells that were preloaded with NAD(+), while the maximal NAD(H) level was determined by exposing the cells to high concentrations of exogenous NAD(H). Compared with supplementation of NADH, cells grew faster and had a higher intracellular NAD(H) level when NAD(+) was fed. The intracellular NAD(H) level increased with the increase of exogenous NAD(+) concentration, until it reached a plateau. Thus, a minimal NAD(H) level of 0.039 mM and a maximum of 8.49 mM were determined, which were 0.044× and 9.6× those of wild-type cells, respectively. Finally, the potential application of this strategy in biotechnology is briefly discussed.	0
Title: Development and Application of a Novel Rapid and Throughput Method for Broad-Spectrum Anti-Foodborne Norovirus Antibody Testing Abstract: Foodbone norovirus (NoV) is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Candidate vaccines are being developed, however, no licensed vaccines are currently available for managing NoV infections. Screening for stimulated antibodies with broad-spectrum binding activities can be performed for the development of NoV polyvalent vaccines. In this study, we aimed to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for testing the broad spectrum of anti-NoV antibodies. Capsid P proteins from 28 representative NoV strains (GI.1-GI.9 and GII.1-GII.22 except GII.11, GII.18, and GII.19) were selected, prepared, and used as coating antigens on one microplate. Combined with incubation and the horseradish peroxidase chromogenic reaction, the entire process for testing the spectrum of unknown antibodies required 2 h for completion. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%. The new method was successfully performed with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies induced by multiple antigens. In conclusion, the indirect ELISA assay developed in this study had a good performance of reliability, convenience, and high-throughput screening for broad-spectrum antibodies.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16-membered macrolide antibiotic FD-891: involvement of a dual functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing epoxidation and hydroxylation Abstract: FD-891 is a 16-membered cytotoxic antibiotic macrolide that is especially active against human leukemia such as HL-60 and Jurkat cells. We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of the aflatoxin-like toxin, dothistromin Abstract: Dothistromin is a polyketide toxin, produced by a fungal forest pathogen, with structural similarity to the aflatoxin precursor versicolorin B. Biochemical and genetic studies suggested that there are common steps in the biosynthetic pathways for these metabolites and showed similarities between some of the genes. A polyketide synthase gene (pksA) was isolated from dothistromin-producing Dothistroma septosporum by hybridization with an aflatoxin ortholog from Aspergillus parasiticus. Inactivation of this gene in D. septosporum resulted in mutants that could not produce dothistromin but that could convert exogenous aflatoxin precursors, including norsolorinic acid, into dothistromin. The mutants also had reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type. So far four other genes are known to be clustered immediately alongside pksA. Three of these (cypA, moxA, avfA) are predicted to be orthologs of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. The other gene (epoA), located between avfA and moxA, is predicted to encode an epoxide hydrolase, for which there is no homolog in either the aflatoxin or sterigmatocystin gene clusters. The pksA gene is located on a small chromosome of approximately 1.3 Mb in size, along with the dothistromin ketoreductase (dotA) gene.	1
Title: Effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 on postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia in rats Abstract: The effect of Lactobacillus pentosus strain S-PT84 (S-PT84) on postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia was investigated in rats. S-PT84 dose-dependently inhibited the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols by pancreatic lipase in vitro. Intragastric administration of S-PT84 significantly reduced the lymphatic recovery of (3)H-trioleoylglycerol up to 8 h. The oral administration of a fat emulsion, with or without S-PT84, resulted in the concentration of plasma triacylglycerol 2 h and 3 h after administration being significantly lower in the S-PT84 group than in the group without S-PT84 (control group). These results suggest that S-PT84 alleviated postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia by delaying triacylglycerol absorption in the intestine through the inhibition of pancreatic lipase.	0
Title: Transfer of proteins into mitochondria. Precursor to the ADP/ATP carrier binds to receptor sites on isolated mitochondria Abstract: The precursor form of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier synthesized in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system can be imported into isolated mitochondria. If the mitochondrial transmembrane potential is abolished, import does not occur but the precursor binds to the mitochondrial surface. Upon reestablishment of the membrane potential, the bound precursor is imported. This occurs without dissociation of the bound precursor from the mitochondrial surface. We conclude that the binding observed represents an interaction with receptor sites and thus is an early step in the import pathway.	0
Title: mTORC1 senses lysosomal amino acids through an inside-out mechanism that requires the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase Abstract: The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that is stimulated by amino acids. Amino acids activate the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. We found that the vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) is necessary for amino acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino acid-sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP hydrolysis by the v-ATPase was necessary for amino acids to regulate the v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. Results obtained in vitro and in human cells suggest that amino acid signaling begins within the lysosomal lumen. These results identify the v-ATPase as a component of the mTOR pathway and delineate a lysosome-associated machinery for amino acid sensing.	0
Title: Penicillium roqueforti PR toxin gene cluster characterization Abstract: PR toxin is a well-known isoprenoid mycotoxin almost solely produced by Penicillium roqueforti after growth on food or animal feed. This mycotoxin has been described as the most toxic produced by this species. In this study, an in silico analysis allowed identifying for the first time a 22.4-kb biosynthetic gene cluster involved in PR toxin biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. The pathway contains 11 open reading frames encoding for ten putative proteins including the major fungal terpene cyclase, aristolochene synthase, involved in the first farnesyl-diphosphate cyclization step as well as an oxidoreductase, an oxidase, two P450 monooxygenases, a transferase, and two dehydrogenase enzymes. Gene silencing was used to study three genes (ORF5, ORF6, and ORF8 encoding for an acetyltransferase and two P450 monooxygenases, respectively) and resulted in 20 to 40% PR toxin production reductions in all transformants proving the involvement of these genes and the corresponding enzyme activities in PR toxin biosynthesis. According to the considered silenced gene target, eremofortin A and B productions were also affected suggesting their involvement as biosynthetic intermediates in this pathway. A PR toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on the most recent and available data.	1
Title: New linear lipopeptides produced by Pseudomonas cichorii SF1-54 are involved in virulence, swarming motility, and biofilm formation Abstract: Pseudomonas cichorii is the causal agent of lettuce midrib rot, characterized by a dark-brown to green-black discoloration of the midrib. Formation of necrotic lesions by several plant-pathogenic pseudomonads is associated with production of phytotoxic lipopeptides, which contribute to virulence. Therefore, the ability of P. cichorii SF1-54 to produce lipopeptides was investigated. A cell-free culture filtrate of SF1-54 showed surfactant, antimicrobial, and phytotoxic activities which are typical for lipopeptides. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of P. cichorii SF1-54 culture filtrate revealed the presence of seven compounds with lipopeptide characteristics. Two related lipopeptides, named cichofactin A and B, were studied in more detail: they are linear lipopeptides with a decanoic and dodecanoic lipid chain, respectively, connected to the N-terminus of an eight-amino-acid peptide moiety. Both cichofactins are new members of the syringafactin lipopeptide family. Furthermore, two nonribosomal peptide synthethase-encoding genes, cifA and cifB, were identified as responsible for cichofactin biosynthesis. A cifAB deletion mutant no longer produced cichofactins and was impaired in swarming motility but showed enhanced biofilm formation. Upon spray inoculation on lettuce, the cichofactin-deficient mutant caused significantly less rotten midribs than the wild type, indicating that cichofactins are involved in pathogenicity of P. cichorii SF1-54. Further analysis revealed that P. cichorii isolates vary greatly in swarming motility and cichofactin production.	1
Title: Organization and nature of fortimicin A (astromicin) biosynthetic genes studied using a cosmid library of Micromonospora olivasterospora DNA Abstract: The cloning of five DNA segments carrying at least seven genes (fms1, fms3, fms4, fms5, fms7, fms11, and fms12) that participate in fortimicin A (astromicin) biosynthesis was described previously. These DNA fragments were used to screen a cosmid library of genomic DNA in order to examine if these biosynthetic genes are clustered in Micromonospora olivasterospora. One cosmid clone (pGLM990) was obtained, which hybridized to all the probes. Complementation analysis, using mutants blocked at various steps and chimeric plasmids subcloned from pGLM990, showed that three additional genes (fms8, fms10, and fms13) are present in pGLM990. A gene conferring self-resistance to the antibiotic, which was independently cloned in Streptomyces lividans, using the plasmid vector pIJ702 was also found to be linked to the cluster of biosynthetic genes. Thus, at least ten biosynthetic genes and a self-defense gene are clustered in a chromosomal region of about 27 kb in M. olivasterospora. Interestingly, the fms8 gene which participates in the dehydroxylation step of fortimicin A biosynthesis was found to have homology with a neomycin resistance gene nmrA from the neomycin-producing Micromonospora sp. MK50. Studies using a cell-free extract of the fms8 mutant and its parent strain showed that the enzyme encoded by fms8 phosphorylates a biosynthetic precursor, fortimicin KK1, in the presence of ATP. Thus the dehydroxylation reaction is suggested to occur via the phosphorylation of the target hydroxyl group. DNA regions homologous to fms genes were found in Micromonospora sp. SF-2098 and Dactylosporangium matsuzakiense, both producers of fortimicin group antibiotics.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of pentangular polyphenols: deductions from the benastatin and griseorhodin pathways Abstract: The benastatins, pradimicins, fredericamycins, and members of the griseorhodin/rubromycin family represent a structurally and functionally diverse group of long-chain polyphenols from actinomycetes. Comparison of their biosynthetic gene clusters (ben, prm, fdm, grh, rub) revealed that all loci harbor genes coding for a similar, yet uncharacterized, type of ketoreductases. In a phylogenetic survey of representative KRs involved in type II PKS systems, we found that it is generally possible to deduce the KR regiospecificity (C-9, C-15, C17) from the amino acid sequence and thus to predict the nature of the aromatic polyketide (e.g., angucycline, anthracycline, benzoisochromanequinones). We hypothezised that the new clade of KRs is characteristic for biosynthesis of polyphenols with an extended angular architecture we termed "pentangular". To test this hypothesis, we demonstrated the biogenetic relationship between benastatin and the structurally unrelated spiro ketal griseorhodin by generating a mutant producing collinone, a pentangular pathway intermediate. The benastatin pathway served as a model to characterize the KR. Gene inactivation of benL resulted in the formation of a series of 19-hydroxy benastatin and bequinostatin derivatives (e.g., benastatin K and benastatin L). These results clearly showed that BenL functions as a C-19 KR in pentangular pathways.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide anthelmintic macrolide avermectin in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Analysis of the gene cluster from Streptomyces avermitilis that governs the biosynthesis of the polyketide anthelmintic avermectin revealed that it contains four large ORFs encoding giant multifunctional polypeptides of the avermectin polyketide synthase (AVES 1, AVES 2, AVES 3, and AVES 4). These clustered polyketide synthase genes responsible for avermectin biosynthesis together encode 12 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of polyketide chain elongation. The clustered genes encoding polyketide synthase are organized as two sets of six modular repeats, aveA1-aveA2 and aveA3-aveA4, which are convergently transcribed. The total of 55 constituent active sites makes this the most complex multifunctional enzyme system identified to date. The sequenced DNA region contains 14 additional ORFs, some of which encode polypeptides governing other key steps in avermectin biosynthesis. Between the two sets of polyketide synthase genes lie two genes involved in postpolyketide modification, one of which encodes cynthochrome P450 hydroxylase that probably catalyzes furan ring formation at C6 to C8a. Immediately right of the large polyketide synthase genes is a set of genes involved in oleandrose biosynthesis and its transglycosylation to polyketide-derived aglycons. This cluster includes nine genes, but one is not functional in the biosynthesis of avermectin. On the left side of polyketide synthase genes, two ORFs encoding methyltransferase and nonpolyketide synthase ketoreductase involved in postpolyketide modification are located to the left of the polyketide synthase genes, and an adjacent gene encodes a regulatory function that may be involved in activation of the transcription of avermectin biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy for volumetric and spectral analysis of histological and immunochemical samples Abstract: Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an imaging modality with superb penetration depth and excellent absorption contrast. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that this technique can advance quantitative analysis of conventional chromogenic histochemistry. Because OR-PAM can quantify the absorption contrast at different wavelengths, it is feasible to spectrally resolve the specific biomolecules involved in a staining color. Furthermore, the tomographic capability of OR-PAM allows for noninvasive volumetric imaging of a thick sample without microtoming it. By immunostaining the sample with different chromogenic agents, we further demonstrated the ability of OR-PAM to resolve different types of cells in a coculture sample with imaging depths up to 1 mm. Taken together, the integration of OR-PAM with (immuno)histochemistry offers a simple and versatile technique with broad applications in cell biology, pathology, tissue engineering, and related biomedical studies.	0
Title: Survival of airborne MS2 bacteriophage generated from human saliva, artificial saliva, and cell culture medium Abstract: Laboratory studies of virus aerosols have been criticized for generating airborne viruses from artificial nebulizer suspensions (e.g., cell culture media), which do not mimic the natural release of viruses (e.g., from human saliva). The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus and to compare it with those of artificial saliva and cell culture medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage was diluted in one of three nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected (100 to 450 nm) using a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto gelatin filters. Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle size distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the collected samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry, respectively. For all nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally followed a particle volume distribution rather than a number distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was independent of particle size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer suspension. Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture medium (i.e., 3% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These results indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory results, which often use artificial nebulizer suspensions. To better assess the risk of airborne transmission of viral diseases in real-life situations, the use of natural suspensions such as saliva or respiratory mucus is recommended.	0
Title: Cloning of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of brasilicardin A, a unique diterpenoid Abstract: Brasilicardin A (BCA), produced by Nocardia brasiliensis IFM 0406 (currently referred to as N. terpenica), has a unique structure consisting of a diterpene skeleton with L-rhamnose, N-acetylglucosamine, amino acid, and 3-hydroxybenzoate moieties, and exhibits potent biological activities. To understand the biosynthetic machinery of this unique compound, we have cloned the corresponding gene cluster. Firstly, we cloned a gene by PCR that encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), which produces a direct precursor of diterpene compounds. We obtained four candidate genes and one of the genes was confirmed to encode a GGPPS. By sequence analysis of regions flanking the GGPPS gene, we identified eleven genes (bra1-11), all oriented in the same direction. We did not, however, detect any genes related to L-rhamnose and N-acetylglucosamine biosyntheses in the flanking regions. A gene disruption experiment did indeed show that this gene cluster was responsible for BCA biosynthesis.	1
Title: Three pleiotropic loci associated with bone mineral density and lean body mass Abstract: Both bone mineral density (BMD) and lean body mass (LBM) are important physiological measures with strong genetic determination. Besides, BMD and LBM might have common genetic factors. Aiming to identify pleiotropic genomic loci underlying BMD and LBM, we performed bivariate genome-wide association study meta-analyses of femoral neck bone mineral density and LBM at arms and legs, and replicated in the large-scale UK Biobank cohort sample. Combining the results from discovery meta-analysis and replication sample, we identified three genomic loci at the genome-wide significance level (p < 5.0 × 10-8): 2p23.2 (lead SNP rs4477866, discovery p = 3.47 × 10-8, replication p = 1.03 × 10-4), 16q12.2 (rs1421085, discovery p = 2.04 × 10-9, replication p = 6.47 × 10-14) and 18q21.32 (rs11152213, discovery p = 3.47 × 10-8, replication p = 6.69 × 10-6). Our findings not only provide useful insights into lean mass and bone mass development, but also enhance our understanding of the potential genetic correlation between BMD and LBM.	0
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. II. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of 3-alkoxycarbonylmethoxy-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)-acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: The synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats of 3-alkoxycarbonyl-methoxy-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins (1) are described. In this cephalosporin series, 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(carboxy-methoxyimino)acetamid o] cephalosporins (1b, 1i and 1j) with a lower alkoxycarbonylmethoxy group at the C-3 position of a cephem nucleus exhibited not only potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria but also good oral absorption in rats. Structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Catabolite activator protein-induced DNA bending in transcription initiation Abstract: We describe experiments that enable us to track the presence and direction of the DNA bend induced by Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) through the intermediate stages of transcription initiation at the lac promoter. Transcriptional complexes examined were formed on superhelical templates to enhance specific complex formation, and detected by electrophoretic analysis after restriction digestion. We found that the bend is maintained and even increased upon formation of closed and open complexes. Our results exclude the hypothesis that the energy of the CAP-induced bend is used to promote open complex formation. We now suggest a new model, in which DNA wraps around the CAP-polymerase complex to form a writhing structure equivalent to that at the end of an interwound superhelical domain. Formation of this structure may facilitate open complex formation. We further propose that the stored bend energy may be used to help counteract strong protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, thus assisting the process of RNA polymerase escape from the promoter.	0
Title: Mass spectrometry and the emerging field of glycomics Abstract: The biological significance of protein and lipid glycosylation is well established. For example, cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering glycan structures on their surfaces, and cancer cells evade normal growth regulation in part by remodeling their surface glycans. In general, glycan chemical properties differ significantly from those of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecule metabolites. Thus, advances in glycomics, a comprehensive study to identify all glycans in an organism, rely on the development of specialized analytical methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as an enabling technology in the field of glycomics. This review summarizes recent developments in mass spectrometric analysis methods for protein-based glycomics and glycoproteomics workflows.	0
Title: Composition of bacterial communities associated with natural and laboratory populations of Asobara tabida infected with Wolbachia Abstract: Asobara tabida wasps are fly endoparasitoids that naturally harbor three Wolbachia strains, which induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and control oogenesis. To investigate whether other bacteria play a role in wasp biology, we surveyed the bacterial communities of wild A. tabida populations originating from different regions of France and of laboratory colonies using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culture methods. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were found to be the main phyla represented in these populations. Among these were several cultured and uncultured representatives of the genera Acetobacter, Acidomonas, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Duganella, Herbaspirillum, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. In addition to Wolbachia, wild individuals harbored Rickettsia, which tended to be lost when insects were reared in the laboratory. The antibiotic treatment used to generate wasp sublines singly infected with Wolbachia also affected the overall bacterial composition, with most fingerprint sequences being characteristic of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We also screened for potentially heritable endosymbionts by PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization in stable laboratory lines, with only Wolbachia being consistently found in wasp ovaries.	0
Title: Cryptosporioptide: a bioactive polyketide produced by an endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis sp Abstract: An antibiotic polyketide, Cryptosporioptide (1) was isolated from the culture extract of the endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis sp. The structure of Cryptosporioptide has been established with the help of 1D ((1)H, (13)C), 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, COSY, NOESY) techniques and mass spectrometry (FABMS, HRFABMS). The absolute configuration was established by means of electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Cryptosporioptide exhibited both lipoxygenase inhibitory and anti-Bacillus megaterium activities.	1
Title: Th17 micro-milieu regulates NLRP1-dependent caspase-5 activity in skin autoinflammation Abstract: IL-1β is a potent player in cutaneous inflammation and central for the development of a Th17 micro-milieu in autoinflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Its production is controlled at the transcriptional level and by subsequent posttranslational processing via inflammatory caspases. In this study, we detected inflammatory caspase-5 active in epidermal keratinocytes and in psoriatic skin lesions. Further, interferon-γ and interleukin-17A synergistically induced caspase-5 expression in cultured keratinocytes, which was dependent on the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin (S100A7). However, diseases-relevant triggers for caspase-5 activity and IL-1β production remain unknown. Recently, extranuclear DNA has been identified as danger-signals abundant in the psoriatic epidermis. Here, we could demonstrate that cytosolic double-stranded (ds) DNA transfected into keratinocytes triggered the activation of caspase-5 and the release of IL-1β. Further, interleukin-17A promoted caspase-5 function via facilitation of the NLRP1-inflammasome. Anti-inflammatory vitamin D interfered with the IL-1β release and suppressed caspase-5 in keratinocytes and in psoriatic skin lesions. Our data link the disease-intrinsic danger signals psoriasin (S100A7) and dsDNA for NLPR1-dependent caspase-5 activity in psoriasis providing potential therapeutic targets in Th17-mediated skin autoinflammation.	0
Title: Alternative epimerization in C(7)N-aminocyclitol biosynthesis is catalyzed by ValD, a large protein of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily Abstract: Gene valD, encodes a large vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily protein, has been identified in the validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Inactivation of valD significantly reduced validamycin A production, which was fully restored with the full-length valD and partially restored with either N-terminal or C-terminal half by complementation. Heterologously expressed ValD catalyzed the epimerization of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone to 5-epi-valiolone. This metalloenzyme is a homodimer with a metal ion-binding ratio of 0.73 mol/mole protein toward Fe(2+), Mn(2+), Ni(2+), and Zn(2+). Individual and combined site-directed mutations of eight putative active site residues revealed that the N-terminal H44/E107 and the C-terminal H315/E366 are more critical for the activity than the internal H130, E183, H229, and E291. Our data have established ValD as one of the largest proteins of the VOC superfamily, catalyzing an alternative epimerization for C(7)N-aminocyclitol biosynthesis.	1
Title: Binding of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides and synthetic oligomannose clusters to human antibody 2G12: implications for HIV-1 vaccine design Abstract: Human antibody 2G12 broadly neutralizes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates and shows protective activity against viral challenge in animal models. Previous mutational analysis suggested that 2G12 recognized a novel cluster of high-mannose type oligosaccharides on HIV-1 gp120. To explore the carbohydrate antigen for HIV-1 vaccine design, we have studied the binding of 2G12 to an array of HIV-1 high-mannose type oligosaccharides by competitive ELISAs and found that Man9GlcNAc is 210- and 74-fold more effective than Man5GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc in binding to 2G12. The results establish that the larger high-mannose oligosaccharide on HIV-1 is the favorable subunit for 2G12 recognition. To mimic the putative epitope of 2G12, we have created scaffold-based multivalent Man9 clusters and found that the galactose-scaffolded bi-, tri-, and tetra-valent Man9 clusters are 7-, 22-, and 73-fold more effective in binding to 2G12 than the monomeric Man9GlcNAc2Asn. The experimental data shed light on further structural optimization of epitope mimics for developing a carbohydrate-based HIV-1 vaccine.	0
Title: Hydrologic variability governs population dynamics of a vulnerable amphibian in an arid environment Abstract: Dynamics of many amphibian populations are governed by the distribution and availability of water. Therefore, understanding the hydrological mechanisms that explain spatial and temporal variation in occupancy and abundance will improve our ability to conserve and recover populations of vulnerable amphibians. We used 16 years of survey data from intermittent mountain streams in the Sonoran Desert to evaluate how availability of surface water affected survival and adult recruitment of a threatened amphibian, the lowland leopard frog (Lithobates yavapaiensis). Across the entire study period, monthly survival of adults ranged from 0.72 to 0.99 during summer and 0.59 to 0.94 during winter and increased with availability of surface water (Z = 7.66; P < 0.01). Recruitment of frogs into the adult age class occurred primarily during winter and ranged from 1.9 to 3.8 individuals/season/pool; like survival, recruitment increased with availability of surface water (Z = 3.67; P < 0.01). Although abundance of frogs varied across seasons and years, we found no evidence of a systematic trend during the 16-year study period. Given the strong influence of surface water on population dynamics of leopard frogs, conservation of many riparian obligates in this and similar arid regions likely depends critically on minimizing threats to structures and ecosystem processes that maintain surface waters. Understanding the influence of surface-water availability on riparian organisms is particularly important because climate change is likely to decrease precipitation and increase ambient temperatures in desert riparian systems, both of which have the potential to alter fundamentally the hydrology of these systems.	0
Title: The antiparasitic compound licochalcone a is a potent echinocytogenic agent that modifies the erythrocyte membrane in the concentration range where antiplasmodial activity is observed Abstract: The well-known antiparasitic compound licochalcone A is a potent membrane-active agent that transforms normal erythrocytes into echinocytes in parallel with the inhibition of growth of Plasmodium falciparum cultures, the in vitro antiplasmodial effect apparently being an indirect effect on the host cell. In vitro experiments with synchronous cultures demonstrate that inhibition of invasion is the principal mechanism of growth inhibition. The erythrocyte membrane-modifying effect was also transiently observed in vivo in mice after intravenous administration.	0
Title: The granaticin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22: sequence analysis and expression in a heterologous host Abstract: Background:                       The granaticins are members of the benzoisochromanequinone class of aromatic polyketides, the best known member of which is actinorhodin made by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Genetic analysis of this class of compounds has played a major role in the development of hypotheses about the way in which aromatic polyketide synthases (PKSs) control product structure. Although the granaticin nascent polyketide is identical to that of actinorhodin, post-PKS steps involve different pyran-ring stereochemistry and glycosylation. Comparison of the complete gene clusters for the two metabolites is therefore of great interest.                  Results:                       The entire granaticin gene cluster (the gra cluster) from Streptomyces violaceoruber T-22 was cloned on either of two overlapping cosmids and expressed in the heterologous host, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), strain CH999. Chemical analysis of the recombinant strains demonstrated production of granaticin, granaticin B, dihydrogranaticin and dihydrogranaticin B, which are the four known metabolites of S. violaceoruber. Analysis of the complete 39,250 base pair sequence of the insert of one of the cosmids, pOJ466-22-24, revealed 37 complete open reading frames (ORFs), 15 of which resemble ORFs from the act (actinorhodin) gene cluster of S. coelicolor A3(2). Among the rest, nine resemble ORFs potentially involved in deoxysugar metabolism from Streptomyces spp. and other bacteria, and six resemble regulatory ORFs.                  Conclusions:                       On the basis of these resemblances, putative functional assignments of the products of most of the newly discovered ORFs were made, including those of genes involved in the PKS and tailoring steps in the biosynthesis of the granaticin aglycone, steps in the deoxy sugar pathway, and putative regulatory and export functions.	1
Title: Complete nucleotide sequence of pCTX-M360, an intermediate plasmid between pEL60 and pCTX-M3, from a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in China Abstract: In this work we report the characterization of plasmid pCTX-M360, isolated from a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from China and encoding the CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Sequence analysis of pCTX-M360 revealed extensive similarity with pEL60 and pCTX-M3, two other enterobacterial plasmids of the IncL/M incompatibility group. Compared to pEL60, pCTX-M360 contains several insertions but lacks most of a 27-kb insert found in pCTX-M3, suggesting that it could be an evolutionary intermediate between pEL60 and pCTX-M3.	0
Title: The thermostable alpha-L-rhamnosidase RamA of Clostridium stercorarium: biochemical characterization and primary structure of a bacterial alpha-L-rhamnoside hydrolase, a new type of inverting glycoside hydrolase Abstract: An alpha-L-rhamnosidase clone was isolated from a genomic library of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Clostridium stercorarium and its primary structure was determined. The recombinant gene product, RamA, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is a dimer of two identical subunits with a monomeric molecular mass of 95 kDa in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At pH 7.5 it is optimally active at 60 degrees C and insensitive to moderate concentrations of Triton X100, ethanol and EDTA. It hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, naringin and hesperidin with a specific activity of 82, 1.5 and 0.46 U mg-1 respectively. Hydrolysis occurs by inversion of the anomeric configuration as detected using 1H-NMR, indicating a single displacement mechanism. Naringin was hydrolysed to rhamnose and prunin, which could further be degraded by incubation with a thermostable beta-glucosidase. The secondary structure of RamA consists of 27% alpha-helices and 50% beta-sheets, as detected by circular dichroism. The primary structure of the ramA gene has no similarity to other glycoside hydrolase sequences and possibly is the first member of a new enzyme family.	0
Title: Highly thermostable endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (laminarinase) LamA from Thermotoga neapolitana: nucleotide sequence of the gene and characterization of the recombinant gene product Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of clone pTT26 (3786 bp), containing the gene for 1,3-beta-glucanase LamA (laminarinase) from Thermotoga neapolitana, was determined. It contains an ORF encoding a protein of 646 aa (73328 Da). The central part of the protein is homologous to the complete catalytic domain of bacterial and some eukaryotic endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanases and belongs to family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases. This domain is flanked on both sides by one copy on each side of a substrate binding domain homologue (family II). The recombinant laminarinase protein was purified from Escherichia coli host cells in two forms, a 73 kDa and a processed 52 kDa protein, both having high specific activity towards laminarin (3100 and 2600 U mg-1, respectively) and K(m) values of 2.8 and 2.2 mg ml-1, respectively. Limited activity on 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan (lichenan) was detected (90 U mg-1). Laminarin was degraded in an endoglucanase modus, yielding glucose, laminaribiose and -triose as end products. Thus LamA classifies as an endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6). The optimum temperature of the enzymes was 95 degrees C (73 kDa) and 85 degrees C (52 kDa) at an optimum pH of 6.2. The superior thermostability of the 73 kDa enzyme is demonstrated by incubation without substrate at 100 degrees C, where 57% of the initial activity remained after 30 min (82% at 95 degrees C). Thus, LamA is the most thermostable 1,3-beta-glucanase described to date.	0
Title: Moso Bamboo Invasion Reshapes Community Structure of Denitrifying Bacteria in Rhizosphere of Alsophila spinulosa Abstract: The uncontrolled invasion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) dramatically alters soil nitrogen cycling and destroys the natural habitat of Alsophila spinulosa. Nevertheless, no clear evidence points out the role of denitrifying bacteria in the invasion of bamboo into the habitat of A. spinulosa. In the present study, we found that low (importance value 0.0008), moderate (0.6551), and high (0.9326) bamboo invasions dramatically altered the underground root biomass of both P. pubescens and A. spinulosa. The root biomass of A. spinulosa was maximal at moderate invasion, indicating that intermediate disturbance might contribute to the growth and survival of the colonized plant. Successful bamboo invasion significantly increased rhizospheric soil available nitrogen content of A. spinulosa, coupled with elevated denitrifying bacterial abundance and diversity. Shewanella, Chitinophaga, and Achromobacter were the primary genera in the three invasions, whereas high bamboo invasion harbored more denitrifying bacteria and higher abundance than moderate and low invasions. Further correlation analysis found that most soil denitrifying bacteria were positively correlated with soil organic matter and available nitrogen but negatively correlated with pH and water content. In addition, our findings illustrated that two denitrifying bacteria, Chitinophaga and Sorangium, might be essential indicators for evaluating the effects of bamboo invasion on the growth of A. spinulosa. Collectively, this study found that moso bamboo invasion could change the nitrogen cycling of colonized habitats through alterations of denitrifying bacteria and provided valuable perspectives for profound recognizing the invasive impacts and mechanisms of bamboo expansion.	0
Title: Remarkably different structures and reaction mechanisms of ketoreductases for the opposite stereochemical control in the biosynthesis of BIQ antibiotics Abstract: Two ketoreductases, RED1 and RED2, are involved in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and dihydrogranaticin in S. violaceoruber Tu22, respectively. They are responsible for the stereospecific reductions of the bicyclic intermediate to give (S)- or (R)-DNPA, although there is no similarity between their amino acid sequences. Biotransformation using synthetic analogous substrates revealed that the substrate specificities are quite different. Homology modelling studies and site directed mutagenesis showed remarkable differences in three-dimensional structures and catalytic mechanisms between RED1 and RED2.	1
Title: Activation of a Cryptic Gene Cluster in Lysobacter enzymogenes Reveals a Module/Domain Portable Mechanism of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases in the Biosynthesis of Pyrrolopyrazines Abstract: Lysobacter are considered "peptide specialists". However, many of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes are silent. Three new compounds were identified from L. enzymogenes upon activating the six-module-containing led cluster by the strong promoter PHSAF. Although ledD was the first gene under PHSAF control, the second gene ledE was expressed the highest. Targeted gene inactivation showed that the two-module LedE and the one-module LedF were selectively used in pyrrolopyrazine biosynthesis, revealing a module/domain portable mechanism.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of chiral triscatechol siderophores with enantiomeric Fe(iii) coordination Abstract: Ferric complexes of triscatechol siderophores may assume one of two enantiomeric configurations at the iron site. Chirality is known to be important in the iron uptake process, however an understanding of the molecular features directing stereospecific coordination remains ambiguous. Synthesis of the full suite of (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 macrolactone diastereomers, which includes the siderophore cyclic trichrysobactin (CTC), enables the effects that the chirality of Lys and Ser residues exert on the configuration of the Fe(iii) complex to be defined. Computationally optimized geometries indicate that the Λ/Δ configurational preferences are set by steric interactions between the Lys sidechains and the peptide backbone. The ability of each (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 diastereomer to form a stable Fe(iii) complex prompted a genomic search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the synthesis of these diastereomers in microbes. The genome of the plant pathogen Dickeya chrysanthemi EC16 was sequenced and the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of CTC were identified. A related but distinct BGC was identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Yersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641; isolation of the siderophore from Y. frederiksenii ATCC 33641, named frederiksenibactin (FSB), revealed the triscatechol oligoester, linear-(DHBLLysLSer)3. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy establishes that Fe(iii)-CTC and Fe(iii)-FSB are formed in opposite enantiomeric configuration, consistent with the results of the ferric complexes of the cyclic (DHBL/DLysL/DSer)3 diastereomers.	1
Title: High-level expression and characterization of an anti-VEGF165 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in Escherichia coli Abstract: Antibodies currently constitute the most rapidly growing class of human therapeutics; however, the high-yield production of recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments is a real challenge. High expression of active single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) in Escherichia coli has not been successful, as the protein contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds that are difficult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. To solve this problem, we fused the scFv gene against VEGF165 with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by synthesizing an artificial SUMO-scFv fusion gene that was highly expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain. The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO-scFv, was up to 28.5% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to obtain the native scFv, which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The result of the high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the purity of the recombinant cleaved scFv was greater than 98%. The primary structure of the purified scFv was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis. In vitro activity assay demonstrated that the recombinant scFv could dose-dependently inhibit VEGF165-induced human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell proliferation. The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant scFv with native sequences.	0
Title: Nonactin biosynthesis: the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster contains type II polyketide synthase-like genes Abstract: Nonactin is the parent compound of a group of highly atypical polyketide metabolites produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. In this paper we describe the isolation, sequencing, and analysis of 15¿ omitted¿559 bp of chromosomal DNA, containing the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster, from S. griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. Fourteen open reading frames were observed in the DNA sequence. Significantly, type II polyketide synthase (PKS) homologues were discovered in an apparent operon structure, which also contained the nonactate synthase gene (nonS), clustered with the tetranactin resistance gene. The deduced products of two of the genes (nonK and nonJ) are quite unusual ketoacyl synthase (KAS) alpha and KASbeta homologues. We speculate that nonactic acid, the polyketide precursor of nonactin, is synthesized by a type II PKS system.	1
Title: Genetics of xanthan production in Xanthomonas campestris: the xanA and xanB genes are involved in UDP-glucose and GDP-mannose biosynthesis Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of a 3.4-kb EcoRI-PstI DNA fragment of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris revealed two open reading frames, which were designated xanA and xanB. The genes xanA and xanB encode proteins of 448 amino acids (molecular weight of 48,919) and 466 amino acids (molecular weight of 50,873), respectively. These genes were identified by analyzing insertion mutants which were known to be involved in xanthan production. Specific tests for the activities of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-glucose and GDP-mannose indicated that the xanA gene product was involved in the biosynthesis of both glucose 1-phosphate and mannose 1-phosphate. The deduced amino acid sequence of xanB showed a significant degree of homology (59%) to the phosphomannose isomerase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of alginate. Moreover, biochemical analysis and complementation experiments with the Escherichia coli manA fragment revealed that xanB encoded a bifunctional enzyme, phosphomannose isomerase-GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase.	1
Title: Synthesis and succinylation of subtilin-like lantibiotics are strongly influenced by glucose and transition state regulator AbrB Abstract: Subtilin and the closely related entianin are class I lantibiotics produced by different subspecies of Bacillus subtilis. Both molecules are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics with unusual ring structures. Subtilin-like lantibiotics develop strong antibiotic activities against various Gram-positive organisms with an efficiency similar to that of nisin from Lactococcus lactis. In contrast to nisin, subtilin-like lantibiotics partially undergo an additional posttranslational modification, where the N-terminal tryptophan residue becomes succinylated, resulting in drastically reduced antibiotic activities. A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based quantification method enabled us to determine entianin and succinylated entianin (S-entianin) concentrations in the supernatant during growth. We show that entianin synthesis and the degree of succinylation drastically change with culture conditions. In particular, increasing glucose concentrations resulted in higher entianin amounts and lower proportions of S-entianin in Landy-based media. In contrast, no succinylation was observed in medium A with 10% glucose. Interestingly, glucose retarded the expression of entianin biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, deletion of the transition state regulator AbrB resulted in a 6-fold increased entianin production in medium A with 10% glucose. This shows that entianin biosynthesis in B. subtilis is strongly influenced by glucose, in addition to its regulation by the transition state regulator AbrB. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying the succinylation of subtilin-like lantibiotics is enzymatically catalyzed and occurs in the extracellular space or at the cellular membrane.	1
Title: SAM/SAH Analogs as Versatile Tools for SAM-Dependent Methyltransferases Abstract: S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is a sulfonium molecule with a structural hybrid of methionine and adenosine. As the second largest cofactor in the human body, its major function is to serve as methyl donor for SAM-dependent methyltransferases (MTases). The resultant transmethylation of biomolecules constitutes a significant biochemical mechanism in epigenetic regulation, cellular signaling, and metabolite degradation. Recently, numerous SAM analogs have been developed as synthetic cofactors to transfer the activated groups on MTase substrates for downstream ligation and identification. Meanwhile, new compounds built upon or derived from the SAM scaffold have been designed and tested as selective inhibitors for important MTase targets. Here, we summarized the recent development and application of SAM analogs as chemical biology tools for MTases.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor rebeccamycin: characterization and generation of indolocarbazole derivatives Abstract: Rebeccamycin, a halogenated natural product of the indolocarbazole family, is produced by Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes ATCC39243. Several rebeccamycin analogues, which target DNA topoisomerase I or II, have already entered clinical trials as anticancer drugs. Using as a probe an internal fragment of ngt, a Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes gene encoding an indolocarbazole N-glycosyltransferase, we isolated a DNA region that directed the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin when introduced into Streptomyces albus. Sequence analysis of 25.6 kb revealed genes for indolocarbazole core formation, halogenation, glycosylation, and sugar methylation, as well as a regulatory gene and two resistance/secretion genes. Heterologous expression of subsets of these genes resulted in production of deschloro-rebeccamycin, 4'-demethyldeschloro-rebeccamycin, and deschloro-rebeccamycin aglycone. The cloned genes should help to elucidate the molecular basis for indolocarbazole biosynthesis and set the stage for the generation of novel indolocarbazole analogues by genetic engineering.	1
Title: The recombination genes addAB are not restricted to gram-positive bacteria: genetic analysis of the recombination initiation enzymes RecF and AddAB in Rhizobium etli Abstract: Single-strand gaps (SSGs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the major initiation sites for recombination. In bacteria, the SSGs are repaired by RecFOR, while the DSBs are processed by RecBCD in gram-negative bacteria and AddAB in gram-positive bacteria. Unexpectedly, instead of recBCD genes, the addAB genes were found in members of the alpha-proteobacteria group (gram negative). Taking Rhizobium etli as a model, the role of recF and addAB genes in homologous recombination and repair of damaged DNA was evaluated. Inactivation of either recF or addA provoked strong sensitivity to UV radiation and mitomycin C, while an additive effect was observed in the recF-addA mutant. The DSBs generated by nalidixic acid caused low viability only in the addA mutant. The recombination frequency of large and small plasmids was reduced in the recF mutant (24- and 36-fold, respectively), whereas a slight decrease (threefold) in the addA mutant was observed. Moreover, an additive effect (47- and 90-fold, respectively) was observed in the double mutant, but it was not as dramatic as that in a recA mutant. Interestingly, the frequency of deletion and Campbell-type recombination was slightly affected in either single or double mutants. These results suggest that another pathway exists that allows plasmid and Campbell-type recombination in the absence of recF and addA genes.	0
Title: Temporal and spatial regulation of microRNA activity with photoactivatable cantimirs Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play numerous important roles in physiology and human diseases. During animal development, many miRNAs are expressed continuously from early embryos throughout adults, yet it is unclear whether these miRNAs are actually required at all the stages of development. Current techniques of manipulating microRNA function lack the required spatial and temporal resolution to adequately address the functionality of a given microRNA at a specific time or at single-cell resolution. To examine stage- or cell-specific function of miRNA during development and to achieve precise control of miRNA activity, we have developed photoactivatable antisense oligonucleotides against miRNAs. These caged oligonucleotides can be activated with 365 nm light with extraordinarily high efficiency to release potent antisense reagents to inhibit miRNAs. Initial application of these caged antimirs in a model organism (C. elegans) revealed that the activity of a miRNA (lsy-6) is required specifically around the comma stage during embryonic development to control a left/right asymmetric differentiation program in the C. elegans nervous system. This suggests that a transient input of lsy-6 during development is sufficient to specify the neuronal cell fate.	0
Title: Modulation of the growth and metabolic response of cyanobacteria by the multifaceted activity of naringenin Abstract: The interactions between the plant-derived bioflavonoid, naringenin, and prokaryotic microalgae representatives (cyanobacteria), were investigated with respect to its influence on the growth and metabolic response of these microorganisms. To achieve reliable results, the growth of cyanobacteria was determined based on measurements of chlorophyll content, morphological changes were assessed through microscopic observations, and the chemical response of cells was determined using liquid and gas chromatography (HPLC; GC-FID). The results show that micromolar levels of naringenin stimulated the growth of cyanobacteria. Increased growth was observed for halophilic strains at naringenin concentrations below 40 mg L-1, and in freshwater strains at concentrations below 20 mg L-1. The most remarkable stimulation was observed for the freshwater species Nostoc muscorum, which had a growth rate that was up to 60% higher than in the control. When naringenin was examined at concentrations above 40 mg L-1, the growth of the tested microorganisms was inhibited. Simultaneously, an intensive excretion of exopolysaccharides was observed. Microscopic observations strongly suggest that these effects resulted from a structural disturbance of cyanobacterial cell walls that was exerted by naringenin. This phenomenon, in combination with the absorption of naringenin into cell wall structures, influenced cell permeability and thus the growth of bacteria. Fortunately, almost all the naringenin added to the culture was incorporated into to cell substructures and could be recovered through extraction, raising the possibility that this modulator could be recycled.	0
Title: The siRNAsome: A Cation-Free and Versatile Nanostructure for siRNA and Drug Co-delivery Abstract: Nanoparticles show great potential for drug delivery. However, suitable nanostructures capable of loading a range of drugs together with the co-delivery of siRNAs, which avoid the problem of cation-associated cytotoxicity, are lacking. Herein, we report an small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based vesicle (siRNAsome), which consists of a hydrophilic siRNA shell, a thermal- and intracellular-reduction-sensitive hydrophobic median layer, and an empty aqueous interior that meets this need. The siRNAsome can serve as a versatile nanostructure to load drug agents with divergent chemical properties, therapeutic proteins as well as co-delivering immobilized siRNAs without transfection agents. Importantly, the inherent thermal/reduction-responsiveness enables controlled drug loading and release. When siRNAsomes are loaded with the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride and anti-P-glycoprotein siRNA, synergistic therapeutic activity is achieved in multidrug resistant cancer cells and a tumor model.	0
Title: The crystal structure of the novobiocin biosynthetic enzyme NovP: the first representative structure for the TylF O-methyltransferase superfamily Abstract: NovP is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. Specifically, it methylates at 4-OH of the noviose moiety, and the resultant methoxy group is important for the potency of the mature antibiotic: previous crystallographic studies have shown that this group interacts directly with the target enzyme DNA gyrase, which is a validated drug target. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of NovP from Streptomyces spheroides as a binary complex with its desmethylated cosubstrate S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. The structure displays a typical class I methyltransferase fold, in addition to motifs that are consistent with a divalent-metal-dependent mechanism. This is the first representative structure of a methyltransferase from the TylF superfamily, which includes a number of enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other therapeutics. The NovP structure reveals a number of distinctive structural features that, based on sequence conservation, are likely to be characteristic of the superfamily. These include a helical 'lid' region that gates access to the cosubstrate binding pocket and an active center that contains a 3-Asp putative metal binding site. A further conserved Asp likely acts as the general base that initiates the reaction by deprotonating the 4-OH group of the noviose unit. Using in silico docking, we have generated models of the enzyme-substrate complex that are consistent with the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, these models suggest that NovP is unlikely to tolerate significant modifications at the noviose moiety, but could show increasing substrate promiscuity as a function of the distance of the modification from the methylation site. These observations could inform future attempts to utilize NovP for methylating a range of glycosylated compounds.	1
Title: Pseudomonas corrugata crpCDE is part of the cyclic lipopeptide corpeptin biosynthetic gene cluster and is involved in bacterial virulence in tomato and in hypersensitive response in Nicotiana benthamiana Abstract: Pseudomonas corrugata CFBP 5454 produces two kinds of cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs), cormycin A and corpeptins, both of which possess surfactant, antimicrobial and phytotoxic activities. In this study, we identified genes coding for a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and an ABC-type transport system involved in corpeptin production. These genes belong to the same transcriptional unit, designated crpCDE. The genetic organization of this locus is highly similar to other Pseudomonas CLP biosynthetic clusters. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis revealed that transporter and synthetase genomic knock-out mutants were unable to produce corpeptins, but continued to produce cormycin A. This suggests that CrpCDE is the only system involved in corpeptin production in P. corrugata CFBP 5454. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CrpE ABC transporter clustered with the transporters of CLPs with a long peptide chain. Strains depleted in corpeptin production were significantly less virulent than the wild-type strain when inoculated in tomato plants and induced only chlorosis when infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Thus, corpeptins are important effectors of P. corrugata interaction with plants. Expression analysis revealed that crpC transcription occurs at high cell density. Two LuxR transcriptional regulators, PcoR and RfiA, have a pivotal role in crpC expression and thus in corpeptin production.	1
Title: Determination of biomass by ultrasonic measurements Abstract: The quantitative determination of biomass in a suspension by means of ultrasound velocity is a simple and on-line-applicable method. Such an ultrasonic sensor offers the advantage of being long-term stable, reliable, and sterilizable. In this paper we present sound velocity measurements made with different microorganisms. The experimental results which we have obtained with an impulse-echo method will be compared with theoretical predictions and discussed with respect to previous findings (Y. Ishimori, I. Karube, and S. Suzuki, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42:632-637, 1981).	0
Title: Quantitative glycomics from fluidic glycan microarrays Abstract: A hallmark of cell-surface processes involving glycans is their multivalent interaction with glycan binding proteins (GBPs). Such a multivalent interaction depends critically on the mobility and density of signaling molecules on the membrane surface. While glycan microarrays have been used in exploring multivalent interactions, the lack of mobility and the difficulty in controlling surface density both limit their quantitative applications. Here we apply a fluidic glycan microarray, with glycan density varying for orders of magnitude, to profile cell surface interaction using a model system, the adhesion of Escherichia coli to mannose. We show the quantitative determination of monovalent and multivalent adhesion channels; the latter can be inhibited by nanopartices presenting a high density of mannosyl groups. These results reveal a new E. coli adhesion mechanism: the switching in the FimH adhesion protein avidity from monovalent to multivalent as the density of mobile mannosyl groups increases; such avidity switching enhances binding affinity and triggers multiple fimbriae anchoring. Affinity enhancement toward FimH has only been observed before for oligo-mannose due to the turn on of secondary interactions outside the mannose binding pocket. We suggest that the new mechanism revealed by the fluidic microarray is of general significance to cell surface interactions: the dynamic clustering of simple sugar groups (homogeneous or heterogeneous) on the fluidic membrane surface may simulate the functions of complex glycan molecules.	0
Title: Korormicin, a novel antibiotic specifically active against marine gram-negative bacteria, produced by a marine bacterium Abstract: A novel antibiotic named korormicin was isolated from the marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas sp. F-420. This strain was isolated from the surface of a macro alga Halimeda sp. collected from Palau (the Republic of Belau). The planar structure of korormicin was determined by the result of 2D NMR studies and mass spectral data. Korormicin had specific inhibitory activity against marine Gram-negative bacteria, but was inactive against terrestrial microorganisms.	0
Title: Anaerobic oxidization of methane in a minerotrophic peatland: enrichment of nitrite-dependent methane-oxidizing bacteria Abstract: The importance of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) as a methane sink in freshwater systems is largely unexplored, particularly in peat ecosystems. Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) was recently discovered and reported to be catalyzed by the bacterium "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera," which is affiliated with the NC10 phylum. So far, several "Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera" enrichment cultures have been obtained using a limited number of freshwater sediments or wastewater treatment sludge as the inoculum. In this study, using stable isotope measurements and porewater profiles, we investigated the potential of n-damo in a minerotrophic peatland in the south of the Netherlands that is infiltrated by nitrate-rich ground water. Methane and nitrate profiles suggested that all methane produced was oxidized before reaching the oxic layer, and NC10 bacteria could be active in the transition zone where countergradients of methane and nitrate occur. Quantitative PCR showed high NC10 bacterial cell numbers at this methane-nitrate transition zone. This soil section was used to enrich the prevalent NC10 bacteria in a continuous culture supplied with methane and nitrite at an in situ pH of 6.2. An enrichment of nitrite-reducing methanotrophic NC10 bacteria was successfully obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of retrieved 16S rRNA and pmoA genes showed that the enriched bacteria were very similar to the ones found in situ and constituted a new branch of NC10 bacteria with an identity of less than 96 and 90% to the 16S rRNA and pmoA genes of "Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera," respectively. The results of this study expand our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of NC10 bacteria in the environment and highlight their potential contribution to nitrogen and methane cycles.	0
Title: A cryptic type I polyketide synthase (cpk) gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: The chromosome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a model organism for the genus Streptomyces, contains a cryptic type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster which was revealed when the genome was sequenced. The ca. 54-kb cluster contains three large genes, cpkA, cpkB and cpkC, encoding the PKS subunits. In silico analysis showed that the synthase consists of a loading module, five extension modules and a unique reductase as a terminal domain instead of a typical thioesterase. All acyltransferase domains are specific for a malonyl extender, and have a B-type ketoreductase. Tailoring and regulatory genes were also identified within the gene cluster. Surprisingly, some genes show high similarity to primary metabolite genes not commonly identified in any antibiotic biosynthesis cluster. Using western blot analysis with a PKS subunit (CpkC) antibody, CpkC was shown to be expressed in S. coelicolor at transition phase. Disruption of cpkC gave no obvious phenotype.	1
Title: From root to fruit: RNA-Seq analysis shows that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis may affect tomato fruit metabolism Abstract: Background:                       Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) establishes a beneficial symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The formation of the mycorrhizal association in the roots leads to plant-wide modulation of gene expression. To understand the systemic effect of the fungal symbiosis on the tomato fruit, we used RNA-Seq to perform global transcriptome profiling on Moneymaker tomato fruits at the turning ripening stage.                  Results:                       Fruits were collected at 55 days after flowering, from plants colonized with Funneliformis mosseae and from control plants, which were fertilized to avoid responses related to nutrient deficiency. Transcriptome analysis identified 712 genes that are differentially expressed in fruits from mycorrhizal and control plants. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these genes showed 81 overrepresented functional GO classes. Up-regulated GO classes include photosynthesis, stress response, transport, amino acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism functions, suggesting a general impact of fungal symbiosis on primary metabolisms and, particularly, on mineral nutrition. Down-regulated GO classes include cell wall, metabolism and ethylene response pathways. Quantitative RT-PCR validated the RNA-Seq results for 12 genes out of 14 when tested at three fruit ripening stages, mature green, breaker and turning. Quantification of fruit nutraceutical and mineral contents produced values consistent with the expression changes observed by RNA-Seq analysis.                  Conclusions:                       This RNA-Seq profiling produced a novel data set that explores the intersection of mycorrhization and fruit development. We found that the fruits of mycorrhizal plants show two transcriptomic "signatures": genes characteristic of a climacteric fleshy fruit, and genes characteristic of mycorrhizal status, like phosphate and sulphate transporters. Moreover, mycorrhizal plants under low nutrient conditions produce fruits with a nutrient content similar to those from non-mycorrhizal plants under high nutrient conditions, indicating that AM fungi can help replace exogenous fertilizer for fruit crops.	0
Title: Biosynthetic characterization and biochemical features of the third natural nisin variant, nisin Q, produced by Lactococcus lactis 61-14 Abstract: Aims:                       To characterize the genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q.                  Methods and results:                       The nisin Q gene cluster was sequenced, and 11 putative orfs having 82% homology with the nisin A biosynthesis gene cluster were identified. Nisin Q production was confirmed from the nisQ-introduced nisin Z producer. In the reporter assay, nisin Q exhibited an induction level that was threefold lower than that of nisin A. Nisin Q demonstrated an antimicrobial spectrum similar to those of the other nisins. Under oxidizing conditions, nisin Q retained a higher level of activity than nisin A. This higher oxidative tolerance could be attributed to the presence of only one methionine residue in nisin Q, in contrast to other nisins that contain two.                  Conclusions:                       The 11 orfs of the nisin producers were identical with regard to their functions. The antimicrobial spectra of the three natural nisins were similar. Nisin Q demonstrated higher oxidative tolerance than nisin A.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q are similar to those of other variants. Moreover, owing to its higher oxidative tolerance, nisin Q is a potential alternative for nisin A.	1
Title: Anti-HIV Tigliane-Type Diterpenoids from the Aerial Parts of Wikstroemia lichiangensis Abstract: Tigliane-type diterpenoids have attracted much attention in drug discovery since they have been reported to exhibit remarkable biological effects, such as tumor-promoting, antineoplastic, and anti-HIV activities. In continuing our efforts to discover novel biologically important diterpenoids from Wikstroemia species, Wikstroemia lichiangensis was investigated phytochemically for the first time. As a result, four new (1-4) and one known (5) tigliane-type diterpenoid were isolated, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. Tiglianes (1-5) showed potent anti-HIV activity against HIV-1 infection of MT4 lymphocytes with IC50 values of 1.1-65.4 nM.	0
Title: Dark Hydrazone Fluorescence Labeling Agents Enable Imaging of Cellular Aldehydic Load Abstract: Aldehydes are key intermediates in many cellular processes, from endogenous metabolic pathways like glycolysis to undesired exogenously induced processes such as lipid peroxidation and DNA interstrand cross-linking. Alkyl aldehydes are well documented to be cytotoxic, affecting the functions of DNA and protein, and their levels are tightly regulated by the oxidative enzyme ALDH2. Mutations in this enzyme are associated with cardiac damage, diseases such as Fanconi anemia (FA), and cancer. Many attempts have been made to identify and quantify the overall level of these alkyl aldehydes inside cells, yet there are few practical methods available to detect and monitor these volatile aldehydes in real time. Here, we describe a multicolor fluorogenic hydrazone transfer ("DarkZone") system to label alkyl aldehydes, yielding up to 30-fold light-up response in vitro. A cell-permeant DarkZone dye design was applied to detect small-molecule aldehydes in the cellular environment. The new dye design also enabled the monitoring of cellular acetaldehyde production from ethanol over time by flow cytometry, demonstrating the utility of the DarkZone dyes for measuring and imaging the aldehydic load related to human disease.	0
Title: Inorganic phosphate self-sufficient whole-cell biocatalysts containing two co-expressed phosphorylases facilitate cellobiose production Abstract: Cellobiose, a natural disaccharide, attracts extensive attention as a potential functional food/feed additive. In this study, we present an inorganic phosphate (Pi) self-sufficient biotransformation system to produce cellobiose by co-expressing sucrose phosphorylase (SP) and cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP). The Bifidobacterium adolescentis SP (BASP) and Cellvibrio gilvus CBP (CGCBP) were co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli cells containing BASP and CGCBP were used as whole-cell catalysts to convert sucrose and glucose to cellobiose. The effects of reaction pH, temperature, Pi concentration, and substrate concentration were investigated. In the optimum biotransformation conditions, 800 mM cellobiose was produced from 1.0 M sucrose, 1.0 M glucose, and 50 mM Pi, within 12 hr. The by-product fructose and residual substrate (sucrose and glucose) were efficiently removed by treatment with yeast, to help purify the product cellobiose. The wider applicability of this Pi self-sufficiency strategy was demonstrated in the production of laminaribiose by co-expressing SP and laminaribiose phosphorylase. This study suggests that the Pi self-sufficiency strategy through co-expressing two phosphorylases has the advantage of great flexibility for enhanced production of cellobiose (or laminaribiose).	0
Title: Structural basis of functional group activation by sulfotransferases in complex metabolic pathways Abstract: Sulfated molecules with diverse functions are common in biology, but sulfonation as a method to activate a metabolite for chemical catalysis is rare. Catalytic activity was characterized and crystal structures were determined for two such "activating" sulfotransferases (STs) that sulfonate β-hydroxyacyl thioester substrates. The CurM polyketide synthase (PKS) ST domain from the curacin A biosynthetic pathway of Moorea producens and the olefin synthase (OLS) ST from a hydrocarbon-producing system of Synechococcus PCC 7002 both occur as a unique acyl carrier protein (ACP), ST, and thioesterase (TE) tridomain within a larger polypeptide. During pathway termination, these cyanobacterial systems introduce a terminal double bond into the β-hydroxyacyl-ACP-linked substrate by the combined action of the ST and TE. Under in vitro conditions, CurM PKS ST and OLS ST acted on β-hydroxy fatty acyl-ACP substrates; however, OLS ST was not reactive toward analogues of the natural PKS ST substrate bearing a C5-methoxy substituent. The crystal structures of CurM ST and OLS ST revealed that they are members of a distinct protein family relative to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic sulfotransferases. A common binding site for the sulfonate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate was visualized in complexes with the product 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate. Critical functions for several conserved amino acids in the active site were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, including a proposed glutamate catalytic base. A dynamic active-site flap unique to the "activating" ST family affects substrate selectivity and product formation, based on the activities of chimeras of the PKS and OLS STs with exchanged active-site flaps.	1
Title: Genetic Characterization of Neosartorin Biosynthesis Provides Insight into Heterodimeric Natural Product Generation Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster of the fungal xanthone heterodimer neosartorin (1) was discovered in Aspergillus novofumigatus, and its biosynthesis was investigated by a series of gene-deletion experiments. The results indicate that the two monomeric units of 1 are synthesized by the same set of enzymes, with chrysophanol (5) as a common precursor. Furthermore, the P450 monooxygenase NsrP for the heterodimerization was discovered, which also accepts non-native substrates to afford novel xanthone dimers.	1
Title: Synthesis of the 5'-Se-thymidine phosphoramidite and convenient labeling of DNA oligonucleotide Abstract: The synthesis of the 5'-Se-derivatized thymidine and phosphoramidite is reported, and the Se-phosphoramidite was incorporated into DNA. Because of its high nucleophilicity, this 5'-Se-moiety permits convenient postsynthetic modification of oligonucleotides. The proof of principle was successfully demonstrated by incorporating fluorescein into DNA. It was also found that the 5'-dye-labeled Se-DNA can be recognized by DNA polymerase as an efficient primer. This novel strategy opens a new avenue for nucleic acid probe preparation and detection.	0
Title: Expression of Caulobacter dnaA as a function of the cell cycle Abstract: The initiation of DNA replication is under differential control in Caulobacter crescentus. Following cell division, only the chromosome in the progeny stalked cell is able to initiate DNA replication, while the chromosome in the progeny swarmer cell does not replicate until later in the cell cycle. We have isolated the dnaA gene in order to determine whether this essential and ubiquitous replication initiation protein also contributes to differential replication control in C. crescentus. Analysis of the cloned C. crescentus dnaA gene has shown that the deduced amino acid sequence can encode a 486-amino-acid protein that is 37% identical to the DnaA protein of Escherichia coli. The gene is located 2 kb from the origin of replication. Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcript originating from a sigma 70-type promoter. Immunoprecipitation of a DnaA'-beta-lactamase fusion protein showed that although expression occurs throughout the cell cycle, there is a doubling in the rate of expression just prior to the initiation of replication.	0
Title: Identification of the incednine biosynthetic gene cluster: characterization of novel β-glutamate-β-decarboxylase IdnL3 Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster for the 24-membered macrolactam antibiotic incednine was identified from the producer strain, Streptomyces sp. ML694-90F3. Among the putative incednine biosynthetic enzymes, a novel pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent β-glutamate-β-decarboxylase, IdnL3, was functionally characterized in vitro by demonstrating its (S)-3-aminobutyrate-forming activity with β-glutamate in the presence of PLP. Because (S)-3-aminobutyrate is known for the direct precursor of incednine, this enzyme supplies the unique β-amino acid starter unit. The identified gene cluster encodes five characteristic β-amino acid carrying enzymes, consisting of a pathway-specific ATP-dependent ligase, a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), β-aminoacyl-ACP β-amino group-protecting ATP-dependent ligase, dipeptidyl-ACP:PKS-loading ACP dipeptidyltransferase and a terminal amino acid peptidase, which are completely conserved in β-amino acid-containing macrolactam biosynthetic gene clusters. Overall, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for incednine was proposed.	1
Title: Expression of the htrB gene is essential for responsiveness of Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni to harsh environments Abstract: In Campylobacter jejuni, an htrB homologous gene is located in the lipo-oligosaccharide synthesis gene cluster. This study examined the effects of htrB expression on the responsiveness of Salmonella typhimurium and C. jejuni to harsh environments. Complementation experiments showed that the C. jejuni htrB gene could restore the normal morphology of the Salmonella htrB mutant, and its ability to grow without inhibition under heat, acid and osmotic stresses, but not bile stress. This indicated that the htrB genes in C. jejuni and S. typhimurium exhibit similar pleiotropic effects. Moreover, quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of the C. jejuni htrB gene was upregulated under acid, heat, oxidative and osmotic stresses, but did not change under bile stress. This indicated that the C. jejuni htrB gene plays a role in regulating cell responses to various environmental changes. Furthermore, deletion mutation of the htrB gene in C. jejuni was lethal, indicating that the htrB gene is essential for C. jejuni survival. Therefore, these results showed that expression of the htrB gene is essential for the response of S. typhimurium and C. jejuni to environmental stresses.	1
Title: Characterization of the coformycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces kaniharaensis Abstract: Coformycin and pentostatin are structurally related N-nucleoside inhibitors of adenosine deaminase characterized by an unusual 1,3-diazepine nucleobase. Herein, the cof gene cluster responsible for coformycin biosynthesis is identified. Reconstitution of the coformycin biosynthetic pathway in vitro demonstrates that it overlaps significantly with the early stages of l-histidine biosynthesis. Committed entry into the coformycin pathway takes place via conversion of a shared branch point intermediate to 8-ketocoformycin-[Formula: see text]-monophosphate catalyzed by CofB, which is a homolog of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) synthetase. This reaction appears to proceed via a Dieckmann cyclization and a retro-aldol elimination, releasing ammonia and D-erythronate-4-phosphate as coproducts. Completion of coformycin biosynthesis involves reduction and dephosphorylation of the CofB product, with the former reaction being catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase CofA. CofB also shows activation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) despite the reaction requiring neither a phosphorylated nor an adenylated intermediate. This may serve to help regulate metabolic partitioning between the l-histidine and coformycin pathways.	1
Title: New insights into chloramphenicol biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 Abstract: Comparative genome analysis revealed seven uncharacterized genes, sven0909 to sven0915, adjacent to the previously identified chloramphenicol biosynthetic gene cluster (sven0916-sven0928) of Streptomyces venezuelae strain ATCC 10712 that was absent in a closely related Streptomyces strain that does not produce chloramphenicol. Transcriptional analysis suggested that three of these genes might be involved in chloramphenicol production, a prediction confirmed by the construction of deletion mutants. These three genes encode a cluster-associated transcriptional activator (Sven0913), a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Sven0914), and a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter (Sven0915). Bioinformatic analysis also revealed the presence of a previously undetected gene, sven0925, embedded within the chloramphenicol biosynthetic gene cluster that appears to encode an acyl carrier protein, bringing the number of new genes likely to be involved in chloramphenicol production to four. Microarray experiments and synteny comparisons also suggest that sven0929 is part of the biosynthetic gene cluster. This has allowed us to propose an updated and revised version of the chloramphenicol biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Towards a 'chassis' for bacterial magnetosome biosynthesis: genome streamlining of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense by multiple deletions Abstract: Background:                       Because of its tractability and straightforward cultivation, the magnetic bacterium Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense has emerged as a model for the analysis of magnetosome biosynthesis and bioproduction. However, its future use as platform for synthetic biology and biotechnology will require methods for large-scale genome editing and streamlining.                  Results:                       We established an approach for combinatory genome reduction and generated a library of strains in which up to 16 regions including large gene clusters, mobile genetic elements and phage-related genes were sequentially removed, equivalent to ~ 227.6 kb and nearly 5.5% of the genome. Finally, the fragmented genomic magnetosome island was replaced by a compact cassette comprising all key magnetosome biosynthetic gene clusters. The prospective 'chassis' revealed wild type-like cell growth and magnetosome biosynthesis under optimal conditions, as well as slightly improved resilience and increased genetic stability.                  Conclusion:                       We provide first proof-of-principle for the feasibility of multiple genome reduction and large-scale engineering of magnetotactic bacteria. The library of deletions will be valuable for turning M. gryphiswaldense into a microbial cell factory for synthetic biology and production of magnetic nanoparticles.	0
Title: Tandem prenyltransferases catalyze isoprenoid elongation and complexity generation in biosynthesis of quinolone alkaloids Abstract: Modification of natural products with prenyl groups and the ensuing oxidative transformations are important for introducing structural complexity and biological activities. Penigequinolones (1) are potent insecticidal alkaloids that contain a highly modified 10-carbon prenyl group. Here we reveal an iterative prenylation mechanism for installing the 10-carbon unit using two aromatic prenyltransferases (PenI and PenG) present in the gene cluster of 1 from Penicillium thymicola. The initial Friedel-Crafts alkylation is catalyzed by PenI to yield dimethylallyl quinolone 6. The five-carbon side chain is then dehydrogenated by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase to give aryl diene 9, which serves as the electron-rich substrate for a second alkylation with dimethylallyl diphosphate to yield stryrenyl product 10. The completed, oxidized 10-carbon prenyl group then undergoes further structural morphing to yield yaequinolone C (12), the immediate precursor of 1. Our studies have therefore uncovered an unprecedented prenyl chain extension mechanism in natural product biosynthesis.	0
Title: A signal for endoplasmic reticulum retention located at the carboxyl terminus of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 4CI Abstract: The plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 4b (PMCA4CI) with truncations in the cytoplasmically exposed COOH-terminal tail was expressed in COS and HeLa cells and in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. The truncated protein terminating with the acidic sequence Glu1067-Arg1087 was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas mutants lacking this sequence or having it at a distance from the COOH terminus were delivered to the plasma membrane. Although the truncated protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum was still able to form a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoenzyme, it underwent partial degradation. Substitution of glutamic and aspartic residue(s) in the acidic region promoted rescue of the protein to the plasma membrane. The results suggest that the sequence Glu1067-Arg1087 encodes a masked signal for ER retention and for the degradation of the protein. However, its presence at the COOH terminus was not sufficient to induce ER-retention and degradation; when the sequence was attached to the full-length PMCA protein, normal plasma delivery was observed. Evidently, ER retention and degradation required the presence of the sequence in its specific location within the PMCA structure. The degradation of the protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum occurred through the proteolytic attack at cytoplasmically exposed residues (amino acid sequence 720-750) by a cytoplasmic PEST sequence-related protease different from calpain.	0
Title: A dual anchoring strategy for the localization and activation of artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology Abstract: Artificial metalloenzymes result from anchoring an active catalyst within a protein environment. Toward this goal, various localization strategies have been pursued: covalent, supramolecular, or dative anchoring. Herein we show that introduction of a suitably positioned histidine residue contributes to firmly anchor, via a dative bond, a biotinylated rhodium piano stool complex within streptavidin. The in silico design of the artificial metalloenzyme was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The resulting artificial metalloenzyme displays significantly improved catalytic performance, both in terms of activity and selectivity in the transfer hydrogenation of imines. Depending on the position of the histidine residue, both enantiomers of the salsolidine product can be obtained.	0
Title: Catalytic Borylative Opening of Propargyl Cyclopropane, Epoxide, Aziridine, and Oxetane Substrates: Ligand Controlled Synthesis of Allenyl Boronates and Alkenyl Diboronates Abstract: A new copper-catalyzed reaction for the stereo- and regioselective synthesis of alkenyl diboronates and allenyl boronates is presented. In this process propargyl derivatives of strained three/four-membered rings were employed as substrates and B2pin2 was used as the boronate source. Selective formation of the alkenyl diboronate versus the allenyl boronate products was controlled by the choice of phosphine ligand.	0
Title: Self-Protection against the Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Inhibitor Fumonisin B1 Is Conferred by a FUM Cluster-Encoded Ceramide Synthase Abstract: Fumonisin (FB) mycotoxins produced by species of the genus Fusarium detrimentally affect human and animal health upon consumption, due to the inhibition of ceramide synthase. In the present work, we set out to identify mechanisms of self-protection employed by the FB1 producer Fusarium verticillioides FB1 biosynthesis was shown to be compartmentalized, and two cluster-encoded self-protection mechanisms were identified. First, the ATP-binding cassette transporter Fum19 acts as a repressor of the FUM gene cluster. Appropriately, FUM19 deletion and overexpression increased and decreased, respectively, the levels of intracellular and secreted FB1 Second, the cluster genes FUM17 and FUM18 were shown to be two of five ceramide synthase homologs in Fusarium verticillioides, grouping into the two clades CS-I and CS-II in a phylogenetic analysis. The ability of FUM18 to fully complement the yeast ceramide synthase null mutant LAG1/LAC1 demonstrated its functionality, while coexpression of FUM17 and CER3 partially complemented, likely via heterodimer formation. Cell viability assays revealed that Fum18 contributes to the fungal self-protection against FB1 and increases resistance by providing FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase activity.IMPORTANCE The biosynthesis of fungal natural products is highly regulated not only in terms of transcription and translation but also regarding the cellular localization of the biosynthetic pathway. In all eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the production of organelles, which are subject to cellular traffic or secretion. Here, we show that in Fusarium verticillioides, early steps in fumonisin production take place in the ER, together with ceramide biosynthesis, which is targeted by the mycotoxin. A first level of self-protection is given by the presence of a FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase, Fum18, hitherto uncharacterized. In addition, the final fumonisin biosynthetic step occurs in the cytosol and is thereby spatially separate from the fungal ceramide synthases. We suggest that these strategies help the fungus to avoid self-poisoning during mycotoxin production.	1
Title: Identifying the functional contribution of the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 Abstract: Mammalian sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) exhibits many pivotal functions and multiple enzymatic activities, but the contribution of each activity to the various functions is unclear. We identified a SIRT6 mutant (G60A) that possesses efficient defatty-acylase activity but has substantially decreased deacetylase activity in vitro and no detectable deacetylase activity in cells. The G60A mutant has a decreased ability to bind NAD(+), but the presence of fatty-acyl lysine peptides restores NAD(+) binding, explaining the retention of the defatty-acylase activity. Using this mutant, we found that the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 regulates the secretion of numerous proteins. Notably, many ribosomal proteins were secreted via exosomes from Sirt6 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and these exosomes increased NIH 3T3 cell proliferation compared with control exosomes. Our data indicate that distinct activities of SIRT6 regulate different pathways and that the G60A mutant is a useful tool to study the contribution of defatty-acylase activity to SIRT6's various functions.	0
Title: Cyanobacterial ent-Sterol-Like Natural Products from a Deviated Ubiquinone Pathway Abstract: Natural products from marine animals show high potential for the development of new medicines, but drug development based on these compounds is commonly hampered by their low natural abundance. Since many of these metabolites are suspected or known to be produced by uncultivated bacterial symbionts, the rapidly growing diversity of sequenced prokaryotic genomes offers the opportunity to identify alternative, culturable sources of natural products computationally. In this work, we investigated the potential of using this sequenced resource to facilitate the production of meroterpenoid-like compounds related to those from marine sources. This genome-mining strategy revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster for highly modified cytotoxic meroterpenoids related to pelorol and other compounds isolated from sponges. Functional characterization of the terpene cyclase MstE showed that it generates an ent-sterol-like skeleton fused to an aryl moiety from an open-chain precursor and is therefore a promising tool for the chemoenzymatic preparation of synthetically challenging chemical scaffolds.	1
Title: First identification of unstable phosphino formic acid (H2PCOOH) Abstract: The hitherto elusive phosphino formic acid molecule (H2PCOOH) was detected for the first time in the gas phase. Theoretical calculations revealed an unexpected kinetic stability of H2PCOOH compared to the isovalent carbamic acid (H2NCOOH) although the replacement of a single nitrogen atom by phosphorus decreases the bond order from a partial double (-C[double bond, length as m-dash]N-) to a single (-C-P-) bond. This work provides a fundamental framework to explore the synthesis and stability of derivatives of carbonic acid (H2CO3), in which one or both hydroxyl groups (OH) are replaced by hydride moieties involving third row atoms.	0
Title: Flavin-linked oxidase catalyzes pyrrolizine formation of dichloropyrrole-containing polyketide extender unit in chlorizidine A Abstract: The marine alkaloid chlorizidine A contains chlorinated pyrroloisoindolone and pyrrolizine rings that are rare chemical features in bacterial natural products. Herein, we report the biosynthetic logic of their construction in Streptomyces sp. CNH-287 based on the identification of the chlorizidine A biosynthetic gene cluster. Using whole pathway heterologous expression and genetic manipulations, we show that chlorizidine A is assembled by a polyketide synthase that uniquely incorporates a fatty acid synthase-derived dichloropyrrolyl extender unit into the pyrroloisoindolone enzymatic product. We further provide the first biochemical characterization of a flavoenzyme associated with the oxidative formation of chlorizidine A's distinctive pyrrolizine ring. This work illuminates new enzymatic assembly line processes leading to rare nitrogen-containing rings in nature.	1
Title: High-titer heterologous production in E. coli of lyngbyatoxin, a protein kinase C activator from an uncultured marine cyanobacterium Abstract: Many chemically complex cyanobacterial polyketides and nonribosomal peptides are of great pharmaceutical interest, but the levels required for exploitation are difficult to achieve from native sources. Here we develop a framework for the expression of these multifunctional cyanobacterial assembly lines in Escherichia coli using the lyngbyatoxin biosynthetic pathway, derived from a marine microbial assemblage dominated by the cyanobacterium Moorea producens. Heterologous expression of this pathway afforded high titers of both lyngbyatoxin A (25.6 mg L(-1)) and its precursor indolactam-V (150 mg L(-1)). Production, isolation, and identification of all expected chemical intermediates of lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis in E. coli also confirmed the previously proposed biosynthetic route, setting a solid chemical foundation for future pathway engineering. The successful production of the nonribosomal peptide lyngbyatoxin A in E. coli also opens the possibility for future heterologous expression, characterization, and exploitation of other cyanobacterial natural product pathways.	1
Title: Exopolysaccharide production and ropy phenotype are determined by two gene clusters in putative probiotic strain Lactobacillus paraplantarum BGCG11 Abstract: Lactobacillus paraplantarum BGCG11, a putative probiotic strain isolated from a soft, white, artisanal cheese, produces a high molecular-weight heteropolysaccharide, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-CG11, responsible for the ropy phenotype and immunomodulatory activity of the strain. In this study, a 26.4-kb region originating from the pCG1 plasmid, previously shown to be responsible for the production of EPS-CG11 and a ropy phenotype, was cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. In this region 16 putative open reading frames (ORFs), encoding enzymes for the production of EPS-CG11, were organized in specific loci involved in the biosynthesis of the repeat unit, polymerization, export, regulation, and chain length determination. Interestingly, downstream of the eps gene cluster, a putative transposase gene was identified, followed by an additional rfb gene cluster containing the rfbACBD genes, the ones most probably responsible for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis. The functional analysis showed that the production of the high-molecular-weight fraction of EPS-CG11 was absent in two knockout mutants, one in the eps and the other in the rfb gene cluster, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography analysis. Therefore, both eps and rfb genes clusters are prerequisites for the production of high-molecular-weight EPS-CG11 and for the ropy phenotype of strain L. paraplantarum BGCG11.	0
Title: Rapid discovery and functional characterization of diterpene synthases from basidiomycete fungi by genome mining Abstract: Basidiomycete fungi are a rich source of bioactive diterpenoid secondary metabolites. However, compared with the large number of diterpene synthases (di-TPSs) identified in plants and ascomycete fungi, only three di-TPSs have been described from basidiomycete fungi. Large scale genome sequencing projects combined with the development of synthetic biology techniques now has enabled the rapidly discovery and characterization of di-TPSs from basidiomycete fungi. In this study, we discovered and functionally characterized four di-TPSs from 220 genome sequenced basidiomycete fungi by a combined strategy of genomic data mining, phylogenetic analysis and fast products characterization with synthetic biology techniques. Among them, SteTC1 of Stereum histurum was characterized as the first fungal cembrane diterpene synthase; PunTC of Punctularia strigosozonata and SerTC of Serpula lacrymans were characterized as ent-kauran-16α-ol synthase and DenTC3 of Dentipellis sp was characterized as a cyathane synthase. Our results provide opportunities for the discovery of new diterpenoids from basidiomycete fungi by genome mining.	1
Title: Complex regulation of secondary metabolism controlling pathogenicity in the phytopathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata Abstract: The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata includes seven pathogenic variants (pathotypes), which produce different host-selective toxins and cause disease on different plants. The Japanese pear, strawberry and tangerine pathotypes produce AK-toxin, AF-toxin and ACT-toxin, respectively, which have a common structural moiety, 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid (EDA). Here, we identified a new gene, AKT7 (AK-toxin biosynthetic gene 7), from the Japanese pear pathotype, which encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and functions to limit AK-toxin production. AKT7 homologs were found in the strawberry pathotype, but not the tangerine pathotype. However, the strawberry pathotype homolog appeared to include a premature stop codon. Although the Japanese pear pathotype strain has multiple copies of AKT7, a single-copy disruption resulted in mutants with increased production of AK-toxin and EDA. AKT7 overexpression in the three pathotypes caused marked reductions of toxin and EDA production, suggesting that Akt7 catalyzes a side reaction of EDA or its precursor. AKT7 overexpression caused reduced virulence in these pathotypes. We also found that AKT7 transcripts predominantly include misspliced mRNAs, which have premature stop codons. Our observations suggest that the AK-toxin production required for full virulence is regulated in a complex way by the copy number and intron information content of AKT7.	1
Title: In vitro and in vivo studies of three antibiotic combinations against gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: The activities of azlocillin, cefotaxime, and amikacin alone and in combination were evaluated in in vitro checkerboard studies, in infected neutropenic mice, and in human volunteers. The combination of cefotaxime plus amikacin was more synergistic in vitro than the others against the Enterobacteriaceae tested, and the combination of azlocillin plus amikacin was more synergistic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Survival of neutropenic mice infected with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, was greater with azlocillin plus amikacin (24 of 40 and 11 of 40) and with cefotaxime plus amikacin (21 of 40 and 17 of 40) than with azlocillin plus cefotaxime (22 of 40 and 3 of 40; P less than 0.05). Median serum bactericidal activity in volunteers receiving these antibiotics alone and in combination was greater than or equal to 1:8 with most agents and with all combinations tested against 10 strains each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. These data suggest that clinical trials with combinations of azlocillin or cefotaxime plus amikacin deserve further study in febrile neutropenic patients.	0
Title: Clorobiocin biosynthesis in Streptomyces: identification of the halogenase and generation of structural analogs Abstract: Clorobiocin (clo) and novobiocin (nov) are potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase. The two substances differ in the substitution pattern at C-8' of the aminocoumarin ring, carrying a chlorine atom or a methyl group, respectively. By gene inactivation, clo-hal was identified as the gene of the halogenase responsible for the introduction of the chlorine atom of clorobiocin. Inactivation of cloZ did not affect clorobiocin formation, showing that this ORF is not essential for clorobiocin biosynthesis. Expression of the methyltransferase gene novO in the clo-hal(-) mutant led to the very efficient formation of a hybrid antibiotic containing a methyl group instead of a chlorine atom at C-8'. Comparison of the antibacterial activity of clorobiocin analogs with -Cl, -H, or -CH(3) at C-8' showed that chlorine leads to 8-fold higher activity than hydrogen and to 2-fold higher activity than a methyl group.	1
Title: Developing a national birth cohort for child health research using a hospital admissions database in England: The impact of changes to data collection practices Abstract: Background:                       National birth cohorts derived from administrative health databases constitute unique resources for child health research due to whole country coverage, ongoing follow-up and linkage to other data sources. In England, a national birth cohort can be developed using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), an administrative database covering details of all publicly funded hospital activity, including 97% of births, with longitudinal follow-up via linkage to hospital and mortality records. We present methods for developing a national birth cohort using HES and assess the impact of changes to data collection over time on coverage and completeness of linked follow-up records for children.                  Methods:                       We developed a national cohort of singleton live births in 1998-2015, with information on key risk factors at birth (birth weight, gestational age, maternal age, ethnicity, area-level deprivation). We identified three changes to data collection, which could affect linkage of births to follow-up records: (1) the introduction of the "NHS Numbers for Babies (NN4B)", an on-line system which enabled maternity staff to request a unique healthcare patient identifier (NHS number) immediately at birth rather than at civil registration, in Q4 2002; (2) the introduction of additional data quality checks at civil registration in Q3 2009; and (3) correcting a postcode extraction error for births by the data provider in Q2 2013. We evaluated the impact of these changes on trends in two outcomes in infancy: hospital readmissions after birth (using interrupted time series analyses) and mortality rates (compared to published national statistics).                  Results:                       The cohort covered 10,653,998 babies, accounting for 96% of singleton live births in England in 1998-2015. Overall, 2,077,929 infants (19.5%) had at least one hospital readmission after birth. Readmission rates declined by 0.2% percentage points per annual quarter in Q1 1998 to Q3 2002, shifted up by 6.1% percentage points (compared to the expected value based on the trend before Q4 2002) to 17.7% in Q4 2002 when NN4B was introduced, and increased by 0.1% percentage points per annual quarter thereafter. Infant mortality rates were under-reported by 16% for births in 1998-2002 and similar to published national mortality statistics for births in 2003-2015. The trends in infant readmission were not affected by changes to data collection practices in Q3 2009 and Q2 2013, but the proportion of unlinked mortality records in HES and in ONS further declined after 2009.                  Discussion:                       HES can be used to develop a national birth cohort for child health research with follow-up via linkage to hospital and mortality records for children born from 2003 onwards. Re-linking births before 2003 to their follow-up records would maximise potential benefits of this rich resource, enabling studies of outcomes in adolescents with over 20 years of follow-up.	0
Title: Nucleation of NaCl from Aqueous Solution: Critical Sizes, Ion-Attachment Kinetics, and Rates Abstract: Nucleation and crystal growth are important in material synthesis, climate modeling, biomineralization, and pharmaceutical formulation. Despite tremendous efforts, the mechanisms and kinetics of nucleation remain elusive to both theory and experiment. Here we investigate sodium chloride (NaCl) nucleation from supersaturated brines using seeded atomistic simulations, polymorph-specific order parameters, and elements of classical nucleation theory. We find that NaCl nucleates via the common rock salt structure. Ion desolvation-not diffusion-is identified as the limiting resistance to attachment. Two different analyses give approximately consistent attachment kinetics: diffusion along the nucleus size coordinate and reaction-diffusion analysis of approach-to-coexistence simulation data from Aragones et al. ( J. Chem. Phys. 2012, 136, 244508 ). Our simulations were performed at realistic supersaturations to enable the first direct comparison to experimental nucleation rates for this system. The computed and measured rates converge to a common upper limit at extremely high supersaturation. However, our rate predictions are between 15 and 30 orders of magnitude too fast. We comment on possible origins of the large discrepancy.	0
Title: The dnaK protein of Escherichia coli possesses an ATPase and autophosphorylating activity and is essential in an in vitro DNA replication system Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaK gene product, originally defined by mutations that blocked lambda phage DNA replication, is known to be necessary for E. coli viability. We have purified dnaK protein to homogeneity and have demonstrated that it possesses a weak DNA-independent ATPase activity, which results in the production of ADP and Pi. The proof that this ATPase activity is encoded by the dnaK+ gene relies primarily on the fact that the dnaK756 mutation results in the production of an ATPase activity with altered physical properties. The dnaK protein is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo, probably as a result of an autophosphorylation reaction. The lambda O and P replication proteins were shown to interact in vitro with the dnaK protein. The ATPase activity of the dnaK protein was inhibited by purified lambda P protein and stimulated by purified lambda O protein. Moreover, the dnaK protein participates in the initiation of DNA synthesis in an in vitro DNA replication system that is dependent on the O and P proteins. Anti-dnaK protein immunoglobulin specifically inhibited DNA synthesis in this system.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces griseochromogenes ATCC 14511T, a producer of nucleoside compounds and diverse secondary metabolites Abstract: ATCC 14511T (=DSM 40499, =NBRC 13413) is a type strain of Streptomyces griseochromogenes. It is known as a producer of nucleoside antibiotic, blasticidin S. In this report we present the complete genome sequence of S. griseochromogenes ATCC 14511T, which consists of 10,764,674bp with a linear chromosome, 9822 protein-coding genes, 6 rRNA operons, 74 tRNA and 3 sRNA. The genomic analysis revealed that 52 putative gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including four gene clusters of nucleoside antibiotics. These gene clusters provide a beneficial source for production of bioactive natural compounds.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: insights into nitrile formation Abstract: The 18-membered polyketide macrolide borrelidin exhibits a number of important biological activities, including potent angiogenesis inhibition. This has prompted two recent total syntheses as well as the cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Borrelidin possesses some unusual structural characteristics, including a cyclopentane carboxylic acid moiety at C17 and a nitrile moiety at C12 of the macrocyclic ring. Nitrile groups are relatively rare in nature, and little is known of their biosynthesis during secondary metabolism. The nitrile group of borrelidin is shown here to arise from the methyl group of a methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit incorporated during polyketide chain extension. Insertional inactivation of two genes in the borrelidin gene cluster, borI (coding for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) and borJ (coding for an aminotransferase), generated borrelidin non-producing mutants. These mutants accumulated different compounds lacking the C12 nitrile moiety, with the product of the borI-minus mutant (12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin) possessing a methyl group and that of the borJ-minus mutant (12-desnitrile-12-carboxyl-borrelidin) a carboxyl group at C12. The former but not the latter was converted into borrelidin when biotransformed by an S. parvulus mutant that is deficient in the biosynthesis of the borrelidin starter unit. This suggests that 12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin is a competent biosynthetic intermediate, whereas the carboxylated derivative is a shunt metabolite. Bioconversion of 12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin into borrelidin was also achieved in a heterologous system co-expressing borI and borJ in Streptomyces albus J1074. This bioconversion was more efficient when borK, which is believed to encode a dehydrogenase, was simultaneously expressed with borI and borJ. On the basis of these findings, a pathway is proposed for the formation of the nitrile moiety during borrelidin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the pharmaceutically important class of epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors Abstract: The epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors are an established class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Their unique α',β'-epoxyketone pharmacophore allows binding to the catalytic β-subunits of the proteasome with extraordinary specificity. Here, we report the characterization of the first gene clusters for the biosynthesis of natural peptidyl-epoxyketones. The clusters for epoxomicin, the lead compound for the anticancer drug Kyprolis, and for eponemycin were identified in the actinobacterial producer strains ATCC 53904 and Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 53709, respectively, using a modified protocol for Ion Torrent PGM genome sequencing. Both gene clusters code for a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase multifunctional enzyme complex and homologous redox enzymes. Epoxomicin and eponemycin were heterologously produced in Streptomyces albus J1046 via whole pathway expression. Moreover, we employed mass spectral molecular networking for a new comparative metabolomics approach in a heterologous system and discovered a number of putative epoxyketone derivatives. With this study, we have definitively linked epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors and their biosynthesis genes for the first time in any organism, which will now allow for their detailed biochemical investigation.	1
Title: Insights into the Biosynthesis of Duramycin Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are characterized by the thioether cross-linked bisamino acids lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan). Duramycin contains 19 amino acids, including one Lan and two MeLans, an unusual lysinoalanine (Lal) bridge formed from the ε-amino group of lysine 19 and a serine residue at position 6, and an erythro-3-hydroxy-l-aspartic acid at position 15. These modifications are important for the interactions of duramycin with its biological target, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Based on the binding affinity and specificity for PE, duramycin has been investigated as a potential therapeutic, as a molecular probe to investigate the role and localization of PE in biological systems, and to block viral entry into mammalian cells. In this study, we identified the duramycin biosynthetic gene cluster by genome sequencing of Streptomyces cinnamoneus ATCC 12686 and investigated the dur biosynthetic machinery by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli In addition, the analog duramycin C, containing six amino acid changes compared to duramycin, was successfully generated in E. coli The substrate recognition motif of DurX, an α-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase that carries out the hydroxylation of aspartate 15 of the precursor peptide DurA, was also investigated using mutagenesis of the DurA peptide. Both in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that Gly16 is important for DurX activity.                  Importance:                       Duramycin is a natural product produced by certain bacteria that binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Because PE is involved in many cellular processes, duramycin is an antibiotic that kills bacteria, but it has also been used as a molecular probe to detect PE and monitor its localization in mammalian cells and even whole organisms, and it was recently shown to display broad-spectrum inhibition of viral entry into host cells. In addition, the molecule has been evaluated as treatment for cystic fibrosis. We report here the genes that are involved in duramycin biosynthesis, and we produced duramycin by expressing those genes in Escherichia coli We show that duramycin analogs can also be produced. The ability to access duramycin and analogs by production in E. coli opens opportunities to improve duramycin as an antibiotic, PE probe, antiviral, or cystic fibrosis therapeutic.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of the dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis region of the Escherichia coli VW187 (O7:K1) rfb gene cluster: identification of functional homologs of rfbB and rfbA in the rff cluster and correct location of the rffE gene Abstract: The O-repeating unit of the Escherichia coli O7-specific lipopolysaccharide is made of galactose, mannose, rhamnose, 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxyglucose, and N-acetyglucosamine. We have recently characterized the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar precursor GDP-mannose occurring in the E. coli O7:K1 strain VW187 (C. L. Marolda and M. A. Valvano, J. Bacteriol. 175:148-158, 1993). In the present study, we identified and sequenced the rfbBDAC genes encoding the enzymes for the biosynthesis of another precursor, dTDP-rhamnose. These genes are localized on the upstream end of the rfbEcO7 region, and they are strongly conserved compared with similar genes found in various enteric and nonenteric bacteria. Upstream of rfbB we identified a DNA segment containing the rfb promoter and a highly conserved untranslated leader sequence also present in the promoter regions of other surface polysaccharide gene clusters. Also, we have determined that rfbB and rfbA have homologs, rffG (o355) and rffH (o292), respectively, located on the rff cluster, which is involved in the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen. We provide biochemical evidence that rffG and rffH encode dTDP-glucose dehydratase and glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase activities, respectively, and we also show that rffG complemented the rfbB defect in the O7+ cosmid pJHCV32. We also demonstrate that rffG is distinct from rffE and map the rffE gene to the second gene of the rff cluster.	1
Title: Involvement of β-Alkylation Machinery and Two Sets of Ketosynthase-Chain-Length Factors in the Biosynthesis of Fogacin Polyketides in Actinoplanes missouriensis Abstract: Fogacin and two novel fogacin derivatives, fogacins B and C, were isolated from the rare actinomycete Actinoplanes missouriensis. Biosynthesis of fogacin C apparently requires β alkylation of a polyketide chain. The fogacin biosynthetic type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster contains a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HCS) cassette, which is usually responsible for β alkylation in the type I PKS system. Another characteristic of the fog cluster is that it encodes two sets of ketosynthase (KS) and chain-length factor (CLF). Inactivation of either of the two KS genes in A. missouriensis and heterologous expression of the HCS cassette with either of the two KS-CLF genes in Streptomyces albus indicated that each KS-CLF had a different starter substrate specificity: one preferred an unusual β-alkylated starter and the other preferred a normal acetyl starter. This study expands knowledge of HCS cassette-dependent β alkylation into the type II PKS system and provides a natural example of combinatorial biosynthesis for producing diverse polyketides from different starter substrates.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides glnB and glnA genes Abstract: The glnA gene of Rhodobacter sphaeroides encoding glutamine synthetase (GS) has been cloned and sequenced. Molecular analysis revealed that there is a glnB gene upstream of glnA, in a single glnBA operon. A putative glnAp1-type promoter sequence, a consensus ntrC gene product binding site and a consensus upstream activator sequence were detected upstream of the glnB gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of the GS and GlnB proteins of R. sphaeroides showed strong homology with the same proteins from other Gram-negative bacteria. The sequence of the glnA gene isolated from glutamine auxotroph Gln83 was also determined. The glnA83 mutation was shown to result in premature termination of GS synthesis and formation of a 17 kDa C-truncated GS which could be complemented by a 5'-truncated glnA gene which encodes a 30 kDa N-truncated GS. This phenomenon is characteristic for interallelic complementation.	0
Title: Malleilactone, a polyketide synthase-derived virulence factor encoded by the cryptic secondary metabolome of Burkholderia pseudomallei group pathogens Abstract: Sequenced bacterial genomes are routinely found to contain gene clusters that are predicted to encode metabolites not seen in fermentation-based studies. Pseudomallei group Burkholderia are emerging pathogens whose genomes are particularly rich in cryptic natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. We systematically probed the influence of the cryptic secondary metabolome on the virulence of these bacteria and found that disruption of the MAL gene cluster, which is natively silent in laboratory fermentation experiments and conserved across this group of pathogens, attenuates virulence in animal models. Using a promoter exchange strategy to activate the MAL cluster, we identified malleilactone, a polyketide synthase-derived cytotoxic siderophore encoded by this gene cluster. Small molecules targeting malleilactone biosynthesis either alone or in conjunction with antibiotics could prove useful as therapeutics to combat melioidosis and glanders.	1
Title: A biosynthetic pathway for BE-7585A, a 2-thiosugar-containing angucycline-type natural product Abstract: Sulfur is an essential element found ubiquitously in living systems. However, there exist only a few sulfur-containing sugars in nature and their biosyntheses have not been studied. BE-7585A produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. vinearia BA-07585 has a 2-thiosugar and is a member of the angucycline class of compounds. We report herein the results of our initial efforts to study the biosynthesis of BE-7585A. Spectroscopic analyses verified the structure of BE-7585A, which is closely related to rhodonocardin A. Feeding experiments using (13)C-labeled acetate were carried out to confirm that the angucycline core is indeed polyketide-derived. The results indicated an unusual manner of angular tetracyclic ring construction, perhaps via a Baeyer-Villiger type rearrangement. Subsequent cloning and sequencing led to the identification of the bex gene cluster spanning approximately 30 kbp. A total of 28 open reading frames, which are likely involved in BE-7585A formation, were identified in the cluster. In view of the presence of a homologue of a thiazole synthase gene (thiG), bexX, in the bex cluster, the mechanism of sulfur incorporation into the 2-thiosugar moiety could resemble that found in thiamin biosynthesis. A glycosyltransferase homologue, BexG2, was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme successfully catalyzed the coupling of 2-thioglucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose to produce 2-thiotrehalose 6-phosphate, which is the precursor of the disaccharide unit in BE-7585A. On the basis of these genetic and biochemical experiments, a biosynthetic pathway for BE-7585A can now be proposed. The combined results set the stage for future biochemical studies of 2-thiosugar biosynthesis and BE-7585A assembly.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of para- Cyclophane-Containing Hirsutellone Family of Fungal Natural Products Abstract: Hirsutellones are fungal natural products containing a macrocyclic para-cyclophane connected to a decahydrofluorene ring system. We have elucidated the biosynthetic pathway for pyrrocidine B (3) and GKK1032 A2 (4). Two small hypothetical proteins, an oxidoreductase and a lipocalin-like protein, function cooperatively in the oxidative cyclization of the cyclophane, while an additional hypothetical protein in the pyrrocidine pathway catalyzes the exo-specific cycloaddition to form the cis-fused decahydrofluorene.	1
Title: Genotypes of Cryptosporidium species infecting fur-bearing mammals differ from those of species infecting humans Abstract: Of 471 specimens examined from foxes, raccoons, muskrats, otters, and beavers living in wetlands adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay, 36 were positive for five types of Cryptosporidium, including the C. canis dog and fox genotypes, Cryptosporidium muskrat genotypes I and II, and Cryptosporidium skunk genotype. Thus, fur-bearing mammals in watersheds excreted host-adapted Cryptosporidium oocysts that are not known to be of significant public health importance.	0
Title: Application of a simulation model to the prognosis of material loss in wood processing Abstract: The article discusses the influence of a sample size on the credibility of a simulation model created for the estimation of material loss in the production of a middle layer of a wooden floorboard. The study was conducted in a production company operating in the wood processing industry. Geometric characteristics of input material were captured and used to derive statistical distributions, which were then included in the simulation model. The conducted experiments indicated that the quality of the simulation model was significantly affected by the quality and quantity of the sample, on the basis of which the stochastic model is estimated. It was shown that small sample for wood processing data was insufficient to capture process variability. On the other hand, excessive sample size (80 or more observations) for the material with high natural geometric variability, involves taking into account outliers, which may lower the overall prognostic quality of the simulation model. Based on the conducted simulation experiments, the recommended sample size which allows development of a reliable model for estimation of material loss in the analyzed manufacturing process, ranges from 40 to 60 measurements.	0
Title: Catenulisporolides, Glycosylated Triene Macrolides from the Chemically Underexploited Actinomycete Catenulispora Species Abstract: New glycosylated 26-membered triene macrolides catenulisporolides, the first polyketide metabolites from Catenulispora species, were obtained by targeting slow-forming colonies on selection agar plates and applying long-term cultivation. Their structures, including the full stereochemistry, were defined by comprehensive spectroscopic and chemical methods and confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster spanning ∼160 kbp, and feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors showed that isovaleric acid acts as a rare starter unit. Catenulisporolides exhibited antimalarial activities against resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, and enhanced activity was observed in semisynthetic derivatives.	1
Title: Difluorocarbene-Derived Trifluoromethylthiolation and [(18)F]Trifluoromethylthiolation of Aliphatic Electrophiles Abstract: The first trifluoromethylthiolation and [(18)F]trifluoromethylthiolation of alkyl electrophiles with in situ generated difluorocarbene in the presence of elemental sulfur and external (radioactive) fluoride ion is described. This transition-metal-free approach is high yielding, compatible with a variety of functional groups, and operated under mild reaction conditions. The conceptual advantage of this exogenous-fluoride-mediated transformation enables unprecedented syntheses of [(18)F]CF3S-labeled molecules from most commonly used [(18)F]fluoride ions. The rapid radiochemical reaction time (≤1 min) and high functional-group tolerance allow access to a variety of aliphatic [(18)F]CF3S compounds in high yields.	0
Title: Characterization of a single gene cluster responsible for methylpendolmycin and pendolmycin biosynthesis in the deep sea bacterium Marinactinospora thermotolerans Abstract: The nine-membered indolactam antibiotics belong to a small group of antibiotics showing broad biological activities. However, the in vivo genetic engineering of compounds of this type has not been performed. Here we report the identification of a single gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of methylpendolmycin and pendolmycin, two members of this family of antibiotics, from the deep sea bacterium Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652. Bioinformatics analysis and gene inactivation, coupled with metabolite characterization, reveal that MpnB, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, MpnC, a cytochrome P450, and MpnD, a prenyltransferase, are sufficient to catalyze the biosynthesis of the two antibiotics from L-Ile (or L-Val), L-Trp, and methionine. MpnD is the first identified enzyme that transfers a C5 prenyl unit in a reverse manner to the C-7 position of a Trp-derived natural product.	1
Title: Identification, cloning, expression, and characterization of the extracellular acarbose-modifying glycosyltransferase, AcbD, from Actinoplanes sp. strain SE50 Abstract: An extracellular enzyme activity in the culture supernatant of the acarbose producer Actinoplanes sp. strain SE50 catalyzes the transfer of the acarviosyl moiety of acarbose to malto-oligosaccharides. This acarviosyl transferase (ATase) is encoded by a gene, acbD, in the putative biosynthetic gene cluster for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose. The acbD gene was cloned and heterologously produced in Streptomyces lividans TK23. The recombinant protein was analyzed by enzyme assays. The AcbD protein (724 amino acids) displays all of the features of extracellular alpha-glucosidases and/or transglycosylases of the alpha-amylase family and exhibits the highest similarities to several cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases). However, AcbD had neither alpha-amylase nor CGTase activity. The AcbD protein was purified to homogeneity, and it was identified by partial protein sequencing of tryptic peptides. AcbD had an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.0 and required Ca(2+) ions for activity. The enzyme displayed maximal activity at 30 degrees C and between pH 6.2 and 6.9. The K(m) values of the ATase for acarbose (donor substrate) and maltose (acceptor substrate) are 0.65 and 0.96 mM, respectively. A wide range of additional donor and acceptor substrates were determined for the enzyme. Acceptors revealed a structural requirement for glucose-analogous structures conserving only the overall stereochemistry, except for the anomeric C atom, and the hydroxyl groups at positions 2, 3, and 4 of D-glucose. We discuss here the function of the enzyme in the extracellular formation of the series of acarbose-homologous compounds produced by Actinoplanes sp. strain SE50.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the respiratory toxin bongkrekic acid in the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia gladioli Abstract: Bongkrekic acid (BA), an infamous respiratory toxin of the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia gladioli, causes lethal intoxications when tempe bongkrek is produced with contaminated Rhizopus oligosporus cultures. Genome sequencing of B. gladioli pathovar cocovenenans unveiled the genetic basis for BA biosynthesis, and pointed to a homologous bon gene cluster in a B. gladioli strain from an infected rice plant. For functional genetics in B. gladioli λ Red recombination was established. Dissection of the modular type I polyketide synthase (a trans-AT PKS) provided insights into complex polyketide assembly. Isoprenoid-like β-branching events and a six-electron oxidation of a methyl group to a carboxylic acid give rise to the unique branched tricarboxylic fatty acid. The role of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, BonL, was proven by structural elucidation of deoxybongkrekic acid from a mutant.	1
Title: Thorectidiol A Isolated from the Marine Sponge Dactylospongia elegans Disrupts Interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain with the Host ACE2 Receptor Abstract: Thorectidiols isolated from the marine sponge Dactylospongia elegans (family Thorectidae, order Dictyoceratida) collected in Papua New Guinea are a family of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dimeric biphenyl meroterpenoid stereoisomers presumed to be products of oxidative phenol coupling of a co-occurring racemic monomer, thorectidol (3). One member of the family, thorectidiol A (1), has been isolated in its natural form, and its structure has been elucidated by analysis of NMR, MS, and ECD data. Acetylation of the sponge extract facilitated isolation of additional thorectidiol diacetate stereoisomers and the isolation of the racemic monomer thorectidol acetate (6). Racemic thorectidiol A (1) showed selective inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with the host ACE2 receptor with an IC50 = 1.0 ± 0.7 μM.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Amino Group Carrier Protein-Mediated Machinery: Discovery and Biosynthetic Characterization of a Natural Product with Unique Hydrazone Unit Abstract: We recently revealed that a Streptomyces strain possesses the gene encoding amino group carrier protein (AmCP). AmCP is involved in the biosynthesis of a previously unidentified nonproteinogenic amino acid, (2S,6R)-diamino-(5R,7)-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid (DADH), which is a core compound for the synthesis of the dipeptide-containing novel natural product vazabitide A. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening to investigate the diversity of the biosynthetic machinery that uses AmCP; the results revealed that genes encoding AmCP are widely distributed among actinomycetes. The heterologous expression of the AmCP-containing gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. SoC090715LN-17 led to the discovery of s56-p1, a novel natural product. The structure of s56-p1 was determined by spectroscopic analysis; the results revealed that s56-p1 has a putative DADH-derived molecule as the core and also possesses a unique hydrazone unit that is rarely observed in natural products. Our results pave the way for investigations of unexploited AmCP-mediated biosynthesis routes among actinomycetes and of the biosynthetic mechanism of the unique hydrazone unit.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of a complex yersiniabactin-like natural product via the mic locus in phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum Abstract: A genome mining study in the plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 unveiled a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster putatively involved in siderophore biosynthesis. Insertional mutagenesis confirmed the respective locus to be operational under iron-deficient conditions and spurred the isolation of the associated natural product. Bioinformatic analyses of the gene cluster facilitated the structural characterization of this compound, which was subsequently identified as the antimycoplasma agent micacocidin. The metal-chelating properties of micacocidin were evaluated in competition experiments, and the cellular uptake of gallium-micacocidin complexes was demonstrated in R. solanacearum GMI1000, indicating a possible siderophore role. Comparative genomics revealed a conservation of the micacocidin gene cluster in defined, but globally dispersed phylotypes of R. solanacearum.	1
Title: Characterization of the nocardiopsin biosynthetic gene cluster reveals similarities to and differences from the rapamycin and FK-506 pathways Abstract: Macrolide-pipecolate natural products, such as rapamycin (1) and FK-506 (2), are renowned modulators of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs). The nocardiopsins, from Nocardiopsis sp. CMB-M0232, are the newest members of this structural class. Here, the biosynthetic pathway for nocardiopsins A-D (4-7) is revealed by cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of the nsn gene cluster. In vitro evaluation of recombinant NsnL revealed that this lysine cyclodeaminase catalyzes the conversion of L-lysine into the L-pipecolic acid incorporated into 4 and 5. Bioinformatic analyses supported the conjecture that a linear nocardiopsin precursor is equipped with the hydroxy group required for macrolide closure in a previously unobserved manner by employing a P450 epoxidase (NsnF) and limonene epoxide hydrolase homologue (NsnG). The nsn cluster also encodes candidates for tetrahydrofuran group biosynthesis. The nocardiopsin pathway provides opportunities for engineering of FKBP-binding metabolites and for probing new enzymology in nature's polyketide tailoring arsenal.	1
Title: The mRNA interferases, MazF-mt3 and MazF-mt7 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis target unique pentad sequences in single-stranded RNA Abstract: mRNA interferases are sequence-specific endoribonucleases encoded by toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacterial genomes. Previously, we demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains at least seven genes encoding MazF homologues (MazF-mt1 to -mt7) and determined cleavage specificities for MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6. Here we have developed a new general method for the determination of recognition sequences longer than three bases for mRNA interferases with the use of phage MS2 RNA as a substrate and CspA, an RNA chaperone, which prevents the formation of secondary structures in the RNA substrate. Using this method, we determined that MazF-mt3 cleaves RNA at UU CCU or CU CCU and MazF-mt7 at U CGCU ( indicates the cleavage site). As pentad sequence recognition is more specific than those of previously characterized mRNA interferases, bioinformatics analysis was carried out to identify M. tuberculosis mRNAs that may be resistant to MazF-mt3 and MazF-mt7 cleavage. The pentad sequence was found to be significantly underrepresented in several genes, including members of the PE and PPE families, large families of proteins that play a role in tuberculosis immunity and pathogenesis. These data suggest that MazF-mt3 and MazF-mt7 or other mRNA interferases that target longer RNA sequences may alter protein expression through differential mRNA degradation, a regulatory mechanism that may allow adaptation to environmental conditions, including those encountered by pathogens such as M. tuberculosis during infection.	0
Title: Binding of ISRIB reveals a regulatory site in the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B Abstract: The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved translational and transcriptional program affecting metabolism, memory, and immunity. The ISR is mediated by stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) that attenuates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. A chemical inhibitor of the ISR, ISRIB, reverses the attenuation of eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2α, protecting mice from neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury. We describe a 4.1-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human eIF2B with an ISRIB molecule bound at the interface between the β and δ regulatory subunits. Mutagenesis of residues lining this pocket altered the hierarchical cellular response to ISRIB analogs in vivo and ISRIB binding in vitro. Our findings point to a site in eIF2B that can be exploited by ISRIB to regulate translation.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane-Type Sesquiterpene Esters Abstract: Drimane-type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane-type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a γ-butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster-associated cytochrome P450 and FAD-binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane-type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.	1
Title: High rate of uptake of organic nitrogen compounds by Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria as a key to their dominance in oligotrophic oceanic waters Abstract: Direct evidence that marine cyanobacteria take up organic nitrogen compounds in situ at high rates is reported. About 33% of the total bacterioplankton turnover of amino acids, determined with a representative [(35)S]methionine precursor and flow sorting, can be assigned to Prochlorococcus spp. and 3% can be assigned to Synechococcus spp. in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic parts of the Arabian Sea, respectively. This finding may provide a mechanism for Prochlorococcus' competitive dominance over both strictly autotrophic algae and other bacteria in oligotrophic regions sustained by nutrient remineralization via a microbial loop.	0
Title: Ligand-controlled asymmetric arylation of aliphatic α-amino anion equivalents Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed asymmetric arylation of 9-aminofluorene-derived imines using a chiral dialkylbiaryl phosphine as the supporting ligand has been developed. This transformation allows for enantioselective access to a diverse range of α-branched benzylamines.	0
Title: Insights into Interactions of Mycobacteria with the Host Innate Immune System from a Novel Array of Synthetic Mycobacterial Glycans Abstract: An array of homogeneous glycans representing all the major carbohydrate structures present in the cell wall of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria has been probed with a panel of glycan-binding receptors expressed on cells of the mammalian innate immune system. The results provide an overview of interactions between mycobacterial glycans and receptors that mediate uptake and survival in macrophages, dendritic cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells. A subset of the wide variety of glycan structures present on mycobacterial surfaces interact with cells of the innate immune system through the receptors tested. Endocytic receptors, including the mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, langerin, and DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN), interact predominantly with mannose-containing caps found on the mycobacterial polysaccharide lipoarabinomannan. Some of these receptors also interact with phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides and mannose-containing phenolic glycolipids. Many glycans are ligands for overlapping sets of receptors, suggesting multiple, redundant routes by which mycobacteria can enter cells. Receptors with signaling capability interact with two distinct sets of mycobacterial glycans: targets for dectin-2 overlap with ligands for the mannose-binding endocytic receptors, while mincle binds exclusively to trehalose-containing structures such as trehalose dimycolate. None of the receptors surveyed bind furanose residues, which often form part of the epitopes recognized by antibodies to mycobacteria. Thus, the innate and adaptive immune systems can target different sets of mycobacterial glycans. This array, the first of its kind, represents an important new tool for probing, at a molecular level, biological roles of a broad range of mycobacterial glycans, a task that has not previously been possible.	0
Title: Papillomaviruses--to vaccination and beyond Abstract: High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 DNAs were initially identified in 1983-1984. Subsequently the DNA of several other high risk HPV types has been identified. HPV 16 is present in more than 50% of cervical cancer biopsies, and HPV 18 is close to 20%. Some geographic variations exist in the prevalence of HPV high risk types: e.g. HPV 45 is more frequently observed in equatorial Africa, whereas types 58 and 52 have been more often found in East Asia. Molecular as well as epidemiological studies demonstrate that high risk HPV are indeed the causative agents for cervical cancer, they are also involved in other anogenital cancers, and in 25-30% of oropharyngeal carcinomas. Some of the mechanistic aspects are discussed in this review.	0
Title: Diversity and seasonality of bioluminescent Vibrio cholerae populations in Chesapeake Bay Abstract: Association of luminescence with phenotypic and genotypic traits and with environmental parameters was determined for 278 strains of Vibrio cholerae isolated from the Chesapeake Bay during 1998 to 2000. Three clusters of luminescent strains (A, B, and C) and two nonluminescent clusters (X and Y) were identified among 180 clonal types. V. cholerae O1 strains isolated during pandemics and endemic cholera in the Ganges Delta were related to cluster Y. Heat-stable enterotoxin (encoded by stn) and the membrane protein associated with bile resistance (encoded by ompU) were found to be linked to luminescence in strains of cluster A. Succession from nonluminescent to luminescent populations of V. cholerae occurred during spring to midsummer. Occurrence of cluster A strains in water with neutral pH was contrasted with that of cluster Y strains in water with a pH of >8. Cluster A was found to be associated with a specific calanoid population cooccurring with cyclopoids. Cluster B was related to cluster Y, with its maximal prevalence at pH 8. Occurrence of cluster B strains was more frequent with warmer water temperatures and negatively correlated with maturity of the copepod community. It is concluded that each cluster of luminescent V. cholerae strains occupies a distinct ecological niche. Since the dynamics of these niche-specific subpopulations are associated with zooplankton community composition, the ecology of luminescent V. cholerae is concluded to be related to its interaction with copepods and related crustacean species.	0
Title: A stereoselective vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase in bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: Halogenases catalyze reactions that introduce halogen atoms into electron-rich organic molecules. Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases are generally considered to be promiscuous halogenating enzymes that have thus far been derived exclusively from eukaryotes, where their cellular function is often disputed. We now report the first biochemical characterization of a bacterial vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase, NapH1 from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525, which catalyzes a highly stereoselective chlorination-cyclization reaction in napyradiomycin antibiotic biosynthesis. This finding biochemically links a vanadium chloroperoxidase to microbial natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Regulation of secondary metabolism by chromatin structure and epigenetic codes Abstract: Chromatin, composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, is the relevant substrate for all genetic processes in eukaryotic nuclei. Changes in chromatin structure are associated with the activation and silencing of gene transcription and reversible post-translational modifications of histones are now known to direct chromatin structure transitions. Recent studies in several fungal species have identified a chromatin-based regulation of secondary metabolism (SM) gene clusters representing an upper-hierarchical level for the coordinated control of large chromosomal elements. Regulation by chromatin transition processes provides a mechanistic model to explain how different SM clusters located at dispersed genomic regions can be simultaneously silenced during primary metabolism. Activation of SM clusters has been shown to be associated with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and, consequently, inhibition of histone de-acetylase activities also leads to increased production of secondary metabolites. New findings suggest that SM clusters are silenced by heterochromatic histone marks and that the "closed" heterochromatic structures are reversed during SM activation. This process is mediated by the conserved activator of SM, LaeA. Despite the increase in knowledge about these processes, much remains to be learned from chromatin-level regulation of SM. For example, which proteins "position" the chromatin restructuring signal onto SM clusters or how exactly LaeA works to mediate the low level of heterochromatic marks inside different clusters remain open questions. Answers to these and other chromatin-related questions would certainly complete our understanding of SM gene regulation and signaling and, because for many predicted SM clusters corresponding products have not been identified so far, anti-silencing strategies would open new ways for the identification of novel bioactive substances.	0
Title: Controlled proteolysis of the purified Ca2+-ATPase of the erythrocyte membrane. A correlation between the structure and the function of the enzyme Abstract: The purified Ca2+-pumping ATPase of the erythrocyte plasma membrane has been subjected to a controlled proteolytic treatment with trypsin. The treatment has been previously shown to shift the enzyme from low to high Ca2+ affinity in the absence of calmodulin. The treatment leads to the fragmentation of the ATPase molecule into a number of products and to the accumulation of major limit polypeptides having Mr of 14,000, 28,000, 33,500, 48,000, and 76,000. The 33,500 Mr fragment reacts with 3(trifluoromethyl)-3 (m-[125I]iodophenyl)-diazirine, suggesting that it contains intramembrane regions of the enzyme. A number of minor fragmentation products were also formed, among them a polypeptide of Mr = 90,000 which is rapidly degraded further and a limit polypeptide of Mr about 25,000. [125I]Iodoazidocalmodulin cross-linked only to the original ATPase and to the fragments with Mr = 90,000 and Mr about 25,000. The Mr = 90,000 fragment can be isolated on calmodulin-Sepharose and on phenothiazine affinity columns. It retains the functional properties of the intact pump; it has a calmodulin-responsive ATPase activity and it actively accumulates Ca2+ upon incorporation into liposomes. Further proteolysis of the Mr = 90,000 fragment produces a fragment of Mr = 81,000-76,000 which forms an acylphosphate intermediate, which does not bind to calmodulin-Sepharose, and which seems to be responsible for the calmodulin-insensitive activity which appears as it is produced. A model is presented which postulates a major and a minor degradation pattern and rationalizes the pattern of proteolysis and of the [125I]iodoazidocalmodulin binding observed.	0
Title: Lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis: sequence of biosynthetic gene cluster and identification of a novel aromatic prenyltransferase Abstract: The lyngbyatoxins are potent skin irritants produced by Lyngbya majuscula and cause a condition known as "Swimmer's Itch" off Honolulu, HI. Reported is the molecular cloning of the lyngbyatoxin (ltx) biosynthetic gene cluster from L. majuscula using a strategy based on its predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly. The biosynthetic gene cluster spans 11.3 kilobase pairs and encodes for a two-module NRPS (LtxA), a P450 monooxygenase (LtxB), an aromatic prenyltransferase (LtxC), and an oxidase/reductase protein (LtxD). LtxC was heterologously produced and purified from E. coli and shown to catalyze the transfer of a geranyl group to (-)-indolactam V as the final step in the biosynthesis of lyngbyatoxin A.	1
Title: Re-expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin abrogates the malignant phenotype of breast carcinoma cells Abstract: To assess the role of altered alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression in breast cancer, we expressed the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin de novo in a poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma that expressed no detectable alpha 2-integrin subunit. Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin resulted in a dramatic phenotypic alteration from a fibroblastoid, spindle-shaped, non-contact-inhibited, motile, and invasive cell to an epithelioid, polygonal-shaped, contact-inhibited, less motile, and less invasive cell. Although expression of the alpha 2 subunit did not alter adhesion to collagen, it profoundly altered cell spreading. Re-expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin restored the ability to differentiate into gland-like structures in three-dimensional matrices and markedly reduced the in vivo tumorigenicity of the cells. These results indicate that the consequences of diminished alpha 2 beta 1-integrin expression in the development of breast cancer and, presumably, of other epithelial malignancies are increased tumorigenicity and loss of the differentiated epithelial phenotype.	0
Title: Stable tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions Abstract: Three-component coupling reactions between trialkylphosphines, methyl propiolates, and aldehydes produced 1:1:1 dipolar adducts in moderate-to-excellent yields. The product phosphonium enolate zwitterions were isolated as crystalline solids. X-ray crystallographic analyses of these single crystals established unequivocally the dipolar structures of these tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions. Because phosphonium enolates are the first key intermediates in the nucleophilic phosphine-mediated catalysis of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, this study provides crucial insight into the mechanisms of Morita–Baylis–Hillman-type reactions.	0
Title: Cell surface display yields evolvable, clickable antibody fragments Abstract: Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provide powerful tools for engineering the chemical and physical properties of proteins. However, introducing ncAAs into proteins can affect protein properties in unpredictable ways, thus necessitating screening efforts to identify mutants with desirable properties. In this work, we describe an Escherichia coli cell surface display platform for the directed evolution of clickable antibody fragments. This platform enabled isolation of antibody fragments with improved digoxigenin binding and modest affinity maturation in several different ncAA contexts. Azide-functionalized fragments exhibited improved binding kinetics relative to their methionine counterparts, facile chemical modification through azide-alkyne cycloaddition, and retention of binding properties after modification. The results described here suggest new possibilities for protein engineering, including modulation of molecular recognition events by ncAAs and direct screening of libraries of chemically modified proteins.	0
Title: Photocleavable peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates for protein kinase assays by MALDI-TOF MS Abstract: Robust methods for highly parallel, quantitative analysis of cellular protein tyrosine kinase activities may provide tools critically needed to decipher oncogenic signaling, discover new targeted drugs, diagnose cancer and monitor patients. Here, we describe proof-of-principle for a novel protein kinase assay with the potential to help overcome these challenges. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provides an ideal tool for label-free multiplexed analysis of peptide phosphorylation, but is poorly matched to homogeneous assays and complex samples. Thus, we conjugated a common oligonucleotide tag to multiple peptide substrates, offering efficient capture from solution-phase kinase reactions by annealing to the complementary sequence tethered to PEG-passivated superparamagnetic microparticles. To enable reversible conjugation, we developed a novel bifunctional cross-linker allowing simple and efficient preparation of photocleavable peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates. After washing away contaminants and following photorelease, MALDI-TOF analysis yielded relative phosphorylation of each peptide with high sensitivity and specificity. Validating the hybridization-mediated multiplexed kinase assay, when three peptide substrate-oligonucleotide conjugates were mixed with the tyrosine kinase c-Abl and ATP, we readily observed their differential phosphorylation yet measured a common IC(50) for the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib. This new assay enables analysis of protein kinase activities in a multiplexed format amenable to screening inhibitors against multiple kinases in parallel, an important capability for drug discovery and predictive diagnostics.	0
Title: Mitochondrial-targeted fatty acid analog induces apoptosis with selective loss of mitochondrial glutathione in promyelocytic leukemia cells Abstract: Some fatty acids and derivatives are known to induce cell death in cancer cells. Mitochondria may have important roles in the death process. Therefore, we investigated the mitochondrial contribution in cell death induced by a modified fatty acid, tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), which cannot be beta-oxidized. TTA treatment induced apoptosis in IPC-81 leukemia cells via depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi) and early release of cytochrome c, accompanied by depletion of mitochondrial glutathione. Caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) occurred at a late stage, but the broad-spectra caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not block TTA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 partially prevented TTA-induced apoptosis, whereas cAMP-induced cell death was completely blocked. In conclusion, TTA seems to trigger apoptosis through mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms and selective modulation of the mitochondrial redox equilibrium.	0
Title: Response surface methodology for ultrasound-assisted extraction of astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis Abstract: Astaxanthin is a novel carotenoid nutraceutical occurring in many crustaceans and red yeasts. It has exhibited various biological activities including prevention or amelioration of cardiovascular disease, gastric ulcer, hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy. In this study, ultrasound-assisted extraction was developed for the effective extraction of astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis. Some parameters such as extraction solvent, liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction temperature, and extraction time were optimized by single-factor experiment and response surface methodology. The optimal extraction conditions were 48.0% ethanol in ethyl acetate, the liquid-to-solid ratio was 20:1 (mL/g), and extraction for 16.0 min at 41.1 °C under ultrasound irradiation of 200 W. Under optimal conditions, the yield of astaxanthin was 27.58 ± 0.40 mg/g. The results obtained are beneficial for the full utilization of Haematococcus pluvialis, which also indicated that ultrasound-assisted extraction is a very useful method for extracting astaxanthin from marine life.	0
Title: Highly Versatile β-C(sp3)-H Iodination of Ketones Using a Practical Auxiliary Abstract: The first example of palladium(II)-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-H iodination of a wide range of ketones using a commercially available aminooxyacetic acid auxiliary has been achieved. This L, X-type directing group overcomes the limitations of the transient directing group approach for C(sp3)-H functionalization of ketones. Practical advantages of this method include simple installation of the auxiliary without chromatography, exceptional tolerance of α-functional groups, as well as alkenes and alkynes, and rapid access to diverse sterically hindered quaternary centers.	0
Title: Late-Stage Terpene Cyclization by an Integral Membrane Cyclase in the Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Epoxycyclohexenone Natural Products Abstract: Macrophorins are representative examples of isoprenoid epoxycyclohexenones containing cyclized drimane moieties. We located and characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster of macrophorin from Penicillium terrestris. MacJ encoded by this cluster was characterized to be the first example of a membrane-bound type-II terpene cyclase catalyzing the cyclization of meroterpenoids via direct protonation of the terminal olefinic bond in acyclic yanuthones. The late-stage functionalization and substrate promiscuity of MacJ make it a potential biocatalyst for the synthesis of macrophorin analogues.	1
Title: Draft genome of Omphalotus olearius provides a predictive framework for sesquiterpenoid natural product biosynthesis in Basidiomycota Abstract: The secondary metabolome of Basidiomycota represents a largely uncharacterized source of pharmaceutically relevant natural products. Terpenoids are the primary class of bioactive compounds isolated from mushrooms. The Jack O'Lantern mushroom Omphalotus olearius was identified 50 years ago as a prolific producer of anticancer illudin sesquiterpenoids; however, to date there have been exceptionally few studies into the biosynthesis of these important compounds. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of O. olearius, which reveals a diverse network of sesquiterpene synthases and two metabolic gene clusters associated with illudin biosynthesis. Characterization of the sesquiterpene synthases enabled a comprehensive survey of all currently available Basidiomycota genomes, thereby creating a predictive resource for terpenoid natural product biosynthesis in these organisms. Our results will facilitate discovery and biosynthetic production of unique pharmaceutically relevant bioactive compounds from Basidiomycota.	0
Title: Intermolecular Anti-Markovnikov Hydroamination of Unactivated Alkenes with Sulfonamides Enabled by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Abstract: Here we report a catalytic method for the intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated alkenes using primary and secondary sulfonamides. These reactions occur at room temperature under visible light irradiation and are jointly catalyzed by an iridium(III) photocatalyst, a dialkyl phosphate base, and a thiol hydrogen atom donor. Reaction outcomes are consistent with the intermediacy of an N-centered sulfonamidyl radical generated via proton-coupled electron transfer activation of the sulfonamide N-H bond. Studies outlining the synthetic scope (>60 examples) and mechanistic features of the reaction are presented.	0
Title: Role refinement of melanin synthesis genes by gene knockout reveals their functional diversity in Pyricularia oryzae strains Abstract: Pyricularia oryzae is a plant pathogenic fungus that severely affects rice production. Past studies, primarily using mutants generated by spontaneous mutations or artificial physical and chemical mutagenesis, have determined that melanin is required for appressorium turgor, penetration, and virulence of P. oryzae. However, these roles need to be verified by gene knockout and/or overexpression in different strains considering the potential differences in the level of virulence. Here, we confirmed the indispensable roles of melanin in the development and virulence of P. oryzae by knocking out and over-expressing three melanin synthesis genes (ALB1, RSY1, and BUF1) in two wild-type strains (Guy11 and 70-15). Deletion of ALB1, RSY1, or BUF1 led to loss of melanin and virulence in both strains. ALB1, RSY1 and BUF1 in Guy11, and BUF1 in 70-15 were required for conidiation, respectively. ALB1, RSY1, and BUF1 were required for conidial resistance to environmental stresses (UV exposure, oxidization, and freezing damage) in both strains. Guy11 cells had greater amounts of melanin and more transcripts of melanin synthesis genes than 70-15 cells. Paired culture experiments between the deletion or over-expression mutants of melanin synthesis genes suggested that the reaction catalyzed by Buf1, but not Alb1 and Rsy1, was likely a rate-limiting step in melanin biosynthesis in 70-15. These results expand our understanding on melanin and its synthesis genes in P. oryzae as well as its responses to biotic and abiotic environments.	1
Title: Genes involved in self-protection against the lantibiotic subtilin produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 Abstract: Subtilin is a ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Recently, we reported regarding genes spaB, spaT, and spaC (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, N. Schnell, and K.-D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:132-142, 1992) which are involved in the biosynthesis of subtilin, and genes spaR and spaK (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, and K.-D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:296-303, 1993), which regulate subtilin biosynthesis via a histidine kinase/response regulator system. Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of three additional open reading frames, spaI, spaF, and spaG, downstream of the structural gene spaS. The spaI gene encodes a hydrophilic 19.3-kDa lipoprotein containing a consensus signal sequence, indicating that this protein might be membrane anchored. A similar gene, nisI, has been identified in the nisin producer. SpaF shows strong homology to members of the family of ABC transporters. spaG encodes a hydrophobic protein which might form the active transporter together with SpaF. Gene disruption mutants in all three genes were still able to produce subtilin; however, these mutants were more sensitive to subtilin than the wild-type strain. These results show that these genes are involved in the immunity mechanism of the producer strain. A similar involvement of an ABC transporter in the self-protection mechanism has been described for the McbE and McbF transporter, which confers immunity against microcin B17 in Escherichia coli. Mutants containing mutations in the genes spaR and spaK, which are responsible for regulation of subtilin biosynthesis, also became more sensitive to subtilin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the gene cluster encoding arthrofactin synthetase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 Abstract: Arthrofactin is a potent cyclic lipopeptide-type biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas sp. MIS38. In this work, an arthrofactin synthetase gene cluster (arf) spanning 38.7 kb was cloned and characterized. Three genes termed arfA, arfB, and arfC encode ArfA, ArfB, and ArfC, containing two, four, and five functional modules, respectively. Each module bears condensation, adenylation, and thiolation domains, like other nonribosomal peptide synthetases. However, unlike most of them, none of the 11 modules possess the epimerization domain responsible for the conversion of amino acid residues from L to D form. Possible L- and D-Leu adenylation domains specifically recognized only L-Leu. Moreover, two thioesterase domains are tandemly located at the C-terminal end of ArfC. These results suggest that ArfA, ArfB, and ArfC assemble to form a unique structure. Gene disruption of arfB impaired arthrofactin production, reduced swarming activity, and enhanced biofilm formation.	1
Title: Identification of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase responsible for biosynthesis of the potential anti-cancer drug sansalvamide in Fusarium solani Abstract: Sansalvamide is a cyclic pentadepsipeptide produced by Fusarium solani and has shown promising results as potential anti-cancer drug. The biosynthetic pathway has until now remained unidentified, but here we used an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) approach to generate knockout mutants of two candidate non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS29 and NRPS30). Comparative studies of secondary metabolites in the two deletion mutants and wild type confirmed the absence of sansalvamide in the NRPS30 deletion mutant, implicating this synthetase in the biosynthetic pathway for sansalvamide. Sansalvamide is structurally related to the cyclic hexadepsipeptide destruxin, which both contain an α-hydroxyisocaproic acid (HICA) unit. A gene cluster responsible for destruxin production has previously been identified in Metarhizium robertsii together with a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway. Using comparative bioinformatic analyses of the catalytic domains in the destruxin and sansalvamide NRPSs, we were able to propose a model for sansalvamide biosynthesis. Orthologues of the gene clusters were also identified in species from several other genera including Acremonium chrysogenum and Trichoderma virens, which suggests that the ability to produce compounds related to destruxin and sansalvamide is widespread.	1
Title: Polymeric Nanoparticles Amenable to Simultaneous Installation of Exterior Targeting and Interior Therapeutic Proteins Abstract: Effective delivery of therapeutic proteins is a formidable challenge. Herein, using a unique polymer family with a wide-ranging set of cationic and hydrophobic features, we developed a novel nanoparticle (NP) platform capable of installing protein ligands on the particle surface and simultaneously carrying therapeutic proteins inside by a self-assembly procedure. The loaded therapeutic proteins (e.g., insulin) within the NPs exhibited sustained and tunable release, while the surface-coated protein ligands (e.g., transferrin) were demonstrated to alter the NP cellular behaviors. In vivo results revealed that the transferrin-coated NPs can effectively be transported across the intestinal epithelium for oral insulin delivery, leading to a notable hypoglycemic response.	0
Title: Microbial features of mature and abandoned soils in refractory clay deposits Abstract: Processes of soil restoration in anthropogenically disturbed soils is an urgent topic in modern ecology and nature management. Being mediator between mineral soil composition and plant vegetation, soil microbial community is important factor of soil restoration processes. Analysis of main soil nutrition components followed by 16S amplicon sequencing are sufficient methods for primary analysis of novel locations. Here is the primary analysis in a novel location in Northwest Europe (Russia). Main nutrition parameters (pH, P, Na and NH4+) and 16S rDNA Illumina amplicons were explored in abandoned soils from sandy pit quarry (2 sites) and refractory clay mining dumps (4 sites).Microbial communities of mature soils and dumps are variable and different in terms both nutritional and microbial components. pH, N and TOC are strong predictors for microbial composition. Dumps of refractory clays pQ_2 are non-developed soils, highly acidic and form specific microbial community. Differences between dumps and mature soils in both pre-quaternary and quaternary soils are connected with specific bacterial taxa. Those taxa are connected more with plant composition, not the soil properties themselves. The exact changes in microbial community are unique for different soils and areas.	0
Title: Genome-Guided Discovery of the First Myxobacterial Biarylitide Myxarylin Reveals Distinct C-N Biaryl Crosslinking in RiPP Biosynthesis Abstract: Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a structurally diverse group of natural products. They feature a wide range of intriguing post-translational modifications, as exemplified by the biarylitides. These are a family of cyclic tripeptides found in Planomonospora, carrying a biaryl linkage between two aromatic amino acids. Recent genomic analyses revealed that the minimal biosynthetic prerequisite of biarylitide biosynthesis consists of only one ribosomally synthesized pentapeptide precursor as the substrate and a modifying cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme. In silico analyses revealed that minimal biarylitide RiPP clusters are widespread among natural product producers across phylogenetic borders, including myxobacteria. We report here the genome-guided discovery of the first myxobacterial biarylitide MeYLH, termed Myxarylin, from Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48. Myxarylin was found to be an N-methylated tripeptide that surprisingly exhibits a C-N biaryl crosslink. In contrast to Myxarylin, previously isolated biarylitides are N-acetylated tripeptides that feature a C-C biaryl crosslink. Furthermore, the formation of Myxarylin was confirmed by the heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes in Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. These findings expand the structural and biosynthetic scope of biarylitide-type RiPPs and emphasize the distinct biochemistry found in the myxobacterial realm.	1
Title: Identification of the nusB gene product of Escherichia coli Abstract: Escherichia coli nusB mutants fail to support the activity of a phage lambda gene product, pN, which regulates phage gene expression by influencing transcription termination. We report the identification of the nusB protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a 14,500 dalton protein.	0
Title: Time-resolved dehydration-induced structural changes in an intact bovine cortical bone revealed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy Abstract: Understanding the structure and structural changes of bone, a highly heterogeneous material with a complex hierarchical architecture, continues to be a significant challenge even for high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy. While it is known that dehydration affects mechanical properties of bone by decreasing its strength and toughness, the underlying structural mechanism at the atomic level is unknown. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy, controlled dehydration, and H/D exchange were used for the first time to reveal the structural changes of an intact piece of bovine cortical bone. (1)H spectra were used to monitor the dehydration of the bone inside the rotor, and high-resolution (13)C chemical shift spectra obtained under magic-angle spinning were used evaluate the dehydration-induced conformational changes in the bone. The experiments revealed the slow denaturation of collagen due to dehydration while the trans-Xaa-Pro conformation in collagen remained unchanged. Our results suggest that glycosaminoglycans in the collagen fiber and mineral interface may chelate with a Ca(2+) ion present on the surface of the mineral through sulfate or carboxylate groups. These results provide insights into the role of water molecules in the bone structure and shed light on the relationship between the structure and mechanics of bone.	0
Title: Design and synthesis of active heparan sulfate-based probes Abstract: A chemoenzymatic approach for synthesizing heparan sulfate oligosaccharides with a reactive diazoacetyl saccharide residue is reported. The resultant oligosaccharides were demonstrated to serve as specific inhibitors for heparan sulfate sulfotransferases, offering a new set of tools to probe the structural selectivity for heparan sulfate-binding proteins.	0
Title: Roles of the pH signaling transcription factor PacC in Wangiella (Exophiala) dermatitidis Abstract: To study the function of the PacC transcription factor in Wangiella dermatitidis, a black, polymorphic fungal pathogen of humans with yeast-phase predominance, the PACC gene was cloned, sequenced, disrupted and expressed. Three zinc finger DNA-binding motifs were found at the N-terminus, and a signaling protease cleavage site at the C-terminus. PACC was more expressed at neutral-alkaline pH than at acidic pH. Truncation at about 40 residues of the coding sequence upstream of the conserved protease processing cleavage site of PacC affected growth on a nutrient-rich medium, increased sensitivity to Na(+) stress, decreased yeast growth at neutral-alkaline pH, and repressed hyphal growth on a nutrient-poor medium at 25 degrees C. Truncation at the coding sequence for the conserved signaling protease box of PacC impaired growth and reduced RNA expression of the class II chitin synthase gene at acidic pH. The results suggested that PacC is important not only for the adaptation of W. dermatitidis to different ambient pH conditions and Na(+) stress conditions, but also for influencing yeast-hyphal transitions in this agent of phaeohyphomycosis.	0
Title: Exochelin genes in Mycobacterium smegmatis: identification of an ABC transporter and two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes Abstract: Many strains of mycobacteria produce two ferric chelating substances that are termed exochelin (an excreted product) and mycobactin (a cell-associated product). These agents may function as iron acquisition siderophores. To examine the genetics of the iron acquisition system in mycobacteria, ultraviolet (UV) and transposon (Tn611) mutagenesis techniques were used to generate exochelin-deficient mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis strains ATCC 607 and LR222 respectively. Mutants were identified on CAS siderophore detection agar plates. Comparisons of the amounts of CAS-reactive material excreted by the possible mutant strains with that of the wild-type strains verified that seven UV mutant strains and two confirmed transposition mutant strains were deficient in exochelin production. Cell-associated mycobactin production in the mutants appeared to be normal. From the two transposon mutants, the mutated gene regions were cloned and identified by colony hybridization with an IS6100 probe, and the DNA regions flanking the transposon insertion sites were then used as probes to clone the wild-type loci from M. smegmatis LR222 genomic DNA. Complementation assays showed that an 8 kb PstI fragment and a 4.8 kb PstI/SacI subclone of this fragment complemented one transposon mutant (LUN2) and one UV mutant (R92). A 10.1 kb SacI fragment restored exochelin production to the other transposon mutant (LUN1). The nucleotide sequence of the 15.3 kb DNA region that spanned the two transposon insertion sites overlapped the 5' region of the previously reported exochelin biosynthetic gene fxbA and contained three open reading frames that were transcribed in the opposite orientation to fxbA. The corresponding genes were designated exiT, fxbB and fxbC. The deduced amino acid sequence of ExiT suggested that it was a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, while FxbB and FxbC displayed significant homology with many enzymes (including pristinamycin I synthetase) that catalyse non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. We propose that the peptide backbone of the siderophore exochelin is synthesized in part by enzymes resembling non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and that the ABC transporter ExiT is responsible for exochelin excretion.	1
Title: Focused Genome Mining of Structurally Related Sesterterpenes: Enzymatic Formation of Enantiomeric and Diastereomeric Products Abstract: Heterologous expression of four clade-A bifunctional terpene synthases (BFTSs), giving di/sesterterpenes with unique polycyclic carbon skeletons such as sesterfisherol, enabled the isolation of the sesterterpenes Bm1, Bm2, Bm3, and Pb1. Their structures suggested that formation of the products occurs via various diastereomeric carbocation intermediates, allowing the proposal that clade-A BFTSs catalyze three-step cyclizations using several stereofacial combinations of allylic cation-olefin pairs in the corresponding intermediates to generate various stereoisomers.	1
Title: Bifunctional Small-Molecule Ligands of K-Ras Induce Its Association with Immunophilin Proteins Abstract: Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of bifunctional chemical ligands that induce the association of Ras with ubiquitously expressed immunophilin proteins such as FKBP12 and cyclophilin A. We show this approach is applicable to two distinct Ras ligand scaffolds, and that both the identity of the immunophilin ligand and the linker chemistry affect compound efficacy in biochemical and cellular contexts. These ligands bind to Ras in an immunophilin-dependent fashion and mediate the formation of tripartite complexes of Ras, immunophilin, and the ligand. The recruitment of cyclophilin A to GTP-bound Ras blocks its interaction with B-Raf in biochemical assays. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of ligand-induced association of Ras with intracellular proteins and suggests it as a promising therapeutic strategy for Ras-driven cancers.	0
Title: Kinetic isolation and characterization of the radical rearrangement step in coenzyme B12-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase Abstract: The transient decay reaction kinetics of the 1,1,2,2-(2)H(4)-aminoethanol generated Co(II)-substrate radical pair catalytic intermediate in ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) from Salmonella typhimurium have been measured by using time-resolved, full-spectrum X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in frozen aqueous solution over the temperature range of 190-207 K. The decay reaction involves sequential passage through the rearrangement step [substrate radical --> product radical] and the step [product radical --> diamagnetic product] that involves hydrogen atom transfer (HT) from carbon C5' of the adenosine moiety of the cofactor to the product radical C2 center. As found for the (1)H-substrate radical [Zhu, C.; Warncke, K. Biophys. J. 2008, 95, 5890], the decay kinetics for the (2)H-substrate radical over 190-207 K represent two noninteracting populations (fast decay population: normalized amplitude = 0.44 +/- 0.07; observed rate constant, k(obs,f) = 5.3 x 10(-5)-1.1 x 10(-3) s(-1); slow decay population: k(obs,s) = 6.1 x 10(-6)-2.9 x 10(-4) s(-1)). The (1)H/(2)H isotope effects (IE) for the fast and slow decay reactions are 1.4 +/- 0.2 and 0.79 +/- 0.11, respectively. The IE on the fast phase is uniform over the temperature interval, and the value is consistent with an alpha-secondary hydrogen kinetic IE, which arises from changes in the force constants of the C-H bonds in the substrate radical structure, upon passing from the substrate radical state to the rearrangement transition state. Therefore, we propose that k(obs,f) represents the rate constant for the radical rearrangement and that this step is the rate-determining step in substrate radical decay. The Arrhenius activation energy for the (1)H-substrate radical rearrangement (13.5 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol) is consistent with values from quantum chemical calculations performed on simple models. The results show that the core, radical rearrangement reaction is culled from the catalytic cycle in the low-temperature system, thus establishing the system for detailed transient kinetic and spectroscopic analysis of protein structural and dynamic contributions to EAL catalysis.	0
Title: Discovery of a novel lantibiotic nisin O from Blautia obeum A2-162, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract Abstract: A novel lanC-like sequence was identified from the dominant human gut bacterium Blautia obeum strain A2-162. This sequence was extended to reveal a putative lantibiotic operon with biosynthetic and transport genes, two sets of regulatory genes, immunity genes, three identical copies of a nisin-like lanA gene with an unusual leader peptide, and a fourth putative lanA gene. Comparison with other nisin clusters showed that the closest relationship was to nisin U. B. obeum A2-162 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Clostridium perfringens when grown on solid medium in the presence of trypsin. Fusions of predicted nsoA structural sequences with the nisin A leader were expressed in Lactococcus lactis containing the nisin A operon without nisA. Expression of the nisA leader sequence fused to the predicted structural nsoA1 produced a growth defect in L. lactis that was dependent upon the presence of biosynthetic genes, but failed to produce antimicrobial activity. Insertion of the nso cluster into L. lactis MG1614 gave an increased immunity to nisin A, but this was not replicated by the expression of nsoI. Nisin A induction of L. lactis containing the nso cluster and nisRK genes allowed detection of the NsoA1 pre-peptide by Western hybridization. When this heterologous producer was grown with nisin induction on solid medium, antimicrobial activity was demonstrated in the presence of trypsin against C. perfringens, Clostridium difficile and L. lactis. This research adds to evidence that lantibiotic production may be an important trait of gut bacteria and could lead to the development of novel treatments for intestinal diseases.	1
Title: Genome mining and biosynthesis of a polyketide from a biofertilizer fungus that can facilitate reductive iron assimilation in plant Abstract: Fungi have the potential to produce a large repertoire of bioactive molecules, many of which can affect the growth and development of plants. Genomic survey of sequenced biofertilizer fungi showed many secondary metabolite gene clusters are anchored by iterative polyketide synthases (IPKSs), which are multidomain enzymes noted for generating diverse small molecules. Focusing on the biofertilizer Trichoderma harzianum t-22, we identified and characterized a cryptic IPKS-containing cluster that synthesizes tricholignan A, a redox-active ortho-hydroquinone. Tricholignan A is shown to reduce Fe(III) and may play a role in promoting plant growth under iron-deficient conditions. The construction of tricholignan by a pair of collaborating IPKSs was investigated using heterologous reconstitution and biochemical studies. A regioselective methylation step is shown to be a key step in formation of the ortho-hydroquinone. The responsible methyltransferase (MT) is fused with an N-terminal pseudo-acyl carrier protein (ψACP), in which the apo state of the ACP is essential for methylation of the growing polyketide chain. The ψACP is proposed to bind to the IPKS and enable the trans MT to access the growing polyketide. Our studies show that a genome-driven approach to discovering bioactive natural products from biofertilizer fungi can lead to unique compounds and biosynthetic knowledge.	1
Title: Functional replacement of the Escherichia coli D-(-)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) with the L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) from Pediococcus acidilactici Abstract: The microbial production of L-(+)-lactic acid is rapidly expanding to allow increased production of polylactic acid (PLA), a renewable, biodegradable plastic. The physical properties of PLA can be tailored for specific applications by controlling the ratio of L-(+) and D-(-) isomers. For most uses of PLA, the L-(+) isomer is more abundant. As an approach to reduce costs associated with biocatalysis (complex nutrients, antibiotics, aeration, product purification, and waste disposal), a recombinant derivative of Escherichia coli W3110 was developed that contains five chromosomal deletions (focA-pflB frdBC adhE ackA ldhA). This strain was constructed from a D-(-)-lactic acid-producing strain, SZ63 (focA-pflB frdBC adhE ackA), by replacing part of the chromosomal ldhA coding region with Pediococcus acidilactici ldhL encoding an L-lactate dehydrogenase. Although the initial strain (SZ79) grew and fermented poorly, a mutant (SZ85) was readily isolated by selecting for improved growth. SZ85 exhibited a 30-fold increase in L-lactate dehydrogenase activity in comparison to SZ79, functionally replacing the native D-lactate dehydrogenase activity. Sequencing revealed mutations in the upstream, coding, and terminator regions of ldhL in SZ85, which are presumed to be responsible for increased L-lactate dehydrogenase activity. SZ85 produced L-lactic acid in M9 mineral salts medium containing glucose or xylose with a yield of 93 to 95%, a purity of 98% (based on total fermentation products), and an optical purity greater than 99%. Unlike other recombinant biocatalysts for L-lactic acid, SZ85 remained prototrophic and is devoid of plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes.	0
Title: New Tetramic Acids Comprising of Decalin and Pyridones From Chaetomium olivaceum SD-80A With Antimicrobial Activity Abstract: Cycloaddition reactions such as intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) are extremely important in constructing multicyclic scaffolds with diverse bioactivities. Using MycB as a biomarker, three new polyketides - Chaetolivacines A (1), B (3), and C (4) - with one known compound Myceliothermophin E (2) comprising of decalin and 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones were obtained from the culture of Chaetomium olivaceum SD-80A under the guidance of gene mining. The structures of these compounds were established using detailed 1D, 2D NMR, and high-resolution electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS) analysis. The relative and absolute configurations of the compounds 1, 3, and 4 were elucidated by NOESY and ECD. The biosynthesis pathways of these compounds were proposed, which involves in three key genes ChaA [polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (PKS-NRPS)], ChaB, and ChaC. Compounds 1-4 were tested for their antimicrobial activities, and compounds 2 and 3 showed moderate bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with MIC values of 15.8 and 27.1 μM. The results showed that configuration of C-21 in 3 and 4 is important for anti-SA and anti-MRSA activities. This study reveals the significant potential of the genus Chaetomium in producing new PKS-NRPS, therefore increasing the speed in the mining for new sources of antimicrobial agents.	1
Title: Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine Abstract: Disease-causing mutations occur in genes for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. That some mutations are dominant suggests a gain of function. Native tRNA synthetases, such as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, catalyze aminoacylation and are also procytokines that are activated by natural fragmentation. In principle, however, gain-of-function phenotypes could arise from mutational activation of synthetase procytokines. From crystal structure analysis, we hypothesized that a steric block of a critical Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif in full-length TyrRS suppresses the cytokine activity of a natural fragment. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to uncover ELR in the procytokine by mutating a conserved tyrosine (Y341) that tethers ELR. Site-specific proteolytic cleavage and small-angle X-ray scattering established subtle opening of the structure by the mutation. Strikingly, four different assays demonstrated mutational activation of cytokine functions. The results prove the possibilities for constitutive gain-of-function mutations in tRNA synthetases.	0
Title: Ligand-Enabled Monoselective β-C(sp3)-H Acyloxylation of Free Carboxylic Acids Using a Practical Oxidant Abstract: The development of C-H activation reactions that use inexpensive and practical oxidants remains a significant challenge. Until our recent disclosure of the β-lactonization of free aliphatic acids, the use of peroxides in C-H activation reactions directed by weakly coordinating native functional groups was unreported. Herein, we report C(sp3)-H β-acetoxylation and γ-, δ-, and ε-lactonization reactions of free carboxylic acids enabled by a novel cyclopentane-based mono-N-protected β-amino acid ligand. Notably, tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide is used as the sole oxidant for these reactions. This reaction has several key advantages over other C-H activation protocols: (1) exclusive monoselectivity was observed in the presence of two α-methyl groups; (2) aliphatic carboxylic acids containing α-hydrogens are compatible with this protocol; (3) lactonization of free acids, affording γ-, δ-, or ε-lactones, has been achieved for the first time.	0
Title: Periplasmic Cytophaga hutchinsonii Endoglucanases Are Required for Use of Crystalline Cellulose as the Sole Source of Carbon and Energy Abstract: The soil bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii actively digests crystalline cellulose by a poorly understood mechanism. Genome analyses identified nine genes predicted to encode endoglucanases with roles in this process. No predicted cellobiohydrolases, which are usually involved in the utilization of crystalline cellulose, were identified. Chromosomal deletions were performed in eight of the endoglucanase-encoding genes: cel5A, cel5B, cel5C, cel9A, cel9B, cel9C, cel9E, and cel9F Each mutant retained the ability to digest crystalline cellulose, although the deletion of cel9C caused a modest decrease in cellulose utilization. Strains with multiple deletions were constructed to identify the critical cellulases. Cells of a mutant lacking both cel5B and cel9C were completely deficient in growth on cellulose. Cell fractionation and biochemical analyses indicate that Cel5B and Cel9C are periplasmic nonprocessive endoglucanases. The requirement of periplasmic endoglucanases for cellulose utilization suggests that cellodextrins are transported across the outer membrane during this process. Bioinformatic analyses predict that Cel5A, Cel9A, Cel9B, Cel9D, and Cel9E are secreted across the outer membrane by the type IX secretion system, which has been linked to cellulose utilization. These secreted endoglucanases may perform the initial digestion within amorphous regions on the cellulose fibers, releasing oligomers that are transported into the periplasm for further digestion by Cel5B and Cel9C. The results suggest that both cell surface and periplasmic endoglucanases are required for the growth of C. hutchinsonii on cellulose and that novel cell surface proteins may solubilize and transport cellodextrins across the outer membrane.                  Importance:                       The bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii digests crystalline cellulose by an unknown mechanism. It lacks processive cellobiohydrolases that are often involved in cellulose digestion. Critical cellulolytic enzymes were identified by genetic analyses. Intracellular (periplasmic) nonprocessive endoglucanases performed an important role in cellulose utilization. The results suggest a model involving partial digestion at the cell surface, solubilization and uptake of cellodextrins across the outer membrane by an unknown mechanism, and further digestion within the periplasm. The ability to sequester cellodextrins and digest them intracellularly may limit losses of soluble cellobiose to other organisms. C. hutchinsonii uses an unusual approach to digest cellulose and is a potential source of novel proteins to increase the efficiency of conversion of cellulose into soluble sugars and biofuels.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from closely related Rhynchosporium species reveals extensive intron invasion Abstract: We sequenced and annotated the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of four closely related Rhynchosporium species that diverged ∼14,000-35,000years ago. During this time frame, three of the mt genomes expanded significantly due to an invasion of introns into three genes (cox1, cox2, and nad5). The enlarged mt genomes contained ∼40% introns compared to 8.1% in uninvaded relatives. Many intron gains were accompanied by co-conversion of flanking exonic regions. The comparative analysis revealed a highly variable set of non-intronic, free-standing ORFs of unknown function (uORFs). This is consistent with a rapidly evolving accessory compartment in the mt genome of these closely related species. Only one free-standing uORF was shared among all mt genomes analyzed. This uORF had a mutation rate similar to the core mt protein-encoding genes, suggesting conservation of function among the species. The nucleotide composition of the core protein-encoding genes significantly differed from those of introns and uORFs. The mt mutation rate was 77 times higher than the nuclear mutation rate, indicating that the phylogeny inferred from mt genes may better resolve the phylogenetic relationships among closely related Rhynchosporium species than phylogenies inferred from nuclear genes.	0
Title: Genetic and Functional Analysis of the Biosynthesis of a Non-Ribosomal Peptide Siderophore in Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 Abstract: B. xenovorans LB400 is a model bacterium for the study of the metabolism of aromatic compounds. The aim of this study was the genomic and functional characterization of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase containing gene cluster that encodes a siderophore in B. xenovorans LB400. The mba gene cluster from strain LB400 encodes proteins involved in the biosynthesis and transport of a hydroxamate-type siderophore. Strain LB400 has a unique mba gene organization, although mba gene clusters have been observed in diverse Burkholderiales. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of promoters in the mba gene cluster that strongly suggest regulation by the ferric uptake regulator protein (Fur) and by the alternative RNA polymerase extracytoplasmic function sigma factor MbaF. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses showed the expression of iron-regulated transcriptional units mbaFGHIJKL, mbaN, mbaABCE, mbaO, mbaP and mbaD genes under iron limitation. Chrome azurol S (CAS) assay strongly suggests that strain LB400 synthesized a siderophore under iron limitation. Mass spectrometry ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses revealed that the siderophore is a non-ribosomal peptide, and forms an iron complex with a molecular mass of 676 Da. Based on bioinformatic prediction, CAS assay and MS analyses, we propose that the siderophore is L-Nδ-hydroxy-Nδ-formylOrn-D-β-hydroxyAsp-L-Ser-L-Nδ-hydroxy-Nδ-formylOrn-1,4-diaminobutane that is closely related to malleobactin-type siderophores reported in B. thailandensis.	1
Title: Impact of the Staphylococcus epidermidis LytSR two-component regulatory system on murein hydrolase activity, pyruvate utilization and global transcriptional profile Abstract: Background:                       Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, mainly because of its ability to colonize implanted biomaterials by forming a biofilm. Extensive studies are focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation. The LytSR two-component regulatory system regulates autolysis and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. However, the role of LytSR played in S. epidermidis remained unknown.                  Results:                       In the present study, we demonstrated that lytSR knock-out in S. epidermidis did not alter susceptibility to Triton X-100 induced autolysis. Quantitative murein hydrolase assay indicated that disruption of lytSR in S. epidermidis resulted in decreased activities of extracellular murein hydrolases, although zymogram showed no apparent differences in murein hydrolase patterns between S. epidermidis strain 1457 and its lytSR mutant. Compared to the wild-type counterpart, 1457ΔlytSR produced slightly more biofilm, with significantly decreased dead cells inside. Microarray analysis showed that lytSR mutation affected the transcription of 164 genes (123 genes were upregulated and 41 genes were downregulated). Specifically, genes encoding proteins responsible for protein synthesis, energy metabolism were downregulated, while genes involved in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid transporters were upregulated. Impaired ability to utilize pyruvate and reduced activity of arginine deiminase was observed in 1457ΔlytSR, which is consistent with the microarray data.                  Conclusions:                       The preliminary results suggest that in S. epidermidis LytSR two-component system regulates extracellular murein hydrolase activity, bacterial cell death and pyruvate utilization. Based on the microarray data, it appears that lytSR inactivation induces a stringent response. In addition, LytSR may indirectly enhance biofilm formation by altering the metabolic status of the bacteria.	0
Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the O-carbamoyltransferase NovN from the novobiocin-biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovN, an O-carbamoyltransferase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallized in two different crystal forms. Crystal form I belonged to space group C2 and native data were collected to 2.9 A resolution in-house. Crystal form II had I-centred orthorhombic symmetry and native data were recorded to a resolution of 2.3 A at a synchrotron. NovN catalyses the final step in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin that targets the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.	1
Title: Sequential action of two flavoenzymes, PgaE and PgaM, in angucycline biosynthesis: chemoenzymatic synthesis of gaudimycin C Abstract: Tailoring steps in aromatic polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis are an important source of structural diversity and, consequently, an intriguing focal point for enzymological studies. PgaE and PgaM from Streptomyces sp. PGA64 are representatives of flavoenzymes catalyzing early post-PKS reactions in angucycline biosynthesis. This in vitro study illustrates that the chemoenzymatic conversion of UWM6 into the metabolite, gaudimycin C, requires multiple closely coupled reactions to prevent intermediate degradation. The NMR structure of gaudimycin C confirms that the reaction cascade involves C12- and C12b-hydroxylation, C2,3-dehydration, and stereospecific ketoreduction at C6. Enzymatic 18O incorporation studies verify that the oxygens at C12 and C12b derive from O2 and H2O, respectively. The results indicate that PgaM deviates mechanistically from flavoprotein monooxygenases, and suggest an alternative catalytic mechanism involving a quinone methide intermediate.	1
Title: Co-linearity and divergence of the A subgenome of Brassica juncea compared with other Brassica species carrying different A subgenomes Abstract: Background:                       There are three basic Brassica genomes (A, B, and C) and three parallel sets of subgenomes distinguished in the diploid Brassica (i.e.: B. rapa, A(r)A(r); B. nigra, B(ni)B(ni); B. oleracea, C(o)C(o)) and the derived allotetraploid species (i.e.: B. juncea, A(j)A(j)B(j)B(j); B. napus, A(n)A(n)C(n)C(n); B. carinata, B(c)B(c)C(c)C(c)). To understand subgenome differentiation in B. juncea in comparison to other A genome-carrying Brassica species (B. rapa and B. napus), we constructed a dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea, and conducted population genetic analysis on diverse lines of the three A-genome carrying Brassica species using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach (DArT-seq).                  Results:                       A dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea was constructed using an F2 population derived from Sichuan Yellow/Purple Mustard. The map included 3329 DArT-seq markers on 18 linkage groups and covered 1579 cM with an average density of two markers per cM. Based on this map and the alignment of the marker sequences with the physical genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we observed strong co-linearity of the ancestral blocks among the different A subgenomes but also considerable block variation. Comparative analyses at the level of genome sequences of B. rapa and B. napus, and marker sequence anchored on the genetic map of B. juncea, revealed a total of 30 potential inversion events across large segments and 20 potential translocation events among the three A subgenomes. Population genetic analysis on 26 accessions of the three A genome-carrying Brassica species showed that the highest genetic distance were estimated when comparing A(j)-A(n) than between A(n)-A(r) and A(j)-A(r) subgenome pairs.                  Conclusions:                       The development of the dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea with informative DArT-seq marker sequences and availability of the reference sequences of the A(r), and A(n)C(n) genomes allowed us to compare the A subgenome structure of B. juncea (A(j)) . Our results suggest that strong co-linearity exists among the three A Brassica genomes (A(r), A(n) and A(j)) but with apparent subgenomic variation. Population genetic analysis on three A-genome carrying Brassica species support the idea that B. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different A genome progenitor of B. napus.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of clavaminate synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus: an unusual oxidative enzyme in natural product biosynthesis Abstract: A pivotal step in the biosynthetic pathway to the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid is the conversion of proclavaminic acid to clavaminic acid in a reaction requiring Fe2+, alpha-ketoglutarate, and oxygen [Elson, S. W., Baggaley, K. H., Gillett, J., Holland, S., Nicholson, N. H., Sime, J. T., & Woroniecki, S. R. (1987) J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1736-1738]. Clavaminate synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes this oxidative cyclization/desaturation, has been purified to homogeneity from clavulanic acid producing cells of Streptomyces clavuligerus (ATCC 27064). The enzyme behaved as a monomer during gel filtration and migrated with Mr 47,000 during denaturing gel electrophoresis. After ion-exchange FPLC two active forms of the protein were resolved that differed slightly in kinetic constants and apparent molecular weight. Kinetic comparisons with the four possible diastereomers of proclavaminate confirmed the absolute configuration of the substrate to be 2S,3R. The stoichiometry of the overall transformation was determined to be proclavaminate + 2(alpha-ketoglutarate) + 2O2----clavaminate + 2(succinate) + 2CO2 + 2H2O. In the absence of proclavaminate a slow decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate and CO2 was observed in an uncoupled reaction which resulted in enzyme inactivation. Steady-state kinetic studies were undertaken for an initial description of the enzyme's catalytic cycle. The double-reciprocal plot with alpha-ketoglutarate as the variable substrate was linear; this supports the proposal that two stepwise oxidations of proclavaminate occur, each with the consumption of alpha-ketoglutarate and oxygen and the release of succinate, CO2, and H2O. The intersecting initial velocity plots obtained from pairwise variation of substrate concentrations were consistent with a sequential kinetic mechanism for the first oxidation. Similarities observed between clavaminate synthase and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases argue for a common mechanism of oxygen activation. However, the nature of the interactions of the substrates in the active site of clavaminate synthase apparently redirects the conventional hydroxylase activity of dioxygenases to the construction of a strained bicyclic skeleton driven by the overall reduction of dioxygen.	1
Title: 7-Step Flow Synthesis of the HIV Integrase Inhibitor Dolutegravir Abstract: Dolutegravir (DTG), an important active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV, has been synthesized in continuous flow. By adapting the reported GlaxoSmithKline process chemistry batch route for Cabotegravir, DTG was produced in 4.5 h in sequential flow operations from commercially available materials. Key features of the synthesis include rapid manufacturing time for pyridone formation, one-step direct amidation of a functionalized pyridone, and telescoping of multiple steps to avoid isolation of intermediates and enable for greater throughput.	0
Title: Landornamides: Antiviral Ornithine-Containing Ribosomal Peptides Discovered through Genome Mining Abstract: Proteusins are a family of bacterial ribosomal peptides that largely remain hypothetical genome-predicted metabolites. The only known members are the polytheonamide-type cytotoxins, which have complex structures due to numerous unusual posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Cyanobacteria contain large numbers of putative proteusin loci. To investigate their chemical and pharmacological potential beyond polytheonamide-type compounds, we characterized landornamide A, the product of the silent osp gene cluster from Kamptonema sp. PCC 6506. Pathway reconstruction in E. coli revealed a peptide combining lanthionines, d-residues, and, unusually, two ornithines introduced by the arginase-like enzyme OspR. Landornamide A inhibited lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mouse cells, thus making it one of the few known anti-arenaviral compounds. These data support proteusins as a rich resource of chemical scaffolds, new maturation enzymes, and bioactivities.	1
Title: Molecular analysis of the rebeccamycin L-amino acid oxidase from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 Abstract: Rebeccamycin, a member of the tryptophan-derived indolocarbazole family, is produced by Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243. The biosynthetic pathway that specifies biosynthesis of this important metabolite is comprised of 11 genes spanning 18 kb of DNA. A presumed early enzyme involved in elaboration of the rebeccamycin aglycone is encoded by rebO, located at the left-hand region of the reb gene cluster. The deduced protein product, RebO (51.9 kDa), is an L-amino acid oxidase (L-AAO) that has 27% identity to an L-AAO from Scomber japonicus (animal, mackerel) and is a member of the family of FAD-dependent oxidase enzymes. In order to study the biochemical properties of this key enzyme, the rebO gene was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization showed that RebO is dimeric, with a molecular mass of approximately 101 kDa. Further analysis revealed that the enzyme contains a noncovalently bound FAD cofactor and is reoxidized at the expense of molecular oxygen by producing one molecule of hydrogen peroxide. Based on kinetic studies, RebO shows significant preference for 7-chloro-L-tryptophan, suggesting its likely role as the natural early pathway substrate. Furthermore, the native RebO enzyme has evident, albeit limited, flexibility as shown by bioconversion studies with unnatural substrates. This work provides the first analysis of a structural enzyme involved in construction of this important class of indolocarbazole natural products.	1
Title: Total synthesis of natural (+)- [corrected] and ent-(-)-4-desacetoxy-6,7-dihydrovindorosine [corrected] and natural and ent-minovine: oxadiazole tandem intramolecular Diels-Alder/1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction Abstract: Efficient and unusually concise total syntheses of both enantiomers of the Aspidosperma alkaloids 4-desacetoxy-6,7-dihydrovindorosine (12) and minovine (1) are detailed. A tandem intramolecular Diels-Alder/1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of the 1,3,4-oxadiazole 8, in which three new rings, four new C-C bonds, and five stereocenters are formed, is a key step in the sequence. The availability of optically active material permitted an assessment of the enantiomeric integrity of minovine and the source of its reported unusual optical rotation. [Reaction: see text]	0
Title: Functional identification of rub52 gene involved in the biosynthesis of rubradirin Abstract: An open reading frame, rub52, has been identified as a gene encoding thymidine diphospho-glucose 2,3-dehydratase by sequence analysis of the rubradirin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces achromogenes var. nibradiris NRRL3061. The gene codes for a protein consisting of 458 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 50862 Da. The gene was amplified and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble His-tagged fusion protein. C-2 deoxygenation functionality of thymidine diphospho-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose was assigned to the rub52 gene product from in vitro enzyme assay.	1
Title: Enzymatic conversion of aclacinomycin A to Y by a specific oxidoreductase in Streptomyces Abstract: A specific oxidoreductase converting aclacinomycin A to a new analog, aclacinomycin Y, was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture filtrate of aclacinomycin-producing microorganisms. The isolated enzyme was a weakly acidic protein (isoelectric point, 5.9) with a molecular weight of about 72,000. The enzymatic reaction requires molecular oxygen and has a pH optimum at 5.5. The enzyme catalyzed an oxidation of the terminal sugar, L-cinerulose, of the trisaccharide moiety of aclacinomycin A to L-aculose (2,3,6-trideoxyhex-2-enopyranos-4-ulose) with removal of two electrons. Studies of substrate specificity revealed that the enzyme is an oxidoreductase capable of modifying anthracyclic triglycosides by oxidizing their terminal sugars.	0
Title: A stand-alone adenylation domain forms amide bonds in streptothricin biosynthesis Abstract: The streptothricin (ST) antibiotics, produced by Streptomyces bacteria, contain L-β-lysine ((3S)-3,6-diaminohexanoic acid) oligopeptides as pendant chains. Here we describe three unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) involved in ST biosynthesis: ORF 5 (a stand-alone adenylation (A) domain), ORF 18 (containing thiolation (T) and condensation (C) domains) and ORF 19 (a stand-alone A domain). We demonstrate that ST biosynthesis begins with adenylation of L-β-lysine by ORF 5, followed by transfer to the T domain of ORF 18. In contrast, L-β-lysine molecules adenylated by ORF 19 are used to elongate an L-β-lysine peptide chain on ORF 18, a reaction unexpectedly catalyzed by ORF 19 itself. Finally, the C domain of ORF 18 catalyzes the condensation of L-β-lysine oligopeptides covalently bound to ORF 18 with a freely diffusible intermediate to release the ST products. These results highlight an unusual activity for an A domain and unique mechanisms of crosstalk within NRPS machinery.	1
Title: Photoredox-Catalyzed Decarboxylative C-Terminal Differentiation for Bulk- and Single-Molecule Proteomics Abstract: Methods for the selective labeling of biogenic functional groups on peptides are being developed and used in the workflow of both current and emerging proteomics technologies, such as single-molecule fluorosequencing. To achieve successful labeling with any one method requires that the peptide fragments contain the functional group for which labeling chemistry is designed. In practice, only two functional groups are present in every peptide fragment regardless of the protein cleavage site, namely, an N-terminal amine and a C-terminal carboxylic acid. Developing a global-labeling technology, therefore, requires one to specifically target the N- and/or C-terminus of peptides. In this work, we showcase the first successful application of photocatalyzed C-terminal decarboxylative alkylation for peptide mass spectrometry and single-molecule protein sequencing that can be broadly applied to any proteome. We demonstrate that peptides in complex mixtures generated from enzymatic digests from bovine serum albumin, as well as protein mixtures from yeast and human cell extracts, can be site-specifically labeled at their C-terminal residue with a Michael acceptor. Using two distinct analytical approaches, we characterize C-terminal labeling efficiencies of greater than 50% across complete proteomes and document the proclivity of various C-terminal amino-acid residues for decarboxylative labeling, showing histidine and tryptophan to be the most disfavored. Finally, we combine C-terminal decarboxylative labeling with an orthogonal carboxylic acid-labeling technology in tandem to establish a new platform for fluorosequencing.	0
Title: Regulation of production of the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol in Pseudomonas fluorescens F113: genetic analysis of phlF as a transcriptional repressor Abstract: The antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol plays a major role in the biocontrol capabilities of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The phloroglucinol biosynthetic locus of P. fluorescens F113 has been isolated previously. From nucleotide sequence data, a putative regulator gene (phlF) was identified upstream and divergently transcribed from the phlACBD phloroglucinol biosynthetic genes. PhlF shows similarity to various transcriptional repressors in the EMBL database and exhibits a helix-turn-helix motif in its amino acid sequence. phlF was cloned into an expression vector and the PhlF protein product was purified. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated PhlF to be a DNA-binding protein and showed that it binds to the phlA-phlF intergenic region. Introduction of phlF into P. fluorescens F113 in multiple copies resulted in repression of phloroglucinol production in this strain. This effect was mediated at the transcription level since the expression of a phloroglucinol biosynthetic gene fusion in this background was equally repressed. Furthermore, the inactivation of phlF results in derepression of phloroglucinol production in this strain.	1
Title: A Peptidyl-Transesterifying Type I Thioesterase in Salinamide Biosynthesis Abstract: Salinamide A belongs to a rare class of bicyclic depsipeptide antibiotics in which the installation of a (4-methylhexa-2,4-dienoyl)glycine handle across a hexadepsipeptide core contributes to its chemical complexity and biological properties. Herein, we report the genetic and biochemical basis for salinamide construction in the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNB-091, which involves a novel intermolecular transesterification reaction catalyzed by a type I thioesterase. Heterologous expression studies revealed the central role of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase Sln9 in constructing and installing the distinctive acylglycine "basket handle" of salinamide. Biochemical characterization of the Sln9 thioesterase domain established that transesterification of the serine residue of desmethylsalinamide E with acylated glycyl thioesters yields desmethylsalinamide C.	1
Title: Differential regulation of undecylprodigiosin biosynthesis in the yeast-scavenging Streptomyces strain MBK6 Abstract: Streptomyces are efficient chemists with a capacity to generate diverse and potent chemical scaffolds. The secondary metabolism of these soil-dwelling prokaryotes is stimulated upon interaction with other microbes in their complex ecosystem. We observed such an interaction when a Streptomyces isolate was cultivated in a media supplemented with dead yeast cells. Whole-genome analysis revealed that Streptomyces sp. MBK6 harbors the red cluster that is cryptic under normal environmental conditions. An interactive culture of MBK6 with dead yeast triggered the production of the red pigments metacycloprodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin. Streptomyces sp. MBK6 scavenges dead-yeast cells and preferentially grows in aggregates of sequestered yeasts within its mycelial network. We identified that the activation depends on the cluster-situated regulator, mbkZ, which may act as a cross-regulator. Cloning of this master regulator mbkZ in S. coelicolor with a constitutive promoter and promoter-deprived conditions generated different production levels of the red pigments. These surprising results were further validated by DNA-protein binding assays. The presence of the red cluster in Streptomyces sp. MBK6 provides a vivid example of horizontal gene transfer of an entire metabolic pathway followed by differential adaptation to a new environment through mutations in the receiver domain of the key regulatory protein MbkZ.	1
Title: The FK520 gene cluster of Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus (ATCC 14891) contains genes for biosynthesis of unusual polyketide extender units Abstract: FK520 (ascomycin) is a macrolide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus (ATCC 14891) that has immunosuppressive, neurotrophic and antifungal activities. To further elucidate the biosynthesis of this and related macrolides, we cloned and sequenced an 80kb region encompassing the FK520 gene cluster. Genes encoding the three polyketide synthase (PKS) subunits (fkbB, fkbC and fkbA), the peptide synthetase (fkbP), the 31-O-methyltransferase (fkbM), the C-9 hydroxylase (fkbD) and the 9-hydroxyl oxidase (fkbO) had the same organization as the genes reported in the FK506 gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. MA6548 (Motamedi, H., Shafiee, A., 1998. The biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolactone ring of the immunosuppressant FK506. Eur. J. Biochem. 256, 528-534). Disruption of a PKS gene in the cluster using the &phi;C31 phage vector, KC515, led to antibiotic non-producing strains, proving the identity of the cluster. Previous labeling data have indicated that FK520 biosynthesis uses novel polyketide extender units (Byrne, K.M., Shafiee, A., Nielson, J., Arison, B., Monaghan, R.L., Kaplan, L., 1993. The biosynthesis and enzymology of an immunosuppressant, immunomycin, produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus var, ascomyceticus. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 32, 29-45). Genes in the flanking regions of the FK520 cluster were identified that appear to be involved in synthesis of these extender units. All but two of these genes were homologous to genes with known function. In addition to a crotonyl-CoA reductase gene (fkbS), at least two other genes are proposed to be involved in biosynthesis of the atypical PKS extender unit ethylmalonyl-CoA, which accounts for the ethyl side chain on C-21 of FK520. A set of five contiguous genes (fkbGHIJK) is proposed to be involved in biosynthesis of an unusual PKS extender unit bearing an oxygen on the alpha-carbon, and leading to the 13- and 15-methoxy side chains. These putative precursor synthesis genes in the flanking regions of the FK520 cluster are not found in the flanking regions of the rapamycin cluster (Molnár, I., Aparicio, J.F., Haydock, S.F., Khaw, L.E., Schwecke, T., König, A., Staunton, J., Leadlay, P.F., 1996. Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of genes flanking the polyketide synthase. Gene 169, 1-7), consistent with labeling data showing that rapamycin biosynthesis uses only malonyl and methylmalonyl extender units.	1
Title: Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: friends or foes? Abstract: Chemical and physiological functions of molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and existing equilibrium between pools of pro-oxidants and anti-oxidants providing steady state ROS level vital for normal mitochondrial and cell functioning are reviewed. The presence of intracellular oxygen and ROS sensors is postulated and few candidates for this role are suggested. Possible involvement of ROS in the process of fragmentation of mitochondrial reticulum made of long mitochondrial filaments serving in the cell as "electric cables", as well as the role of ROS in apoptosis and programmed mitochondrial destruction (mitoptosis) are reviewed. The critical role of ROS in destructive processes under ischemia/reoxygenation and ischemic preconditioning is discussed. Mitochondrial permeability transition gets special consideration as a possible component of the apoptotic cascade, resulting in excessive "ROS-induced ROS release".	0
Title: Role of the LolP cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in loline alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: The insecticidal loline alkaloids, produced by Neotyphodium uncinatum and related endophytes, are exo-1-aminopyrrolizidines with an ether bridge between C-2 and C-7. Loline alkaloids vary in methyl, acetyl, and formyl substituents on the 1-amine, which affect their biological activity. Enzymes for key loline biosynthesis steps are probably encoded by genes in the LOL cluster, which is duplicated in N. uncinatum, except for a large deletion in lolP2. The role of lolP1 was investigated by its replacement with a hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene. Compared to wild type N. uncinatum and an ectopic transformant, DeltalolP1 cultures had greatly elevated levels of N-methylloline (NML) and lacked N-formylloline (NFL). Complementation of DeltalolP1 with lolP1 under control of the Emericella nidulans trpC promoter restored NFL production. These results and the inferred sequence of LolP1 indicate that it is a cytochrome P450, catalyzing oxygenation of an N-methyl group in NML to the N-formyl group in NFL.	1
Title: Structural characterization of in vitro and in vivo intermediates on the loading module of microcystin synthetase Abstract: The microcystin family of toxins is the most common cause of hepatotoxicity associated with water blooms of cyanobacterial genera. The biosynthetic assembly line producing the toxic cyclic peptide, microcystin, contains an adenylation-peptidyl carrier protein didomain (A-PCP) at the N-terminus of the initiator module McyG (295 kDa) that has been postulated to activate and load the starter unit phenylacetate for formation of the unusual aromatic beta-amino acid residue, Adda, before subsequent extension. Characterization of the McyG A-PCP didomain (78 kDa) using ATP-PP i exchange assays and mass spectrometry revealed that assorted phenylpropanoids are preferentially activated and loaded onto the PCP carrier domain rather than phenylacetate itself. For the first time, thioesters formed in vivo were detected directly using large molecule mass spectrometry. Additionally substrates were cleaved using a type II thioesterase for structural elucidation by small molecule mass spectrometry. Unprecedented features of the McyG A-PCP didomain include the in vivo acylation of the holo PCP with exogenous and endogenous substrates, along with the ability of the apo protein to retain the acyl-AMP intermediate during affinity purification. These results imply that phenylpropanoids are preferentially loaded onto the McyG PCP; however one carbon must be excised following extension of the starter unit with malonyl-CoA in order to generate the expected polyketide chain which leads us to ponder the novel biochemistry by which this occurs.	1
Title: Regioselective Dichlorination of a Non-Activated Aliphatic Carbon Atom and Phenolic Bismethylation by a Multifunctional Fungal Flavoenzyme Abstract: The regioselective functionalization of non-activated carbon atoms such as aliphatic halogenation is a major synthetic challenge. A novel multifunctional enzyme catalyzing the geminal dichlorination of a methyl group was discovered in Aspergillus oryzae (Koji mold), an important fungus that is widely used for Asian food fermentation. A biosynthetic pathway encoded on two different chromosomes yields mono- and dichlorinated polyketides (diaporthin derivatives), including the cytotoxic dichlorodiaporthin as the main product. Bioinformatic analyses and functional genetics revealed an unprecedented hybrid enzyme (AoiQ) with two functional domains, one for halogenation and one for O-methylation. AoiQ was successfully reconstituted in vivo and in vitro, unequivocally showing that this FADH2 -dependent enzyme is uniquely capable of the stepwise gem-dichlorination of a non-activated carbon atom on a freestanding substrate. Genome mining indicated that related hybrid enzymes are encoded in cryptic gene clusters in numerous ecologically relevant fungi.	1
Title: The proteomic profile of Fusobacterium nucleatum is regulated by growth pH Abstract: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a saccharolytic Gram-negative anaerobic organism believed to play an important role in the microbial succession associated with the development of periodontal disease. Its genome contains niche-specific genes shared with the other inhabitants of dental plaque, which may help to explain its ability to survive and grow in the changing environmental conditions experienced in the gingival sulcus during the transition from health to disease. The pH of the gingival sulcus increases during the development of periodontitis and this is thought to occur by the metabolism of nutrients supplied by gingival crevicular fluid. In comparison with other plaque inhabitants, F. nucleatum has the greatest ability to neutralize acidic environments. The differential expression of soluble cytoplasmic proteins induced by acidic (pH 6.4) or basic (pH 7.4 and 7.8) conditions, during long-term anaerobic growth in a chemostat, was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis software. Twenty-two proteins, found to have altered expression in response to external pH, were identified by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. Eight differentially expressed proteins associated with increased energy (ATP) production via the 2-oxoglutarate and Embden-Meyerhof pathways appeared to be directed towards either cellular biosynthesis or the maintenance of internal homeostasis. Overall, these results represent the first proteomic investigation of F. nucleatum and the identification of gene products which may be important in the organism's persistence during the transition from health to disease in vivo.	0
Title: Engineered biosynthesis of nonribosomal lipopeptides with modified fatty acid side chains Abstract: The biological properties of the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs), daptomycin and related nonribosomal lipopeptides, depend to a large extent on the nature of the N-terminal fatty acid moiety. It is suggested that the chain length of the unusually short (C6) 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl fatty acid moiety of CDA is determined by the specificity of the KAS-II enzyme encoded by fabF3 in the CDA biosynthetic gene cluster. Indeed, deletion of the downstream gene hxcO results in three new lipopeptides, all of which possess hexanoyl side chains (hCDAs). This confirms that HxcO functions as a hexanoyl-CoA or -ACP oxidase. The absence of additional CDA products with longer fatty acid groups further suggests that the CDA lipid chain is biosynthesized on a single ACP and is then transferred directly from this ACP to the first CDA peptide synthetase (CdaPS1). Interestingly, the hexanoyl-containing CDAs retain antibiotic activity. To further modulate the biological properties of CDA by introducing alternative fatty acid groups, a mutasynthesis approach was developed. This involved mutating the key active site Ser residue of the CdaPS1, module 1 PCP domain to Ala, which prevents subsequent phosphopantetheinylation. In the absence of the natural module 1 PCP tethered intermediate, it is possible to effect incorporation of different N-acyl-L-serinyl N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) thioester analogues, leading to CDA products with pentanoyl as well as hexanoyl side chains.	1
Title: Error-prone initiation factor 2 mutations reduce the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance Abstract: Mutations in the fmt gene (encoding formyl methionine transferase) that eliminate formylation of initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) confer resistance to the novel antibiotic class of peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDFIs) while concomitantly reducing bacterial fitness. Here we show in Salmonella typhimurium that novel mutations in initiation factor 2 (IF2) located outside the initiator tRNA binding domain can partly restore fitness of fmt mutants without loss of antibiotic resistance. Analysis of initiation of protein synthesis in vitro showed that with non-formylated Met-tRNA(i) IF2 mutants initiated much faster than wild-type IF2, whereas with formylated fMet-tRNA(i) the initiation rates were similar. Moreover, the increase in initiation rates with Met-tRNA(i) conferred by IF2 mutations in vitro correlated well with the increase in growth rate conferred by the same mutations in vivo, suggesting that the mutations in IF2 compensate formylation deficiency by increasing the rate of in vivo initiation with Met-tRNA(i). IF2 mutants had also a high propensity for erroneous initiation with elongator tRNAs in vitro, which could account for their reduced fitness in vivo in a formylation-proficient strain. More generally, our results suggest that bacterial protein synthesis is mRNA-limited and that compensatory mutations in IF2 could increase the persistence of PDFI-resistant bacteria in clinical settings.	0
Title: Selective polymerization catalysis: controlling the metal chain end group to prepare block copolyesters Abstract: Selective catalysis is used to prepare block copolyesters by combining ring-opening polymerization of lactones and ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides/anhydrides. By using a dizinc complex with mixtures of up to three different monomers and controlling the chemistry of the Zn-O(polymer chain) it is possible to select for a particular polymerization route and thereby control the composition of block copolyesters.	0
Title: Molecular Mechanisms of Two-Component Signal Transduction Abstract: Two-component systems (TCS) comprising sensor histidine kinases and response regulator proteins are among the most important players in bacterial and archaeal signal transduction and also occur in reduced numbers in some eukaryotic organisms. Given their importance to cellular survival, virulence, and cellular development, these systems are among the most scrutinized bacterial proteins. In the recent years, a flurry of bioinformatics, genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have provided detailed insights into many molecular mechanisms that underlie the detection of signals and the generation of the appropriate response by TCS. Importantly, it has become clear that there is significant diversity in the mechanisms employed by individual systems. This review discusses the current knowledge on common themes and divergences from the paradigm of TCS signaling. An emphasis is on the information gained by a flurry of recent structural and bioinformatics studies.	0
Title: Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of genes flanking the polyketide synthase Abstract: Analysis of the gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus that governs the biosynthesis of the polyketide immuno-suppressant rapamycin (Rp) has revealed that it contains three exceptionally large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the modular polyketide synthase (PKS). Between two of these lies a fourth gene (rapP) encoding a pipecolate-incorporating enzyme that probably also catalyzes closure of the macrolide ring. On either side of these very large genes are ranged a total of 22 further ORFs before the limits of the cluster are reached, as judged by the identification of genes clearly encoding unrelated activities. Several of these ORFs appear to encode enzymes that would be required for Rp biosynthesis. These include two cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P450s), designated RapJ and RapN, an associated ferredoxin (Fd) RapO, and three potential SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases (MTases), RapI, RapM and RapQ. All of these are likely to be involved in 'late' modification of the macrocycle. The cluster also contains a novel gene (rapL) whose product is proposed to catalyze the formation of the Rp precursor, L-pipecolate, through the cyclodeamination of L-lysine. Adjacent genes have putative roles in Rp regulation and export. The codon usage of the PKS biosynthetic genes is markedly different from that of the flanking genes of the cluster.	1
Title: Studies on lactoferricin-derived Escherichia coli membrane-active peptides reveal differences in the mechanism of N-acylated versus nonacylated peptides Abstract: To improve the low antimicrobial activity of LF11, an 11-mer peptide derived from human lactoferricin, mutant sequences were designed based on the defined structure of LF11 in the lipidic environment. Thus, deletion of noncharged polar residues and strengthening of the hydrophobic N-terminal part upon adding a bulky hydrophobic amino acid or N-acylation resulted in enhanced antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, which correlated with the peptides' degree of perturbation of bacterial membrane mimics. Nonacylated and N-acylated peptides exhibited different effects at a molecular level. Nonacylated peptides induced segregation of peptide-enriched and peptide-poor lipid domains in negatively charged bilayers, although N-acylated peptides formed small heterogeneous domains resulting in a higher degree of packing defects. Additionally, only N-acylated peptides perturbed the lateral packing of neutral lipids and exhibited increased permeability of E. coli lipid vesicles. The latter did not correlate with the extent of improvement of the antimicrobial activity, which could be explained by the fact that elevated binding of N-acylated peptides to lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria seems to counteract the elevated membrane permeabilization, reflected in the respective minimal inhibitory concentration for E. coli. The antimicrobial activity of the peptides correlated with an increase of membrane curvature stress and hence bilayer instability. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that only the N-acylated peptides induced tubular protrusions from the outer membrane, whereas all peptides caused detachment of the outer and inner membrane of E. coli bacteria. Viability tests demonstrated that these bacteria were dead before onset of visible cell lysis.	0
Title: Refactoring the Cryptic Streptophenazine Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Unites Phenazine, Polyketide, and Nonribosomal Peptide Biochemistry Abstract: The disconnect between the genomic prediction of secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential and the observed laboratory production profile of microorganisms is well documented. While heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is often seen as a potential solution to bridge this gap, it is not immune to many challenges including impaired regulation, the inability to recruit essential building blocks, and transcriptional and/or translational silence of the biosynthetic genes. Here we report the discovery, cloning, refactoring, and heterologous expression of a cryptic hybrid phenazine-type BGC (spz) from the marine actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. Overexpression of the engineered spz pathway resulted in increased production and chemical diversity of phenazine natural products belonging to the streptophenazine family, including bioactive members containing an unprecedented N-formylglycine attachment. An atypical discrete adenylation enzyme in the spz cluster is required to introduce the formylglycine moiety and represents a phylogenetically distinct class of adenylation proteins.	1
Title: Selective inhibition by 2-bromoethanesulfonate of methanogenesis from acetate in a thermophilic anaerobic digestor Abstract: The effects of 2-bromoethanesulfonate, an inhibitor of methanogenesis, on metabolism in sludge from a thermophilic (58 degrees C) anaerobic digestor were studied. It was found from short-term experiments that 1 mumol of 2-bromoethanesulfonate per ml completely inhibited methanogenesis from CH(3)COO, whereas 50 mumol/ml was required for complete inhibition of CO(2) reduction. When 1 mumol of 2-bromoethanesulfonate per ml was added to actively metabolizing sludge which was then incubated for 24 h. it caused a 60% reduction in methanogenesis and a corresponding increase in acetate accumulation; at 50 mumol/ml it caused complete inhibition of methanogenesis and accumulation of acetate. H(2), and ethanol.	0
Title: Formation of the preprimosome protects lambda O from RNA transcription-dependent proteolysis by ClpP/ClpX Abstract: Using the bacteriophage lambda DNA replication system, composed entirely of purified proteins, we have tested the accessibility of the short-lived lambda O protein to the ClpP/ClpX protease during the various stages of lambda DNA replication. We find that binding of lambda O protein to its orilambda DNA sequence, leading to the so-called "O-some" formation, largely inhibits its degradation. On the contrary, under conditions permissive for transcription, the lambda O protein bound to the orilambda sequence becomes largely accessible to ClpP/ClpX-mediated proteolysis. However, when the lambda O protein is part of the larger orilambda:O.P.DnaB preprimosomal complex, transcription does not significantly increase ClpP/ClpX-dependent lambda O degradation. These results show that transcription can stimulate proteolysis of a protein that is required for the initiation of DNA replication.	0
Title: Isolation, characterization, and heterologous expression of the novel lantibiotic epicidin 280 and analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Epicidin 280 is a novel type A lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis BN 280. During C18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography two epicidin 280 peaks were obtained; the two compounds had molecular masses of 3,133 +/- 1.5 and 3,136 +/- 1.5 Da, comparable antibiotic activities, and identical amino acid compositions. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that epicidin 280 exhibits 75% similarity to Pep5. The strains that produce epicidin 280 and Pep5 exhibit cross-immunity, indicating that the immunity peptides cross-function in antagonization of both lantibiotics. The complete epicidin 280 gene cluster was cloned and was found to comprise at least five open reading frames (eciI, eciA, eciP, eciB, and eciC, in that order). The proteins encoded by these open reading frames exhibit significant sequence similarity to the biosynthetic proteins of the Pep5 operon of Staphylococcus epidermidis 5. A gene for an ABC transporter, which is present in the Pep5 gene cluster but is necessary only for high yields (G. Bierbaum, M. Reis, C. Szekat, and H.-G. Sahl, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:4332-4338, 1994), was not detected. Instead, upstream of the immunity gene eciI we found an open reading frame, eciO, which could code for a novel lantibiotic modification enzyme involved in reduction of an N-terminally located oxopropionyl residue. Epicidin 280 produced by the heterologous host Staphylococcus carnosus TM 300 after introduction of eciIAPBC (i.e., no eciO was present) behaved homogeneously during reverse-phase chromatography.	1
Title: Ureaplasma antigenic variation beyond MBA phase variation: DNA inversions generating chimeric structures and switching in expression of the MBA N-terminal paralogue UU172 Abstract: Phase variation of the major ureaplasma surface membrane protein, the multiple-banded antigen (MBA), with its counterpart, the UU376 protein, was recently discussed as a result of DNA inversion occurring at specific inverted repeats. Two similar inverted repeats to the ones within the mba locus were found in the genome of Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3; one within the MBA N-terminal paralogue UU172 and another in the adjacent intergenic spacer region. In this report, we demonstrate on both genomic and protein level that DNA inversion at these inverted repeats leads to alternating expression between UU172 and the neighbouring conserved hypothetical ORF UU171. Sequence analysis of this phase-variable 'UU172 element' from both U. parvum and U. urealyticum strains revealed that it is highly conserved among both species and that it also includes the orthologue of UU144. A third inverted repeat region in UU144 is proposed to serve as an additional potential inversion site from which chimeric genes can evolve. Our results indicate that site-specific recombination events in the genome of U. parvum serovar 3 are dynamic and frequent, leading to a broad spectrum of antigenic variation by which the organism may evade host immune responses.	0
Title: Electron paramagnetic resonance measurement of the distance between the metal binding sites of transferrin Abstract: The distance between the two metal binding sites of human serum transferrin is calculated from measurements made of the paramagnetic broadening of the EPR spectrum of Cu2+ bound at the NH2-terminal (B) site from Fe3+ bound at the COOH-terminal (A) site. Complexes of monoferric(A)-monocupric(B) transferrin, monocupric(B) transferrin, and monogallium(A)-monocupric(B) transferrin were prepared under identical conditions. Computer simulation and direct measurement of the EPR spectra from these complexes demonstrate a paramagnetic broadening of 0.6 +/- 0.1 G in the line width of the Cu2+ spectrum due to the paramagnetic Fe3+ bound at the other site. The distance between the two metal binding sites is calculated to be 41.6 +/- 2.8 A.	0
Title: Enterobactin: an archetype for microbial iron transport Abstract: Bacteria have aggressive acquisition processes for iron, an essential nutrient. Siderophores are small iron chelators that facilitate cellular iron transport. The siderophore enterobactin is a triscatechol derivative of a cyclic triserine lactone. Studies of the chemistry, regulation, synthesis, recognition, and transport of enterobactin make it perhaps the best understood of the siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems, displaying a lot of function packed into this small molecule. However, recent surprises include the isolation of corynebactin, a closely related trithreonine triscatechol derivative lactone first found in Gram-positive bacteria, and the crystal structure of a ferric enterobactin complex of a protein identified as an antibacterial component of the human innate immune system.	1
Title: Novel South African Rare Actinomycete Kribbella speibonae Strain SK5: A Prolific Producer of Hydroxamate Siderophores Including New Dehydroxylated Congeners Abstract: In this paper, we report on the chemistry of the rare South African Actinomycete Kribbella speibonae strain SK5, a prolific producer of hydroxamate siderophores and their congeners. Two new analogues, dehydroxylated desferrioxamines, speibonoxamine 1 and desoxy-desferrioxamine D1 2, have been isolated, together with four known hydroxamates, desferrioxamine D1 3, desferrioxamine B 4, desoxy-nocardamine 5 and nocardamine 6, and a diketopiperazine (DKP) 7. The structures of 1-7 were characterized by the analysis of HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR data, as well as by comparison with the relevant literature. Three new dehydroxy desferrioxamine derivatives 8-10 were tentatively identified in the molecular network of K. speibonae strain SK5 extracts, and structures were proposed based on their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. A plausible spb biosynthetic pathway was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of desferrioxamines from the actinobacterial genus Kribbella.	1
Title: Elucidation of inositol hexaphosphate and heparin interaction sites and conformational changes in arrestin-1 by solution nuclear magnetic resonance Abstract: Arrestins specifically bind activated and phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors and orchestrate both receptor trafficking and channel signaling through G protein-independent pathways via direct interactions with numerous nonreceptor partners. Here we report the first successful use of solution NMR in mapping the binding sites in arrestin-1 (visual arrestin) for two polyanionic compounds that mimic phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin: inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) and heparin. This yielded an identification of residues involved in the binding with these ligands that was more complete than what has previously been feasible. IP6 and heparin appear to bind to the same site on arrestin-1, centered on a positively charged region in the N-domain. We present the first direct evidence that both IP6 and heparin induced a complete release of the arrestin C-tail. These observations provide novel insight into the nature of the transition of arrestin from the basal to active state and demonstrate the potential of NMR-based methods in the study of protein-protein interactions involving members of the arrestin family.	0
Title: Spatial and resource factors influencing high microbial diversity in soil Abstract: To begin defining the key determinants that drive microbial community structure in soil, we examined 29 soil samples from four geographically distinct locations taken from the surface, vadose zone, and saturated subsurface using a small-subunit rRNA-based cloning approach. While microbial communities in low-carbon, saturated, subsurface soils showed dominance, microbial communities in low-carbon surface soils showed remarkably uniform distributions, and all species were equally abundant. Two diversity indices, the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) and the log series index, effectively distinguished between the dominant and uniform diversity patterns. For example, the uniform profiles characteristic of the surface communities had diversity index values that were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than those for the high-dominance, saturated, subsurface communities. In a site richer in organic carbon, microbial communities consistently exhibited the uniform distribution pattern regardless of soil water content and depth. The uniform distribution implies that competition does not shape the structure of these microbial communities. Theoretical studies based on mathematical modeling suggested that spatial isolation could limit competition in surface soils, thereby supporting the high diversity and a uniform community structure. Carbon resource heterogeneity may explain the uniform diversity patterns observed in the high-carbon samples even in the saturated zone. Very high levels of chromium contamination (e.g., >20%) in the high-organic-matter soils did not greatly reduce the diversity. Understanding mechanisms that may control community structure, such as spatial isolation, has important implications for preservation of biodiversity, management of microbial communities for bioremediation, biocontrol of root diseases, and improved soil fertility.	0
Title: Protein Domain Specific Covalent Inhibition of Human DNA Polymerase β Abstract: DNA polymerase β (Pol β) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol β possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair. Pol β is an attractive therapeutic target for which there is a need for inhibitors. Two mechanistically inspired covalent inhibitors (1, IC50 =21.0 μM; 9, IC50 =18.7 μM) that modify lysine residues in different Pol β active sites are characterized. Despite modifying lysine residues in different active sites, 1 and 9 inactivate the polymerase and lyase activities of Pol β. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that they do so by preventing DNA binding. Inhibitors 1 and 9 provide the basis for a general approach to preparing domain selective inhibitors of bifunctional polymerases. Such molecules could prove to be useful tools for studying the role of wild type and mutant forms of Pol β and other polymerases in DNA repair.	0
Title: 7-Step Flow Synthesis of the HIV Integrase Inhibitor Dolutegravir Abstract: Dolutegravir (DTG), an important active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV, has been synthesized in continuous flow. By adapting the reported GlaxoSmithKline process chemistry batch route for Cabotegravir, DTG was produced in 4.5 h in sequential flow operations from commercially available materials. Key features of the synthesis include rapid manufacturing time for pyridone formation, one-step direct amidation of a functionalized pyridone, and telescoping of multiple steps to avoid isolation of intermediates and enable for greater throughput.	0
Title: From synthesis to biologics: preclinical data on a chemistry derived anticancer vaccine Abstract: A fully synthetic anticancer vaccine 2 has been prepared via bioconjugation of unimolecular pentavalent construct 1-containing five prostate and breast cancer associated carbohydrate antigens, Globo-H, GM2, STn, TF and Tn-to maleimide-modified carrier protein KLH. An improved conjugation protocol has been developed, which allowed us to obtain a higher epitope ratio of the unimolecular pentavalent glycopeptide antigen to the carrier protein (505/1 versus 228/1 for the previous version). KLH conjugate 2 has been subsequently submitted to preclinical immunogenic evaluation in mice in the presence of QS-21 as an adjuvant. Through standard ELISA assay, this vaccine candidate showed high promise in inducing IgG and IgM antibodies against each of the five individual carbohydrate antigens. In addition, FACS analysis indicated that these antibodies were able to react with MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines expressing these five carbohydrate antigens.	0
Title: Cytochrome P450 as dimerization catalyst in diketopiperazine alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: As dimeric natural products frequently exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding their mechanisms of dimerization is of great interest. One such compound is (−)-ditryptophenaline, isolated from Aspergillus flavus, which inhibits substance P receptor for potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Through targeted gene knockout in A. flavus and heterologous yeast gene expression, we determined for the first time the gene cluster and pathway for the biosynthesis of a dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloid. We also determined that a single cytochrome P450, DtpC, is responsible not only for pyrroloindole ring formation but also for concurrent dimerization of N-methylphenylalanyltryptophanyl diketopiperazine monomers into a homodimeric product. Furthermore, DtpC exhibits relaxed substrate specificity, allowing the formation of two new dimeric compounds from a non-native monomeric precursor, brevianamide F. A radical-mediated mechanism of dimerization is proposed.	1
Title: Helicase-Dependent Isothermal Amplification of DNA and RNA by Using Self-Avoiding Molecular Recognition Systems Abstract: Assays that detect DNA or RNA (xNA) are highly sensitive, as small amounts of xNA can be amplified by PCR. Unfortunately, PCR is inconvenient in low-resource environments, and requires equipment and power that might not be available in these environments. Isothermal procedures, which avoid thermal cycling, are often confounded by primer dimers, off-target priming, and other artifacts. Here, we show how a "self avoiding molecular recognition system" (SAMRS) eliminates these artifacts and gives clean amplicons in a helicase-dependent isothermal amplification (SAMRS-HDA). We also show that incorporating SAMRS into the 3'-ends of primers facilitates the design and screening of primers for HDA assays. Finally, we show that SAMRS-HDA can be twofold multiplexed, difficult to achieve with HDA using standard primers. Thus, SAMRS-HDA is a more versatile approach than standard HDA, with a broader applicability for xNA-targeted diagnostics and research.	0
Title: Deletion of a regulatory gene within the cpk gene cluster reveals novel antibacterial activity in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Genome sequencing of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed an uncharacterized type I polyketide synthase gene cluster (cpk). Here we describe the discovery of a novel antibacterial activity (abCPK) and a yellow-pigmented secondary metabolite (yCPK) after deleting a presumed pathway-specific regulatory gene (scbR2) that encodes a member of the gamma-butyrolactone receptor family of proteins and which lies in the cpk gene cluster. Overproduction of yCPK and abCPK in a scbR2 deletion mutant, and the absence of the newly described compounds from cpk deletion mutants, suggest that they are products of the previously orphan cpk biosynthetic pathway in which abCPK is converted into the yellow pigment. Transcriptional analysis suggests that scbR2 may act in a negative feedback mechanism to eventually limit yCPK biosynthesis. The results described here represent a novel approach for the discovery of new, biologically active compounds.	1
Title: Sequence analysis by cloning of the structural gene of gassericin A, a hydrophobic bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 Abstract: Gassericin A, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, was purified to homogeneity from the culturesupernatant mainly by reverse-phase chromatography. The molecular weight of gassericin A was found to be 5,652 by mass analysis, unlike the estimated 3,800 found by SDS-PAGE. However, when the purified preparation was treated with lysylendopeptidase, it migrated as a single band to 5,600 with bacteriocin activity on SDS-PAGE. N- and C-terminal amino acids could not be identified. The internal amino acid could be identified after gassericin A was hydrolyzed with lysylendopeptidase. The DNA of the structural gene of gassericin A was sequenced by cloning of the gene from chromosomal DNA with an oligonucleotide probe. The structural gene of gassericin A was found on the chromosomal DNA as an open reading frame encoding a protein composed of 91 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of mature gassericin A was predicted to be 58 residues from the DNA sequence and results of mass analysis. These results suggested that gassericin A has a closed circular structure with N- and C-terminals linked. Gassericin A is a hydrophobic class II bacteriocin; it was 98% identical with acidocin B produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.	1
Title: Identification of Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22 genes involved in the biosynthesis of granaticin Abstract: A 50 kb region of DNA from Streptomyces violaceoruber Tü22, containing genes encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of granaticin, was isolated. The DNA sequence of a 7.3 kb fragment from this region, located approximately 10 kb from the genes that encode the polyketide synthetase responsible for formation of the benzoisochromane quinone skeleton, revealed five open reading frames (ORF1-ORF5). The deduced amino acid sequence of GraE, encoded by ORF2, shows 60.8% identity (75.2% similarity) to a dTDP-glucose dehydratase (StrE) from Streptomyces griseus. Cultures of Escherichia coli containing plasmids with ORF2, on a 2.1 kb BamHI fragment, were able to catalyze the formation of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose from dTDP-glucose at 5 times the rate of control cultures, confirming that ORF2 encodes a dTDP-glucose dehydratase. The amino acid sequence encoded by ORF3 (GraD) is 51.4% identical (69.9% similar) to that of StrD, a dTDP-glucose synthase from Streptomyces griseus. The amino acid sequence encoded by ORF4 shares similarities with proteins that confer resistance to tetracycline and methylenomycin, and is suggested to be involved in transporting granaticin out of the cells by an active efflux mechanism.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the astaxanthin biosynthesis gene cluster from the marine bacterium Paracoccus haeundaensis Abstract: Carotenoids are important natural pigments produced by many microorganisms and plants. In a previous study, we isolated and characterized a marine bacterium, Paracoccus haeundaensis, which produces carotenoids, mainly astaxanthin. In the present study, a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster involved in the production of astaxanthin was isolated and characterized from this marine bacterium. The cluster contained six carotenogenic genes, five of which, with the same orientation, were designated crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, and crtB, and one of which, with the opposite orientation, was designated crtE. The crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtE genes contained 726, 486, 1158, 1503, 912, and 879 base pairs, respectively, and encoded polypeptides of 242, 162, 386, 501, 304, and 293 amino acid residues, respectively. The stop codon of each crt gene, except crtE, overlapped the start codon of the following crt gene. Comparisons of the structures and nucleotide sequences of the crt genes showed that the signature domains of the carotenoid biosynthesis genes are highly conserved. The molecular phylogenetic tree analysis showed the evolutionary relationships among the carotenoid biosynthesis genes of various organisms. An expression vector (pCR-XR-TOPO-Crt-full vector) containing the astaxanthin biosynthesis genes was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells. The E. coli transformants produced 400 microg astaxanthin per gram of dry cell weight.	1
Title: The Epipolythiodiketopiperazine Gene Cluster in Claviceps purpurea: Dysfunctional Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Prevents Formation of the Previously Unknown Clapurines Abstract: Claviceps purpurea is an important food contaminant and well known for the production of the toxic ergot alkaloids. Apart from that, little is known about its secondary metabolism and not all toxic substances going along with the food contamination with Claviceps are known yet. We explored the metabolite profile of a gene cluster in C. purpurea with a high homology to gene clusters, which are responsible for the formation of epipolythiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxins in other fungi. By overexpressing the transcription factor, we were able to activate the cluster in the standard C. purpurea strain 20.1. Although all necessary genes for the formation of the characteristic disulfide bridge were expressed in the overexpression mutants, the fungus did not produce any ETPs. Isolation of pathway intermediates showed that the common biosynthetic pathway stops after the first steps. Our results demonstrate that hydroxylation of the diketopiperazine backbone is the critical step during the ETP biosynthesis. Due to a dysfunctional enzyme, the fungus is not able to produce toxic ETPs. Instead, the pathway end-products are new unusual metabolites with a unique nitrogen-sulfur bond. By heterologous expression of the Leptosphaeria maculans cytochrome P450 encoding gene sirC, we were able to identify the end-products of the ETP cluster in C. purpurea. The thioclapurines are so far unknown ETPs, which might contribute to the toxicity of other C. purpurea strains with a potentially intact ETP cluster.	1
Title: Phenolic lipid synthesis by type III polyketide synthases is essential for cyst formation in Azotobacter vinelandii Abstract: Cysts of Azotobacter vinelandii are resting cells that are surrounded by a protective coat, conferring resistance to various chemical and physical agents. The major chemical components of the cyst coat are alkylresorcinols, which are amphiphilic molecules possessing an aromatic ring with a long aliphatic carbon chain. Although alkylresorcinols are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, no enzyme systems for their biosynthesis are known. We report here an ars operon in A. vinelandii that is responsible for the biosynthesis of the alkylresorcinols in the cysts. The ars operon consisted of four genes, two of which encoded a type III polyketide synthase, ArsB and ArsC. In vitro experiments revealed that ArsB and ArsC, sharing 71% amino acid sequence identity, were an alkylresorcinol synthase and an alkylpyrone synthase, respectively, indicating that ArsB and ArsC are not isozymes but enzymatically distinct polyketide synthases. In addition, ArsB and ArsC accepted several acyl-CoAs with various lengths of the side chain as a starter substrate and gave corresponding alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, respectively, which suggests that the mode of the ring folding is uninfluenced by the structure of the starter substrates. The importance of the alkylresorcinols for encystment was confirmed by gene inactivation experiments; the lack of alkylresorcinols synthesis caused by ars mutations resulted in the formation of severely impaired cysts, as observed by electron microscopy.	1
Title: Microbial genomics as a guide to drug discovery and structural elucidation: ECO-02301, a novel antifungal agent, as an example Abstract: Analysis of the genome of Streptomyces aizunensis NRRL B-11277 indicated its potential to produce a compound of novel and highly predictable structure. The structure was predicted with sufficient accuracy to allow straightforward detection of the specific metabolite in HPLC profiles of fermentation extracts and hence to guide the isolation. The spectroscopic work was reduced to a confirmation of structure rather than a first principle determination. The compound, ECO-02301 (1), demonstrated potent antifungal activity. This work exemplifies not only the discovery of novel antibiotics from well-characterized organisms but also the utility of genomics as a further tool, complementary to spectroscopy, to enable rapid determination of complex structures.	1
Title: Twilight zone sponges from Guam yield theonellin isocyanate and psammaplysins I and J Abstract: From the organic extracts of two Guam sponges, Rhaphoxya sp. and Suberea sp., determined to have cytotoxic and chemopreventive activities, three new compounds, theonellin isocyanate (1) and psammaplysins I and J (5, 6), and six previously reported compounds (2-4, 7-9) were isolated and characterized spectroscopically ((1)H and (13)C NMR, MS, IR, UV, [α](D)). The two new metabolites (5 and 6) isolated from the Suberea sp. sponge are rare examples of compounds containing a bromotyramine moiety rather than the more usual dibromo analogue. For the compounds isolated from the Rhaphoxya sp., this is the first report of the known compounds 2-4 being found in a single sponge. For previously reported compounds 2-4 complete unambiguous (1)H and (13)C NMR data are provided.	0
Title: Hapalindole/Ambiguine Biogenesis Is Mediated by a Cope Rearrangement, C-C Bond-Forming Cascade Abstract: Hapalindoles are bioactive indole alkaloids with fascinating polycyclic ring systems whose biosynthetic assembly mechanism has remained unknown since their initial discovery in the 1980s. In this study, we describe the fam gene cluster from the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua UTEX 1903 encoding hapalindole and ambiguine biosynthesis along with the characterization of two aromatic prenyltransferases, FamD1 and FamD2, and a previously undescribed cyclase, FamC1. These studies demonstrate that FamD2 and FamC1 act in concert to form the tetracyclic core ring system of the hapalindoles from cis-indole isonitrile and geranyl pyrophosphate through a presumed biosynthetic Cope rearrangement and subsequent 6-exo-trig cyclization/electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.	1
Title: Optically transparent dense colloidal gels Abstract: Traditionally it has been difficult to study the porous structure of dense colloidal gels and (macro) molecular transport through them simply because of the difference in refractive index between the colloid material and the continuous fluid phase surrounding it, rendering the samples opaque even at low colloidal volume fractions. Here, we demonstrate a novel colloidal gel that can be refractive index-matched in aqueous solutions owing to the low refractive index of fluorinated latex (FL)-particles (n = 1.37). Synthesizing them from heptafluorobutyl methacrylate using emulsion polymerization, we demonstrate that they can be functionalized with short DNA sequences via a dense brush-layer of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) block-copolymers (PS-PEO). The block-copolymer, holding an azide group at the free PEO end, was grafted to the latex particle utilizing a swelling-deswelling method. Subsequently, DNA was covalently attached to the azide-end of the block copolymer via a strain-promoted alkyne-azide click reaction. For comparison, we present a structural study of single gels made of FL-particles only and composite gels made of a percolating FL-colloid gel coated with polystyrene (PS) colloids. Further we demonstrate that the diffusivity of tracer colloids dispersed deep inside a refractive index matched FL-colloidal gel can be measured as function of the local confinement using Dynamic Differential Microscopy (DDM).	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide beauvericin, a virulence factor of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauvericin, a cyclohexadepsipeptide ionophore from the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana, shows antibiotic, antifungal, insecticidal, and cancer cell antiproliferative and antihaptotactic (cell motility inhibitory) activity in vitro. The bbBeas gene encoding the BbBEAS nonribosomal peptide synthetase was isolated from B. bassiana and confirmed to be responsible for beauvericin biosynthesis by targeted disruption. BbBEAS utilizes D-2-hydroxyisovalerate (D-Hiv) and L-phenylalanine (Phe) for the iterative synthesis of a predicted N-methyl-dipeptidol intermediate, and forms the cyclic trimeric ester beauvericin from this intermediate in an unusual recursive process. Heterologous expression of the bbBeas gene in Escherichia coli to produce the 3189 amino acid, 351.9 kDa BbBEAS enzyme provided a strain proficient in beauvericin biosynthesis. Comparative infection assays with a BbBEAS knockout B. bassiana strain against three insect hosts revealed that beauvericin plays a highly significant but not indispensable role in virulence.	1
Title: The enzymes of β-lactam biosynthesis Abstract: The β-lactam antibiotics and related β-lactamase inhibitors are amongst the most important small molecules in clinical use. Most, but not all, β-lactams including penicillins, cephalosporins, and clavulanic acid are produced via fermentation or via modification of fermented intermediates, with important exceptions being the carbapenems and aztreonam. The desire for more efficient routes to existing antibiotics and for access to new and synthetically challenging ones stimulates continued interest in β-lactam biosynthesis. We review knowledge of the pathways leading to β-lactam antibiotics focusing on the mechanisms, structures and biocatalytic applications of the enzymes involved.	1
Title: Autoregulation of microRNA biogenesis by let-7 and Argonaute Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a large family of small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in many biological pathways. Most miRNAs are derived from long primary transcripts that undergo processing by Drosha to produce ~65-nucleotide precursors that are then cleaved by Dicer, resulting in the mature 22-nucleotide forms. Serving as guides in Argonaute protein complexes, mature miRNAs use imperfect base pairing to recognize sequences in messenger RNA transcripts, leading to translational repression and destabilization of the target messenger RNAs. Here we show that the miRNA complex also targets and regulates non-coding RNAs that serve as substrates for the miRNA-processing pathway. We found that the Argonaute protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, ALG-1, binds to a specific site at the 3′ end of let-7 miRNA primary transcripts and promotes downstream processing events. This interaction is mediated by mature let-7 miRNA through a conserved complementary site in its own primary transcript, thus creating a positive-feedback loop. We further show that ALG-1 associates with let-7 primary transcripts in nuclear fractions. Argonaute also binds let-7 primary transcripts in human cells, demonstrating that the miRNA pathway targets non-coding RNAs in addition to protein-coding messenger RNAs across species. Moreover, our studies in C. elegans reveal a novel role for Argonaute in promoting biogenesis of a targeted transcript, expanding the functions of the miRNA pathway in gene regulation. This discovery of autoregulation of let-7 biogenesis establishes a new mechanism for controlling miRNA expression.	0
Title: Lif, the lysostaphin immunity factor, complements FemB in staphylococcal peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge formation Abstract: The formation of the Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan pentaglycine interpeptide chain needs FemA and FemB for the incorporation of glycines Gly2-Gly3, and Gly4-Gly5, respectively. The lysostaphin immunity factor Lif was able to complement FemB, as could be shown by serine incorporation and by an increase in lysostaphin resistance in the wild-type as well as in a femB mutant. However, Lif could not substitute for FemA in femA or in femAB-null mutants. Methicillin resistance, which is dependent on functional FemA and FemB, was not complemented by Lif, suggesting that serine-substituted side chains are a lesser substrate for penicillin-binding protein PBP2' in methicillin resistance.	0
Title: Azide- and Alkyne-Bearing Metabolic Chemical Reporters of Glycosylation Show Structure-Dependent Feedback Inhibition of the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Metabolic chemical reporters (MCRs) of protein glycosylation are analogues of natural monosaccharides that bear reactive groups, like azides and alkynes. When they are added to living cells and organisms, these small molecules are biosynthetically transformed into nucleotide donor sugars and then used by glycosyltransferases to modify proteins. Subsequent installation of tags by bioorthogonal chemistries can then enable the visualization and enrichment of these glycoproteins. Although this two-step procedure is powerful, the use of MCRs has the potential to change the endogenous production of the natural repertoire of donor sugars. A major route for the generation of these glycosyltransferase substrates is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which results in uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Interestingly, the rate-determining enzyme of the HBP, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), is feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc. This raises the possibility that a build-up of UDP-MCRs would block the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, resulting in off target effects. Here, we directly test this possibility with recombinant human GFAT and a small panel of synthetic UDP-MCRs. We find that MCRs with larger substitutions at the N-acetyl position do not inhibit GFAT, whereas those with modifications of the 2- or 6-hydroxy group do. These results further illuminate the considerations that should be applied to the use of MCRs.	0
Title: A gene cluster containing two fungal polyketide synthases encodes the biosynthetic pathway for a polyketide, asperfuranone, in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species including A. nidulans reveals that the products of many of the secondary metabolism pathways in these fungi have not been elucidated. Our examination of the 27 polyketide synthases (PKS) in A. nidulans revealed that one highly reduced PKS (HR-PKS, AN1034.3) and one nonreduced PKS (NR-PKS, AN1036.3) are located next to each other in the genome. Since no known A. nidulans secondary metabolites could be produced by two PKS enzymes, we hypothesized that this cryptic gene cluster produces an unknown natural product. Indeed after numerous attempts we found that the products from this cluster could not be detected under normal laboratory culture conditions in wild type strains. Closer examination of the gene cluster revealed a gene with high homology to a citrinin biosynthesis transcriptional activator (CtnR, 32% identity/47% similarity), a fungal transcription activator located next to the two PKSs. We replaced the promoter of the transcription activator with the inducible alcA promoter, which enabled the production of a novel polyketide that we have named asperfuranone. A series of gene deletions has allowed us to confirm that the two PKSs together with five additional genes comprise the asperfuranone biosynthetic pathway and leads us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for asperfuranone. Our results confirm and substantiate the potential to discover novel compounds even from a well-studied fungus by using a genomic mining approach.	1
Title: CRISPR-Mediated Activation of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters for Bioactive Molecule Discovery in Filamentous Fungi Abstract: Accessing the full biosynthetic potential encoded in the genomes of fungi is limited by the low expression of most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) under common laboratory culture conditions. CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) of fungal BGCs could accelerate genomics-driven bioactive secondary metabolite discovery. In this work, we established the first CRISPRa system for filamentous fungi. First, we constructed a CRISPR/dLbCas12a-VPR-based system and demonstrated the activation of a fluorescent reporter in Aspergillus nidulans. Then, we targeted the native nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene micA in both chromosomal and episomal contexts, achieving increased production of the compound microperfuranone. Finally, multigene CRISPRa led to the discovery of the mic cluster product as dehydromicroperfuranone. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of the variant dLbCas12aD156R-VPR for CRISPRa at room temperature culture conditions. Different aspects that influence the efficiency of CRISPRa in fungi were investigated, providing a framework for the further development of fungal artificial transcription factors based on CRISPR/Cas.	1
Title: Macrotermycins A-D, Glycosylated Macrolactams from a Termite-Associated Amycolatopsis sp. M39 Abstract: Bioassay-guided metabolomic analyses led to the characterization of four new 20-membered glycosylated polyketide macrolactams, macrotermycins A-D, from a termite-associated actinomycete, Amycolatopsis sp. M39. M39's sequenced genome revealed the macrotermycin's putative biosynthetic gene cluster. Macrotermycins A and C had antibacterial activity against human-pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and, of greater ecological relevance, they also had selective antifungal activity against a fungal parasite of the termite fungal garden.	1
Title: Analysis of saponins detoxification genes in Ilyonectria mors-panacis G3B inducing root rot of Panax notoginseng by RNA-Seq Abstract: Saponins are kinds of antifungal compounds produced by Panax notoginseng to resist invasion by pathogens. Ilyonectria mors-panacis G3B was the dominant pathogen inducing root rot of P. notoginseng, and the abilities to detoxify saponins were the key to infect P. notoginseng successfully. To research the molecular mechanisms of detoxifying saponins in I. mors-panacis G3B, we used high-throughput RNA-Seq to identify 557 and 1519 differential expression genes (DEGs) in I. mors-panacis G3B with saponins treatments for 4H (Hours) and 12H (Hours) compared with no saponins treatments, respectively. Among these DEGs, we found 93 genes which were simultaneously highly expressed in I. mors-panacis G3B with saponins treatments for 4H and 12H, they mainly belong to genes encoding transporters, glycoside hydrolases, oxidation-reduction enzymes, transcription factors and so on. In addition, there were 21 putative PHI (Pathogen-Host Interaction) genes out of those 93 up-regulated genes. In this report, we analyzed virulence-associated genes in I. mors-panacis G3B which may be related to detoxifying saponins to infect P. notoginseng successfully. They provided an excellent starting point for in-depth study on pathogenicity of I. mors-panacis G3B and developed appropriate root rot disease management strategies in the future.	0
Title: The mithramycin gene cluster of Streptomyces argillaceus contains a positive regulatory gene and two repeated DNA sequences that are located at both ends of the cluster Abstract: Sequencing of a 4.3-kb DNA region from the chromosome of Streptomyces argillaceus, a mithramycin producer, revealed the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs). The first one (orfA) codes for a protein that resembles several transport proteins. The second one (mtmR) codes for a protein similar to positive regulators involved in antibiotic biosynthesis (DnrI, SnoA, ActII-orf4, CcaR, and RedD) belonging to the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family. Both ORFs are separated by a 1.9-kb, apparently noncoding region. Replacement of the mtmR region by an antibiotic resistance cassette completely abolished mithramycin biosynthesis. Expression of mtmR in a high-copy-number vector in S. argillaceus caused a 16-fold increase in mithramycin production. The mtmR gene restored actinorhodin production in Streptomyces coelicolor JF1 mutant, in which the actinorhodin-specific activator ActII-orf4 is inactive, and also stimulated actinorhodin production by Streptomyces lividans TK21. A 241-bp region located 1.9 kb upstream of mtmR was found to be repeated approximately 50 kb downstream of mtmR at the other end of the mithramycin gene cluster. A model to explain a possible route for the acquisition of the mithramycin gene cluster by S. argillaceus is proposed.	1
Title: DNA binding of the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog alters in vitro DNA flexibility Abstract: BpH1, the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog, interacts with chromosomal DNA. With DNase I protection assays, we demonstrate in this study that BpH1 binds DNA in a nonspecific manner and that it may cover DNA fragments from end to end. Although the binding was shown to be nonspecific, preferential binding sites and sites resistant to BpH1 binding were identified within and upstream of the pertussis toxin promoter sequence. In the presence of DNA ligase, BpH1 favored the formation of multimeric DNA fragments of various sizes and prevented ring closures, suggesting a diminished flexibility of the DNA fragments and thus indicating that BpH1 acts as a macromolecular crowding agent.	0
Title: Antitumor active fucoidan from the brown seaweed, umitoranoo (Sargassum thunbergii) Abstract: Neutral and acidic polysaccharides and their protein complexes were fractionated and purified from the brown seaweed umitoranoo (Sargassum thunbergii) by fractional extraction, iron-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Thirty-one polysaccharide fractions were obtained and tested for antitumor activity in mice with Ehrlich carcinoma transplanted i.p. Two of the fractions, GIV-A ([alpha]25D -127 degrees and mol. wt., 19,000) and GIV-B ([alpha]25D -110 degrees and mol. wt., 13,500) had such activity. On the basis of chemical and spectral analyses, these compounds were found to be a fucoidan or L-fucan containing approx. 30% sulfate ester groups per fucose residue, about 10% uronic acid, and less than 2% protein.	0
Title: Cacaoidin, First Member of the New Lanthidin RiPP Family Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) characterized by the presence of lanthionine or methyllanthionine rings and their antimicrobial activity. Cacaoidin, a novel glycosylated lantibiotic, was isolated from a Streptomyces cacaoi strain and fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, chemical derivatization approaches and genome analysis. The new molecule combines outstanding structural features, such as a high number of d-amino acids, an uncommon glycosylated tyrosine residue and an unprecedented N,N-dimethyl lanthionine. This latter feature places cacaoidin within a new RiPP family located between lanthipeptides and linaridins, here termed lanthidins. Cacaoidin displayed potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Clostridium difficile. The biosynthetic gene cluster showed low homology with those of other known lanthipeptides or linaridins, suggesting a new RiPP biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Elusive metal-free primary amination of arylboronic acids: synthetic studies and mechanism by density functional theory Abstract: Herein, we disclose the first metal-free synthesis of primary aromatic amines from arylboronic acids, a reaction that has eluded synthetic chemists for decades. This remarkable transformation affords structurally diverse primary arylamines in good chemical yields, including a variety of halogenated primary anilines that often cannot be prepared via transition-metal-catalyzed amination. The reaction is operationally simple, requires only a slight excess of aminating agent, proceeds under neutral or basic conditions, and, importantly, can be scaled up to provide multigram quantities of primary anilines. Density functional calculations reveal that the most likely mechanism involves a facile 1,2-aryl migration and that the presence of an ortho nitro group in the aminating agent plays a critical role in lowering the free energy barrier of the 1,2-aryl migration step.	0
Title: Following the Reaction of Heteroanions inside a {W18O56} Polyoxometalate Nanocage by NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry Abstract: By incorporating phosphorus(III)-based anions into a polyoxometalate cage, a new type of tungsten-based unconventional Dawson-like cluster, [W18O56(HP(III)O3)2(H2O)2](8-), was isolated, in which the reaction of the two phosphite anions [HPO3](2-) within the {W18O56} cage could be followed spectroscopically. As well as full X-ray crystallographic analysis, we studied the reactivity of the cluster using both solution-state NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These techniques show that the cluster undergoes a structural rearrangement in solution whereby the {HPO3} moieties dimerize to form a weakly interacting (O3PH⋅⋅⋅HPO3) moiety. In the crystalline state the cluster exhibits a thermally triggered oxidation of the two P(III) template moieties to form P(V) centers (phosphite to phosphate), commensurate with the transformation of the cage into a Wells-Dawson {W18O54} cluster.	0
Title: Bottom-up approaches in synthetic biology and biomaterials for tissue engineering applications Abstract: Synthetic biologists use engineering principles to design and construct genetic circuits for programming cells with novel functions. A bottom-up approach is commonly used to design and construct genetic circuits by piecing together functional modules that are capable of reprogramming cells with novel behavior. While genetic circuits control cell operations through the tight regulation of gene expression, a diverse array of environmental factors within the extracellular space also has a significant impact on cell behavior. This extracellular space offers an addition route for synthetic biologists to apply their engineering principles to program cell-responsive modules within the extracellular space using biomaterials. In this review, we discuss how taking a bottom-up approach to build genetic circuits using DNA modules can be applied to biomaterials for controlling cell behavior from the extracellular milieu. We suggest that, by collectively controlling intrinsic and extrinsic signals in synthetic biology and biomaterials, tissue engineering outcomes can be improved.	0
Title: Competing charge transfer pathways at the photosystem II-electrode interface Abstract: The integration of the water-oxidation enzyme photosystem II (PSII) into electrodes allows the electrons extracted from water oxidation to be harnessed for enzyme characterization and to drive novel endergonic reactions. However, PSII continues to underperform in integrated photoelectrochemical systems despite extensive optimization efforts. Here we carried out protein-film photoelectrochemistry using spinach and Thermosynechococcus elongatus PSII, and we identified a competing charge transfer pathway at the enzyme-electrode interface that short-circuits the known water-oxidation pathway. This undesirable pathway occurs as a result of photo-induced O2 reduction occurring at the chlorophyll pigments and is promoted by the embedment of PSII in an electron-conducting fullerene matrix, a common strategy for enzyme immobilization. Anaerobicity helps to recover the PSII photoresponse and unmasks the onset potentials relating to the QA/QB charge transfer process. These findings impart a fuller understanding of the charge transfer pathways within PSII and at photosystem-electrode interfaces, which will lead to more rational design of pigment-containing photoelectrodes in general.	0
Title: Biosynthetic pathway and gene cluster analysis of curacin A, an antitubulin natural product from the tropical marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula Abstract: Curacin A (1) is a potent cancer cell toxin obtained from strains of the tropical marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula found in Curaçao. Its structure is unique in that it contains the sequential positioning of a thiazoline and cyclopropyl ring, and it exerts its potent cell toxicity through interaction with the colchicine drug binding site on microtubules. A series of stable isotope-labeled precursors were fed to cultures of curacin A-producing strains and, following NMR analysis, allowed determination of the metabolic origin of all atoms in the natural product (one cysteine, 10 acetate units, two S-adenosyl methionine-derived methyl groups) as well as several unique mechanistic insights. Moreover, these incorporation experiments facilitated an effective gene cloning strategy that allowed identification and sequencing of the approximately 64 kb putative curacin A gene cluster. The metabolic system is comprised of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and multiple polyketide synthases (PKSs) and shows a very high level of collinearity between genes in the cluster and the predicted biochemical steps required for curacin biosynthesis. Unique features of the cluster include (1) all but one of the PKSs are monomodular multifunctional proteins, (2) a unique gene cassette that contains an HMG-CoA synthase likely responsible for formation of the cyclopropyl ring, and (3) a terminating motif that is predicted to function in both product release and terminal dehydrative decarboxylation.	1
Title: Molecular Recognition in C-Type Lectins: The Cases of DC-SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L-Sectin Abstract: Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross-talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll-like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C-type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.	0
Title: Deletions in Klebsiella pneumoniae R plasmids induced by growth in the presence of acridine orange at high temperature Abstract: The generation in vivo of plasmids deleted at specific sites in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae containing R plasmids, by treatment with high concentrations of acridine orange (1.2 mg/ml) at 42 degrees C are reported. These deletions seem to be site specific because loss of specific restriction fragments after digestion with restriction enzymes was demonstrated.	0
Title: Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells Abstract: We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.	0
Title: The ard1 gene from Streptomyces capreolus encodes a polypeptide of the ABC-transporters superfamily which confers resistance to the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A Abstract: A gene (ard1) encoding resistance to the aminonucleoside antibiotic A201A was cloned from Streptomyces capreolus NRRL 3817, the producing organism, and expressed in Streptomyces lividans. The gene ard1 induced antibiotic resistance that was highly specific for A201A. The nucleotide sequence of ard1 contains an open reading frame of 1677 bp. Transcription initiation was found to take place approximately 86 nucleotides preceding the ATG translation-initiation codon, indicating that ard1 is transcribed from its own promoter. The deduced protein sequence (Ard1, 558 amino acids) presents two ATP-binding domains with significant similarities to those of the ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC-transporters) superfamily, including some that confer drug resistance in a variety of antibiotic-producing Streptomyces, other Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotic cells. As is probably the case for most of these proteins, the mechanism of A201A resistance conferred by Ard1 is an active efflux energized by ATP hydrolysis.	1
Title: Improvement of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 production by manipulating its biosynthetic pathway regulation in Streptomyces globisporus Abstract: The production of C-1027 in Streptomyces globisporus was previously increased 2- to 3-fold by manipulating three pathway-specific activators, SgcR1, SgcR2, and SgcR3. In this study, we have further characterized two putative C-1027 regulatory genes, sgcE1 and sgcR, by in vivo inactivation. The HxlR family DNA-binding protein SgcE1 was not essential for C-1027 biosynthesis, since inactivation of sgcE1 showed no effect on C-1027 production. In contrast, the proposed repressive role of the sgcR gene was confirmed by a 3-fold increase in C-1027 production in the ΔsgcR mutant S. globisporus SB1022 strain relative to the wild-type strain. Considering SgcR shows no significant similarity to any protein of known function, it may be representative of a new family of regulatory proteins. Finally, overexpression of the previously characterized activator sgcR1 in S. globisporus SB1022 increased the C-1027 yield to 37.5 ± 7.7 mg/L, which is about 7-fold higher than the wild-type strain.	1
Title: Bioreductively Activatable Prodrug Conjugates of Combretastatin A-1 and Combretastatin A-4 as Anticancer Agents Targeted toward Tumor-Associated Hypoxia Abstract: The natural products combretastatin A-1 (CA1) and combretastatin A-4 (CA4) function as potent inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and as selective vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) in tumors. Bioreductively activatable prodrug conjugates (BAPCs) can enhance selectivity by serving as substrates for reductase enzymes specifically in hypoxic regions of tumors. A series of CA1-BAPCs incorporating nor-methyl, mono-methyl, and gem-dimethyl nitrothiophene triggers were synthesized together with corresponding CA4-BAPCs, previously reported by Davis (Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006, 5 (11), 2886), for comparison. The CA4-gem-dimethylnitrothiophene BAPC 45 proved exemplary in comparison to its nor-methyl 43 and mono-methyl 44 congeners. It was stable in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 24 h), was cleaved (25%, 90 min) by NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), was inactive (desirable prodrug attribute) as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization (IC50 > 20 μM), and demonstrated hypoxia-selective activation in the A549 cell line [hypoxia cytotoxicity ratio (HCR) = 41.5]. The related CA1-gem-dimethylnitrothiophene BAPC 41 was also promising (HCR = 12.5) with complete cleavage (90 min) upon treatment with POR. In a preliminary in vivo dynamic bioluminescence imaging study, BAPC 45 (180 mg/kg, ip) induced a decrease (within 4 h) in light emission in a 4T1 syngeneic mouse breast tumor model, implying activation and vascular disruption.	0
Title: Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris: a cluster of 15 genes is involved in the biosynthesis of the LPS O-antigen and the LPS core Abstract: As a result of mutational and DNA sequence analysis, a wxc gene cluster involved in the synthesis of the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was identified in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. This gene cluster comprises 15 genes. It was located on a cloned 35-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA, close, but not directly adjacent, to previously characterized genes for LPS biosynthesis. The G + C content of all but one of the wxc genes was atypically low for X. campestris pv. campestris, while the G + C distribution was uniform throughout the cluster. An SDS-PAGE analysis of mutant strains defective in various wxc genes confirmed that genes from this cluster were involved in LPS biosynthesis. The mutant phenotypes allowed the differentiation of three regions within the wxc cluster. Genes from wxc region 1 are necessary for the biosynthesis of the water-soluble LPS O-antigen. Analysis of DNA and deduced amino acid sequences led to the identification of two glycosyltransferases, two components of an ABC transport system, and a possible kinase among the seven putative proteins encoded by genes constituting wxc region 1. The two genes in wxc region 2 were similar to gmd and rmd, which direct the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide GDP-D-rhamnose. Mutations affecting wxc region 2 demonstrated its involvement in the formation of the LPS core. Genes from wxc region 3 showed similarities to genes that code for enzymes that modify nucleotide sugars, and to components of sugar translocation systems that have so far been rarely described in bacteria.	1
Title: Mutational analysis of the group A streptococcal operon encoding streptolysin S and its virulence role in invasive infection Abstract: The pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) produces a wide spectrum of infections including necrotizing fasciitis (NF). Streptolysin S (SLS) produces the hallmark beta-haemolytic phenotype produced by GAS. The nine-gene GAS locus (sagA-sagI) resembling a bacteriocin biosynthetic operon is necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Using precise, in-frame allelic exchange mutagenesis and single-gene complementation, we show sagA, sagB, sagC, sagD, sagE, sagF and sagG are each individually required for SLS production, and that sagE may further serve an immunity function. Limited site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids in the SagA prepropeptide supports the designation of SLS as a bacteriocin-like toxin. No significant pleotrophic effects of sagA deletion were observed on M protein, capsule or cysteine protease production. In a murine model of NF, the SLS-negative M1T1 GAS mutant was markedly diminished in its ability to produce necrotic skin ulcers and spread to the systemic circulation. The SLS toxin impaired phagocytic clearance and promoted epithelial cell cytotoxicity, the latter phenotype being enhanced by the effects of M protein and streptolysin O. We conclude that all genetic components of the sag operon are required for expression of functional SLS, an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of invasive M1T1 GAS infection.	1
Title: A Diastereodivergent and Enantioselective Approach to syn- and anti-Diamines: Development of 2-Azatrienes for Cu-Catalyzed Reductive Couplings with Imines That Furnish Allylic Amines Abstract: We introduce a new reagent class, 2-azatrienes, as a platform for catalytic enantioselective synthesis of allylic amines. Herein, we demonstrate their promise by a diastereodivergent synthesis of syn- and anti-1,2-diamines through their Cu-bis(phosphine)-catalyzed reductive couplings with imines. With Ph-BPE as the supporting ligand, anti-diamines are obtained (up to 91% yield, >20:1 dr, and >99:1 er), and with the rarely utilized t-Bu-BDPP, syn-diamines are generated (up to 76% yield, 1:>20 dr, and 97:3 er).	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin is regulated by a histidine kinase/response regulator system Abstract: Subtilin is a lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic) which is produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Upstream from the structural gene of subtilin, spaS, three genes (spaB, spaT, and spaC) which are involved in the biosynthesis of subtilin have been identified (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, N. Schnell, and K.-D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:132-142, 1992). By using a hybridization probe specific for these genes, the DNA region downstream from spaS was isolated. Further subcloning revealed a 5.2-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment on which two open reading frames, spaR and spaK, were identified approximately 3 kb downstream from spaS. The spaR gene encodes an open reading frame of 220 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kDa. SpaR shows 35% similarity to positive regulatory factors OmpR and PhoB. The spaK gene encodes an open reading frame of 387 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 44.6 kDa and was highly similar to histidine kinases previously described (PhoM, PhoR, and NtrB). Hydrophobicity blots suggested two membrane-spanning regions. Thus, spaR and spaK belong to a recently identified family of environmentally responsive regulators. These results indicated a regulatory function of spaR and spaK in subtilin biosynthesis. Indeed, batch culture experiments confirmed the regulation of subtilin biosynthesis starting in the mid-logarithmic growth phase and reaching its maximum in the early stationary growth phase. Gene deletions within spaR and spaK yielded subtilin-negative mutants, which confirms that subtilin biosynthesis is under the control of a two-component regulatory system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: cluster analysis and assignment of functions Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin has been cloned from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Sequence analysis indicates that the macrolide ring of borrelidin is formed by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) (borA1-A6), a result that was confirmed by disruption of borA3. The borrelidin PKS is striking because only seven rather than the nine modules expected for a nonaketide product are encoded by borA1-A6. The starter unit of the PKS has been verified as trans-cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (trans-1,2-CPDA), and the genes involved in its biosynthesis identified. Other genes responsible for biosynthesis of the nitrile moiety, regulation, and self-resistance were also identified.	1
Title: Characterization of E. coli O24 and O56 O antigen gene clusters reveals a complex evolutionary history of the O24 gene cluster Abstract: O antigen is part of the lipopolysaccharide present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It has many different forms, which are almost entirely due to genetic variations of O antigen gene clusters. In this study, the O antigen gene clusters of E. coli O24 and O56 were sequenced, and all genes were assigned functions on the basis of homology. Comparison of O antigen gene clusters indicated that E. coli O24 O antigen gene cluster has possibly arisen from the E. coli O56 gene cluster, through inactivation of two glycosyltransferase genes and acquisition of two new genes from E. coli O157 and O152, respectively. The insertion sequence elements seemed to play important roles for the assembly of the O24 O antigen gene cluster. This is the first time that the evolutionary history of a multi-origin O antigen gene cluster is clearly demonstrated. Genes specific to E. coli O24 and O56 were also identified, which may be used for development of DNA-based serotyping schemes.	1
Title: Tripping the light fantastic: blue-light photoreceptors as examples of environmentally modulated protein-protein interactions Abstract: Blue-light photoreceptors play a pivotal role in detecting the quality and quantity of light in the environment, controlling a wide range of biological responses. Several families of blue-light photoreceptors have been characterized in detail using biophysics and biochemistry, beginning with photon absorption, through intervening signal transduction, to regulation of biological activities. Here we review the light oxygen voltage, cryptochrome, and sensors of blue light using FAD families, three different groups of proteins that offer distinctly different modes of photochemical activation and signal transduction yet play similar roles in a vast array of biological responses. We cover mechanisms of light activation and propagation of conformational responses that modulate protein-protein interactions involved in biological signaling. Discovery and characterization of these processes in natural proteins are now allowing the design of photoregulatable engineered proteins, facilitating the generation of novel reagents for biochemical and cell biological research.	0
Title: Each peptide of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 requires a separate modification enzyme for activity Abstract: The genetic determinants for production and immunity to the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 are encoded by a 12.6 kb region of the plasmid pMRC01. This region contains ten genes arranged in two divergent clusters; these include the structural genes and a number of genes whose products show significant similarity to proteins involved in the biosynthesis of other lantibiotics. Using a strategy of deletion and mutational analysis, the effect of disruption of a number of these genes was investigated. Inactivation of either of the structural genes, ltnA1 or ltnA2, resulted in mutants that were incapable of producing active lacticin 3147; however, the combination of the cell-free supernatant from both mutants resulted in a restoration of bacteriocin activity, confirming that processing and export of the structural peptides can occur independently. An unusual feature of the lacticin 3147 gene cluster is the presence of two lanM homologues, whose gene products are proposed to be involved in the dehydration and thioether-forming reactions which result in lanthionine bridge formation. Mutants created in the ltnM1 and ltnM2 genes were also incapable of lantibiotic production, confirming an essential role for these enzymes in the lacticin 3147 biosynthetic pathway and supporting the assertion that these proteins are modification enzymes. Interestingly, addition of purified LtnA1, but not purified LtnA2, to the cell-free supernatant of the ltnM1 mutant restored bacteriocin activity; in contrast, only purified LtnA2 could complement the cell-free supernatant of the ltnM2 mutant. Creation of a number of double mutants supported these findings, and confirmed that LtnM1 is required to produce mature LtnA1, while LtnM2 is required to produce mature LtnA2.	1
Title: Synthetic Ecology of Microbes: Mathematical Models and Applications Abstract: As the indispensable role of natural microbial communities in many aspects of life on Earth is uncovered, the bottom-up engineering of synthetic microbial consortia with novel functions is becoming an attractive alternative to engineering single-species systems. Here, we summarize recent work on synthetic microbial communities with a particular emphasis on open challenges and opportunities in environmental sustainability and human health. We next provide a critical overview of mathematical approaches, ranging from phenomenological to mechanistic, to decipher the principles that govern the function, dynamics and evolution of microbial ecosystems. Finally, we present our outlook on key aspects of microbial ecosystems and synthetic ecology that require further developments, including the need for more efficient computational algorithms, a better integration of empirical methods and model-driven analysis, the importance of improving gene function annotation, and the value of a standardized library of well-characterized organisms to be used as building blocks of synthetic communities.	0
Title: Molecular cloning and functional characterization of two CYP619 cytochrome P450s involved in biosynthesis of patulin in Aspergillus clavatus Abstract: Patulin is an acetate-derived tetraketide mycotoxin produced by several fungal species, especially Aspergillus, Penicillium and Byssochlamys species. The health risks due to patulin consumption by humans have led many countries to regulate it in human food. Previous studies have shown the involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in the hydroxylation of two precursors of patulin, m-cresol and m-hydroxybenzylalcohol. In the present study, two cytochrome P450 genes were identified in the genome sequence of Aspergillus clavatus, a patulin-producing species. Both mRNAs were strongly co-expressed during patulin production. CYP619C2, encoded by the first gene, consists of 529 aa, while the second cytochrome, CYP619C3, consists of 524 aa. The coding sequences were used to perform the heterologous expression of functional enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bioconversion assays showed that CYP619C3 catalysed the hydroxylation of m-cresol to yield m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. CYP619C2 catalysed the hydroxylation of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and m-cresol to gentisyl alcohol and 2,5-dihydroxytoluene (toluquinol), respectively. Except for the last compound, all enzyme products are known precursors of patulin. Taken together, these data strongly suggest the involvement of CYP619C2 and CYP619C3 in the biosynthesis of patulin. CYP619C2 and CYP619C3 are located near to two other genes involved in patulin biosynthesis, namely the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (6msas) and isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (idh) genes. The current data associated with an analysis of the sequence of A. clavatus suggest the presence of a cluster of 15 genes involved in patulin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of lactocyclicin Q, a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. strain QU 12 Abstract: Lactococcus sp. strain QU 12, which was isolated from cheese, produced a novel cyclic bacteriocin termed lactocyclicin Q. By using cation-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, lactocyclicin Q was purified from culture supernatant, and its molecular mass was determined to be 6,062.8 Da by mass spectrometry. Lactocyclicin Q has been characterized by its unique antimicrobial spectrum, high level of protease resistance, and heat stability compared to other reported bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria. The amino acid sequence of lactocyclicin Q was determined chemically, and this compound is composed of 61 amino acid residues that have a cyclic structure with linkage between the N and C termini by a peptide bond. It showed no homology to any other antimicrobial peptide, including cyclic bacteriocins. On the basis of the amino acid sequences obtained, the sequence of the gene encoding the prepeptide lactocyclicin Q was obtained. This is the first report of a cyclic bacteriocin purified from a strain belonging to the genus Lactococcus.	1
Title: Characterization of a silent azaphilone gene cluster from Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 reveals a hydroxylation-mediated pyran-ring formation Abstract: Azaphilones are a class of fungal metabolites characterized by a highly oxygenated pyrano-quinone bicyclic core and exhibiting a broad range of bioactivities. Although widespread among various fungi, their biosynthesis has not been thoroughly elucidated. By activation of a silent (aza) gene cluster in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015, we discovered six azaphilone compounds, azanigerones A-F (1, 3-7). Transcriptional analysis and deletion of a key polyketide synthase (PKS) gene further confirmed the involvement of the aza gene cluster. The biosynthetic pathway was shown to involve the convergent actions of a highly reducing PKS and a non-reducing PKS. Most significantly, in vitro reaction of a key flavin-dependent monooxygenase encoded in the cluster with an early benzaldehyde intermediate revealed its roles in hydroxylation and pyran-ring formation to afford the characteristic bicylic core shared by azaphilones.	1
Title: A hydrated crystalline calcium carbonate phase: Calcium carbonate hemihydrate Abstract: As one of the most abundant materials in the world, calcium carbonate, CaCO3, is the main constituent of the skeletons and shells of various marine organisms. It is used in the cement industry and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and formation of sedimentary rocks. For more than a century, only three polymorphs of pure CaCO3-calcite, aragonite, and vaterite-were known to exist at ambient conditions, as well as two hydrated crystal phases, monohydrocalcite (CaCO3·1H2O) and ikaite (CaCO3·6H2O). While investigating the role of magnesium ions in crystallization pathways of amorphous calcium carbonate, we unexpectedly discovered an unknown crystalline phase, hemihydrate CaCO3·½H2O, with monoclinic structure. This discovery may have important implications in biomineralization, geology, and industrial processes based on hydration of CaCO3.	0
Title: Identification of an inhibitory mechanism of luteolin on the insulin-like growth factor-1 ligand-receptor interaction Abstract: Using single-molecule force measurement and fluorescence imaging, we have demonstrated that luteolin has an inhibitory effect on IGF-1 ligand-receptor binding, the initial step in IGF-1 signaling. This inhibition mechanism, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and molecular docking, could play a role in cancer therapy.	0
Title: Identification of novel hrp-regulated genes through functional genomic analysis of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 genome Abstract: Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 infects the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, causing disease symptoms characterized by necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis. One mechanism used by Pst DC3000 to infect host plants is the type III protein secretion system, which is thought to deliver multiple effector proteins to the plant cell. The exact number of type III effectors in Pst DC3000 or any other plant pathogenic bacterium is not known. All known type III effector genes of P. syringae are regulated by HrpS, an NtrC family protein, and the HrpL alternative sigma factor, which presumably binds to a conserved cis element (called the "hrp box") in the promoters of type III secretion-associated genes. In this study, we designed a search motif based on the promoter sequences conserved in 12 published hrp operons and putative effector genes in Pst DC3000. Seventy-three predicted genes were retrieved from the January 2001 release of the Pst DC3000 genome sequence, which had 95% genome coverage. The expression of the 73 genes was analysed by microarray and Northern blotting, revealing 24 genes/operons (including eight novel genes), the expression of which was consistently higher in hrp-inducing minimal medium than in nutrient-rich Luria-Bertani broth. Expression of all eight genes was dependent on the hrpS gene. Most were also dependent on the hrpL gene, but at least one was dependent on the hrpS gene, but not on the hrpL gene. An AvrRpt2-based type III translocation assay provides evidence that some of the hrpS-regulated novel genes encode putative effector proteins.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 as a Producer of an Anthraquinone-Fused Enediyne Abstract: A new anthraquinone-fused enediyne, yangpumicin A (YPM A, 1), along with four Bergman cyclization congeners (YPM B-E, 2-5), was isolated from Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 after mining enediyne biosynthetic gene clusters from public actinobacterial genome databases and prioritizing the hits by an enediyne genome neighborhood network analysis for discovery. YPM A is potent against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines. The discovery of 1 provides new opportunities for the functionalization of enediynes to develop new conjugation chemistries for antibody-drug conjugates.	1
Title: Pore-forming activity is not sufficient for Legionella pneumophila phagosome trafficking and intracellular growth Abstract: Bacterial pathogens often subvert eukaryotic cellular processes in order to establish a replicative niche and evade host immunity. Inhibition of phagosome lysosome fusion is a strategy used by several intracellular bacteria that grow within mammalian cells. It was shown recently that Legionella pneumophila possesses a cytolytic activity that results from the insertion of pores in the macrophage membrane upon contact, and that this activity requires the dot/icm gene products, which are necessary for intracellular growth and phagosome trafficking. Other bacteria that inhibit phagosome lysosome fusion, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, demonstrate similar cytolytic activities, which suggests that formation of pores in the phagosome membrane may account for the defects observed in phagosome trafficking. In this study, we identify a new class of L. pneumophila mutant that retains the pore-forming activity found in virulent bacteria, but is defective in phagosome lysosome fusion inhibition and intracellular growth. These data indicate that cytolytic activity is not sufficient for L. pneumophila-induced alterations in phagosome trafficking. Rather, the pore may be a vehicle that facilitates delivery of bacterial-derived effector molecules to the host cell cytoplasm.	0
Title: Frameworks for programming biological function through RNA parts and devices Abstract: One of the long-term goals of synthetic biology is to reliably engineer biological systems that perform human-defined functions. Currently, researchers face several scientific and technical challenges in designing and building biological systems, one of which is associated with our limited ability to access, transmit, and control molecular information through the design of functional biomolecules exhibiting novel properties. The fields of RNA biology and nucleic acid engineering, along with the tremendous interdisciplinary growth of synthetic biology, are fueling advances in the emerging field of RNA programming in living systems. Researchers are designing functional RNA molecules that exhibit increasingly complex functions and integrating these molecules into cellular circuits to program higher-level biological functions. The continued integration and growth of RNA design and synthetic biology presents exciting potential to transform how we interact with and program biology.	0
Title: Catalytic Enantioselective Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation: Phosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzylic Ethers via the Oxidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds Abstract: Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, γ-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene.	0
Title: Genome-wide detection of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single human cell Abstract: Kindred cells can have different genomes because of dynamic changes in DNA. Single-cell sequencing is needed to characterize these genomic differences but has been hindered by whole-genome amplification bias, resulting in low genome coverage. Here, we report on a new amplification method-multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC)-that offers high uniformity across the genome. Sequencing MALBAC-amplified DNA achieves 93% genome coverage ≥1x for a single human cell at 25x mean sequencing depth. We detected digitized copy-number variations (CNVs) of a single cancer cell. By sequencing three kindred cells, we were able to identify individual single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with no false positives detected. We directly measured the genome-wide mutation rate of a cancer cell line and found that purine-pyrimidine exchanges occurred unusually frequently among the newly acquired SNVs.	0
Title: The DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system activates inert wild type pi initiator protein of R6K into a form active in replication initiation Abstract: The plasmid R6K is an interesting model system for investigating initiation of DNA replication, not only near the primary binding sites of the initiator protein pi but also at a distance, caused by pi -mediated DNA looping. An important milestone in the mechanistic analysis of this replicon was the development of a reconstituted replication system consisting of 22 different highly purified proteins (Abhyankar, M. A., Zzaman, S., and Bastia, D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 45476-45484). Although the in vitro reconstituted system promotes ori gamma-specific initiation of replication by a mutant form of the initiator called pi*, the wild type (WT) pi is functionally inert in this system. Here we show that the chaperone DnaK along with its co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE were needed to activate WT pi and caused it to initiate replication in vitro at the correct origin. We show further that the reaction was relatively chaperone-specific and that other chaperones, such as ClpB and ClpX, were incapable of activating WT pi. The molecular mechanism of activation appeared to be a chaperone-catalyzed facilitation of dimeric inert WT pi into iteron-bound monomers. Protein-protein interaction analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that, in the absence of ATP, DnaJ directly interacted with pi but its binary interactions with DnaK and GrpE and with ClpB and ClpX were at background levels, suggesting that pi is recruited by protein-protein interaction with DnaJ and then fed into the DnaK chaperone machine to promote initiator activation.	0
Title: RNAi screen identifies Brd4 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukaemia Abstract: Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.	0
Title: Biochemical characterization of the beta-1,4-glucuronosyltransferase GelK in the gellan gum-producing strain Sphingomonas paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461 Abstract: Biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharide-repeat units proceeds by sequential transfer of sugars, from the appropriate sugar donor to an activated lipid carrier, by committed glycosyltransferases (GTs). Few studies on the mechanism of action for this type of GT are available. Sphingomonas paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461 produces the industrially important polysaccharide gellan gum. We have cloned the gelK gene from S. paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461. GelK belongs to family 1 of the GT classification [Campbell, Davies, Bulone, Henrissat (1997) Biochem. J. 326, 929-939]. Sequence similarity studies suggest that GelK consists of two protein modules corresponding to the -NH(2) and -CO(2)H halves, the latter possibly harbouring the GT activity. The gelK gene and the open reading frames coding for the -NH(2) (GelK(NH2)) and -CO(2)H (GelK(COOH)) halves were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. GelK and GelK(NH2) were present in both the soluble and membrane fractions of E. coli, whereas GelK(COOH) was only present in the soluble fraction. GelK catalysed the transfer of [(14)C]glucuronic acid from UDP-[(14)C]glucuronic acid into a glycolipid extracted from S. paucimobilis or E. coli, even in the presence of EDTA, and the radioactive sugar was released from the glycolipid by beta-1,4-glucuronidase. GelK was not able to use synthetic glucosyl derivatives as acceptors, indicating that the PP(i)-lipid moiety is needed for enzymic activity. Recombinant GelK(NH2) and GelK(COOH) did not show detectable activity. Based on the biochemical characteristics of GelK and on sequence similarities with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, we propose that GT families 1 and 28 form a superfamily.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin, an SJG-136 monomeric analog Abstract: Tomaymycin produced by Streptomyces achromogenes is a naturally produced pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). The biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin was identified and sequenced. The gene cluster analysis reveals a novel biosynthetic pathway for the anthranilate moiety of PBDs. Gene replacement and chemical complementation studies were used to confirm the proposed biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Honokiol for the Treatment of Neonatal Pain and Prevention of Consequent Neurobehavioral Disorders Abstract: This study examined the short- and long-term neuroprotective and analgesic activity of honokiol (a naturally occurring lignan isolated from Magnolia) on developing brains in neonates exposed to inflammatory pain, known to cause neuronal cell death. Postnatal day 4 (P4) neonatal rat pups were subjected to intraplantar formalin injection to four paws as a model of severe neonatal pain. Intraperitoneal honokiol (10 mg/kg) or corn oil vehicle control was administered 1 h prior to formalin insult, and animals were maintained on honokiol through postnatal day 21 (P21). Behavioral tests for stress and pain were performed after the painful insult, followed by morphological examinations of the brain sections at P7 and P21. Honokiol significantly attenuated acute pain responses 30 min following formalin insult and decreased chronic thermal hyperalgesia later in life. Honokiol-treated rats performed better on tests of exploratory behavior and performed significantly better in tests of memory. Honokiol treatment normalized hippocampal and thalamic c-Fos and hippocampal alveus substance P receptor expression relative to controls at P21. Together, these findings support that (1) neonatal pain experiences predispose rats to the development of chronic behavioral changes and (2) honokiol prevents and reduces both acute and chronic pathological pain-induced deteriorations in neonatal rats.	0
Title: Rationally designed glycosylated premithramycins: hybrid aromatic polyketides using genes from three different biosynthetic pathways Abstract: Heterologous expression of the urdGT2 gene from the urdamycin producer Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, which encodes a C-glycosyltransferase, into mutants of the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus, in which either one or all glycosyltransferases were inactivated, yielded four novel C-glycosylated premithramycin-type molecules. Structure elucidation revealed these to be 9-C-olivosylpremithramycinone, 9-C-mycarosylpremithramycinone, and their respective 4-O-demethyl analogues. In another experiment, both the urdGT2 gene from S. fradiae and the lanGT1 gene from S. cyanogenus, were coexpressed into a S. argillaceus mutant lacking the MtmGIV glycosyltransferase. This experiment, in which genes from three different organisms were combined, resulted in the production of 9-C-(olivo-1-4-olivosyl)premithramycinone. These results prove the unique substrate flexibility of the C-glycosyltransferase UrdGT2, which tolerates not only a variety of sugar-donor substrates, but also various acceptor substrates. The five new hybrid products also represent the first compounds, in which sugars were attached to a position that is normally unglycosylated. The successful combination of two glycosyltransferases in the latter experiment proves that the design of saccharide side chains by combinatorial biosynthetic methods is possible.	1
Title: Mutation of a highly conserved base in the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA restricts ribosomal frameshifting Abstract: A mutation shown to cause resistance to chloramphenicol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mapped to the central loop in domain V of the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA. The mutant 21S rRNA has a base pair exchange from U2677 (corresponding to U2504 in Escherichia coli) to C2677, which significantly reduces rightward frameshifting at a UU UUU UCC A site in a +1 U mutant. There is evidence to suggest that this reduction also applies to leftward frameshifting at the same site in a -1 U mutant. The mutation did not increase the rate of misreading of a number of mitochondrial missense, nonsense or frameshift (of both signs) mutations, and did not adversely affect the synthesis of wild-type mitochondrial gene products. It is suggested here that ribosomes bearing either the C2677 mutation or its wild-type allele may behave identically during normal decoding and only differ at sites where a ribosomal stall, by permitting non-standard decoding, differentially affects the normal interaction of tRNAs with the chloramphenicol resistant domain V. Chloramphenicol-resistant mutations mapping at two other sites in domain V are described. These mutations had no effect on frameshifting.	0
Title: An unusually large multifunctional polypeptide in the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.	1
Title: Stereochemistry of Transition Metal Complexes Controlled by the Metallo-Anomeric Effect Abstract: The use of stereoelectronic interactions to control reactivity and selectivity has a long history in chemistry. The anomeric effect, one of the fundamental concepts in organic chemistry, describes the preferences of a substituent at the anomeric carbon in glycosides to adopt axial configuration when the anomeric group is an electronegative element such as oxygen or a halogen. The origin of the anomeric effect has been the subject of intense debate. Explanations capitalizing on either the delocalization of the endocyclic oxygen lone pair into the antibonding σ*(C-X) orbital or the minimization of the dipole-dipole interactions are currently the two leading theoretical models. Although the majority of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the elements from groups 6 and 7, little is known about conformational preferences of tetrahydropyran rings substituted with a transition metal at the anomeric carbon and the role of these interactions in stereoselective synthesis. Here, we report studies on conformational and configurational preferences of organometallic complexes stabilized by vicinal heteroatoms. We provide computational evidence that late transition metals adopt the axial position in heterocycles or synclinal geometry in acyclic systems. Furthermore, the anomeric preferences of late transition metals correlate with the oxidation state of the metal and can be explained by hyperconjugative interactions between endocyclic heteroatom and the σ* acceptor orbitals of the C-M bond. In a broader context, this discovery provides insight into the role of previously unanticipated stereoelectronic effects that can be harnessed in the design of stereoselective reactions, including chemical glycosylation and enantioselective catalysis.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of the naphthocyclinone gene cluster from Streptomyces arenae DSM 40737 and heterologous expression of the polyketide synthase genes Abstract: Streptomyces arenae produces the aromatic polyketide naphthocyclinone, which exhibits activity against Gram-positive bacteria. A cosmid clone containing the putative naphthocyclinone gene cluster was isolated from a genomic library of S. arenae by hybridization with a conserved region from the actinorhodin PKS of S. coelicolor. Sequence analysis of a 5.5-kb DNA fragment, which hybridizes with the actI probe, revealed three open reading frames coding for the minimal polyketide synthase. A strong sequence similarity was found to several previously described ketosynthases, chain length factors and acyl carrier proteins from other polyketide gene clusters. An additional open reading frame downstream of the PKS genes of S. arenae showed 53% identity to act VII probably encoding an aromatase. Another open reading frame was identified in a region of 1.436 bp upstream of the PKS genes, which, however, had no similarity to known genes in the database. Approximately 8 kb upstream of the PKS genes, a DNA fragment was identified that hybridizes to an actVII--actIV specific probe coding for a cyclase and a putative regulatory protein, respectively. Disruption of the proposed naphthocyclinone gene cluster by insertion of a thiostrepton resistance gene completely abolished production of naphthocyclinones in the mutant strain, showing that indeed the naphthocyclinone gene cluster had been isolated. Heterologous expression of the minimal PKS genes in S. coelicolor CH999 in the presence of the act ketoreductase led to the production of mutactin and dehydromutactin, indicating that the S. arenae polyketide synthase forms a C-16 backbone that is subsequently dimerized to build naphthocyclinone. The functions of the proposed cyclase and aromatase were examined by coexpression with genes from different polyketide core producers.	1
Title: Elucidation of the function of two glycosyltransferase genes (lanGT1 and lanGT4) involved in landomycin biosynthesis and generation of new oligosaccharide antibiotics Abstract: Background:                       The genetic engineering of antibiotic-producing Streptomyces strains is an approach that became a successful methodology in developing new natural polyketide derivatives. Glycosyltransferases are important biosynthetic enzymes that link sugar moieties to aglycones, which often derive from polyketides. Biological activity is frequently generated along with this process. Here we report the use of glycosyltransferase genes isolated from the landomycin biosynthetic gene cluster to create hybrid landomycin/urdamycin oligosaccharide antibiotics.                  Results:                       Production of several novel urdamycin derivatives by a mutant of Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717 has been achieved in a combinatorial biosynthetic approach using glycosyltransferase genes from the landomycin producer Streptomyces cyanogenus S136. For the generation of gene cassettes useful for combinatorial biosynthesis experiments new vectors named pMUNI, pMUNII and pMUNIII were constructed. These vectors facilitate the construction of gene combinations taking advantage of the compatible MunI and EcoRI restriction sites.                  Conclusions:                       The high-yielding production of novel oligosaccharide antibiotics using glycosyltransferase gene cassettes generated in a very convenient way proves that glycosyltransferases can be flexible towards the alcohol substrate. In addition, our results indicate that LanGT1 from S. cyanogenus S136 is a D-olivosyltransferase, whereas LanGT4 is a L-rhodinosyltransferase.	1
Title: Divergent Biosynthesis of C-Nucleoside Minimycin and Indigoidine in Bacteria Abstract: Minimycin (MIN) is a C-nucleoside antibiotic structurally related to pseudouridine, and indigoidine is a naturally occurring blue pigment produced by diverse bacteria. Although MIN and indigoidine have been known for decades, the logic underlying the divergent biosynthesis of these interesting molecules has been obscure. Here, we report the identification of a minimal 5-gene cluster (min) essential for MIN biosynthesis. We demonstrated that a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (MinA) governs "the switch" for the divergent biosynthesis of MIN and the cryptic indigoidine. We also demonstrated that MinCN (the N-terminal phosphatase domain of MinC), MinD (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase), and MinT (transporter) function together as the safeguard enzymes, which collaboratively constitute an unusual self-resistance system. Finally, we provided evidence that MinD, utilizing an unprecedented substrate-competition strategy for self-resistance of the producer cell, maintains competition advantage over the active molecule MIN-5'-monophosphate by increasing the UMP pool in vivo. These findings greatly expand our knowledge regarding natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Reconstitution of the iterative type II polyketide synthase for tetracenomycin F2 biosynthesis Abstract: The tetracenomycin polyketide synthase (TCM PKS), a type II complex, produces TCM F2, a precursor of TCM C in Streptomyces glaucescens, and consists of at least the TcmK, -L, -M, and -N proteins. The TcmK/TcmL ketosynthase subunits were purified from overexpression of their genes in Streptomyces lividans. TcmK (calculated molecular mass 45 kd) and TcmL (calculated molecular mass 42 kd) function as a heterodimeric alphabeta complex based on observing that only the purified complex complemented TCM PKS activity in protein extracts made from strains bearing tcmK or tcmL deletion mutants to make TCM F2 in vitro, and that the molecular mass of the purified complex was 90 kd as estimated by gel filtration chromatography. The TCM PKS activity was reconstituted with purified protein components, indicating that the minimal set of proteins required to make TCM F2 included the ketosynthase complex (TcmKL), an acyl carrier protein (TcmM), a malonyl CoA:ACP acyltransferase (MAT), and a cyclase (TcmN). The MAT was required to catalyze the transacylation between malonyl-CoA and TcmM, although a relatively slow spontaneous transacylation also occurred in a reaction without the MAT. Acetyl-CoA, the proposed starter unit for the TCM PKS, was not required for the production of TCM F2 in vitro, although it could be incorporated into this polyketide to a small extent. TcmJ, a PKS protein without a known function, greatly increased the production of TCM F2 but could not replace TcmN as a cyclase in the reconstituted system.	1
Title: Biochemical Characterization of the Lysine Acetylation of Tyrosyl-tRNA Synthetase in Escherichia coli Abstract: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play essential roles in protein synthesis. As a member of the aaRS family, the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) in Escherichia coli has been shown in proteomic studies to be acetylated at multiple lysine residues. However, these putative acetylation targets have not yet been biochemically characterized. In this study, we applied a genetic-code-expansion strategy to site-specifically incorporate Nϵ -acetyl-l-lysine into selected positions of TyrRS for in vitro characterization. Enzyme assays demonstrated that acetylation at K85, K235, and K238 could impair the enzyme activity. In vitro deacetylation experiments showed that most acetylated lysine residues in TyrRS were sensitive to the E. coli deacetylase CobB but not YcgC. In vitro acetylation assays indicated that 25 members of the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase family in E. coli, including YfiQ, could not acetylate TyrRS efficiently, whereas TyrRS could be acetylated chemically by acetyl-CoA or acetyl-phosphate (AcP) only. Our in vitro characterization experiments indicated that lysine acetylation could be a possible mechanism for modulating aaRS enzyme activities, thus affecting translation.	0
Title: Allosteric activation of acid alpha-glucosidase by the human papillomavirus E7 protein Abstract: Changes in the cellular carbohydrate metabolism are a hallmark of malignant transformation and represent one of the earliest discernible events in tumorigenesis. In the early stages of certain epithelial cancers, a metabolic switch is regularly observed, in which slowly growing glycogenotic cells are converted to highly proliferating basophilic cells. This step is accompanied by a rapid depletion of the intracellular glycogen stores, which in liver carcinogenesis results from the activation of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase by an as yet unknown mechanism. We show here that acid alpha-glucosidase is a target for the E7 protein encoded by human papillomavirus type 16, a human tumor virus that plays a key role in the genesis of cervical carcinoma. We show that expression of E7 induces the catalytic activity of acid alpha-glucosidase in vivo and wild type E7, but not transformation-deficient mutants bind directly to acid alpha-glucosidase and increase the catalytic activity of the enzyme in vitro. The data suggest that the E7 protein encoded by human papillomavirus type 16 can act as an allosteric activator of acid alpha-glucosidase.	0
Title: A Single Stereodynamic Center Modulates the Rate of Self-Assembly in a Biomolecular System Abstract: Chirality is a property of asymmetry important to both physical and abstract systems. Understanding how molecular systems respond to perturbations in their chiral building blocks can provide insight into diverse areas such as biomolecular self-assembly, protein folding, drug design, materials, and catalysis. Despite the fundamental importance of stereochemical preorganization in nature and designed materials, the ramifications of replacing chiral centers with stereodynamic atomic mimics in the context of biomolecular systems is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that replacement of a single amino acid stereocenter with a stereodynamic nitrogen atom has profound consequences on the self-assembly of a biomolecular system. Our results provide insight into how the fundamental biopolymers of life would behave if their chiral centers were not configurationally stable, highlighting the vital importance of stereochemistry as a pre-organizing element in biomolecular folding and assembly events.	0
Title: Identification of the antiphagocytic trypacidin gene cluster in the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus produces numerous different natural products. The genetic basis for the biosynthesis of a number of known metabolites has remained unknown. The gene cluster encoding for the biosynthesis of the conidia-bound metabolite trypacidin is of particular interest because of its antiprotozoal activity and possible role in the infection process. Here, we show that the genes encoding the biosynthesis enzymes of trypacidin reside within an orphan gene cluster in A. fumigatus. Genome mining identified tynC as an uncharacterized polyketide synthase with high similarity to known enzymes, whose products are structurally related to trypacidin including endocrocin and fumicycline. Gene deletion of tynC resulted in the complete absence of trypacidin production, which was fully restored when the mutant strain was complemented with the wild-type gene. When confronted with macrophages, the tynC deletion mutant conidia were more frequently phagocytosed than those of the parental wild-type strain. This was also found for phagocytic amoebae of the species Dictyostelium discoideum, which showed increased phagocytosis of ΔtynC conidia. Both macrophages and amoebae were also sensitive to trypacidin. Therefore, our results suggest that the conidium-bound trypacidin could have a protective function against phagocytes both in the environment and during the infection process.	1
Title: Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin-like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii Abstract: The glidobactin-like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin A and cepafungin I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881-1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.	0
Title: GacS sensor domains pertinent to the regulation of exoproduct formation and to the biocontrol potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 Abstract: In the root-colonizing biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens, cell density-dependent synthesis of extracellular, plant-beneficial secondary metabolites and enzymes is positively regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Mutational analysis of the GacS sensor kinase using improved single-copy vectors showed that inactivation of each of the three conserved phosphate acceptor sites caused an exoproduct null phenotype (GacS-), whereas deletion of the periplasmic loop domain had no significant effect on the expression of exoproduct genes. Strain CHA0 is known to synthesize a solvent-extractable extracellular signal that advances and enhances the expression of exoproduct genes during the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase when maximal exoproduct formation occurs. Mutational inactivation of either GacS or its cognate response regulator GacA abolished the strain's response to added signal. Deletion of the linker domain of the GacS sensor kinase caused signal-independent, strongly elevated expression of exoproduct genes at low cell densities. In contrast to the wild-type strain CHA0, the gacS linker mutant and a gacS null mutant were unable to protect tomato plants from crown and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici in a soil-less microcosm, indicating that, at least in this plant-pathogen system, there is no advantage in using a signal-independent biocontrol strain.	0
Title: Nickel-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions of unactivated tertiary alkyl halides: Suzuki arylations Abstract: The first Suzuki cross-couplings of unactivated tertiary alkyl electrophiles are described. The method employs a readily accessible catalyst (NiBr(2)·diglyme/4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, both commercially available) and represents the initial example of the use of a group 10 catalyst to cross-couple unactivated tertiary electrophiles to form C-C bonds. This approach to the synthesis of all-carbon quaternary carbon centers does not suffer from isomerization of the alkyl group, in contrast with the umpolung strategy for this bond construction (cross-coupling of a tertiary alkylmetal with an aryl electrophile). Preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of a radical intermediate along the reaction pathway.	0
Title: Simple and efficient recycling of fungal selectable marker genes with the Cre-loxP recombination system via anastomosis Abstract: Reverse-genetics analysis has played a significant role in advancing fungal biology, but is limited by the number of available selectable marker genes (SMGs). The Cre-loxP recombination system has been adapted for use in filamentous fungi to overcome this limitation. Expression of the Cre recombinase results in excision of an integrated SMG that is flanked by loxP sites, allowing a subsequent round of transformation with the same SMG. However, current protocols for regulated expression or presentation of Cre require multiple time-consuming steps. During efforts to disrupt four different RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes in a single strain of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, we tested whether Cre could successfully excise loxP-flanked SMGs when provided in trans via anastomosis. Stable Cre-producing donor strains were constructed by transformation of wild-type C. parasitica strain EP155 with the Cre-coding domain under the control of a constitutive promoter. Excision of multiple loxP-flanked SMGs was efficiently achieved by simply pairing the Cre-donor strain and the loxP-flanked SMGs-transformed recipient strain and recovering mycelia from the margin of the recipient colony near the anastomosis zone. This method was shown to be as efficient as and much less time consuming than excision by transformation-mediated expression of Cre. It also allows unlimited recycling of loxP-flanked SMGs and the generation of disruption mutant strains that are free of any foreign gene. The successful application of this method to Metarhizium robertsii suggests potential use for optimizing reverse-genetics analysis in a broad range of filamentous fungi.	0
Title: Near-Infrared Photoactivatable Nitric Oxide Donors with Integrated Photoacoustic Monitoring Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) tomography is a noninvasive technology that utilizes near-infrared (NIR) excitation and ultrasonic detection to image biological tissue at centimeter depths. While several activatable small-molecule PA sensors have been developed for various analytes, the use of PA molecules for deep-tissue analyte delivery and monitoring remains an underexplored area of research. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo validation of photoNOD-1 and photoNOD-2, the first organic, NIR-photocontrolled nitric oxide (NO) donors that incorporate a PA readout of analyte release. These molecules consist of an aza-BODIPY dye appended with an aryl N-nitrosamine NO-donating moiety. The photoNODs exhibit chemostability to various biological stimuli, including redox-active metals and CYP450 enzymes, and demonstrate negligible cytotoxicity in the absence of irradiation. Upon single-photon NIR irradiation, photoNOD-1 and photoNOD-2 release NO as well as rNOD-1 or rNOD-2, PA-active products that enable ratiometric monitoring of NO release. Our in vitro studies show that, upon irradiation, photoNOD-1 and photoNOD-2 exhibit 46.6-fold and 21.5-fold ratiometric turn-ons, respectively. Moreover, unlike existing NIR NO donors, the photoNODs do not require encapsulation or multiphoton activation for use in live animals. In this study, we use PA tomography to monitor the local, irradiation-dependent release of NO from photoNOD-1 and photoNOD-2 in mice after subcutaneous treatment. In addition, we use a murine model for breast cancer to show that photoNOD-1 can selectively affect tumor growth rates in the presence of NIR light stimulation following systemic administration.	0
Title: Involvement of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain in allosteric regulation of membrane association of proline utilization A Abstract: Proline utilization A (PutA) from Escherichia coli is a membrane-associated trifunctional flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate and moonlights as a transcriptional regulator. As a regulatory protein, PutA represses transcription of the put regulon, which contains the genes encoding PutA and the proline transporter PutP. The binding of proline to the proline dehydrogenase active site and the subsequent reduction of the flavin induce high affinity membrane association of PutA and relieve repression of the put regulon, thereby causing PutA to switch from its regulatory to its enzymatic role. Here, we present evidence suggesting that residues of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain (βα)8 barrel are involved in proline-mediated allosteric regulation of PutA-membrane binding. Mutation of the conserved residues Asp370 and Glu372 in the β3-α3 loop abrogates the ability of proline to induce functional membrane association. Both in vitro lipid/membrane binding assays and in vivo cell-based assays demonstrate that mutagenesis of Asp370 (D370N/A) or Glu372 (E372A) dramatically impedes PutA functional switching. The crystal structures of the proline dehydrogenase domain mutants PutA86-630D370N and PutA86-630D370A complexed with the proline analogue l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid show that the mutations cause only minor perturbations to the active site but no major structural changes, suggesting that the lack of proline response is not due to a failure of the mutated active sites to correctly bind the substrate. Rather, these results suggest that the β3-α3 loop may be involved in transmitting the status of the proline dehydrogenase active site and flavin redox state to the distal membrane association domain.	0
Title: Changes in human fecal microbiota due to chemotherapy analyzed by TaqMan-PCR, 454 sequencing and PCR-DGGE fingerprinting Abstract: Background:                       We investigated whether chemotherapy with the presence or absence of antibiotics against different kinds of cancer changed the gastrointestinal microbiota.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       Feces of 17 ambulant patients receiving chemotherapy with or without concomitant antibiotics were analyzed before and after the chemotherapy cycle at four time points in comparison to 17 gender-, age- and lifestyle-matched healthy controls. We targeted 16S rRNA genes of all bacteria, Bacteroides, bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa as well as C. difficile with TaqMan qPCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing. After a significant drop in the abundance of microbiota (p = 0.037) following a single treatment the microbiota recovered within a few days. The chemotherapeutical treatment marginally affected the Bacteroides while the Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. DGGE fingerprinting showed decreased diversity of Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa in response to chemotherapy with cluster IV diversity being particularly affected by antibiotics. The occurrence of C. difficile in three out of seventeen subjects was accompanied by a decrease in the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Veillonella and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Enterococcus faecium increased following chemotherapy.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Despite high individual variations, these results suggest that the observed changes in the human gut microbiota may favor colonization with C. difficile and Enterococcus faecium. Perturbed microbiota may be a target for specific mitigation with safe pre- and probiotics.	0
Title: Identification of a conserved switch residue responsible for selective constitutive activation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor Abstract: A cysteine-to-phenylalanine mutation of residue 116 in the third transmembrane domain of the beta2-adrenergic receptor caused selective constitutive activation of Na+/H+ exchange through a pathway not involving cAMP. This selectivity was identified by comparing binding and signaling characteristics of wild-type (WT) versus C116F mutant receptors transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Indicating constitutive activity, ligand binding to the C116F mutant showed a 78-fold higher than WT affinity for isoproterenol and a 40-fold lower than WT affinity for ICI 118551. Although agonist-independent activation of cAMP production was not exhibited by the C116F mutant, a constitutive stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) was observed. This was identified by measuring either basal intracellular pH (pHi) or rate of pHi recovery from cellular acid load. Due to a higher rate of H+ efflux through NHE1, C116F transfectants exhibited a significantly higher pHi (7.42) than did WT transfectants (7.1). Furthermore, the rate of pHi recovery from acid load facilitated by NHE1 was 2.1-fold faster in mutant transfectants than in WT transfectants. The lower rate seen in the WT case was stimulated by epinephrine, and the higher rate seen in the mutant case was inhibited by ICI 118551. These findings, which show that a C116F mutation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor evokes selective constitutive coupling to NHE1 over cAMP, form the basis of our prediction that multiple and distinct activation states can exist in G protein-coupled receptors.	0
Title: Structure, organization and characterization of the gene cluster involved in the production of microcin E492, a channel-forming bacteriocin Abstract: Microcin E492 is a low-molecular-weight, channel-forming bacteriocin produced and excreted by Klebsiella pneumoniae RYC492. A 13 kb chromosomal DNA fragment from K. pneumoniae RYC492 was sequenced, and it was demonstrated by random Tn5 mutagenesis that most of this segment, which has at least 10 cistrons, is needed for the production of active microcin and its immunity protein. Genes mceG and mceH correspond to an ABC exporter and its accessory protein, respectively, and they are closely related to the colicin V ABC export system. The microcin E492 system also requires the product of gene mceF as an additional factor for export. Despite the fact that this bacteriocin lacks post-translational modifications, genes mceC, mceI and mceJ are needed for the production of active microcin. Genes mceC and mceI are homologous to a glycosyl transferase and acyltransferase, respectively, whereas mceJ has no known homologue. Mutants in these three genes secrete an inactive form of microcin, able to form ion channels in a phospholipidic bilayer, indicating that the mutation of these microcin genes does not alter the process of membrane insertion. On the other hand, microcin isolated from mutants in genes mceC and mceJ has a lethal effect when incubated with spheroplasts of sensitive cells, indicating that the microcin defects in these mutants are likely to alter receptor recognition at the outer membrane. A model for synthesis and export is proposed as well as a novel maturation pathway that would involve conformational changes to explain the production of active microcin E492.	1
Title: Isotopically Labeled Clickable Glutathione to Quantify Protein S-Glutathionylation Abstract: Protein S-glutathionylation is one of the important cysteine oxidation events that regulate various redox-mediated biological processes. Despite several existing methods, there are few proteomic approaches to identify and quantify specific cysteine residues susceptible to S-glutathionylation. We previously developed a clickable glutathione approach that labels intracellular glutathione with azido-Ala by using a mutant form of glutathione synthetase. In this study, we developed a quantification strategy with clickable glutathione by using isotopically labeled heavy and light derivatives of azido-Ala, which provides the relative quantification of glutathionylated peptides in mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. We applied isotopically labeled clickable glutathione to HL-1 cardiomyocytes, quantifying relative levels of 1398 glutathionylated peptides upon addition of hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, we highlight elevated levels of glutathionylation on sarcomere-associated muscle proteins while validating glutathionylation of two structural proteins, α-actinin and desmin. Our report provides a chemical proteomic strategy to quantify specific glutathionylated cysteines.	0
Title: The mycelium-associated Streptomyces reticuli catalase-peroxidase, its gene and regulation by FurS Abstract: During early stages of growth, Streptomyces reticuli synthesizes a hyphae-associated, haem-containing enzyme which exhibits catalase and peroxidase activities with broad substrate specificity (CpeB). The purified dimeric enzyme (160 kDa) consists of two identical subunits. Using anti-CpeB antibodies and an expression- as well as a mini-library, the corresponding cpeB gene was identified and sequenced. It encodes a protein of 740 aa with a molecular mass of 81.3 kDa. The deduced protein shares the highest level of amino acid identity with KatG from Caulobacter crescentus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and PerA from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Streptomyces lividans transformants carrying cpeB and the upstream-located furS gene with its regulatory region on the bifunctional vector pWHM3 produced low or enhanced levels of CpeB in the presence or absence of Fe ions, respectively. An in-frame deletion of the major part of furS induces increased CpeB synthesis. The data imply that FurS regulates the transcription of cpeB. The deduced FurS protein is rich in histidine residues, contains a putative N-terminally situated helix-turn-helix motif and has a molecular mass of 15.1 kDa. It shares only 29% amino acid identity with the Escherichia coli ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein, but about 64% with FurA deduced from the genomic sequences of several mycobacteria. The predicted secondary structures of FurS and FurA are highly similar and considerably divergent from those of the E. coli Fur. In contrast to some Gram-negative bacteria, within several mycobacteria an intact furA gene or a furA pseudogene is upstream of a catalase-peroxidase (katG) gene predicted to encode a functional or a non-functional (Mycobacterium leprae) enzyme. Thus the data obtained for Streptomyces reticuli are expected to serve as an additional model to elucidate the regulation of mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase genes.	0
Title: Identification of the Antifungal Metabolite Chaetoglobosin P From Discosia rubi Using a Cryptococcus neoformans Inhibition Assay: Insights Into Mode of Action and Biosynthesis Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogen with limited options for treatments. We have interrogated extracts from fungal fermentations to find Cryptococcus-inhibiting natural products using assays for growth inhibition, differential thermosensitivity, and synergy with existing antifungal drugs. Extracts from fermentations of strains of Discosia rubi from eastern Texas showed anticryptococcal bioactivity with preferential activity in agar zone of inhibition assays against C. neoformans at 37°C versus 25°C. Assay-guided fractionation led to the purification and identification of chaetoglobosin P as the active component of these extracts. Genome sequencing of these strains revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with chaetoglobosin biosynthesis and β-methylation of the tryptophan residue. Proximity of genes of the actin-binding protein twinfilin-1 to the chaetoglobosin P and K gene clusters suggested a possible self-resistance mechanism involving twinfilin-1 which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action involving interference with the polymerization of the capping process of filamentous actin. A C. neoformans mutant lacking twinfilin-1 was hypersensitive to chaetoglobosin P. Chaetoglobosins also potentiated the effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on C. neoformans.	1
Title: Structural analysis of the contacts anchoring moenomycin to peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases and implications for antibiotic design Abstract: Peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs), enzymes that catalyze the formation of the glycan chains of the bacterial cell wall, have tremendous potential as antibiotic targets. The moenomycins, a potent family of natural product antibiotics, are the only known active site inhibitors of the PGTs and serve as blueprints for the structure-based design of new antibacterials. A 2.8 A structure of a Staphylococcus aureus PGT with moenomycin A bound in the active site appeared recently, potentially providing insight into substrate binding; however, the protein-ligand contacts were not analyzed in detail and the implications of the structure for inhibitor design were not addressed. We report here the 2.3 A structure of a complex of neryl-moenomycin A bound to the PGT domain of Aquifex aeolicus PBP1A. The structure allows us to examine protein-ligand contacts in detail and implies that six conserved active site residues contact the centrally located F-ring phosphoglycerate portion of neryl-moenomycin A. A mutational analysis shows that all six residues play important roles in enzymatic activity. We suggest that small scaffolds that maintain these key contacts will serve as effective PGT inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we have prepared, via heterologous expression of a subset of moenomycin biosynthetic genes, a novel moenomycin intermediate that maintains these six contacts but does not contain the putative minimal pharmacophore. This compound has comparable biological activity to the previously proposed minimal pharmacophore. The results reported here may facilitate the design of antibiotics targeted against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases.	0
Title: Lacticin 481 synthetase as a general serine/threonine kinase Abstract: Methods that introduce posttranslational modifications in a general, mild, and non-sequence-specific manner using biologically produced peptides have great utility for investigation of the functions of these modifications. In this study, the substrate promiscuity of a lantibiotic synthetase was exploited for the preparation of phosphopeptides, glycopeptides, and peptides containing analogs of methylated or acetylated lysine residues. Peptides attached to the C-terminus of the leader peptide of the lacticin 481 precursor peptide were phosphorylated on serine residues in a wide variety of sequence contexts by the R399M and T405A mutants of lacticin 481 synthetase (LctM). Serine residues located as many as 30 amino acids C-terminal to the leader peptide were phosphorylated. Wild-type LctM was shown to dehydrate these peptides to generate dehydroalanine-containing products that can be conveniently modified with external nucleophiles including thiosaccharides, 2-(dimethylamino)ethanethiol, and N-acetyl cysteamine, resulting in mimics of O-linked glycopeptides and acetylated and methylated lysines.	0
Title: Identification of the polyketide synthase PKS7 responsible for the production of lecanoric acid and ethyl lecanorate in Claviceps purpurea Abstract: Claviceps purpurea is a plant pathogenic fungus which is still highly relevant in modern agriculture as it infects grasses such as rye and wheat. The disease caused by the consumption of contaminated grain or flour has been known since the Middle Ages and is termed ergotism. The main cause for the toxicity of this fungus is attributed to the ergot alkaloids. Apart from these alkaloids and the ergochromes known as ergot pigments, the secondary metabolism of C. purpurea is not well investigated. This study demonstrated the function of the polyketide synthase PKS7 in C. purpurea by determining the effect of its overexpression on metabolite profiles. For the first time, the depsides lecanoric acid, ethyl lecanorate, gerfelin, and C10-deoxy gerfelin were discovered as secondary metabolites of C. purpurea. Additionally, to estimate the contribution of isolated secondary metabolites to the toxic effects of C. purpurea, lecanoric acid, ethyl lecanorate, and orsellinic acid were tested on HepG2 and CCF-STTG1 cell lines. This study provides the first report on the function of C. purpurea PKS7 responsible for the production of depsides, among which lecanoric acid and ethyl lecanorate were identified as main secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Early cephamycin biosynthetic genes are expressed from a polycistronic transcript in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A polycistronic transcript that is initiated at the lat promoter has been implicated in the expression of the genes involved in early steps of cephamycin C biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus. pcbC is also expressed as a monocistronic transcript from its own promoter. However, an alternative interpretation involving expression via three separate yet interdependent transcripts has also been proposed. To distinguish between these possibilities, mutants lacking the lat promoter and containing a transcription terminator within the lat gene (Deltalat::tsr/term mutants) were created. This mutation eliminated the production of lysine-epsilon-aminotransferase (the lat gene product) but also affected the expression of downstream genes, indicating an operon arrangement. Production of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS) (the pcbAB gene product) was eliminated in Deltalat::tsr/term mutants, while production of isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) (the pcbC gene product) was greatly reduced. The provision of alpha-aminoadipate to the Deltalat::tsr/term mutants, either via exogenous feeding or via lat gene complementation, did not restore production of ACVS or IPNS. Analysis of RNA isolated from the Deltalat::tsr/term mutants confirmed that the polycistronic transcript was absent but also indicated that monocistronic pcbC transcript levels were greatly decreased. In contrast, Deltalat mutants created by in-frame internal deletion of lat maintained the polycistronic transcript and allowed production of wild-type levels of both ACVS and IPNS.	1
Title: Cytotoxic polyisoprenyl benzophenonoids from Garcinia subelliptica Abstract: Six new polyisoprenyl benzophenonoids, (+/-)-garcinialiptone A (1, 2), garcinialiptone B (3), (-)-cycloxanthochymol (4), garcinialiptone C (5), and garcinialiptone D (6), along with three known compounds, xanthochymol (7), isoxanthochymol (8), and cycloxanthochymol (9), were isolated from the fruits of Garcinia subelliptica. The structures of 1-6 were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. Biological evaluation showed that all compounds 1-9 exhibited cytotoxic activity against a small panel of human tumor cell lines (A549, DU145, KB, vincristine-resistant KB).	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the β-Lactone Proteasome Inhibitors Belactosin and Cystargolide Abstract: Belactosins and cystargolides are natural product proteasome inhibitors from Actinobacteria. Both feature dipeptidic backbones and a unique β-lactone building block. Herein, we present a detailed investigation of their biosynthesis. Identification and analysis of the corresponding gene clusters indicated that both compounds are assembled by rare single-enzyme amino acid ligases. Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors and in vitro biochemistry showed that the formation of the β-lactone warhead is unprecedented and reminiscent of leucine biosynthesis, and that it involves the action of isopropylmalate synthase homologues.	1
Title: The gastric caeca of pentatomids as a house for actinomycetes Abstract: Background:                       Microbes are extensively associated with insects, playing key roles in insect defense, nutrition and reproduction. Most of the associations reported involve Proteobacteria. Despite the fact that Actinobacteria associated with insects were shown to produce antibiotic barriers against pathogens to the hosts or to their food and nutrients, there are few studies focusing on their association with insects. Thus, we surveyed the Actinobacteria diversity on a specific region of the midgut of seven species of stinkbugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) known to carry a diversity of symbiotically-associated Proteobacteria.                  Results:                       A total of 34 phylotypes were placed in 11 different Actinobacteria families. Dichelops melacanthus held the highest diversity with six actinobacteria families represented by nine phylotypes. Thyanta perditor (n = 7), Edessa meditabunda (n = 5), Loxa deducta (n = 4) and Pellaea stictica (n = 3) were all associated with three families. Piezodorus guildini (n = 3) and Nezara viridula (n = 3) had the lowest diversity, being associated with two (Propionibacteriaceae and Mycobacteriaceae) and one (Streptomyceataceae) families, respectively. Corynebacteriaceae and Mycobacteriaceae were the most common families with phylotypes from three different insect species each one.                  Conclusions:                       Many phylotypes shared a low 16S rRNA gene similarity with their closest type strains and formed new phyletic lines on the periphery of several genera. This is a strong indicative that stinkbug caeca can harbor new species of actinobacteria, which might be derived from specific associations with the species of stinkbugs studied. Although the well-known role of actinobacteria as a source of biomolecules, the ecological features of these symbionts on the stinkbugs biology remain unknown.	0
Title: Molecular resolution imaging by post-labeling expansion single-molecule localization microscopy (Ex-SMLM) Abstract: Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables super-resolution fluorescence imaging of physically expanded biological samples with conventional microscopes. By combining ExM with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) it is potentially possible to approach the resolution of electron microscopy. However, current attempts to combine both methods remained challenging because of protein and fluorophore loss during digestion or denaturation, gelation, and the incompatibility of expanded polyelectrolyte hydrogels with photoswitching buffers. Here we show that re-embedding of expanded hydrogels enables dSTORM imaging of expanded samples and demonstrate that post-labeling ExM resolves the current limitations of super-resolution microscopy. Using microtubules as a reference structure and centrioles, we demonstrate that post-labeling Ex-SMLM preserves ultrastructural details, improves the labeling efficiency and reduces the positional error arising from linking fluorophores into the gel thus paving the way for super-resolution imaging of immunolabeled endogenous proteins with true molecular resolution.	0
Title: Enantioselective reduction of sulfur-containing cyclic imines through biocatalysis Abstract: The 3-thiazolidine ring represents an important structural motif in life sciences molecules. However, up to now reduction of 3-thiazolines as an attractive approach failed by means of nearly all chemical reduction technologies for imines. Thus, the development of an efficient general and enantioselective synthetic technology giving access to a range of such heterocycles remained a challenge. Here we present a method enabling the reduction of 3-thiazolines with high conversion and high to excellent enantioselectivity (at least 96% and up to 99% enantiomeric excess). This technology is based on the use of imine reductases as catalysts, has a broad substrate range, and is also applied successfully to other sulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Moreover the effiency of this biocatalytic technology platform is demonstrated in an initial process development leading to 99% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess at a substrate loading of 18 g/L in the presence of designer cells.	0
Title: p63(+)Krt5(+) distal airway stem cells are essential for lung regeneration Abstract: Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis involve the progressive and inexorable destruction of oxygen exchange surfaces and airways, and have emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide. Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden, massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome often recover full pulmonary function within six months. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process. Here we show that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.	0
Title: Taming a wild beast: Developing molecular tools and new methods to understand the biology of Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: Septoria blotch of wheat is one of the world's most serious plant diseases, which is difficult to control due to the absence of durable host resistance and the increasing frequency of fungicide-resistance. The ascomycete fungus that causes the disease, Zymoseptoria tritici, has been very challenging to study. This special issue of Fungal Genetics and Biology showcases an integrated approach to method development and the innovation of new molecular tools to study the biology of Z. tritici. When considered together, these new methods will have a rapid and dramatic effect on our ability to combat this significant disease.	0
Title: Wolff Rearrangement of Oxidatively Generated α-Oxo Gold Carbenes: An Effective Approach to Silylketenes Abstract: Gold-catalyzed oxidations of alkynes by N-oxides offer direct access to reactive α-oxo gold carbene intermediates from benign and readily available alkynes instead of hazardous diazo carbonyl compounds. Despite various versatile synthetic methods developed based on this strategy, one of the hallmarks of α-oxo carbene/carbenoid chemistry, that is, the Wolff rearrangement, has not been realized in this context. This study discloses the first examples that show the Wolff rearrangement can be readily realized by α-oxo gold carbenes oxidatively generated from TBS-terminated alkynes (TBS=tert-butyldimethylsilyl). The thus-generated silylketenes can be either isolated pure or subsequently trapped by various internal or external nucleophiles in one pot to afford α-silylated carboxylic acids, their derivatives, or TBS-substituted allenes.	0
Title: Sequencing and analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of a vancomycin group antibiotic Abstract: Background:                       The emergence of resistance to vancomycin, the drug of choice against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in enterococci has increased the need for new antibiotics. As chemical modification of the antibiotic structure is not trivial, we have initiated studies towards enzymatic modification by sequencing the DNA coding for the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin (also known as A82846B and LY264826).                  Results:                       Analysis of 72 kilobases of genomic DNA from Amycolatopsis orientalis, the organism that produces chloroeremomycin, revealed the presence of 39 putative genes, including those coding for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. Translation and subsequent comparison with known proteins in public databases identified enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the heptapeptide backbone and 4-epi-vancosamine, as well as those for chlorination and oxidation reactions involved in the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin.                  Conclusions:                       The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin have been identified, and selective expression of these genes could lead to the synthesis of new potent glycopeptide antibiotics.	1
Title: Calyculin biogenesis from a pyrophosphate protoxin produced by a sponge symbiont Abstract: The Japanese marine sponge Discodermia calyx contains a major cytotoxic compound, calyculin A, which exhibits selective inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. It has long been used as a chemical tool to evaluate intracellular signal transduction regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation. We describe the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of calyculin A by a metagenome mining approach. Single-cell analysis revealed that the gene cluster originates in the symbiont bacterium 'Candidatus Entotheonella' sp. A phosphotransferase encoded in the gene cluster deactivated calyculin A to produce a newly discovered diphosphate, which was actually the biosynthetic end product. The diphosphate had been previously overlooked because of the enzymatic dephosphorylation that occurred in response to sponge tissue disruption. Our work presents what is to our knowledge the first evidence for the biosynthetic process of calyculin A along with a notable phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism to regulate toxicity, suggesting activated chemical defense in the most primitive of all multicellular animals.	1
Title: Engineering of Bacillus subtilis for enhanced total synthesis of folic acid Abstract: We investigated whether the yield of the B vitamin folic acid could be elevated in Bacillus subtilis. Strategies for increasing the folic acid yield were investigated by employing computer-aided flux analysis and mutation. Controlling the activity of the enzyme pyruvate kinase by placing it under inducible control was one strategy devised to elevate yield while insuring that a rapid growth rate results. Other single mutation strategies included amplifying the expression of the genes in the folate operon and overexpressing the Escherichia coli aroH gene, which encodes 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphoheptonate aldolase. The latter could conceivably elevate the abundance of the folic acid precursor, para-aminobenzoic acid. Strains that combined two or more mutations were also constructed. Overall, a strain possessing inducible pyruvate kinase, overexpressed aroH, and increased transcription and translation of genes from the folic operon exhibited the best yield. The yield was eightfold higher than that displayed by the parent B. subtilis 168 strain.	0
Title: The gentle touch receptors of mammalian skin Abstract: The skin is our largest sensory organ, transmitting pain, temperature, itch, and touch information to the central nervous system. Touch sensations are conveyed by distinct combinations of mechanosensory end organs and the low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) that innervate them. Here we explore the various structures underlying the diverse functions of cutaneous LTMR end organs. Beyond anchoring of LTMRs to the surrounding dermis and epidermis, recent evidence suggests that the non-neuronal components of end organs play an active role in signaling to LTMRs and may physically gate force-sensitive channels in these receptors. Combined with LTMR intrinsic properties, the balance of these factors comprises the response properties of mechanosensory neurons and, thus, the neural encoding of touch.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Apoptolidins in Nocardiopsis sp. FU 40 Abstract: The apoptolidins are 20/21-membered macrolides produced by Nocardiopsis sp. FU40. Several members of this family are potent and remarkably selective inducers of apoptosis in cancer cell lines, likely via a distinct mitochondria associated target. To investigate the biosynthesis of this natural product, the complete genome of the apoptolidin producer Nocardiopsis sp. FU40 was sequenced and a 116 Kb region was identified containing a putative apoptolidin biosynthetic gene cluster. The apoptolidin gene cluster comprises a type I polyketide synthase, with 13 homologating modules, apparently initiated in an unprecedented fashion via transfer from a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein loading module. Spanning approximately 39 open reading frames, the gene cluster was cloned into a series of overlapping cosmids and functionally validated by targeted gene disruption experiments in the producing organism. Disruption of putative PKS and P(450) genes delineated the roles of these genes in apoptolidin biosynthesis and chemical complementation studies demonstrated intact biosynthesis peripheral to the disrupted genes. This work provides insight into details of the biosynthesis of this biologically significant natural product and provides a basis for future mutasynthetic methods for the generation of non-natural apopotolidins.	1
Title: Mapping the active site in a chemzyme: diversity in the N-substituent in the catalytic asymmetric aziridination of imines Abstract: The active site of the aziridination catalyst derived from either the VANOL or VAPOL ligand and B(OPh)(3) is larger than expected and can accommodate not only significant substitution on the diarylmethyl unit of the imine but also that alkyl (but not perfluorylalkyl) substituents on the aryl groups lead to enhanced rates and enantioselection. The screen of diarylmethyl N-substituents on the imine revealed that the 3,5-di-tert-butyldianisylmethyl group (BUDAM) gave exceptionally high asymmetric inductions for imines of aryl aldehydes.	0
Title: NMR-based conformational ensembles explain pH-gated opening and closing of OmpG channel Abstract: The outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a monomeric 33 kDa 14-stranded β-barrel membrane protein functioning as a nonspecific porin for the uptake of oligosaccharides in Escherichia coli. Two different crystal structures of OmpG obtained at different values of pH suggest a pH-gated pore opening mechanism. In these structures, extracellular loop 6 extends away from the barrel wall at neutral pH but is folded back into the pore lumen at low pH, blocking transport through the pore. Loop 6 was invisible in a previously published solution NMR structure of OmpG in n-dodecylphosphocholine micelles, presumably due to conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time scale. Here we present an NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)-based approach to visualize the conformational dynamics of loop 6 and to calculate conformational ensembles that explain the pH-gated opening and closing of the OmpG channel. The different loop conformers detected by the PRE ensemble calculations were validated by disulfide cross-linking of strategically engineered cysteines and electrophysiological single channel recordings. The results indicate a more dynamically regulated channel opening and closing than previously thought and reveal additional membrane-associated conformational ensembles at pH 6.3 and 7.0. We anticipate this approach to be generally applicable to detect and characterize functionally important conformational ensembles of membrane proteins.	0
Title: Light-Dependent Cytoplasmic Recruitment Enhances the Dynamic Range of a Nuclear Import Photoswitch Abstract: Cellular signal transduction is often regulated at multiple steps to achieve more complex logic or precise control of a pathway. For instance, some signaling mechanisms couple allosteric activation with localization to achieve high signal to noise. Here, we create a system for light-activated nuclear import that incorporates two levels of control. It consists of a nuclear import photoswitch, light-activated nuclear shuttle (LANS), and a protein engineered to preferentially interact with LANS in the dark, Zdk2. First, Zdk2 is tethered to a location in the cytoplasm that sequesters LANS in the dark. Second, LANS incorporates a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is sterically blocked from binding to the nuclear import machinery in the dark. If activated with light, LANS both dissociates from its tethered location and exposes its NLS, which leads to nuclear accumulation. We demonstrate that this coupled system improves the dynamic range of LANS in mammalian cells, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans and provides tighter control of transcription factors that have been fused to LANS.	0
Title: Enzyme-catalyzed cationic epoxide rearrangements in quinolone alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: Epoxides are highly useful synthons and biosynthons for the construction of complex natural products during total synthesis and biosynthesis, respectively. Among enzyme-catalyzed epoxide transformations, a reaction that is notably missing, in regard to the synthetic toolbox, is cationic rearrangement that takes place under strong acid. This is a challenging transformation for enzyme catalysis, as stabilization of the carbocation intermediate upon epoxide cleavage is required. Here, we discovered two Brønsted acid enzymes that can catalyze two unprecedented epoxide transformations in biology. PenF from the penigequinolone pathway catalyzes a cationic epoxide rearrangement under physiological conditions to generate a quaternary carbon center, while AsqO from the aspoquinolone pathway catalyzes a 3-exo-tet cyclization to forge a cyclopropane-tetrahydrofuran ring system. The discovery of these new epoxide-modifying enzymes further highlights the versatility of epoxides in complexity generation during natural product biosynthesis.	0
Title: An unusual Burkholderia gladioli double chain-initiating nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembles 'fungal' icosalide antibiotics Abstract: Burkholderia is a multi-talented genus of Gram-negative bacteria, which in recent years has become increasingly recognised as a promising source of bioactive natural products. Metabolite profiling of Burkholderia gladioli BCC0238 showed that it produces the asymmetric lipopeptidiolide antibiotic icosalide A1, originally isolated from a fungus. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of several genome-sequenced B. gladioli isolates identified a gene encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) with an unusual architecture that was predicted to be responsible for icosalide biosynthesis. Inactivation of this gene in B. gladioli BCC0238 abolished icosalide production. PCR analysis and sequencing of total DNA from the original fungal icosalide A1 producer revealed it has a B. gladioli strain associated with it that harbours an NRPS with an identical architecture to that responsible for icosalide A1 assembly in B. gladioli BCC0238. Sequence analysis of the icosalide NRPS indicated that it contains two chain-initiating condensation (CI) domains. One of these is appended to the N-terminus of module 1 - a common architecture for NRPSs involved in lipopeptide assembly. The other is embedded in module 3, immediately downstream of a putative chain-elongating condensation domain. Analysis of the reactions catalysed by a tridomain construct from module 3 of the NRPS using intact protein mass spectrometry showed that the embedded CI domain initiates assembly of a second lipopeptide chain, providing key insights into the mechanism for asymmetric diolide assembly.	1
Title: Genome-Guided Discovery of Highly Oxygenated Aromatic Polyketides, Saccharothrixins D-M, from the Rare Marine Actinomycete Saccharothrix sp. D09 Abstract: Angucyclines and angucyclinones are aromatic polyketides with intriguing structures and therapeutic value. Genome mining of the rare marine actinomycete Saccharothrix sp. D09 led to the identification of a type II polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster, sxn, which encodes several distinct subclasses of oxidoreductases, implying that this strain has the potential to produce novel polycyclic aromatic polyketides with unusual redox modifications. The "one strain-many compounds" (OSMAC) strategy and comparative metabolite analysis facilitated the discovery of 20 angucycline derivatives from the D09 strain, including six new highly oxygenated saccharothrixins D-I (1-6), four new glycosylated saccharothrixins J-M (7-10), and 10 known analogues (11-20). Their structures were elucidated based on detailed HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we proposed their plausible biosynthetic pathways. In addition, compounds 3, 4, and 8 showed antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori with MIC values ranging from 16 to 32 μg/mL. Compound 3 also revealed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the production of NO with an IC50 value of 28 μM.	1
Title: A general method for artificial metalloenzyme formation through strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition Abstract: Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) can be used to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) from scaffold proteins containing a p-azido-L-phenylalanine (Az) residue and catalytically active bicyclononyne-substituted metal complexes. The high efficiency of this reaction allows rapid ArM formation when using Az residues within the scaffold protein in the presence of cysteine residues or various reactive components of cellular lysate. In general, cofactor-based ArM formation allows the use of any desired metal complex to build unique inorganic protein materials. SPAAC covalent linkage further decouples the native function of the scaffold from the installation process because it is not affected by native amino acid residues; as long as an Az residue can be incorporated, an ArM can be generated. We have demonstrated the scope of this method with respect to both the scaffold and cofactor components and established that the dirhodium ArMs generated can catalyze the decomposition of diazo compounds and both Si-H and olefin insertion reactions involving these carbene precursors.	0
Title: Development and application of a rapid all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system for iterative genome editing in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Background:                       Bacillus subtilis, an important industrial microorganism, is commonly used in the production of industrial enzymes. Genome modification is often necessary to improve the production performance of cell. The dual-plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system suitable for iterative genome editing has been applied in Bacillus subtilis. However, it is limited by the selection of knockout genes, long editing cycle and instability.                  Results:                       To address these problems, we constructed an all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system, which was suitable for iterative genome editing of B. subtilis. The PEG4000-assisted monomer plasmid ligation (PAMPL) method greatly improved the transformation efficiency of B. subtilis SCK6. Self-targeting sgRNArep transcription was tightly controlled by rigorous promoter PacoR, which could induce the elimination of plasmids after genome editing and prepare for next round of genome editing. Our system achieved 100% efficiency for single gene deletions and point mutations, 96% efficiency for gene insertions, and at least 90% efficiency for plasmid curing. As a proof of concept, two extracellular protease genes epr and bpr were continuously knocked out using this system, and it only took 2.5 days to complete one round of genome editing. The engineering strain was used to express Douchi fibrinolytic enzyme DFE27, and its extracellular enzyme activity reached 159.5 FU/mL.                  Conclusions:                       We developed and applied a rapid all-in-one plasmid CRISPR-Cas9 system for iterative genome editing in B. subtilis, which required only one plasmid transformation and curing, and accelerated the cycle of genome editing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rapidest iterative genome editing system for B. subtilis. We hope that the system can be used to reconstruct the B. subtilis cell factory for the production of various biological molecules.	0
Title: VirB1* promotes T-pilus formation in the vir-Type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Abstract: The vir-type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium is assembled from 12 proteins encoded by the virB operon and virD4. VirB1 is one of the least-studied proteins encoded by the virB operon. Its N terminus is a lytic transglycosylase. The C-terminal third of the protein, VirB1*, is cleaved from VirB1 and secreted to the outside of the bacterial cell, suggesting an additional function. We show that both nopaline and octopine strains produce abundant amounts of VirB1* and perform detailed studies on nopaline VirB1*. Both domains are required for wild-type virulence. We show here that the nopaline type VirB1* is essential for the formation of the T pilus, a subassembly of the vir-T4SS composed of processed and cyclized VirB2 (major subunit) and VirB5 (minor subunit). A nopaline virB1 deletion strain does not produce T pili. Complementation with full-length VirB1 or C-terminal VirB1*, but not the N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain, restores T pili containing VirB2 and VirB5. T-pilus preparations also contain extracellular VirB1*. Protein-protein interactions between VirB1* and VirB2 and VirB5 were detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We propose that VirB1 is a bifunctional protein required for virT4SS assembly. The N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain provides localized lysis of the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow insertion of the T4SS. The C-terminal VirB1* promotes T-pilus assembly through protein-protein interactions with T-pilus subunits.	0
Title: Paenilarvins: Iturin family lipopeptides from the honey bee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae Abstract: The bacterium Paenibacillus larvae has been extensively studied as it is an appalling honey bee pathogen. In the present work, we screened crude extracts derived from fermentations of P. larvae genotypes ERIC I and II for antimicrobial activity, following the detection of four putative secondary metabolite gene clusters that show high sequence homology to known biosynthetic gene clusters for the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Low molecular weight metabolites produced by P. larvae have recently been shown to have toxic effects on honey bee larvae. Moreover, a novel tripeptide, sevadicin, was recently characterized from laboratory cultures of P. larvae. In this study, paenilarvins, which are iturinic lipopeptides exhibiting strong antifungal activities, were obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation from cultures of P. larvae, genotype ERIC II. Their molecular structures were determined by extensive 2D NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, and other methods. Paenilarvins are the first antifungal secondary metabolites to be identified from P. larvae. In preliminary experiments, these lipopeptides also affected honey bee larvae and might thus play a role in P. larvae survival and pathogenesis. However, further studies are needed to investigate their function.	1
Title: Biosynthetic Origin of the Antibiotic Pseudopyronines A and B in Pseudomonas putida BW11M1 Abstract: Within the framework of our effort to discover new antibiotics from pseudomonads, pseudopyronines A and B were isolated from the plant-derived Pseudomonas putida BW11M1. Pseudopyronines are 3,6-dialkyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones and displayed high in vitro activities against several human pathogens, and in our hands also towards the plant pathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi. Here, the biosynthesis of pseudopyronine B was studied by a combination of feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors, genomic sequence analysis, and gene deletion experiments. The studies resulted in the deduction of all acetate units and revealed that the biosynthesis of these α-pyrones occurs with a single PpyS-homologous ketosynthase. It fuses, with some substrate flexibility, a 3-oxo-fatty acid and a further unbranched saturated fatty acid, both of medium chain-length and provided by primary metabolism.	1
Title: The penicillin gene cluster is amplified in tandem repeats linked by conserved hexanucleotide sequences Abstract: The penicillin biosynthetic genes (pcbAB, pcbC, penDE) of Penicillium chrysogenum AS-P-78 were located in a 106.5-kb DNA region that is amplified in tandem repeats (five or six copies) linked by conserved TTTACA sequences. The wild-type strains P. chrysogenum NRRL 1951 and Penicillium notatum ATCC 9478 (Fleming's isolate) contain a single copy of the 106.5-kb region. This region was bordered by the same TTTACA hexanucleotide found between tandem repeats in strain AS-P-78. A penicillin overproducer strain, P. chrysogenum E1, contains a large number of copies in tandem of a 57.9-kb DNA fragment, linked by the same hexanucleotide or its reverse complementary TGTAAA sequence. The deletion mutant P. chrysogenum npe10 showed a deletion of 57.9 kb that corresponds exactly to the DNA fragment that is amplified in E1. The conserved hexanucleotide sequence was reconstituted at the deletion site. The amplification has occurred within a single chromosome (chromosome I). The tandem reiteration and deletion appear to arise by mutation-induced site-specific recombination at the conserved hexanucleotide sequences.	1
Title: Secoemestrin D, a cytotoxic epitetrathiodioxopiperizine, and emericellenes A-E, five sesterterpenoids from Emericella sp. AST0036, a fungal endophyte of Astragalus lentiginosus1 Abstract: A new epitetrathiodioxopiperizine, secoemestrin D (1), and five sesterterpenoids bearing a new carbon skeleton, emericellenes A-E (2-6), together with previously known fungal metabolites, sterigmatocystin (7), arugosin C (8), and epiisoshamixanthone (9), were obtained from the endophytic fungal strain Emericella sp. AST0036 isolated from a healthy leaf tissue of Astragalus lentiginosus. The planar structures and relative configurations of the new metabolites 1-6 were elucidated using MS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data. All compounds were evaluated for their potential anticancer activity using a panel of six tumor cell lines and normal human fibroblast cells. Only metabolites 1 and 7 showed cytotoxic activity. More importantly, secoemestrin D (1) exhibited significant cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.24 μM and moderate selectivity to human glioma (SF-268) and metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cell lines.	0
Title: Protein-associated intercalator-induced DNA scission is enhanced by estrogen stimulation in human breast cancer cells Abstract: Estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) displayed a higher frequency of intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA scission after treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) than did cells that had not received estrogen treatment. This effect was dependent on estrogen concentration (maximum enhancement at approximately equal to 1 nM E2) and time (maximum effect seen approximately equal to 24 hr after E2 addition). Human breast cancer cells lacking estrogen receptors did not display the enhanced response. Antiestrogens produced a slight decrease in intercalator-induced DNA scission, whereas insulin produced an enhanced effect. The DNA breaks produced by the intercalators 5-iminodaunorubicin and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) in these cells were undetectable without enzymatic deproteinization of cell lysates prior to quantification by alkaline elution. Intercalator-induced DNA-protein crosslinking also was enhanced in E2-treated MCF-7 cells. Studies with m-[14C]AMSA revealed no estrogen-associated increases in drug uptake. The data suggest that E2 treatment, either by specifically and directly increasing active transcription in chromatin or through secondary effects on DNA that accompany alterations in cell growth or cell cycle distribution, alters the susceptibility of DNA to intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA scission. If this enhanced protein-associated scission is selectively localized to transcriptionally active chromatin, the adsorption of the DNA-bound proteins to membrane filters (DNA-protein crosslinking) may allow identification and isolation of estrogen-regulated gene sequences.	0
Title: Characterization of the ectoine biosynthesis genes of haloalkalotolerant obligate methanotroph "Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z" Abstract: The genes involved in biosynthesis of the major compatible solute ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methylpyrimidine carboxylic acid) in halotolerant obligate methanotroph "Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z" were studied. The complete nucleotide sequences of the structural genes encoding L: -aspartokinase (Ask), L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid transaminase (EctB), L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase (EctA), and L-ectoine synthase (EctC) were defined and shown to be transcribed as a single operon ectABCask. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high sequence identities (34-63%) of the Ect proteins to those from halophilic heterotrophs with the highest amino acid identities being to Vibrio cholerae enzymes. The chromosomal DNA fragment from "M. alcaliphilum 20Z" containing ectABC genes and putative promoter region was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant cells could grow in the presence of 4% NaCl and synthesize ectoine. The data obtained suggested that despite the ectoine biosynthesis pathway being evolutionary well conserved with respect to the genes and enzymes involved, some differences in their organization and regulation could occur in various halophilic bacteria.	1
Title: Response and adaptation of Escherichia coli to suppression of the amber stop codon Abstract: Some extant organisms reassign the amber stop codon to a sense codon through evolution, and suppression of the amber codon with engineered tRNAs has been exploited to expand the genetic code for incorporating non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) in live systems. However, it is unclear how the host cells respond and adapt to such amber suppression. Herein we suppressed the amber codon in Escherichia coli with an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair and cultured the cells under such a pressure for about 500 generations. We discovered that E. coli quickly counteracted the suppression with transposon insertion to inactivate the orthogonal synthetase. Persistent amber suppression evading transposon inactivation led to global proteomic changes with a notable up-regulation of a previously uncharacterized protein (YdiI) for which we identified an unexpected function of expelling plasmids. These results should be valuable for understanding codon reassignment in genetic code evolution and for improving the efficiency of ncAA incorporation.	0
Title: Identification and sequence determination of the capsid protein gene of human astrovirus serotype 1 Abstract: We present the sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) at the 3' end of human astrovirus serotype 1. Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein of M(r) 85,540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.	0
Title: Enantioselective Decarboxylative Arylation of α-Amino Acids via the Merger of Photoredox and Nickel Catalysis Abstract: An asymmetric decarboxylative Csp(3)-Csp(2) cross-coupling has been achieved via the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of naturally abundant α-amino acids and readily available aryl halides into valuable chiral benzylic amines in high enantiomeric excess, thereby producing motifs found in pharmacologically active agents.	0
Title: Genes associated with 2-methylisoborneol biosynthesis in cyanobacteria: isolation, characterization, and expression in response to light Abstract: The volatile microbial metabolite 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is a root cause of taste and odor issues in freshwater. Although current evidence suggests that 2-MIB is not toxic, this compound degrades water quality and presents problems for water treatment. To address these issues, cyanobacteria and actinomycetes, the major producers of 2-MIB, have been investigated extensively. In this study, two 2-MIB producing strains, coded as Pseudanabaena sp. and Planktothricoids raciborskii, were used in order to elucidate the genetic background, light regulation, and biochemical mechanisms of 2-MIB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Genome walking and PCR methods revealed that two adjacent genes, SAM-dependent methyltransferanse gene and monoterpene cyclase gene, are responsible for GPP methylation and subsequent cyclization to 2-MIB in cyanobacteria. These two genes are located in between two homologous cyclic nucleotide-binding protein genes that may be members of the Crp-Fnr regulator family. Together, this sequence of genes forms a putative operon. The synthesis of 2-MIB is similar in cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. Comparison of the gene arrangement and functional sites between cyanobacteria and other organisms revealed that gene recombination and gene transfer probably occurred during the evolution of 2-MIB-associated genes. All the microorganisms examined have a common origin of 2-MIB biosynthesis capacity, but cyanobacteria represent a unique evolutionary lineage. Gene expression analysis suggested that light is a crucial, but not the only, active regulatory factor for the transcription of 2-MIB synthesis genes. This light-regulated process is immediate and transient. This study is the first to identify the genetic background and evolution of 2-MIB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, thus enhancing current knowledge on 2-MIB contamination of freshwater.	1
Title: Frequency of human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERV) K113 and K115 in the Polish population, and their effect on HIV infection Abstract: Background:                       The human genome contains about 8% of endogenous retroviral sequences originated from germ cell infections by exogenous retroviruses during evolution. Most of those sequences are inactive because of accumulation of mutations but some of them are still capable to be transcribed and translated. The latter are insertionally polymorphic HERV-K113 and HERV-K115. It has been suggested that their presence and expression was connected with several human diseases. It is also believed that they could interfere with the replication cycle of exogenous retroviruses, including HIV.                  Results:                       Prevalence of endogenous retroviral sequences HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 was determined in the Polish population. The frequencies were found as 11.8% for HERV-K113 and 7.92% for HERV-K115. To verify the hypothesis that the presence of these HERVs sequences could affect susceptibility to HIV infection, comparison of a control group (HIV-negative, not exposed to HIV; n = 303) with HIV-positive patients (n = 470) and exposed but uninfected (EU) individuals (n = 121) was performed. Prevalence of HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 in the EU group was 8.26% and 5.71%, respectively. In the HIV(+) group we detected HERV-K113 sequences in 12.98% of the individuals and HERV-K115 sequences in 7.23% of the individuals. There were no statistically significant differences between groups studied.                  Conclusion:                       The frequency of HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 sequences in Poland were found to be higher than usually shown for European populations. No relation between presence of the HERVs and HIV infection was detected.	0
Title: Functional analysis of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli membrane protein gene Lxx18460 (anti-sigma K) Abstract: Background:                       Sugarcane is an important sugar and economic crop in the world. Ratoon stunting Disease (RSD) of sugarcane, caused by Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli, is widespread in countries and regions where sugarcane is grown and also limited to sugarcane productivity. Although the whole genome sequencing of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli was completed, progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of the disease has been slow because it is difficult to grow in culture.                  Results:                       The Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli membrane protein gene Lxx18460 (anti-sigma K) was cloned from the Lxx-infected sugarcane cultivar GT11 at the mature stage using RT-PCR technique, and the gene structure and expression in infected sugarcane were analyzed. The Lxx18460 gene was transformed into Nicotiana tabacum by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediation. The transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing Lxx18460 had lower levels in plant height, leaf area, net photosynthetic rate and endogenous hormones of IAA, ABA and GA3, as well as lower activities of three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than the wild type (WT) tobacco. With the plant growth, the expression of Lxx18460 gene and protein was increased. To better understand the regulation of Lxx18460 expression, transcriptome analysis of leaves from transgenic and wild type tobacco was performed. A total of 60,222 all-unigenes were obtained through BGISEQ-500 sequencing. Compared the transgenic plants with the WT plants, 11,696 upregulated and 5949 downregulated genes were identified. These differentially expressed genes involved in many metabolic pathways including signal transduction, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and so on. Though the data presented here are from a heterologous system, Lxx 18460 has an adverse impact on the growth of tobacco; it reduces the photosynthesis of tobacco, destroys the activity of defense enzymes, and affects the levels of endogenous hormones, which indicate that Lxx18460 may act important roles in the course of infection in sugarcane.                  Conclusions:                       This is the first study on analyzing the function of the membrane protein gene Lxx18460 of anti-sigma K (σK) factor in Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli. Our findings will improve the understanding of the interaction between the RSD pathogen Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli and sugarcane. The output of this study will also be helpful to explore the pathogenesis of RSD.	0
Title: Activation of subtilin precursors by Bacillus subtilis extracellular serine proteases subtilisin (AprE), WprA, and Vpr Abstract: The maturation of the peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic) subtilin in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 includes posttranslational modifications of the propeptide and proteolytic cleavage of the leader peptide. To identify subtilin processing activities, we used antimicrobial inactive subtilin precursors consisting of the leader peptide which was still attached to the fully matured propeptide. Two extracellular B. subtilis proteases were able to activate subtilin precursors, the commercially available serine protease prototype subtilisin (AprE) and WprA. The latter was isolated from B. subtilis WB600, a strain deficient in six extracellular proteases. Surprisingly, the aprE wprA double mutant of the ATCC 6633 strain was still able to produce active subtilin, however, with a reduced production rate. No subtilin processing was found within the culture supernatant of the WB800 strain, which is deficient in eight extracellular proteases. Vpr was identified as the third protease capable to process subtilin.	1
Title: Photosensitizer synergistic effects: D-A-D structured organic molecule with enhanced fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yield for photodynamic therapy Abstract: The development of photosensitizers with high fluorescence intensity and singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields (QYs) is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) are two kinds of building block with great potential for PDT. Herein, a novel donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structured organic photosensitizer DPPBDPI with a benzene ring as a π bridge linking DPP and BODIPY has been designed and synthesized. The results indicate that the combination of DPP with BODIPY can simultaneously increase the fluorescence QY (5.0%) and the 1O2 QY (up to 80%) significantly by the synergistic effect of the two photosensitizers. By nanoprecipitation, DPPBDPI can form uniform nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of less than 100 nm. The obtained NPs not only exhibit high photo-toxicity, but also present negligible dark toxicity towards HeLa cells, demonstrating their excellent photodynamic therapeutic efficacy. In vivo fluorescence imaging shows that DPPBDPI NPs can target the tumor site quickly with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and can effectively inhibit tumor growth using photodynamic therapy even with low doses (0.5 mg kg-1). The enhanced imaging and photodynamic performance of DPPBDPI suggest that the synergistic effect of DPP and BODIPY provides a novel theranostic platform for cancer diagnosis and photodynamic therapy.	0
Title: Phylogenetic diversity of marine cyanophage isolates and natural virus communities as revealed by sequences of viral capsid assembly protein gene g20 Abstract: In order to characterize the genetic diversity and phylogenetic affiliations of marine cyanophage isolates and natural cyanophage assemblages, oligonucleotide primers CPS1 and CPS8 were designed to specifically amplify ca. 592-bp fragments of the gene for viral capsid assembly protein g20. Phylogenetic analysis of isolated cyanophages revealed that the marine cyanophages were highly diverse yet more closely related to each other than to enteric coliphage T4. Genetically related marine cyanophage isolates were widely distributed without significant geographic segregation (i.e., no correlation between genetic variation and geographic distance). Cloning and sequencing analysis of six natural virus concentrates from estuarine and oligotrophic offshore environments revealed nine phylogenetic groups in a total of 114 different g20 homologs, with up to six clusters and 29 genotypes encountered in a single sample. The composition and structure of natural cyanophage communities in the estuary and open-ocean samples were different from each other, with unique phylogenetic clusters found for each environment. Changes in clonal diversity were also observed from the surface waters to the deep chlorophyll maximum layer in the open ocean. Only three clusters contained known cyanophage isolates, while the identities of the other six clusters remain unknown. Whether or not these unidentified groups are composed of bacteriophages that infect different Synechococcus groups or other closely related cyanobacteria remains to be determined. The high genetic diversity of marine cyanophage assemblages revealed by the g20 sequences suggests that marine viruses can potentially play important roles in regulating microbial genetic diversity.	0
Title: Twenty-five coregulated transcripts define a sterigmatocystin gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Sterigmatocystin (ST) and the aflatoxins (AFs), related fungal secondary metabolites, are among the most toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic natural products known. The ST biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus nidulans is estimated to involve at least 15 enzymatic activities, while certain Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus nomius strains contain additional activities that convert ST to AF. We have characterized a 60-kb region in the A. nidulans genome and find it contains many, if not all, of the genes needed for ST biosynthesis. This region includes verA, a structural gene previously shown to be required for ST biosynthesis, and 24 additional closely spaced transcripts ranging in size from 0.6 to 7.2 kb that are coordinately induced only under ST-producing conditions. Each end of this gene cluster is demarcated by transcripts that are expressed under both ST-inducing and non-ST-inducing conditions. Deduced polypeptide sequences of regions within this cluster had a high percentage of identity with enzymes that have activities predicted for ST/AF biosynthesis, including a polyketide synthase, a fatty acid synthase (alpha and beta subunits), five monooxygenases, four dehydrogenases, an esterase, an 0-methyltransferase, a reductase, an oxidase, and a zinc cluster DNA binding protein. A revised system for naming the genes of the ST pathway is presented.	1
Title: Transfer of neurotoxigenicity from Clostridium butyricum to a nontoxigenic Clostridium botulinum type E-like strain Abstract: Two Clostridium butyricum strains from infant botulism cases produce a toxic molecule very similar to C. botulinum type E neurotoxin. Chromosomal, plasmid, and bacteriophage DNAs of toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of C. butyricum and C. botulinum type E were probed with (i) a synthesized 30-mer oligonucleotide encoding part of the L chain of type E botulinum toxin and (ii) the DNA of phages lysogenizing these cultures. The toxin gene probe hybridized to the chromosomal DNA of toxigenic strains but not to their plasmid DNA. All toxigenic and most nontoxigenic strains tested were lysogenized by a prophage on the chromosome. Prophages of toxigenic strains, irrespective of species, had related or identical DNAs which differed from the DNAs of prophages in nontoxigenic strains. The prophage of toxigenic strains was adjacent or close to the toxin gene on the chromosome. Phage DNAs purified from toxigenic strains did not hybridize with the toxin gene probe but could act as the template of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the toxin gene. The toxin gene was not transferred between C. botulinum and C. butyricum (either direction) when different pairs of a possible gene donor and a recipient strain were grown as mixed cultures. Nontoxigenic C. butyricum or C. botulinum type E-like strains did not become toxigenic when grown in broth containing the phage induced from a toxigenic strain of the other species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Title: Cs3VO(O2)2CO3: an exceptionally thermostable carbonatoperoxovanadate with an extremely large second-harmonic generation response Abstract: A novel nonlinear optical (NLO) carbonatoperoxovanadate, Cs3VO(O2)2CO3, with an exceptionally high thermostability was successfully synthesized by introducing highly polarizable Cs+ cations and inorganic polydentate carbonate anions into asymmetric peroxovanadates. The structure of Cs3VO(O2)2CO3 is composed of distorted [VO(O2)2CO3]3- units and charge balancing Cs+ cations. The title compound exhibits the largest NLO intensity ever found in the current carbonate NLO materials, i.e., 23.0 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The remarkably strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) response originates from the synergistic effect of the exceedingly polarizable Cs+ cations, distortive polyhedra of the V5+ cation, delocalized π orbitals in CO3 groups, and distorted localized π orbitals in O2 groups. First-principles calculations indicated that introducing the polarizable cations into peroxovanadates not only induces the enhancement of the SHG response but also improves the thermal stability of the framework.	0
Title: Modular Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of GE81112 B1 and Related Analogues Enables Elucidation of Its Key Pharmacophores Abstract: The GE81112 complex has garnered much interest due to its broad antimicrobial properties and unique ability to inhibit bacterial translation initiation. Herein we report the use of a chemoenzymatic strategy to complete the first total synthesis of GE81112 B1. By pairing iron and α-ketoglutarate dependent hydroxylases found in GE81112 biosynthesis with traditional synthetic methodology, we were able to access the natural product in 11 steps (longest linear sequence). Following this strategy, 10 GE81112 B1 analogues were synthesized, allowing for identification of its key pharmacophores. A key feature of our medicinal chemistry effort is the incorporation of additional biocatalytic hydroxylations in modular analogue synthesis to rapidly enable exploration of relevant chemical space.	0
Title: Microneedle-Assisted Percutaneous Delivery of a Tetramethylpyrazine-Loaded Microemulsion Abstract: This study examined the efficacy of the percutaneous delivery of a tetramethylpyrazine-loaded microemulsion (TMP-ME) on skin pretreated with microneedles (MN). The TMP-ME formulation was optimized in vitro with skin permeation experiments, using a uniform experimental design, guided by a pseudo-ternary phase diagram, in which the TMP skin permeation level and mean particle size were indices. The effects of MN pretreatment on skin permeation by TMP-ME were assessed using in vitro skin permeation, in vivo skin microdialysis, and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The influence of MN pretreatment on the skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring the electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion. In the optimal formulation of TMP-ME, the weight percentages of Maisine® 35-1 (oil phase), Labrasol® (surfactant), and Transcutol® P (co-surfactant) were 7%, 30% and 10%, respectively, with 1.5% TMP loading. In the in vitro skin permeation study, MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a two-fold increase in a 24-h cumulative TMP permeation compared with TMP-ME alone (p < 0.05). In the skin microdialysis study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 1.25-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.93-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 0.88-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). Similarly, in the pharmacokinetic study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 2.11-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.67-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 1.07-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). The percutaneous electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion was 850 ± 50 Ω/cm² and 283 ± 104 Ω/cm² respectively, indicating that MN dramatically compromises the skin barrier. These results suggest that MN assistance increases the skin permeation rate and the extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME, and that the mechanism may involve the reversible barrier perturbation effect. The rate and extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME can be significantly enhanced by MN assistance, possibly because MN causes a reversible barrier perturbation effect on skin.	0
Title: Mutation of His-157 in the second pore loop drastically reduces the activity of the Synechocystis Ktr-type transporter Abstract: Mutation of a conserved His-157 in the second pore loop of KtrB drastically reduced the activity of the K+ transporter from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. This result suggests that His-157 plays an essential role in the K+ transport activity of the transporter system.	0
Title: A dual anchoring strategy for the localization and activation of artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology Abstract: Artificial metalloenzymes result from anchoring an active catalyst within a protein environment. Toward this goal, various localization strategies have been pursued: covalent, supramolecular, or dative anchoring. Herein we show that introduction of a suitably positioned histidine residue contributes to firmly anchor, via a dative bond, a biotinylated rhodium piano stool complex within streptavidin. The in silico design of the artificial metalloenzyme was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The resulting artificial metalloenzyme displays significantly improved catalytic performance, both in terms of activity and selectivity in the transfer hydrogenation of imines. Depending on the position of the histidine residue, both enantiomers of the salsolidine product can be obtained.	0
Title: Atolypenes, Tricyclic Bacterial Sesterterpenes Discovered Using a Multiplexed In Vitro Cas9-TAR Gene Cluster Refactoring Approach Abstract: Most natural product biosynthetic gene clusters identified in bacterial genomic and metagenomic sequencing efforts are silent under laboratory growth conditions. Here, we describe a scalable biosynthetic gene cluster activation method wherein the gene clusters are disassembled at interoperonic regions in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 and then reassembled with PCR-amplified, short DNAs, carrying synthetic promoters, using transformation assisted recombination (TAR) in yeast. This simple, cost-effective, and scalable method allows for the simultaneous generation of combinatorial libraries of refactored gene clusters, eliminating the need to understand the transcriptional hierarchy of the silent genes. In two test cases, this in vitro disassembly-TAR reassembly method was used to create collections of promoter-replaced gene clusters that were tested in parallel to identify versions that enabled secondary metabolite production. Activation of the atolypene ( ato) gene cluster led to the characterization of two unprecedented bacterial cyclic sesterterpenes, atolypene A (1) and B (2), which are moderately cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines. This streamlined in vitro disassembly- in vivo reassembly method offers a simplified approach for silent gene cluster refactoring that should facilitate the discovery of natural products from silent gene clusters cloned from either metagenomes or cultured bacteria.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of producer of the glycopeptide antibiotic Aculeximycin Kutzneria albida DSM 43870T, a representative of minor genus of Pseudonocardiaceae Abstract: Background:                       Kutzneria is a representative of a rarely observed genus of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. Kutzneria species were initially placed in the Streptosporangiaceae genus and later reconsidered to be an independent genus of the Pseudonocardiaceae. Kutzneria albida is one of the eight known members of the genus. This strain is a unique producer of the glycosylated polyole macrolide aculeximycin which is active against both bacteria and fungi. Kutzneria albida genome sequencing and analysis allow a deeper understanding of evolution of this genus of Pseudonocardiaceae, provide new insight in the phylogeny of the genus, as well as decipher the hidden secondary metabolic potential of these rare actinobacteria.                  Results:                       To explore the biosynthetic potential of Kutzneria albida to its full extent, the complete genome was sequenced. With a size of 9,874,926 bp, coding for 8,822 genes, it stands alongside other Pseudonocardiaceae with large circular genomes. Genome analysis revealed 46 gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. Two large genomic islands were identified, containing regions most enriched with secondary metabolism gene clusters. Large parts of this secondary metabolism "clustome" are dedicated to siderophores production.                  Conclusions:                       Kutzneria albida is the first species of the genus Kutzneria with a completely sequenced genome. Genome sequencing allowed identifying the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of aculeximycin, one of the largest known oligosaccharide-macrolide antibiotics. Moreover, the genome revealed 45 additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, suggesting a huge biosynthetic potential, which makes Kutzneria albida a very rich source of natural products. Comparison of the Kutzneria albida genome to genomes of other actinobacteria clearly shows its close relations with Pseudonocardiaceae in line with the taxonomic position of the genus.	1
Title: In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents Abstract: Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.	0
Title: Overexpression of a novel member of the mitochondrial carrier family rescues defects in both DNA and RNA metabolism in yeast mitochondria Abstract: The PIF1 and MRS2 gene products have previously been shown to be essential for mitochondrial DNA maintenance at elevated temperatures and mitochondrial group II intron splicing, respectively, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A multicopy suppressor capable of rescuing the respiratory deficient phenotype associated with null alleles of either gene has been isolated. This suppressor is a nuclear gene that was called RIM2/MRS12. The RIM2/MRS12 gene encodes a predicted protein of 377 amino acids that is essential for mitochondrial DNA metabolism and proper cell growth. Inactivation of this gene causes the total loss of mitochondrial DNA and, compared to wild-type rhoo controls, a slow-growth phenotype on media containing glucose. Analysis of the RIM2/MRS12 protein sequence suggests that RIM2/MRS12 encodes a novel member of the mitochondrial carrier family. In particular, a typical triplicate structure, where each repeat consists of two putative transmembrane segments separated by a hydrophilic loop, can be deduced from amino acid sequence comparisons and the hydropathy profile of RIM2/MRS12. Antibodies directed against the aminoterminus of RIM2/MRS12 detect this protein in mitochondria. The function of the RIM2/MRS12 protein and the substrates it might transport are discussed.	0
Title: Production of hybrid anthracycline antibiotics by heterologous expression of Streptomyces nogalater nogalamycin biosynthesis genes Abstract: A cluster of anthracycline biosynthetic genes isolated from Streptomyces nogalater was expressed in Streptomyces lividans and in Streptomyces galilaeus. A 12 kb DNA fragment cloned from this cluster in pIJ486 caused the production of a novel compound when introduced into S. lividans. The compound is derived from nogalonic acid methyl ester, an early intermediate in nogalamycin biosynthesis. Complementation with the cloned 12 kb fragment of S. galilaeus mutants blocked in aclacinomycin biosynthesis caused the production of hybrid anthracyclines. Cloning of the nogalamycin gene cluster should make possible a detailed study of the biosynthesis of this interesting antibiotic, as well as the production of novel anthracyclines of potential value as cytostatic drugs.	1
Title: Hydroxylation of Longiborneol by a Clm2-Encoded CYP450 Monooxygenase to Produce Culmorin in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: A second structural gene required for culmorin biosynthesis in the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum is described. Clm2 encodes a regio- and stereoselective cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for C-11 of longiborneol (1). Clm2 gene disruptants were grown in liquid culture and assessed for culmorin production via HPLC-evaporative light scattering detection. The analysis indicated a complete loss of culmorin (2) from the liquid culture of the ΔClm2 mutants. Culmorin production resumed in a ΔClm2 complementation experiment. A detailed analysis of the secondary metabolites extracted from the large-scale liquid culture of disruptant ΔClm2D20 revealed five new natural products: 3-hydroxylongiborneol (3), 5-hydroxylongiborneol (4), 12-hydroxylongiborneol (5), 15-hydroxylongiborneol (6), and 11-epi-acetylculmorin (7). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by a combination of HRMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography.	1
Title: Accessing Both Retention and Inversion Pathways in Stereospecific, Nickel-Catalyzed Miyaura Borylations of Allylic Pivalates Abstract: We have developed a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Miyaura borylation of allylic pivalates, which delivers highly enantioenriched α-stereogenic γ-aryl allylboronates with good yields and regioselectivities. Our complementary sets of conditions enable access to either enantiomer of allylboronate product from a single enantiomer of readily prepared allylic pivalate substrate. Excellent functional group tolerance, yields, regioselectivities, and stereochemical fidelities are observed. The stereochemical switch from stereoretention to stereoinversion largely depends upon solvent and can be explained by competitive pathways for the oxidative addition step. Our mechanistic investigations support a stereoretentive pathway stemming from a directed oxidative addition and a stereoinvertive pathway that is dominant when MeCN blocks coordination of the directing group by binding the nickel catalyst.	0
Title: Functional Reconstitution of a Fungal Natural Product Gene Cluster by Advanced Genome Editing Abstract: Filamentous fungi produce varieties of natural products even in a strain dependent manner. However, the genetic basis of chemical speciation between strains is still widely unknown. One example is trypacidin, a natural product of the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, which is not produced among different isolates. Combining computational analysis with targeted gene editing, we could link a single nucleotide insertion in the polyketide synthase of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway and reconstitute its production in a nonproducing strain. Thus, we present a CRISPR/Cas9-based tool for advanced molecular genetic studies in filamentous fungi, exploiting selectable markers separated from the edited locus.	1
Title: Organizational and mutational analysis of a complete FR-008/candicidin gene cluster encoding a structurally related polyene complex Abstract: The complete gene cluster for biosynthesis of a polyene complex, FR-008, spans 137.2 kb of the genome of Streptomyces sp. FR-008 consisting of six genes for a modular PKS and 15 additional genes. The extensive similarity to the partially characterized candicidin gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, especially for genes involved in mycosamine biosynthesis, prompted us to compare the compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. FR-008 and Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, and we found that FR-008 and candicidin complex are identical. A model for biosynthesis of a set of four structurally related FR-008/candicidin compounds was proposed. Deletion of the putative regulatory genes abolished antibiotic production, while disruption of putative glycosyltransferase and GDP-ketosugar aminotransferase functionalities led to the productions of a set of nonmycosaminated aglycones and a novel polyene complex with attachment of altered sugar moiety, respectively.	1
Title: Control of Charge Carriers Trapping and Relaxation in Hematite by Oxygen Vacancy Charge: Ab Initio Non-adiabatic Molecular Dynamics Abstract: Ultrafast charge recombination in hematite (α-Fe2O3) severely limits its applications in solar energy conversion and utilization, for instance, in photoelectrochemical water splitting. We report the first time-domain ab initio study of charge relaxation dynamics in α-Fe2O3 with and without the oxygen vacancy (Ov) defect, using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics implemented within time-dependent density functional theory. The simulations show that the hole trapping is the rate-limiting step in the electron-hole recombination process for both neutral and ionized Ov systems. The electron trapping is fast, and the trapped electron are relatively long-lived. A similar asymmetry is found for the relaxation of free charge carriers: relaxation of photoholes in the valence band is slower than relaxation of photoelectrons in the conduction band. The slower dynamics of holes offers an advantage to water oxidation at α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Notably, the neutral Ov defect accelerates significantly the charge recombination rate, by about a factor of 30 compared to the ideal lattice, due to the stronger electron-vibrational coupling at the defect. However, the recombination rate in the ionized Ov defect is decreased by a factor of 10 with respect to the neutral defect, likely due to expansion of the local iron shell around the Ov site. The Ov defect ionization in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is important for increasing both electrical conductivity and charge carrier lifetimes. The simulations reproduce well the time scales for the hot carrier cooling, trapping and recombination available from transient spectroscopy experiments, and suggest two alternative mechanisms for the Ov-assisted electron-hole recombination. The study provides a detailed atomistic understanding of carrier dynamics in hematite, and rationalizes the experimentally reported activation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by incorporation of Ov defects.	0
Title: Cariogenic Streptococcus mutans Produces Tetramic Acid Strain-Specific Antibiotics That Impair Commensal Colonization Abstract: Streptococcus mutans is a common constituent of dental plaque and a major etiologic agent of dental caries (tooth decay). In this study, we elucidated the biosynthetic pathway encoded by muc, a hybrid polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), present in a number of globally distributed S. mutans strains. The natural products synthesized by muc included three N-acyl tetramic acid compounds (reutericyclin and two novel analogues) and an unacylated tetramic acid (mutanocyclin). Furthermore, the enzyme encoded by mucF was identified as a novel class of membrane-associated aminoacylases and was responsible for the deacylation of reutericyclin to mutanocyclin. A large number of hypothetical proteins across a broad diversity of bacteria were homologous to MucF, suggesting that this may represent a large family of unexplored acylases. Finally, S. mutans utilized the reutericyclin produced by muc to impair the growth of neighboring oral commensal bacteria. Since S. mutans must be able to out-compete these health-associated organisms to persist in the oral microbiota and cause disease, the competitive advantage conferred by muc suggests that this BGC is likely to be involved in S. mutans ecology and therefore dental plaque dysbiosis and the resulting caries pathogenesis.	1
Title: Total synthesis of salinosporamide A Abstract: Total synthesis of potent proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (1) has been accomplished, which features strictly substrate-controlled operations starting with the only chiral center of (R)-pyroglutamic acid. The consecutive quaternary carbons within 1 have been efficiently constructed by manipulation of two intramolecular reactions: (1) carbonate-mediated internal acylation of imidate ester (4 --> 14) and (2) selenocyclization of aldehyde to exocyclic methylene group (5 --> 18).	1
Title: Lag phase of Salmonella enterica under osmotic stress conditions Abstract: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was grown at salt concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 7.5% in minimal medium with and without added osmoprotectant and in a rich medium. In minimal medium, the cells showed an initial decline period, and consequently the definition of the lag time of the resultant log count curve was revised. The model of Baranyi and Roberts (Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23:277-294, 1994) was modified to take into account the initial decline period, based on the assumption that the log count curve of the total population was the sum of a dying and a surviving-then-growing subpopulation. The lag time was defined as the lag of the surviving subpopulation. It was modeled by means of a parameter quantifying the biochemical work the surviving cells carry out during this phase, the "work to be done." The logarithms of the maximum specific growth rates as a function of the water activity in the three media differed only by additive constants, which gave a theoretical basis for bias factors characterizing the relationships between different media. Models for the lag and the "work to be done" as a function of the water activity showed similar properties, but in rich medium above 5% salt concentrations, the data showed a maximum for this work. An accurate description of the lag time is important to avoid food wastage, which is an issue of increasing significance in the food industry, while maintaining food safety standards.	0
Title: Characterization of the Suillus grevillei quinone synthetase GreA supports a nonribosomal code for aromatic α-keto acids Abstract: The gene greA was cloned from the genome of the basidiomycete Suillus grevillei. It encodes a monomodular natural product biosynthesis protein composed of three domains for adenylation, thiolation, and thioesterase and, hence, is reminiscent of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). GreA was biochemically characterized in vitro. It was identified as atromentin synthetase and therefore represents one of only a limited number of biochemically characterized NRPS-like enzymes which accept an aromatic α-keto acid. Specificity-conferring amino acid residues--collectively referred to as the nonribosomal code--were predicted for the primary sequence of the GreA adenylation domain and were an unprecedented combination for aromatic α-keto acids. Plausible support for this new code came from in silico simulation of the adenylation domain structure. According to the model, the predicted residues line the active site and, therefore, very likely contribute to substrate specificity.	1
Title: Bacterial endotoxin stimulates adipose lipolysis via toll-like receptor 4 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway Abstract: Bacterial endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide elicits inflammatory responses and also elevates circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and impairs insulin sensitivity. Serum FFA elevation in acute endotoxemia has long been thought to be due to endotoxin dysregulating lipid disposal and counterregulatory hormones and cytokines. Here, we investigated the direct lipolysis effect of endotoxin in rodents and in isolated primary adipocytes. Endotoxin increases lipolysis in vivo in adipose tissues, elevates circulating FFA level, induces insulin resistance in rats, and directly stimulates chronic lipolysis in vitro in adipocytes. The lipolytic action of endotoxin is mediated via its lipid A moiety and is blocked by anti-endotoxin peptides. Neither adipocytokine secretion nor nuclear factor-kappaB activation is involved in endotoxin-induced lipolysis. Different from catecholamine, endotoxin stimulates lipolysis without elevating cAMP production and activating protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Instead, endotoxin induces phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. Upon inhibition of ERK1/2 but not JNK and p38 MAPK, endotoxin-stimulated lipolysis ceases. Endotoxin causes perilipin down-regulation and phosphorylation and increases the activity and protein levels of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase but does not induce hormone-sensitive lipase translocation to intracellular lipid droplets. In TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-deficient mice and adipocytes, endotoxin fails to increase in vivo and in vitro lipolysis. These findings suggest that endotoxin stimulates lipolysis via TLR4 and ERK1/2 signaling in adipocytes. The lipolytic action of endotoxin liberates FFA efflux from adipocytes to the bloodstream, which is a possible basis for systemic FFA elevation and insulin resistance in endotoxemia or Gram-negative bacterial infection.	0
Title: Unprecedented Cyclization Catalyzed by a Cytochrome P450 in Benzastatin Biosynthesis Abstract: Benzastatins have unique structures probably derived from geranylated p-aminobenzoic acids. The indoline and tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds are presumably formed by cyclization of the geranyl moiety, but the cyclization mechanism was unknown. We studied the benzastatin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. RI18; functions of the six enzymes encoded by it were analyzed by gene disruption in a heterologous host and in vitro enzyme assays. We propose the biosynthetic pathway for benzastatins in which a cytochrome P450 (BezE) is responsible for the cyclization of geranylated p-acetoxyaminobenzoic acids; BezE catalyzes elimination of acetic acid to form an iron nitrenoid, nitrene transfer to form an aziridine ring, and nucleophilic addition of hydroxide ion to C-10 and chloride ion to C-9 to generate the indoline and tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds, respectively. Discovery of this enzyme, which should be termed cytochrome P450 nitrene transferase, provides an important insight into the functional diversity of cytochrome P450.	1
Title: Comparative characterization of the lactimidomycin and iso-migrastatin biosynthetic machineries revealing unusual features for acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases and providing an opportunity to engineer new analogues Abstract: Lactimidomycin (LTM, 1) and iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS, 2) belong to the glutarimide-containing polyketide family of natural products. We previously cloned and characterized the mgs biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993. The iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery featured an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK). We now report cloning and characterization of the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, which consists of nine genes that encode an AT-less type I PKS (LtmBCDEFGHL) and one tailoring enzyme (LtmK). Inactivation of ltmE or ltmH afforded the mutant strain SB15001 or SB15002, respectively, that abolished the production of 1, as well as the three cometabolites 8,9-dihydro-LTM (14), 8,9-dihydro-8S-hydroxy-LTM (15), and 8,9-dihydro-9R-hydroxy-LTM (13). Inactivation of ltmK yielded the mutant strain SB15003 that abolished the production of 1, 13, and 15 but led to the accumulation of 14. Complementation of the ΔltmK mutation in SB15003 by expressing ltmK in trans restored the production of 1, as well as that of 13 and 15. These results support the model for 1 biosynthesis, featuring an AT-less type I PKS that synthesizes 14 as the nascent polyketide intermediate and a cytochrome P450 desaturase that converts 14 to 1, with 13 and 15 as minor cometabolites. Comparative analysis of the LTM and iso-MGS AT-less type I PKSs revealed several unusual features that deviate from those of the collinear type I PKS model. Exploitation of the tailoring enzymes for 1 and 2 biosynthesis afforded two analogues, 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM (16) and 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM (17), that provided new insights into the structure-activity relationship of 1 and 2. While 12-membered macrolides, featuring a combination of a hydroxyl group at C-17 and a double bond at C-8 and C-9 as found in 1, exhibit the most potent activity, analogues with a single hydroxyl or methoxy group at C-8 or C-9 retain most of the activity whereas analogues with double substitutions at C-8 and C-9 lose significant activity.	1
Title: Optogenetic control of kinetochore function Abstract: Kinetochores act as hubs for multiple activities during cell division, including microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint signaling. Each kinetochore can act autonomously, and activities change rapidly as proteins are recruited to, or removed from, kinetochores. Understanding this dynamic system requires tools that can manipulate kinetochores on biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales. Optogenetic approaches have the potential to provide temporal and spatial control with molecular specificity. Here we report new chemical inducers of protein dimerization that allow us to both recruit proteins to and release them from kinetochores using light. We use these dimerizers to manipulate checkpoint signaling and molecular motor activity. Our findings demonstrate specialized properties of the CENP-E (kinesin-7) motor for directional chromosome transport to the spindle equator and for maintenance of metaphase alignment. This work establishes a foundation for optogenetic control of kinetochore function, which is broadly applicable to experimental probing of other dynamic cellular processes.	0
Title: Linking chemistry and genetics in the growing cyanobactin natural products family Abstract: Ribosomal peptide natural products are ubiquitous, yet relatively few tools exist to predict structures and clone new pathways. Cyanobactin ribosomal peptides are found in ~30% of all cyanobacteria, but the connection between gene sequence and structure was not defined, limiting the rapid identification of new compounds and pathways. Here, we report discovery of four orphan cyanobactin gene clusters by genome mining and an additional pathway by targeted cloning, which represented a tyrosine O-prenylating biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining enabled discovery of five cyanobactins, including peptide natural products from Spirulina supplements. A phylogenetic model defined four cyanobactin genotypes, which explain the synthesis of multiple cyanobactin structural classes and help direct pathway cloning and structure prediction efforts. These strategies were applied to DNA isolated from a mixed cyanobacterial bloom containing cyanobactins.	1
Title: Tuning the composition of AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles for antibacterial application Abstract: We show that bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) of AuPt without any surface modification are potent antibiotic reagents, while pure Au NPs or pure Pt NPs display no antibiotic activities. The most potent antibacterial AuPt NPs happen to be the most effective catalysts for chemical transformations. The mechanism of antibiotic action includes the dissipation of membrane potential and the elevation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. These bimetallic NPs are unique in that they do not produce reactive oxygen species as most antibiotics do. Being non-toxic to human cells, these bimetallic noble NPs might open an entry to a new class of antibiotics.	0
Title: Structural and functional analysis of the gene cluster encoding the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of Lactobacillus sake Abstract: Lactobacillus sake can use arginine via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. We designed degenerate primers based on an alignment of known sequences of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)-encoding genes in order to amplify the L. sake counterpart sequences by PCR. Screening a genomic library of L. sake in lambdaEMBL3 allowed us to isolate a clone containing a 10-kb L. sake genomic DNA insert. Sequence analysis revealed that the genes involved in arginine catabolism were clustered and encoded ADI (arcA), OTC (arcB), carbamate kinase (arcC), and a putative carrier with high similarity to the arginine/ornithine antiporter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (arcD). Additionally, a putative transaminase-encoding gene (arcT) was located in this region. The genes followed the order arcA arcB arcC arcT arcD, which differs from that found in other microorganisms. arcA, arcB, arcC, and arcD mutants were constructed, and the ADI pathway was impaired in all of them. Transcriptional studies indicated that arcA gene is subject to catabolite repression, and under the conditions used, several transcripts could be detected, suggesting the existence of different initiation sites or processing of a larger mRNA.	0
Title: Identification of a gene cluster of polyether antibiotic lasalocid from Streptomyces lasaliensis Abstract: Elucidation of enzymatic polyether formation is a long-standing controversial issue in organic chemistry. To address this intriguing issue, identifying the actual substrate for epoxidation and sequential cyclization is essential. We selected the representative polyether ionophore, lasalocid, which has been proposed to undergo no modification at the late stage of biosynthesis. Cloning and a sequence analysis revealed seven polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, epoxidase and epoxide hydrolase genes for sequential ether formation, and several putative genes for supplying ethylmalonyl-CoA. Based on bioinformatic data, we propose the lasalocid biosynthetic pathway which involves characteristic aromatic ring formation and sequential cyclic ether formation. The finding of a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the seventh PKS indicates that intriguing oxidative cascade cyclization would occur after cleavage of the polyketide intermediate from PKS. Based on this observation, we have recently reported the enzymatic transformation of a bisepoxide intermediate to lasalocid with the recombinant epoxide hydrolase, Lsd19.	1
Title: Total synthesis and structural revision of viridicatumtoxin B Abstract: Will the real viridicatumtoxin B please stand up:                       Total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B resulted in its structural revision and opens the way for analogue construction and biological evaluation of this complex tetracycline antibiotic. The highly convergent strategy employed allows for swift construction of the entire carbocyclic framework of the molecule.	1
Title: Beta hydroxylation of glycolipids from Ustilago maydis and Pseudozyma flocculosa by an NADPH-dependent β-hydroxylase Abstract: Flocculosin and ustilagic acid (UA), two highly similar antifungal cellobiose lipids, are respectively produced by Pseudozyma flocculosa, a biocontrol agent, and Ustilago maydis, a plant pathogen. Both glycolipids contain a short-chain fatty acid hydroxylated at the β position but differ in the long fatty acid, which is hydroxylated at the α position in UA and at the β position in flocculosin. In both organisms, the biosynthesis genes are arranged in large clusters. The functions of most genes have already been characterized, but those of the P. flocculosa fhd1 gene and its homolog from U. maydis, uhd1, have remained undefined. The deduced amino acid sequences of these genes show homology to those of short-chain dehydrogenases and reductases (SDR). We disrupted the uhd1 gene in U. maydis and analyzed the secreted UA. uhd1 deletion strains produced UA lacking the β-hydroxyl group of the short-chain fatty acid. To analyze the function of P. flocculosa Fhd1, the corresponding gene was used to complement U. maydis Δuhd1 mutants. Fhd1 was able to restore wild-type UA production, indicating that Fhd1 is responsible for β hydroxylation of the flocculosin short-chain fatty acid. We also investigated a P. flocculosa homolog of the U. maydis long-chain fatty-acid alpha hydroxylase Ahd1. The P. flocculosa ahd1 gene, which does not reside in the flocculosin gene cluster, was introduced into U. maydis Δahd1 mutant strains. P. flocculosa Ahd1 neither complemented the U. maydis Δahd1 phenotype nor resulted in the production of β-hydroxylated UA. This suggests that P. flocculosa Ahd1 is not involved in flocculosin hydroxylation.	1
Title: Evaluation of data transformations and validation of a model for the effect of temperature on bacterial growth Abstract: The temperature of chilled foods is an important variable for controlling microbial growth in a production and distribution chain. Therefore, it is essential to model growth as a function of temperature in order to predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time. This article deals with the correct variance-stabilizing transformation of the growth parameters A (asymptotic level), mu (specific growth rate), and lambda (lag time). This is of importance for the regression analysis of the data. A previously gathered data set and model for the effect of temperature on the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum (M. H. Zwietering, J. T. de Koos, B. E. Hasenack, J. C. de Wit, and K. van 't Riet, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 57:1094-1101, 1991) is extended with new data. With the total data set (original and new data), a variance-stabilizing transformation is selected in order to determine which transformation should precede fitting. No transformation for the asymptote data, a square root for the growth rate, and a logarithmic transformation for the lag time were found to be appropriate. After these transformations, no significant correlation was found between the variance and the magnitude of the variable. Model corrections were made and model parameters were estimated by using the original data. With the new data, the models were validated by comparing the lack of fit of the models with the measurement error, using an F test. The predictions of the models for mu and lambda were adequate. The model for A showed a systematic deviation, and therefore a new model for A is proposed.	0
Title: Engineering new protein-protein interactions on the β-propeller fold by yeast cell surface display Abstract: REINVENTING THE WHEEL: The β-propeller domain folds like a wheel to provide key protein-protein interactions in the cell.

Title: Community dynamics and activity of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes in intertidal sediments of the Yangtze estuary Abstract: Diversity, abundance, and activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were investigated using the ammonia monooxygenase α subunit (amoA) in the intertidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary. Generally, AOB had a lower diversity of amoA genes than did AOA in this study. Clone library analysis revealed great spatial variations in both AOB and AOA communities along the estuary. The UniFrac distance matrix showed that all the AOB communities and 6 out of 7 AOA communities in the Yangtze Estuary were statistically indistinguishable between summer and winter. The studied AOB and AOA community structures were observed to correlate with environmental parameters, of which salinity, pH, ammonium, total phosphorus, and organic carbon had significant correlations with the composition and distribution of both communities. Also, the AOA communities were significantly correlated with sediment clay content. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results indicated that the abundance of AOB amoA genes was greater than that of AOA amoA genes in 10 of the 14 samples analyzed in this study. Potential nitrification rates were significantly greater in summer than in winter and had a significant negative correlation with salinity. In addition, potential nitrification rates were correlated strongly only with archaeal amoA gene abundance and not with bacterial amoA gene abundance. However, no significant differences were observed between rates measured with and without ampicillin (AOB inhibitor). These results implied that archaea might play a more important role in mediating the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in the Yangtze estuarine sediments.	0
Title: Characterization of SgcE6, the flavin reductase component supporting FAD-dependent halogenation and hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: The C-1027 enediyne antitumor antibiotic from Streptomyces globisporus possesses an (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine moiety, the chloro- and hydroxy-substituents of which are installed by a flavin-dependent halogenase SgcC3 and monooxygenase SgcC, respectively. Interestingly, a single flavin reductase, SgcE6, can provide reduced flavin to both enzymes. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that, similar to other flavin reductases involved in natural product biosynthesis, SgcE6 belongs to the HpaC-like subfamily of the Class I flavin reductases. The present study describes the steady-state kinetic characterization of SgcE6 as a strictly NADH- and FAD-specific enzyme.	1
Title: Breast cancer occurrence after low dose radiotherapy of non-malignant disorders of the shoulder Abstract: Stochastic long-term damages at relatively low doses have the potential for cancer induction. For the first time we investigated the occurrence of breast cancer in female patients after radiotherapy of non-malignant disorders of the shoulder and made a comparison with the estimated spontaneous incidence of mammary carcinoma for this cohort. In a geographically defined district with a population of approximately 100.000 inhabitants, comprehensive data of radiological diagnostics and radiotherapy were registered nearly completely for 41 years; data included mammography and radiotherapy of breast cancer patients as well as of non-malignant disorders. Within this population a collective of 158 women with radiotherapy of the shoulder was investigated. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt-60 photons (Gammatron) with an average cumulative-dose of 6 Gy. The average follow-up time was 21.3 years. Patients were 55 years old (median) when radiotherapy of the shoulder was performed. Seven patients (4.4%) developed breast cancer after a median of 21 years. According to the incidence statistics, 9.4 +/- 1.8 (95%CI) cases (5.9%) would be expected. In regard to the irradiated shoulder neither the ipsilateral nor the contralateral breasts showed increased rates of breast cancer. An induction of additional breast cancer caused by radiation of non-malignant disorders of the shoulder wasn't detected in the investigated cohort.	0
Title: Cytosporone B is an agonist for nuclear orphan receptor Nur77 Abstract: Nuclear orphan receptor Nur77 has important roles in many biological processes. However, a physiological ligand for Nur77 has not been identified. Here, we report that the octaketide cytosporone B (Csn-B) is a naturally occurring agonist for Nur77. Csn-B specifically binds to the ligand-binding domain of Nur77 and stimulates Nur77-dependent transactivational activity towards target genes including Nr4a1 (Nur77) itself, which contains multiple consensus response elements allowing positive autoregulation in a Csn-B-dependent manner. Csn-B also elevates blood glucose levels in fasting C57 mice, an effect that is accompanied by induction of multiple genes involved in gluconeogenesis. These biological effects were not observed in Nur77-null (Nr4a1-/-) mice, which indicates that Csn-B regulates gluconeogenesis through Nur77. Moreover, Csn-B induced apoptosis and retarded xenograft tumor growth by inducing Nur77 expression, translocating Nur77 to mitochondria to cause cytochrome c release. Thus, Csn-B may represent a promising therapeutic drug for cancers and hypoglycemia, and it may also be useful as a reagent to increase understanding of Nur77 biological function.	0
Title: Discovery of an Antibacterial Isoindolinone-Containing Tetracyclic Polyketide by Cryptic Gene Activation and Characterization of Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: The major setback in natural product screening is the decreasing hit rate of novel bioactive compounds containing new chemical skeletons. Here we report the identification and biosynthesis of isoindolinomycin (Idm), an unprecedented bioactive polyketide with a novel isoindolinone-containing tetracyclic skeleton. Idm was discovered through the screening of rifampicin-resistant ( rif) mutants that were generated from nine actinomycete strains used in this study. Of the 114 rif mutants isolated, the mutant S55-50-5 was found to overproduce Idm, which is almost undetectable in the wild-type Streptomyces sp. SoC090715LN-16. An in silico analysis coupled with gene deletion experiments revealed a biosynthetic idmB gene cluster that is responsible for the production of Idm. The biosynthetic studies of Idm primarily focused on the formation of the five-membered ring in the tetracyclic structure and the attachment of the methyl group to the core structure. In addition, a malachite green phosphate assay performed using a stand-alone adenylation domain ( idmB21) demonstrated the involvement of glycine in the formation of the isoindolinone-containing skeleton. This study contributes to an increase in the structural diversity of polyketides and paves the way toward an understanding of the complete biosynthetic pathway of a novel class of tetracyclic polyketides.	1
Title: Nucleoid condensation and cell division in Escherichia coli MX74T2 ts52 after inhibition of protein synthesis Abstract: The reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid of an Escherichia coli mutant, MX74T2 ts52, was studied by electron microscopy after protein synthesis inhibition by using whole mounts of cell ghosts, ultrathin-sectioning, and freeze-etching. The bacterial nucleoid showed two morphological changes after chloramphenicol addition: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) localization and DNA condensation. DNA localization was observed 10 min after chloramphenicol addition; the DNA appeared as a compact, solid mass. DNA condensation was observed at 25 min; the nucleoid appeared as a cytoplasm-filled sphere, often opened at one end. Ribosomes were observed in the center. Giant nucleoids present in some mutant filaments showed fused, spherical nucleoids arranged linearly, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the nucleoid reflects the number of replicated genomes. Inhibitors which directly or indirectly blocked protein synthesis and caused DNA condensation were chloramphenicol, puromycin, amino acid starvation, rifampicin, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. All inhibitors that caused cell division in the mutant also caused condensation, although some inhibitors caused condensation without cell division. Nucleoid condensation appears to be related to chromosome structure rather than to DNA segregation upon cell division.	0
Title: Heme-biosynthetic porphobilinogen deaminase protects Aspergillus nidulans from nitrosative stress Abstract: Microorganisms have developed mechanisms to combat reactive nitrogen species (RNS); however, only a few of the fungal genes involved have been characterized. Here we screened RNS-resistant Aspergillus nidulans strains from fungal transformants obtained by introducing a genomic DNA library constructed in a multicopy vector. We found that the AN0121.3 gene (hemC) encodes a protein similar to the heme biosynthesis enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) and facilitates RNS-tolerant fungal growth. The overproduction of PBG-D in A. nidulans promoted RNS tolerance, whereas PBG-D repression caused growth that was hypersensitive to RNS. PBG-D levels were comparable to those of cellular protoheme synthesis as well as flavohemoglobin (FHb; encoded by fhbA and fhbB) and nitrite reductase (NiR; encoded by niiA) activities. Both FHb and NiR are hemoproteins that consume nitric oxide and nitrite, respectively, and we found that they are required for maximal growth in the presence of RNS. The transcription of hemC was upregulated by RNS. These results demonstrated that PBG-D is a novel NO-tolerant protein that modulates the reduction of environmental NO and nitrite levels by FHb and NiR.	0
Title: Targeting Reactive Carbonyls for Identifying Natural Products and Their Biosynthetic Origins Abstract: Natural products (NPs) serve important roles as drug candidates and as tools for chemical biology. However, traditional NP discovery, largely based on bioassay-guided approaches, is biased toward abundant compounds and rediscovery rates are high. Orthogonal methods to facilitate discovery of new NPs are thus needed, and herein we describe an isotope tag-based expansion of reactivity-based NP screening to address these shortcomings. Reactivity-based screening is a directed discovery approach in which a specific reactive handle on the NP is targeted by a chemoselective probe to enable its detection by mass spectrometry. In this study, we have developed an aminooxy-containing probe to guide the discovery of aldehyde- and ketone-containing NPs. To facilitate the detection of labeling events, the probe was dibrominated, imparting a unique isotopic signature to distinguish labeled metabolites from spectral noise. As a proof of concept, the probe was then utilized to screen a collection of bacterial extracts, leading to the identification of a new analogue of antipain, deimino-antipain. The bacterial producer of deimino-antipain was sequenced and the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression. These data reveal the previously undetermined genetic basis for a well-known family of aldehyde-containing, peptidic protease inhibitors, including antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, elastatinal, and microbial alkaline protease inhibitor, which have been widely used for over 40 years.	1
Title: Regulation of synthesis of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus NCIB8250 Abstract: Specific activity of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase in carbon-limited continuous cultures was at a maximum at a specific growth rate of 0.2 h-1, but fell off at lower and higher growth rates. The specific activity in nitrogen-limited cultures was always lower and was inversely proportional to growth rate. There was severe repression of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase during metabolism of L(+)-mandelate or phenylglyoxylate in batch cultures. Synthesis of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was followed in experiments where various compounds, including a gratuitous inducer and an anti-inducer of the mandelate enzymes, were added to uninduced or pre-induced cultures and to constitutive and blocked mutants. The results led to the conclusion that there were at least two types of repression. One was caused by phenylglyoxylate carbon-lyase (or a compound synthesized co-ordinately with it), but not by the other mandelate enzymes or by L(+)-mandelate, phenylglyoxylate, benzaldehyde or benzoate. A second type of repression was observed during rapid growth or after the addition of compound such as succinate which are rapidly and completely metabolized.	1
Title: Inhibition of collagenase by aranciamycin and aranciamycin derivatives Abstract: Aranciamycin (1), an anthracycline antibiotic, was found to be an inhibitor of Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, with an IC50 = 3.7 x 10(-7) M. Elastase and trypsin were not inhibited at concentrations less than or equal to 10(-5) M. A number of aranciamycin derivatives 2-13 were prepared and tested for collagenase inhibition. While loss of activity was found for derivatives modified in the sugar ring or rings B and D of the aglycone, increased potency was found when the tertiary alcohol at C-9 was esterified. All compounds 1-13 were found to inhibit DNA synthesis of Yoshida sarcoma tumor cells.	1
Title: Pseudophedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Structures and Influence of Lithium Chloride on Reactivity and Mechanism Abstract: The structures and reactivities of pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates are examined. A combination of NMR and IR spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational data reveal that the homoaggregated dianions form octalithiated tetramers displaying S4-symmetric Li8O8 cores and overall C2 symmetry. Computational and isotopic labeling studies reveal strong N-Li contacts in the carboxamide enolate moiety. The method of continuous variations proves deceptive, as octalithiated tetrameric homoaggregates afford hexalithiated trimeric heteroaggregates. A lithium diisopropylamide-lithium enolate mixed aggregate is found to be a C2-symmetric hexalithiated species incorporating two enolate dianions and two lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) subunits. Structural and rate studies show that lithium chloride has little effect on the dynamics of the enolate homoaggregates but forms adducts of unknown structure. Rate studies of alkylations indicate that the aging of the aggregates can have effects spanning orders of magnitude. The LiCl-enolate adduct dramatically accelerates the reaction but requires superstoichiometric quantities owing to putative autoinhibition. Efforts and progress toward eliminating the requisite large excess of LiCl are discussed.	0
Title: Coordinated cyclic-di-GMP repression of Salmonella motility through YcgR and cellulose Abstract: Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a secondary messenger that controls a variety of cellular processes, including the switch between a biofilm and a planktonic bacterial lifestyle. This nucleotide binds to cellular effectors in order to exert its regulatory functions. In Salmonella, two proteins, BcsA and YcgR, both of them containing a c-di-GMP binding PilZ domain, are the only known c-di-GMP receptors. BcsA, upon c-di-GMP binding, synthesizes cellulose, the main exopolysaccharide of the biofilm matrix. YcgR is dedicated to c-di-GMP-dependent inhibition of motility through its interaction with flagellar motor proteins. However, previous evidences indicate that in the absence of YcgR, there is still an additional element that mediates motility impairment under high c-di-GMP levels. Here we have uncovered that cellulose per se is the factor that further promotes inhibition of bacterial motility once high c-di-GMP contents drive the activation of a sessile lifestyle. Inactivation of different genes of the bcsABZC operon, mutation of the conserved residues in the RxxxR motif of the BcsA PilZ domain, or degradation of the cellulose produced by BcsA rescued the motility defect of ΔycgR strains in which high c-di-GMP levels were reached through the overexpression of diguanylate cyclases. High c-di-GMP levels provoked cellulose accumulation around cells that impeded flagellar rotation, probably by means of steric hindrance, without affecting flagellum gene expression, exportation, or assembly. Our results highlight the relevance of cellulose in Salmonella lifestyle switching as an architectural element that is both essential for biofilm development and required, in collaboration with YcgR, for complete motility inhibition.	0
Title: VirB1* promotes T-pilus formation in the vir-Type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Abstract: The vir-type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium is assembled from 12 proteins encoded by the virB operon and virD4. VirB1 is one of the least-studied proteins encoded by the virB operon. Its N terminus is a lytic transglycosylase. The C-terminal third of the protein, VirB1*, is cleaved from VirB1 and secreted to the outside of the bacterial cell, suggesting an additional function. We show that both nopaline and octopine strains produce abundant amounts of VirB1* and perform detailed studies on nopaline VirB1*. Both domains are required for wild-type virulence. We show here that the nopaline type VirB1* is essential for the formation of the T pilus, a subassembly of the vir-T4SS composed of processed and cyclized VirB2 (major subunit) and VirB5 (minor subunit). A nopaline virB1 deletion strain does not produce T pili. Complementation with full-length VirB1 or C-terminal VirB1*, but not the N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain, restores T pili containing VirB2 and VirB5. T-pilus preparations also contain extracellular VirB1*. Protein-protein interactions between VirB1* and VirB2 and VirB5 were detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We propose that VirB1 is a bifunctional protein required for virT4SS assembly. The N-terminal lytic transglycosylase domain provides localized lysis of the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow insertion of the T4SS. The C-terminal VirB1* promotes T-pilus assembly through protein-protein interactions with T-pilus subunits.	0
Title: Pantocin A, a peptide-derived antibiotic involved in biological control by plant-associated Pantoea species Abstract: The genus Pantoea contains a broad range of plant-associated bacteria, including some economically important plant pathogens as well as some beneficial members effective as biological control agents of plant pathogens. The most well-characterized representatives of biological control agents from this genus generally produce one or more antimicrobial compounds adding to biocontrol efficacy. Some Pantoea species evaluated as biocontrol agents for fire blight disease of apple and pear produce a histidine-reversible antibiotic. Three commonly studied histidine-reversible antibiotics produced by Pantoea spp. are herbicolin O, MccEh252, and pantocin A. Pantocin A is a novel ribosomally encoded and post-translationally modified peptide natural product. Here, we review the current knowledge on the chemistry, genetics, biosynthesis, and incidence and environmental relevance of pantocin A and related histidine-reversible antibiotics produced by Pantoea.	1
Title: Enhancement and selective production of phoslactomycin B, a protein phosphatase IIa inhibitor, through identification and engineering of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Phoslactomycins (PLMs), potent and selective inhibitors of serine threonine phosphatases, are of interest for their antitumor and antiviral activity. Multiple analogs and low titers in the fermentation process have hampered the development of this class of natural products. The entire 75-kb PLM biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. HK-803 was cloned, sequenced, and analyzed. The loading domain and seven extension modules of the PLM polyketide synthase generate an unusual linear unsaturated polyketide chain containing both E- and Z-double bonds from a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (CHC) primer. Hydroxylation of the CHC-derived side chain of the resulting PLM-B by PlmS2, and a subsequent esterification, produces the remaining PLM analogs. A new PCR targeting technology allowed rapid and facile allelic replacement of plmS2. The resulting mutant selectively produced the PLM-B, at 6-fold higher titers than the wild type strain. This mutant and the biosynthetic gene cluster will facilitate engineered microbial production of hybrid PLMs with improved properties.	1
Title: Evaluation of arylimidamides DB1955 and DB1960 as candidates against visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease: in vivo efficacy, acute toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies Abstract: Arylimidamides (AIAs) have shown outstanding in vitro potency against intracellular kinetoplastid parasites, and the AIA 2,5-bis[2-(2-propoxy)-4-(2-pyridylimino)aminophenyl]furan dihydrochloride (DB766) displayed good in vivo efficacy in rodent models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and Chagas' disease. In an attempt to further increase the solubility and in vivo antikinetoplastid potential of DB766, the mesylate salt of this compound and that of the closely related AIA 2,5-bis[2-(2-cyclopentyloxy)-4-(2-pyridylimino)aminophenyl]furan hydrochloride (DB1852) were prepared. These two mesylate salts, designated DB1960 and DB1955, respectively, exhibited dose-dependent activity in the murine model of VL, with DB1960 inhibiting liver parasitemia by 51% at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day × 5 and DB1955 reducing liver parasitemia by 57% when given by the same dosing regimen. In a murine Trypanosoma cruzi infection model, DB1960 decreased the peak parasitemia levels that occurred at 8 days postinfection by 46% when given orally at 100 mg/kg/day × 5, while DB1955 had no effect on peak parasitemia levels when administered by the same dosing regimen. Distribution studies revealed that these compounds accumulated to micromolar levels in the liver, spleen, and kidneys but to a lesser extent in the heart, brain, and plasma. A 5-day repeat-dose toxicology study with DB1960 and DB1955 was also conducted with female BALB/c mice, with the compounds administered orally at 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg/day. In the high-dose groups, DB1960 caused changes in serum chemistry, with statistically significant increases in serum blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels, and a 21% decrease in body weight was observed in this group. These changes were consistent with microscopic findings in the livers and kidneys of the treated animals. The incidences of observed clinical signs (hunched posture, tachypnea, tremors, and ruffled fur) were more frequent in DB1960-treated groups than in those treated with DB1955. However, histopathological examination of tissue samples indicated that both compounds had adverse effects at all dose levels.	0
Title: Multiplexed screening of cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry Abstract: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are highly promising candidates as drug delivery agents into cells of interest. We describe for the first time the multiplexed analysis of nanoparticle uptake by cells using mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that the cellular uptake of functionalized gold nanoparticles with cationic or neutral surface ligands can be readily determined using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of cell lysates. The surface ligands have "mass barcodes" that allow different nanoparticles to be simultaneously identified and quantified at levels as low as 30 pmol. Using this method, we find that subtle changes to AuNP surface functionalities can lead to measurable changes in cellular uptake propensities.	0
Title: Disodium Salts of Pseudoephedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Stereoselectivity and Mechanism of Alkylation Abstract: Pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates were generated using sodium diisopropylamide (NaDA) in THF solution. The reactivities and selectivities of the disodium salts largely mirror those of the dilithium salts but without the requisite large excesses of inorganic salts (LiCl) or mandated dilute solutions. The disodium salts require careful control of temperature to preclude deleterious aggregate aging effects traced to changes in the aggregate structure and intervening O-alkylations. Structural studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations show a dominant highly symmetric polyhedron quite different from the lithium analogue. No enolate-NaDA mixed aggregates are observed with excess NaDA. Rate studies show an alkylation mechanism involving an intervening tetramer-monomer pre-equilibrium followed by rate-limiting alkylation of tetrasolvated monomers. DFT computations were conducted to explore the possible influences on stereochemistry. A crystal deriving from samples aged at ambient temperature contains six dianionic subunits and two monoanionic (alkoxide-only) subunits. A new preparation of concentrated solutions of NaDA in THF solution is described.	0
Title: A naturally inspired antibiotic to target multidrug-resistant pathogens Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for an increasing number of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant infections1,2. The bacterial natural product colistin is considered the last line of defence against a number of Gram-negative pathogens. The recent global spread of the plasmid-borne mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 (phosphoethanolamine transferase) threatens the usefulness of colistin3. Bacteria-derived antibiotics often appear in nature as collections of similar structures that are encoded by evolutionarily related biosynthetic gene clusters. This structural diversity is, at least in part, expected to be a response to the development of natural resistance, which often mechanistically mimics clinical resistance. Here we propose that a solution to mcr-1-mediated resistance might have evolved among naturally occurring colistin congeners. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced bacterial genomes identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that was predicted to encode a structurally divergent colistin congener. Chemical synthesis of this structure produced macolacin, which is active against Gram-negative pathogens expressing mcr-1 and intrinsically resistant pathogens with chromosomally encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase genes. These Gram-negative bacteria include extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and intrinsically colistin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which, owing to a lack of effective treatment options, are considered among the highest level threat pathogens4. In a mouse neutropenic infection model, a biphenyl analogue of macolacin proved to be effective against extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii with colistin-resistance, thus providing a naturally inspired and easily produced therapeutic lead for overcoming colistin-resistant pathogens.	1
Title: Nisin J, a Novel Natural Nisin Variant, Is Produced by Staphylococcus capitis Sourced from the Human Skin Microbiota Abstract: The skin microbiota is thought to play a key role in host protection from infection. Nisin J is a novel nisin variant produced by Staphylococcus capitis APC 2923, a strain isolated from the toe web space area in a screening study performed on the human skin microbiota. Whole-genome sequencing and mass spectrometry of the purified peptide confirmed that S. capitis APC 2923 produces a 3,458-Da bacteriocin, designated nisin J, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Cutibacterium acnes The gene order in the nisin J gene cluster (nsjFEGBTCJP) differs from that of other nisin variants in that it is lacking the nisin regulatory genes, nisRK, as well as the nisin immunity gene nisI Nisin J has 9 amino acid changes compared to prototypical nisin A, with 8 amino acid substitutions, 6 of which are not present in other nisin variants (Ile4Lys, Met17Gln, Gly18Thr, Asn20Phe, Met21Ala, Ile30Gly, Val33His, and Lys34Thr), and an extra amino acid close to the C terminus, rendering nisin J the only nisin variant to contain 35 amino acids. This is the first report of a nisin variant produced by a Staphylococcus species and the first nisin producer isolated from human skin.IMPORTANCE This study describes the characterization of nisin J, the first example of a natural nisin variant, produced by a human skin isolate of staphylococcal origin. Nisin J displays inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial targets, including MRSA. This work demonstrates the potential of human commensals as a source for novel antimicrobials that could form part of the solution to antibiotic resistance across a broad range of bacterial pathogens.	1
Title: Laminin-induced activation of Rac1 and JNKp46 is initiated by Src family kinases and mimics the effects of skeletal muscle contraction Abstract: Binding of laminin to dystroglycan in the dystrophin glycoprotein complex causes signaling through dystroglycan-syntrophin-grb2-SOS1-Rac1-PAK1-JNK. Laminin binding also causes syntrophin tyrosine phosphorylation to initiate signaling. The kinase responsible was investigated here. PP2 and SU6656, specific inhibitors of Src family kinases, decreased the amount of phosphotyrosine syntrophin and decreased the level of active Rac1 in laminin-treated myoblasts, myotubes, or skeletal muscle microsomes. c-Src and c-Fyn both phosphorylate syntrophin, and inhibition of either with specific siRNAs diminishes the level of syntrophin phosphorylation. When the rat gastrocnemius was contracted, the level of Rac1 activation increased compared to that of the relaxed control muscle and Rac1 colocalized with beta-dystroglycan. Similar results were obtained when the muscle was stretched. Contracted muscle also contained more activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNKp46. E3, an expressed protein containing only laminin domains LG4 and LG5, increased the rate of proliferation of myoblasts, and PP2 prevented cell proliferation. In addition, Src family kinases colocalized with activated Rac1 and with laminin-Sepharose in solid-phase binding assays. Thus, contraction, stretching, or laminin binding causes recruitment of Src family kinase to the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, activating Rac1 and inducing downstream signaling. The DGC likely represents a mechanoreceptor in skeletal muscle-regulating muscle growth in response to muscle activity. Src family kinases play an initiating and critical role.	0
Title: NOVEL Escherichia coli dnaB mutant: direct involvement of the dnaB252 gene product in the synthesis of an origin-ribonucleic acid species during initiaion of a round of deoxyribonucleic acid replication Abstract: The initiation process of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication in Escherichia coli has been studied using the thermoreversible dna initiation mutant E. coli HfrHl65/120/6 dna-252. This dna mutation was incorrectly classed as a dnaA mutation. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the dna-252 mutant is a novel dnaB mutant, possessing phenotypic properties which distinguish it from other dnaB mutants. Sensitivity of reinitiation in the dna-252 mutant to specific inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and DNA synthesis was studied. Reinitiation is shown to be sensitive to rifampin and streptolydigin but not to cholramphenicol. Thus, the dna-252 gene product appears to be required during the initiation process for a step occurring either before or during synthesis of an RNA species (origin-RNA). Using reversible inhibition of RNA synthesis by streptolydigin of a streptolydigin-sensitive derivative of the dna-252 mutant, the dna-252 gene product is shown to be directly involved in the synthesis of an orgin-RNA species. These results are included in a schematic model presented in the accompanying paper of the temporal sequence of events occurring during the initiation process.	0
Title: Palladium(II)-catalyzed ortho alkylation of benzoic acids with alkyl halides Abstract: The first Pd(II)-catalyzed alkylation of aryl C–H bonds is achieved without using a co-oxidant. The alkylation reaction was followed thereafter by an intramolecular lactonization to give broadly useful γ– and ™– benzolactones.	0
Title: Genome mining identifies cepacin as a plant-protective metabolite of the biopesticidal bacterium Burkholderia ambifaria Abstract: Beneficial microorganisms are widely used in agriculture for control of plant pathogens, but a lack of efficacy and safety information has limited the exploitation of multiple promising biopesticides. We applied phylogeny-led genome mining, metabolite analyses and biological control assays to define the efficacy of Burkholderia ambifaria, a naturally beneficial bacterium with proven biocontrol properties but potential pathogenic risk. A panel of 64 B. ambifaria strains demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against priority plant pathogens. Genome sequencing, specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster mining and metabolite analysis revealed an armoury of known and unknown pathways within B. ambifaria. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of the metabolite cepacin was identified and directly shown to mediate protection of germinating crops against Pythium damping-off disease. B. ambifaria maintained biopesticidal protection and overall fitness in the soil after deletion of its third replicon, a non-essential plasmid associated with virulence in Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria. Removal of the third replicon reduced B. ambifaria persistence in a murine respiratory infection model. Here, we show that by using interdisciplinary phylogenomic, metabolomic and functional approaches, the mode of action of natural biological control agents related to pathogens can be systematically established to facilitate their future exploitation.	1
Title: Carbohydrate scaffolds as glycosyltransferase inhibitors with in vivo antibacterial activity Abstract: The rapid rise of multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a global healthcare crisis, and new antibiotics are urgently required, especially those with modes of action that have low-resistance potential. One promising lead is the liposaccharide antibiotic moenomycin that inhibits bacterial glycosyltransferases, which are essential for peptidoglycan polymerization, while displaying a low rate of resistance. Unfortunately, the lipophilicity of moenomycin leads to unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties that render it unsuitable for systemic administration. In this study, we show that using moenomycin and other glycosyltransferase inhibitors as templates, we were able to synthesize compound libraries based on novel pyranose scaffold chemistry, with moenomycin-like activity, but with improved drug-like properties. The novel compounds exhibit in vitro inhibition comparable to moenomycin, with low toxicity and good efficacy in several in vivo models of infection. This approach based on non-planar carbohydrate scaffolds provides a new opportunity to develop new antibiotics with low propensity for resistance induction.	0
Title: Genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the TIFY gene family in response to drought in cotton Abstract: Jasmonates control many aspects of plant biological processes. They are important for regulating plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, which is one of the most serious threats to sustainable agricultural production. However, little is known regarding how jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins mediate jasmonic acid signals to improve stress tolerance in cotton. This represents the first comprehensive comparative study of TIFY transcription factors in both diploid A, D and tetraploid AD cotton species. In this study, we identified 21 TIFY family members in the genome of Gossypium arboretum, 28 members from Gossypium raimondii and 50 TIFY genes in Gossypium hirsutum. The phylogenetic analyses indicated the TIFY gene family could be divided into the following four subfamilies: TIFY, PPD, ZML, and JAZ subfamilies. The cotton TIFY genes have expanded through tandem duplications and segmental duplications compared with other plant species. Gene expression profile revealed temporal and tissue specificities for TIFY genes under simulated drought conditions in Gossypium arboretum. The JAZ subfamily members were the most highly expressed genes, suggesting that they have a vital role in responses to drought stress. Over-expression of GaJAZ5 gene decreased water loss, stomatal openings, and the accumulation of H2O2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, the results of drought tolerance assays suggested that this subfamily might be involved in increasing drought tolerance. Our study provides new data regarding the genome-wide analysis of TIFY gene families and their important roles in drought tolerance in cotton species. These data may form the basis of future studies regarding the relationship between drought and jasmonic acid.	0
Title: Host-mediated modification of Sau3AI restriction in Listeria monocytogenes: prevalence in epidemic-associated strains Abstract: Most major food-related outbreaks of listeriosis have been traced to a cluster of genetically related strains of serovar 4b (epidemic clone). In spite of numerous searches, distinct bacteriologic or virulence-related features unique to these strains have eluded identification, although a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) characteristic of the epidemic clone has previously been described (W. Zheng and S. Kathariou, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:4310-4314, 1995). We found that DNAs from 75 strains which were derived from three separate outbreaks and which had the epidemic clone-specific RFLP were also invariably resistant to digestion by Sau3AI and other restriction endonucleases sensitive to cytosine methylation at 5' GATC 3' sites. This modification of Sau3AI restriction was host mediated, as it did not persist when DNA was cloned and propagated in Escherichia coli, and was uncommon among other Listeria strains. Epidemic-associated strains with this modification were resistant to infection by phage propagated in a serotype 4b strain which was not known to be involved in an epidemic and which lacked the epidemic clone-specific RFLP. Screening for susceptibility to MboI digestion revealed that these epidemic strains lacked methylation of adenines at GATC sites. This type of modification was rare among Listeria strains and was found in only three (of eight screened) strains of serovar 1/2b, possibly representing one clonal lineage.	0
Title: Purification and Characterization of Suicin 65, a Novel Class I Type B Lantibiotic Produced by Streptococcus suis Abstract: Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides of bacterial origin that are considered as a promising alternative to the use of conventional antibiotics. Recently, our laboratory reported the purification and characterization of two lantibiotics, suicin 90-1330 and suicin 3908, produced by the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis (serotype 2). In this study, a novel bacteriocin produced by S. suis has been identified and characterized. The producing strain S. suis 65 (serotype 2) was found to belong to the sequence type 28, that includes strains known to be weakly or avirulent in a mouse model. The bacteriocin, whose production was only possible following growth on solid culture medium, was purified to homogeneity by cationic exchange and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The bacteriocin, named suicin 65, was heat, pH and protease resistant. Suicin 65 was active against all S. suis isolates tested, including antibiotic resistant strains. Amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocin by Edman degradation revealed the presence of modified amino acids suggesting a lantibiotic. Using the partial sequence obtained, a blast was performed against published genomes of S. suis and allowed to identify a putative lantibiotic locus in the genome of S. suis 89-1591. From this genome, primers were designed and the gene cluster involved in the production of suicin 65 by S. suis 65 was amplified by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of ten open reading frames, including a duplicate of the structural gene. The structural genes (sssA and sssA') of suicin 65 encodes a 25-amino acid residue leader peptide and a 26-amino acid residue mature peptide yielding an active bacteriocin with a deducted molecular mass of 3,005 Da. Mature suicin 65 showed a high degree of identity with class I type B lantibiotics (globular structure) produced by Streptococcus pyogenes (streptococcin FF22; 84.6%), Streptococcus macedonicus (macedocin ACA-DC 198; 84.6%), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (lacticin 481; 74.1%). Further studies will evaluate the ability of suicin 65 or the producing strain to prevent experimental S. suis infections in pigs.	1
Title: Translational control of transcription termination at the attenuator of the Escherichia coli tryptophan operon Abstract: We have isolated two regulatory mutants altered in the leader region of the Escherichia coli tryptophan (trp) operon. In one mutant, trpL29, the AUG translation start codon for the trip leader peptide is replaced by AUA. The other mutant, trpL75, has a G leads to A change at residue 75, immediately after the UGA translation stop codon for the trp leader peptide. In vivo, trpL29 and trpL75 increase the efficiency of transcription termination at the trp attenuator 3- to 5-fold. trpL29 and trpL75 also fail to respond fully to tryptophan starvation and other conditions that normally relieve transcription termination at the trp attenuator. The trpL29 mutation, which presumably reduces synthesis of the trp leader peptide, is cis dominant. The effect of starvation for a number of the amino acids in the trp leader peptide was determined. Only starvation for tryptophan and arginine, amino acids that occur at residues 10, 11, and 12 of the 14-residue trp leader peptide, elicits relief of transcription termination. Our findings suggest that translation of trp leader RNA is involved in regulation of transcription termination at the attenuator. A model is discussed in which the location of the ribosome synthesizing the leader peptide is communicated to the RNA polymerase transcribing the leader region.	0
Title: Role of AbrB in Spo0A- and Spo0B-dependent utilization of a sporulation promoter in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Transcription of the Bacillus subtilis gene spoVG is induced at the onset of sporulation and is dependent on the products of the stage-0 regulatory genes spo0A, spo0B, and spo0H. We show here that the dependence of spoVG transcription on Spo0A and Spo0B (but not Spo0H) can be bypassed by a mutation at abrB, a previously identified locus at which mutations that suppress some of the phenotypes of spo0A are often located, or by a cis-acting mutation within the spoVG promoter. To explain the epistatis of abrB to spo0A and spo0B mutations, we propose that AbrB acts, directly or indirectly, to block transcription of spoVG and that Spo0A and Spo0B cause inactivation of the abrB gene product(s). Spo0A-Spo0B-dependent inactivation of AbrB could be a general explanation for the pleiotropic effects of spo0A and spo0B mutations on B. subtilis gene expression.	0
Title: APS8, a polymeric alkylpyridinium salt blocks α7 nAChR and induces apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma Abstract: Naturally occurring 3-alkylpyridinium polymers (poly-APS) from the marine sponge Reniera sarai, consisting of monomers containing polar pyridinium and nonpolar alkyl chain moieties, have been demonstrated to exert a wide range of biological activities, including a selective cytotoxicity against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. APS8, an analog of poly-APS with defined alkyl chain length and molecular size, non-competitively inhibits α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at nanomolar concentrations that are too low to be acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory or generally cytotoxic. In the present study we show that APS8 inhibits NSCLC tumor cell growth and activates apoptotic pathways. APS8 was not toxic for normal lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, in NSCLC cells, APS8 reduced the adverse anti-apoptotic, proliferative effects of nicotine. Our results suggest that APS8 or similar compounds might be considered as lead compounds to develop antitumor therapeutic agents for at least certain types of lung cancer.	0
Title: Transcriptional regulation by a point mutant of adenovirus-2 E1a product lacking DNA binding activity Abstract: The adenovirus E1a protein (E1A) regulates transcription through interaction with transcription factors bound to DNA, like cAMP response element BP1/ATF2, or through dissociating E2F transcription factor complex. However, it was also reported that E1A can bind to DNA (Chatterjee, P. K., Bruner, M., Flint, S. J., and Harter, M. L. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 835-841), and it is not clear whether DNA binding of E1A is involved in a part of the process of transcriptional regulation by E1A. In this paper, the small region of E1A that is responsible for DNA binding was identified and a point mutant lacking DNA binding activity was constructed. Analysis of deletion mutants of E1A proteins expressed in bacteria showed that a basic region between amino acids 201 and 216 of E1A is essential for DNA binding. Point mutation of arginines at amino acid numbers 205 and 206 to aspartic acids completely abolished the DNA binding activity of E1A. Using this mutant, the requirement of the E1A DNA binding for E1A-dependent transcriptional regulation was examined. trans-Activation of the adenovirus E4 promoter and trans-repression of the human c-erbB-2 promoter by this point mutant were examined by cotransfection experiments. Mutations of the E1A DNA-binding domain affected neither the E1A-induced trans-activation nor trans-repression at all. These results give complete proof that the DNA binding activity of E1A is not required for transcriptional regulation by E1A.	0
Title: Randomized Noninferiority Trial of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Compared with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine plus Amodiaquine for Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in Burkina Faso Abstract: The WHO recommends that children living in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission in the Sahel subregion should receive seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SPAQ). We evaluated the use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ) as an alternative drug that could be used if SPAQ starts to lose efficacy. A total of 1,499 children 3 to 59 months old were randomized to receive SMC with SPAQ or DHAPQ over 3 months. The primary outcome measure was the risk of clinical malaria (fever or a history of fever with a parasite density of at least 3,000/μl). A cohort of 250 children outside the trial was followed up as a control group. Molecular markers of drug resistance were assessed. The risk of a malaria attack was 0.19 in the DHAPQ group and 0.15 in the SPAQ group, an odds ratio of 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.72). Efficacy of SMC compared to the control group was 77% (67% to 84%) for DHAPQ and 83% (74% to 89%) for SPAQ. pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations associated with antifolate resistance were more prevalent in parasites from children who received SPAQ than in children who received DHAPQ. Both regimens were highly efficacious and well tolerated. DHAPQ is a potential alternative drug for SMC. (This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00941785.).	0
Title: Alanylclavam biosynthetic genes are clustered together with one group of clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Streptomyces clavuligerus produces at least five different clavam metabolites, including clavulanic acid and the methionine antimetabolite, alanylclavam. In vitro transposon mutagenesis was used to analyze a 13-kb region upstream of the known paralogue gene cluster. The paralogue cluster includes one group of clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes in S. clavuligerus. Twelve open reading frames (ORFs) were found in this area, and mutants were generated in each using either in vitro transposon or PCR-targeted mutagenesis. Mutants with defects in any of the genes orfA, orfB, orfC, or orfD were unable to produce alanylclavam but could produce all of the other clavams, including clavulanic acid. orfA encodes a predicted hydroxymethyltransferase, orfB encodes a YjgF/YER057c/UK114-family regulatory protein, orfC encodes an aminotransferase, and orfD encodes a dehydratase. All of these types of proteins are normally involved in amino acid metabolism. Mutants in orfC or orfD also accumulated a novel clavam metabolite instead of alanylclavam, and a complemented orfC mutant was able to produce trace amounts of alanylclavam while still producing the novel clavam. Mass spectrometric analyses, together with consideration of the enzymes involved in its production, led to tentative identification of the novel clavam as 8-OH-alanylclavam, an intermediate in the proposed alanylclavam biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: The biosynthetic pathway for a thousand-year-old natural food colorant and citrinin in Penicillium marneffei Abstract: Monascorubrin and its derivatives are polyketides used as natural colorants for a wide range of food for more than one thousand years. Since the biosynthetic pathway for this ancient chemical compound is unknown and genome sequence unavailable for any Monascus species, monascorubrin production has relied on extraction from fungal cultures of Monascus species. In vitro synthesis and genetic manipulation are not possible. Here we report the polyketide gene cluster and pathway for monascorubrin biosynthesis in Penicillium marneffei, a diffusible red pigment-producing, thermal dimorphic fungus, taking advantage of available genome sequence and faster growth rate than Monascus species. We also documented that the red pigment of P. marneffei is a mixture of more than 16 chemical compounds, which are amino acid conjugates of monascorubrin and rubropunctatin, and showed that this polyketide gene cluster and pathway are also responsible for biosynthesis of ankaflavin and citrinin, a mycotoxin with nephrotoxic activity in mammals. The present study on elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of monascorubrin is a proof-of-the-concept study that serves as a cornerstone for future studies on monascorubrin biosynthesis pathway dissection in Monascus species.	1
Title: Pt(IV) prodrugs designed to bind non-covalently to human serum albumin for drug delivery Abstract: Albumin is the most abundant protein in human serum and drugs that are administered intravenously inevitably interact with it. We present here a series of platinum(IV) prodrugs designed specifically to enhance interaction with human serum albumin (HSA) for drug delivery. This goal is achieved by asymmetrically functionalizing the axial ligands of the prodrug so as to mimic the overall features of a fatty acid. Systematic variation of the length of the aliphatic tail tunes the cellular uptake and, consequently, the cytotoxicity of cis,cis,trans-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2(O2CCH2CH2COOH)(OCONHR)], 4, where R is a linear alkyl group. Investigation of an analogue bearing a fluorophore conjugated to the succinate ligand confirmed that these compounds are reduced by biological reductants with loss of the axial ligands. Intracellular release of cisplatin from 4 was further confirmed by observing the characteristic effects of cisplatin on the cell cycle and morphology following treatment with the prodrug. The most potent member of series 4, for which R is a hexadecyl chain, interacts with HSA in a 1:1 stoichiometry to form the platinum-protein complex 7. The interaction is non-covalent and extraction with octanol completely removes the prodrug from an aqueous solution of HSA. Construct 7 is robust and can be isolated following fast protein liquid chromatography. The nature of the tight interaction was investigated computationally, and these studies suggest that the prodrug is buried below the surface of the protein. Consequently, complexation to HSA is able to reduce the rate of reduction of the prodrug by ascorbate. The lead compound from series 4 also exhibited significant stability in whole human blood, attributed to its interaction with HSA. This favorable redox profile, in conjunction with the established nonimmunogenicity, biocompatibility, and enhanced tumor accumulation of HSA, produces a system that holds significant therapeutic potential.	0
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene clusters for the lipopeptides fusaristatin A and W493 B in Fusarium graminearum and F. pseudograminearum Abstract: The closely related species Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium pseudograminearum differ in that each contains a gene cluster with a polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that is not present in the other species. To identify their products, we deleted PKS6 and NRPS7 in F. graminearum and NRPS32 in F. pseudograminearum. By comparing the secondary metabolite profiles of the strains we identified the resulting product in F. graminearum as fusaristatin A, and as W493 A and B in F. pseudograminearum. These lipopeptides have previously been isolated from unidentified Fusarium species. On the basis of genes in the putative gene clusters we propose a model for biosynthesis where the polyketide product is shuttled to the NPRS via a CoA ligase and a thioesterase in F. pseudograminearum. In F. graminearum the polyketide is proposed to be directly assimilated by the NRPS.	1
Title: Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Rakicidin A and Discovery of a Simplified Bioactive Analogue Abstract: We report a concise asymmetric synthesis of rakicidin A, a macrocyclic depsipeptide that selectively inhibits the growth of hypoxic cancer cells and stem-like leukemia cells. Key transformations include a diastereoselective organocatalytic cross-aldol reaction to build the polyketide portion of the molecule, a highly hindered ester fragment coupling reaction, an efficient Helquist-type Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) macrocyclization, and a new DSC-mediated elimination reaction to construct the sensitive APD portion of rakicidin A. We further report the preparation of a simplified structural analogue (WY1) with dramatically enhanced hypoxia-selective activity.	1
Title: Matching Glycosyl Donor Reactivity to Sulfonate Leaving Group Ability Permits SN2 Glycosylations Abstract: Here we demonstrate that highly β-selective glycosylation reactions can be achieved when the electronics of a sulfonyl chloride activator and the reactivity of a glycosyl donor hemiacetal are matched. While these reactions are compatible with the acid- and base-sensitive protecting groups that are commonly used in oligosaccharide synthesis, these protecting groups are not relied upon to control selectivity. Instead, β-selectivity arises from the stereoinversion of an α-glycosyl arylsulfonate in an SN2-like mechanism. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by NMR studies, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements, and DFT calculations.	0
Title: Nonribosomal peptide synthase gene clusters for lipopeptide biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis 916 and their phenotypic functions Abstract: Bacillus cyclic lipopeptides (LPs) have been well studied for their phytopathogen-antagonistic activities. Recently, research has shown that these LPs also contribute to the phenotypic features of Bacillus strains, such as hemolytic activity, swarming motility, biofilm formation, and colony morphology. Bacillus subtilis 916 not only coproduces the three families of well-known LPs, i.e., surfactins, bacillomycin Ls (iturin family), and fengycins, but also produces a new family of LP called locillomycins. The genome of B. subtilis 916 contains four nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene clusters, srf, bmy, fen, and loc, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of surfactins, bacillomycin Ls, fengycins, and locillomycins, respectively. By studying B. subtilis 916 mutants lacking production of one, two, or three LPs, we attempted to unveil the connections between LPs and phenotypic features. We demonstrated that bacillomycin Ls and fengycins contribute mainly to antifungal activity. Although surfactins have weak antifungal activity in vitro, the strain mutated in srfAA had significantly decreased antifungal activity. This may be due to the impaired productions of fengycins and bacillomycin Ls. We also found that the disruption of any LP gene cluster other than fen resulted in a change in colony morphology. While surfactins and bacillomycin Ls play very important roles in hemolytic activity, swarming motility, and biofilm formation, the fengycins and locillomycins had little influence on these phenotypic features. In conclusion, B. subtilis 916 coproduces four families of LPs which contribute to the phenotypic features of B. subtilis 916 in an intricate way.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the uridine-derived nucleoside antibiotic A-94964: identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster provide insight into the biosynthetic pathway Abstract: The natural product A-94964 is a uridine-derived nucleoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404. In this study, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for A-94964 using gene deletion experiments coupled with in silico analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster. This study provides insights into the unique biosynthetic pathway for A-94964.	1
Title: A microbial world within us Abstract: The microbial world within us includes a vast array of gastrointestinal (GI) tract communities that play an important role in health and disease. Significant progress has been made in recent years in describing the intestinal microbial composition based on the application of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based approaches. These were not only instrumental in providing a phylogenetic framework of the more than 1000 different intestinal species but also illustrated the temporal and spatial diversity of the microbial GI tract composition that is host-specific and affected by the genotype. However, our knowledge of the molecular and cellular bases of host-microbe interactions in the GI tract is still very limited. Here an overview is presented of the most recent developments and applications of novel culture-independent approaches that promise to unravel the mechanisms of GI tract functionality and subsequent possibilities to exploit specifically these mechanisms in order to improve gut health.	0
Title: Mechanical transition from α-helical coiled coils to β-sheets in fibrin(ogen) Abstract: We characterized the α-to-β transition in α-helical coiled-coil connectors of the human fibrin(ogen) molecule using biomolecular simulations of their forced elongation and theoretical modeling. The force (F)-extension (X) profiles show three distinct regimes: (1) the elastic regime, in which the coiled coils act as entropic springs (F < 100-125 pN; X < 7-8 nm); (2) the constant-force plastic regime, characterized by a force-plateau (F ≈ 150 pN; X ≈ 10-35 nm); and (3) the nonlinear regime (F > 175-200 pN; X > 40-50 nm). In the plastic regime, the three-stranded α-helices undergo a noncooperative phase transition to form parallel three-stranded β-sheets. The critical extension of the α-helices is 0.25 nm, and the energy difference between the α-helices and β-sheets is 4.9 kcal/mol per helical pitch. The soft α-to-β phase transition in coiled coils might be a universal mechanism underlying mechanical properties of filamentous α-helical proteins.	0
Title: Semisynthetic analogues of toxiferine I and their pharmacological properties at α7 nAChRs, muscle-type nAChRs, and the allosteric binding site of muscarinic M2 receptors Abstract: A new series of analogues of the calabash curare alkaloid toxiferine I was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated at α7 and muscle-type nAChRs and the allosteric site of muscarinic M2 receptors. The new ligands differ from toxiferine I by the absence of one (2a-c) or two (3a-c) hydroxy groups, saturation of the exocyclic double bonds, and various N-substituents (methyl, allyl, 4-nitrobenzyl). At the muscle-type nAChRs, most ligands showed similar binding to the muscle relaxant alcuronium, indicating neuromuscular blocking activity, with the nonhydroxylated analogues 3b (Ki = 75 nM) and 3c (Ki = 82 nM) displaying the highest affinity. At α7 nAChRs, all ligands showed a moderate to low antagonistic effect, suggesting that the alcoholic functions are not necessary for antagonistic action. Compound 3c exerted the highest preference for the muscle-type nAChRs (Ki = 82 nM) over α7 (IC50 = 21 μM). As for the allosteric site of M2 receptors, binding was found to be dependent on N-substitution rather than on the nature of the side chains. The most potent ligands were the N-allyl analogues 2b and 3b (EC0.5,diss = 12 and 36 nM) and the N-nitrobenzyl derivatives 2c and 3c (EC0.5,diss = 32 and 49 nM). The present findings should help delineate the structural requirements for activity at different types of AChRs and for the design of novel selective ligands.	0
Title: Structural Diversification of Andiconin-Derived Natural Products by α-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the fungal meroterpenoid emeridone F (8) was discovered in the genome of Aspergillus sp. TJ23, and its late-stage biosynthesis was elucidated by characterizing two α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases, SptF and SptN. SptF catalyzes oxidative rearrangement followed by epoxidation, whereas SptN serves as the C-9 hydroxylase. Our study provides insight into the biosynthetic mechanisms of other andiconin (1)-derived natural products, exemplifying the important roles of αKG-dependent enzymes in the structural complexifications.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of an attenuated strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AC869, a 3,5-dichlorobenzoate degrader Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa AC869, a 3,5-dichlorobenzoate degrader, is a mouse pathogen and has a reported 50% lethal dose (LD50) of 1.05 x 10(7) CFU when given intranasally to C3H/HeJ mice (S.E. George, M.J. Kohan, M.I. Gilmour, M.S. Taylor, H.G. Brooks, J.P. Creason, and L.D. Claxton, Appl. Environ, Microbiol. 59:3585-3591, 1993). AC869 was serotyped as O6 when grown in CD-1 mouse cecal and lung mucus but could not be assigned an O serotype when grown in Luria broth (LB). After growth in mouse cecal mucus, a less virulent mutant, AC869-11, was isolated from AC869 by using bacteriophage E79, which adsorbs to the O side chain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). AC869-11 produced significantly less O antigen on its LPS than AC869 when grown in mouse lung and cecal mucus. The mutant also produced half the amount of exoenzyme S and 16-fold less extracellular protease than AC869 and was more sensitive than its parent to a number of antibiotics when grown either in LB or in mouse lung mucus. AC869-11 had ninefold higher LD50 than AC869 in CD-1 mice when administered intranasally. AC869-11 was found in the lungs, small intestine, cecum, and large intestine in numbers at least 100-fold below AC869, 3 h after intranasal exposure of mice to a sublethal dose of the two strains. Moreover, AC869-11 induced a decreased pulmonary inflammatory response relative to AC869. In contrast to AC869, AC869-11 did not translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen following a sublethal dose. Despite attenuation, AC869-11 grew as well as AC869 with 3,5-dichlorobenzoate as the sole carbon and energy source. However, although AC869-11 survived in 3,5-dichlorobenzoate-contaminated soil as well as AC869 for 1 week, it failed to survive as well thereafter. These results suggest the possibility that mutations that lead to pulmonary attenuation of P. aeruginosa in mice also lead to weakness in the environment, despite such mutants maintaining the ability to degrade toxic substances under laboratory conditions.	0
Title: The barbamide biosynthetic gene cluster: a novel marine cyanobacterial system of mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) origin involving an unusual trichloroleucyl starter unit Abstract: Barbamide was extracted from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula strain 19L as a chlorinated lipopeptide for its potent molluscicidal activity. Precursor incorporation studies indicated that it is derived from acetate, L-phenylalanine, L-leucine and L-cysteine. The gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of barbamide (bar) was cloned and characterized in this study. DNA sequence analysis of cosmid pLM49 revealed a cluster of 12 open reading frames (barA-barK) extending 26 kb including the expected polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules and tailoring genes. The genetic architecture and domain organization of the bar cluster supports the assignment based on the apparent co-linearity of the systems. The activity assay of adenylation domains of barD (A(D)), barE (A(E)) and barG (A(G2) for module 2) in an amino acid-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange experiment supports the conclusion that barbamide is synthesized from acetate, L-phenylalanine, L-cysteine and L-leucine with trichloroleucine as a direct precursor by a mixed polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetase. Assembly of barbamide includes unique biochemical mechanisms for chlorination, one-carbon truncation during chain elongation, E-double bond formation and thiazole ring formation.	1
Title: Allenamide hydro-hydroxyalkylation: 1,2-amino alcohols via ruthenium-catalyzed carbonyl anti-aminoallylation Abstract: Exposure of alcohols to allenamides in the presence of RuHCl(CO)(PPh(3))(3) and dippf [dippf = bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene] results in hydrogen transfer to generate aldehyde-allylruthenium pairs, which engage in C-C coupling to form products of carbonyl aminoallylation as single anti-diastereomers.	0
Title: Rapid access to conformational analogues of (+)-peloruside A Abstract: An efficient synthetic strategy for rapid access to analogues of peloruside A has been demonstrated. The synthetic route was highlighted by a simple esterification-based fragment coupling and a late stage ring-closing metathesis reaction. This convergent route has provided access to rationally designed analogues inspired by the solution conformational preferences of peloruside A.	0
Title: Investigating Nucleosome Accessibility for MNase, FeII Peplomycin, and Duocarmycin B2 by Using Capillary Electrophoresis Abstract: Capillary electrophoresis, coupled with DNA 5' Texas Red labeling, was used to investigate the ability of MNase, FeII peplomycin, and duocarmycin B2 to access the nucleosome. Distinct accessibility patterns of these species to the nucleosome were observed. MNase was completely prevented from approaching the nucleosome core and exhibited a higher site specificity for targeting DNA sites located close to the core region. Intercalation of peplomycin in the nucleosomal core region was highly suppressed, but reaction sites located at the ends of the nucleosomal core remained accessible, which implied flexibility of the core DNA end. Duocarmycin B2 was able to enter and react in the core region, although its alkylating efficiency decreased significantly.	0
Title: Identification of the putative bryostatin polyketide synthase gene cluster from "Candidatus Endobugula sertula", the uncultivated microbial symbiont of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina Abstract: The bryostatins are protein kinase C modulators with unique structural features and potential anticancer and neurological activities. These complex polyketides were isolated from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina, but recent studies indicate that they are produced by the uncultured symbiotic bacterium "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" ("E. sertula"). Here we present the putative biosynthetic genes: five modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, a discrete acyltransferase, a beta-ketosynthase, a hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA synthase (HMG-CS), and a methyltransferase. The cluster was sequenced in two closely related "E. sertula" strains from different host species. In one strain the gene cluster is contiguous, while in the other strain it is split into two loci, with one locus containing the PKS genes and the other containing the accessory genes. Here, we propose a hypothesis for the biosynthesis of the bryostatins. Thirteen PKS modules form the core macrolactone ring, and the pendent methyl ester groups are added by the HMG-CS gene cassette. The resulting hypothetical compound bryostatin 0 is the common basis for the 20 known bryostatins. As "E. sertula" is to date uncultured, heterologous expression of this biosynthetic gene cluster has the potential of producing the bioactive bryostatins in large enough quantities for development into a pharmaceutical.	1
Title: Functional Analysis of a Novel β-(1,3)-Glucanase from Corallococcus sp. Strain EGB Containing a Fascin-Like Module Abstract: A novel β-(1,3)-glucanase gene designated lamC, cloned from Corallococcus sp. strain EGB, contains a fascin-like module and a glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) catalytic module. LamC displays broad hydrolytic activity toward various polysaccharides. Analysis of the hydrolytic products revealed that LamC is an exo-acting enzyme on β-(1,3)(1,3)- and β-(1,6)-linked glucan substrates and an endo-acting enzyme on β-(1,4)-linked glucan and xylan substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved catalytic Glu residues (E304A and E309A) demonstrated that these activities were derived from the same active site. Excision of the fascin-like module resulted in decreased activity toward β-(1,3)(1,3)-linked glucans. The carbohydrate-binding assay showed that the fascin-like module was a novel β-(1,3)-linked glucan-binding module. The functional characterization of the fascin-like module and catalytic module will help us better understand these enzymes and modules.IMPORTANCE In this report of a bacterial β-(1,3)(1,3)-glucanase containing a fascin-like module, we reveal the β-(1,3)(1,3)-glucan-binding function of the fascin-like module present in the N terminus of LamC. LamC displays exo-β-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucanase and endo-β-(1,4)-glucanase/xylanase activities with a single catalytic domain. Thus, LamC was identified as a novel member of the GH16 family.	0
Title: Oxidation-induced conformational changes in calcineurin determined by covalent labeling and tandem mass spectrometry Abstract: The Ca(2+)/calmodulin activated phosphatase, calcineurin, is inactivated by H2O2 or superoxide-induced oxidation, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the potential for global and/or local conformation changes occurring within calcineurin as a function of oxidative modification, that may play a role in the inactivation process, has not been examined. Here, the susceptibility of calcineurin methionine residues toward H2O2-induced oxidation were determined using a multienzyme digestion strategy coupled with capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Then, regions within the protein complex that underwent significant conformational perturbation upon oxidative modification were identified by monitoring changes in the modification rates of accessible lysine residues between native and oxidized forms of calcineurin, using an amine-specific covalent labeling reagent, S,S'-dimethylthiobutanoylhydroxysuccinimide ester (DMBNHS), and tandem mass spectrometry. Importantly, methionine residues found to be highly susceptible toward oxidation, and the lysine residues exhibiting large increases in accessibility upon oxidation, were all located in calcineurin functional domains involved in Ca(2+)/CaM binding regulated calcineurin stimulation. These findings therefore provide initial support for the novel mechanistic hypothesis that oxidation-induced global and/or local conformational changes within calcineurin contribute to inactivation via (i) impairing the interaction between calcineurin A and calcineurin B, (ii) altering the low-affinity Ca(2+) binding site in calcineurin B, (iii) inhibiting calmodulin binding to calcineurin A, and/or (iv) by altering the affinity between the calcineurin A autoinhibitory domain and the catalytic center.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster from Sorangium cellulosum Abstract: The epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from Sorangium cellulosum strain SMP44. The gene cluster contains seven genes and spans approx. 56kb. The genes encoding the PKS, epoA, epoC, epoD, epoE, and epoF, are divided into nine modules. The EpoB protein is a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that catalyzes formation of the thiazole found in the epothilones. EpoK is a P450 enzyme responsible for the epoxidation of epothilones C and D to epothilones A and B, respectively. EpoK was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was shown to convert epothilone D to epothilone B in vitro.	1
Title: Polyphyly of the extinct family Oviparosiphidae and its implications for inferring aphid evolution (Hemiptera, Sternorrhyncha) Abstract: Aphidoidea, the so-called "true aphids" are one of the most challenging groups in terms of solving the phylogenetic relationships. Morphology-based analyses were strongly affected by widespread homoplasy, while the molecular-based attempts struggled with the lack of sufficient phylogenetic signal. Despite significant improvements, the higher classification still remains unresolved and rather controversial. However, the use of the fossil record, one of the most valuable sources of information, was mainly limited to calibration of a phylogenetic tree, without a direct inclusion into the analysis. The extinct family Oviparosiphidae has long been considered as the common ancestor of all recent Aphidoidea and it was used as a calibration point in several analyses, but it has been never analyzed in a phylogenetic context. The family has been treated as a monophyletic group purely based on the simultaneous presence of two abdominal structures, ovipositor and siphunculi. However, it has been shown recently that at least one more extinct lineage, present at the same time, was characterized by the same features. For these reasons, we performed a maximum parsimony analysis using morphological data for extinct aphid taxa to prove the monophyly of Oviparosiphidae. Our analysis shows that the presumed ancestor lineage of recent aphids is a polyphyletic group. Our results support the hypothesis of an early Mesozoic rapid radiation of aphids, which led to several different lineages characterized by both ovipositor and siphunculi. The results indicate the necessity of examining the other extinct families, and shows that the diversity of aphids before the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR) was higher than expected. Even though there is not enough data to perform a formal analysis, fossils seem to suggest a significant impact of the KTR on aphid diversification. Additionally, we have made a redescription of two genera and description of a new species, Vitimaphis subridens sp. nov.	0
Title: Characterization and heterologous expression of the neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces koyangensis SCSIO 5802 Abstract: Background:                       The deep-sea-derived microbe Streptomyces koyangensis SCSIO 5802 produces neoabyssomicins A-B (1-2) and abyssomicins 2 (3) and 4 (4). Neoabyssomicin A (1) augments human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication whereas abyssomicin 2 (3) selectively reactivates latent HIV and is also active against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Structurally, neoabyssomicins A-B constitute a new subtype within the abyssomicin family and feature unique structural traits characteristic of extremely interesting biosynthetic transformations.                  Results:                       In this work, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the neoabyssomicins and abyssomicins, composed of 28 opening reading frames, was identified in S. koyangensis SCSIO 5802, and its role in neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthesis was confirmed via gene inactivation and heterologous expression experiments. Bioinformatics and genomics analyses enabled us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthesis. Similarly, a protective export system by which both types of compounds are secreted from the S. koyangensis producer was identified, as was a four-component ABC transporter-based import system central to neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthesis. Furthermore, two regulatory genes, abmI and abmH, were unambiguously shown to be positive regulators of neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthesis. Consistent with their roles as positive regulatory genes, the overexpression of abmI and abmH (independent of each other) was shown to improve neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin titers.                  Conclusions:                       These studies provide new insight into the biosynthesis of the abyssomicin class of natural products, and highlight important exploitable features of its BGC for future efforts. Elucidation of the neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin BGC now enables combinatorial biosynthetic initiatives aimed at improving both the titers and pharmaceutical properties of these important natural products-based drug leads.	1
Title: Characterization of CYP76AH4 clarifies phenolic diterpenoid biosynthesis in the Lamiaceae Abstract: Miltiradiene (1) is the precursor of phenolic diterpenoids such as ferruginol (2), requiring aromatization and hydroxylation. While this has been attributed to a single cytochrome P450 (CYP76AH1), characterization of the rosemary ortholog CYP76AH4 led to the discovery that these CYPs simply hydroxylate the facilely oxidized aromatic intermediate abietatriene (3).	0
Title: Two new cellulosome components encoded downstream of celI in the genome of Clostridium thermocellum: the non-processive endoglucanase CelN and the possibly structural protein CseP Abstract: Clostridium thermocellum produces a great number of extracellular cellulases which are free or cellulosome-bound. The nucleotide sequence of a gene cluster containing the genes celI, celN and cseP was determined from C. thermocellum strain F7. Gene products Cel9I and Cel9N are structurally related enzymes having a glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c), but show characteristic differences: Cel9I is a non-cellulosomal protein with an additional CBM (CBM3b), whereas Cel9N contains a cellulosomal dockerin module and no additional CBM. Although Cel9I is a processive endoglucanase, Cel9N is non-processive. Both enzymes hydrolyse phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, but the products of hydrolysis are different. The CseP protein encoded in the gene cluster is the first component attached to the cellulosomal scaffoldin for which no catalytic activity could be detected. It was shown to be present in the cellulosome. Its sequence is homologous to the spore-coat assembly protein CotH of Bacillus subtilis, suggesting a structural role of CseP in the cellulosome.	0
Title: Characterization of the product of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene using the doxycycline dependent Tet-on system in Aspergillus terreus Abstract: Genome sequencing of the fungus Aspergillus terreus uncovered a number of silent core structural biosynthetic genes encoding enzymes presumed to be involved in the production of cryptic secondary metabolites. There are five nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like genes with the predicted A-T-TE domain architecture within the A. terreus genome. Among the five genes, only the product of pgnA remains unknown. The Tet-on system is an inducible, tunable and metabolism-independent expression system originally developed for Aspergillus niger. Here we report the adoption of the Tet-on system as an effective gene activation tool in A. terreus. Application of this system in A. terreus allowed us to uncover the product of the cryptic NRPS-like gene, pgnA. Furthermore expression of pgnA in the heterologous Aspergillus nidulans host suggested that the pgnA gene alone is necessary for phenguignardic acid (1) biosynthesis.	1
Title: High-resolution NMR analysis of the conformations of native and base analog substituted retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon PPT primers Abstract: A purine-rich region of the plus-strand RNA genome of retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons, known as the polypurine tract (PPT), is resistant to hydrolysis by the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT) and ultimately serves as a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. The mechanisms underlying PPT resistance and selective processing remain largely unknown. Here, two RNA/DNA hybrids derived from the PPTs of HIV-1 and Ty3 were probed using high-resolution NMR for preexisting structural distortions in the absence of RT. The PPTs were selectively modified through base-pair changes or by incorporation of the thymine isostere, 2,4-difluoro-5-methylbenzene (dF), into the DNA strand. Although both wild-type (WT) and mutated hybrids adopted global A-form-like helical geometries, observed structural perturbations in the base-pair and dF-modified hybrids suggested that the PPT hybrids may function as structurally coupled domains.	0
Title: Bioactive Antimicrobial Peptides: A New Weapon to Counteract Zoonosis Abstract: Zoonoses have recently become the center of attention of the general population and scientific community. Notably, more than 30 new human pathogens have been identified in the last 30 years, 75% of which can be classified as zoonosis. The complete eradication of such types of infections is far out of reach, considering the limited understanding of animal determinants in zoonoses and their causes of emergence. Therefore, efforts must be doubled in examining the spread, persistence, and pathogenicity of zoonosis and studying possible clinical interventions and antimicrobial drug development. The search for antimicrobial bioactive compounds has assumed great emphasis, considering the emergence of multi-drug-resistant microorganisms. Among the biomolecules of emerging scientific interest are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), potent biomolecules that can potentially act as important weapons against infectious diseases. Moreover, synthetic AMPs are easily tailored (bioinformatically) to target specific features of the pathogens to hijack, inducing no or very low resistance. Although very promising, previous studies on SAMPs' efficacy are still at their early stages. Indeed, further studies and better characterization on their mechanism of action with in vitro and in vivo assays are needed so as to proceed to their clinical application on human beings.	0
Title: Enzyme-Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia Abstract: Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density-dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone-containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome-guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S→N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme-primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.	1
Title: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. II. Kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus growing in a defined medium was determined. Under these conditions, M. xanthus contains one chromosome which is replicated during 80% of the cell cycle. Stable RNA synthesis was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radioactive uridine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of stable RNA synthesis as a function of cell size was determined. Unstable RNA synthesis during the division cycle was determined by correlating the data for stable RNA synthesis with the relative amounts of stable and unstable RNA labeled during the short pulse. The data reported here demonstrate that: (i) cells synthesize both stable and unstable RNA throughout the division cycle; (ii) the rate of stable RNA synthesis increases in two discrete steps, corresponding to average ages of 0.15 and 0.75 generations; (iii) the rate of unstable RNA synthesis exhibits an initial rise, followed by a relatively constant rate of synthesis, and finally, a burst of unstable RNA synthesis prior to septum formation. The half-life of unstable RNA of M. xanthus, generation time of 390 min at 30 C, was 4 min. Comparison of the rates of stable and unstable RNA synthesis indicates noncoordinate RNA synthesis within the normal division cycle.	0
Title: Structural and functional complexity of the genomic region controlling AK-toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in the Japanese pear pathotype of Alternaria alternata Abstract: The Japanese pear pathotype of Alternaria alternata produces host-specific AK-toxin and causes black spot of Japanese pear. Previously, a cosmid clone, pcAKT-1, was isolated that contains two genes, AKT1 and AKT2, within a 5.0-kb region required for AK-toxin biosynthesis. The wild-type strain has multiple, nonfunctional copies of these genes. In the present study, two additional genes, AKTR-1 and AKT3-1, downstream of AKT2 were identified. Transformation of the wild type with AKTR-1- and AKT3-1-targeting vectors produced toxin-deficient (Tox-), nonpathogenic mutants. DNA gel blot analysis, however, demonstrated that the fragments targeted in Tox- mutants were different from those containing AKTR-1 and AKT3-1 on the transforming vectors. A cosmid clone, pcAKT-2, containing the targeted DNA was isolated and shown to carry two genes, AKTR-2 and AKT3-2, with high similarity to AKTR-1 and AKT3-1, respectively. Transcripts from not only AKTR-2 and AKT3-2 but also AKTR-1 and AKT3-1 were found in the wild type. DNA gel blot analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and AKTR and their homologues are on a single chromosome. These results indicate the structural and functional complexity of the genomic region controlling AK-toxin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of a DNA element in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 (thi3) promoter involved in thiamine-regulated gene expression Abstract: To define DNA elements involved in thiamine-regulated transcription of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene nmt1 (thi3), we analyzed several nmt1 promoter constructs. We detected a DNA element which is required for promoter activation in the absence of thiamine. It is located 54 to 62 bp upstream of the TATA box and matches the consensus sequence of the binding site for the mammalian transcription factor C/EBP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein). We show that the element specifically binds proteins.	0
Title: One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans-Acting Enzyme-Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis Abstract: Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans-acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans-acting C-methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual-functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.	1
Title: Modulating Enzyme Catalysis through Mutations Designed to Alter Rapid Protein Dynamics Abstract: The relevance of sub-picosecond protein motions to the catalytic event remains a topic of debate. Heavy enzymes (isotopically substituted) provide an experimental tool for bond-vibrational links to enzyme catalysis. A recent transition path sampling study with heavy purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) characterized the experimentally observed mass-dependent slowing of barrier crossing (Antoniou, D.; Ge, X.; Schramm, V. L.; Schwartz, S. D. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 3538). Here we computationally identify second-sphere amino acid residues predicted to influence the freedom of the catalytic site vibrational modes linked to heavy enzyme effects in PNP. We mutated heavy and light PNPs to increase the catalytic site vibrational freedom. Enzymatic barrier-crossing rates were converted from mass-dependent to mass-independent as a result of the mutations. The mutagenic uncoupling of femtosecond motions between catalytic site groups and reactants decreased transition state barrier crossing by 2 orders of magnitude, an indication of the femtosecond dynamic contributions to catalysis.	0
Title: Significance of CO2 donor on the production of succinic acid by Actinobacillus succinogenes ATCC 55618 Abstract: Background:                       Succinic acid is a building-block chemical which could be used as the precursor of many industrial products. The dissolved CO2 concentration in the fermentation broth could strongly regulate the metabolic flux of carbon and the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, which are the important committed steps for the biosynthesis of succinic acid by Actinobacillus succinogenes. Previous reports showed that succinic acid production could be promoted by regulating the supply of CO2 donor in the fermentation broth. Therefore, the effects of dissolved CO2 concentration and MgCO3 on the fermentation process should be investigated. In this article, we studied the impacts of gaseous CO2 partial pressure, dissolved CO2 concentration, and the addition amount of MgCO3 on succinic acid production by Actinobacillus succinogenes ATCC 55618. We also demonstrated that gaseous CO2 could be removed when MgCO3 was fully supplied.                  Results:                       An effective CO2 quantitative mathematical model was developed to calculate the dissolved CO2 concentration in the fermentation broth. The highest succinic acid production of 61.92 g/L was obtained at 159.22 mM dissolved CO2 concentration, which was supplied by 40 g/L MgCO3 at the CO2 partial pressure of 101.33 kPa. When MgCO3 was used as the only CO2 donor, a maximal succinic acid production of 56.1 g/L was obtained, which was just decreased by 7.03% compared with that obtained under the supply of gaseous CO2 and MgCO3.                  Conclusions:                       Besides the high dissolved CO2 concentration, the excessive addition of MgCO3 was beneficial to promote the succinic acid synthesis. This was the first report investigating the replaceable of gaseous CO2 in the fermentation of succinic acid. The results obtained in this study may be useful for reducing the cost of succinic acid fermentation process.	0
Title: Solution structure of acidocin B, a circular bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46 Abstract: Acidocin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46, was originally reported to be a linear peptide composed of 59 amino acid residues. However, its high sequence similarity to gassericin A, a circular bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, suggested that acidocin B might be circular as well. Acidocin B was purified from culture supernatant by a series of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps. Its circular nature was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequencing. The peptide sequence was found to consist of 58 amino acids with a molecular mass of 5,621.5 Da. The sequence of the acidocin B biosynthetic gene cluster was also determined and showed high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of gassericin A. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of acidocin B in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was elucidated, revealing that it is composed of four α-helices of similar length that are folded to form a compact, globular bundle with a central pore. This is a three-dimensional structure for a member of subgroup II circular bacteriocins, which are classified based on their isoelectric points of ∼7 or lower. Comparison of acidocin B with carnocyclin A, a subgroup I circular bacteriocin with four α-helices and a pI of 10, revealed differences in the overall folding. The observed variations could be attributed to inherent diversity in their physical properties, which also required the use of different solvent systems for three-dimensional structural elucidation.	1
Title: Subtilosin production by two Bacillus subtilis subspecies and variance of the sbo-alb cluster Abstract: Eight different Bacillus subtilis strains and Bacillus atrophaeus were found to produce the bacteriocin subtilosin A. On the basis of the subtilosin gene (sbo) sequences two distinct classes of B. subtilis strains were distinguished, and they fell into the two B. subtilis subspecies (B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii). The entire sequence of the subtilosin gene cluster of a B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii strain, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, was determined. This sequence exhibited a high level of homology to the sequence of the sbo-alb gene locus of B. subtilis 168. By using primer extension analysis the transcriptional start sites of sbo in B. subtilis strains ATCC 6633 and 168 were found to be 47 and 45 bp upstream of the sbo start codon, respectively. Our results provide insight into the incipient evolutionary divergence of the two B. subtilis subspecies.	1
Title: Nosiheptide biosynthesis featuring a unique indole side ring formation on the characteristic thiopeptide framework Abstract: Nosiheptide (NOS), belonging to the e series of thiopeptide antibiotics that exhibit potent activity against various bacterial pathogens, bears a unique indole side ring system and regiospecific hydroxyl groups on the characteristic macrocyclic core. Here, cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the nos gene cluster from Streptomyces actuosus ATCC 25421 as a model for this series of thiopeptides has unveiled new insights into their biosynthesis. Bioinformatics-based sequence analysis and in vivo investigation into the gene functions show that NOS biosynthesis shares a common strategy with recently characterized b or c series thiopeptides for forming the characteristic macrocyclic core, which features a ribosomally synthesized precursor peptide with conserved posttranslational modifications. However, it apparently proceeds via a different route for tailoring the thiopeptide framework, allowing the final product to exhibit the distinct structural characteristics of e series thiopeptides, such as the indole side ring system. Chemical complementation supports the notion that the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent protein NosL may play a central role in converting tryptophan to the key 3-methylindole moiety by an unusual carbon side chain rearrangement, most likely via a radical-initiated mechanism. Characterization of the indole side ring-opened analogue of NOS from the nosN mutant strain is consistent with the proposed methyltransferase activity of its encoded protein, shedding light into the timing of the individual steps for indole side ring biosynthesis. These results also suggest the feasibility of engineering novel thiopeptides for drug discovery by manipulating the NOS biosynthetic machinery.	1
Title: Genetic organisation of the capsule biosynthetic locus of Pasteurella multocida M1404 (B:2) Abstract: Capsules from a range of bacterial species have been shown to be major virulence determinants and capsule has been implicated in virulence in Pasteurella multocida. Moreover, capsular serogroup appears to be related to disease predilection. Haemorrhagic septicaemia strains belong to serogroup B and E, fowl cholera strains to serogroup A and atrophic rhinitis strains to serogroup D. The entire capsule biosynthetic locus of P. multocida A:1 has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined (Chung et al., 1998. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 166, 289-296); however, nothing is known of the P. multocida B:2 capsule locus. In this work we have determined the nucleotide sequence and genetic organisation of the P. multocida M1404 (B:2) capsule locus. By analogy with the cap loci of other bacteria, the nucleotide sequence can be divided into three functional regions. Regions 1 and 3 comprise six genes involved in transport of the polysaccharide capsule to the cell surface. The deduced products of these genes show high similarity to proteins involved in capsule export in other bacteria. Region 2 comprises nine genes which are likely involved in biosynthesis of the polysaccharide capsule. The deduced products of three of these genes (bcbA, bcbB and bcbC) show significant similarity to proteins known to be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis while the other six show no similarity to known proteins. However, their organisation indicates they are co-transcribed with bcbA, bcbB, bcbC and the Region 1 capsule export genes, suggesting strongly that they are also involved in capsule biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genome-wide identification of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) aquaporin genes and their response to ethephon stimulation in the laticifer, a rubber-producing tissue Abstract: Background:                       Natural rubber, an important industrial raw material, is specifically synthesized in laticifers located inside the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) trunk. Due to the absence of plasmodesmata, the laticifer water balance is mediated by aquaporins (AQPs). However, to date, the characterization of H. brasiliensis AQPs (HbAQPs) is still in its infancy.                  Results:                       In this study, 51 full-length AQP genes were identified from the rubber tree genome. The phylogenetic analysis assigned these AQPs to five subfamilies, including 15 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), 17 tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), 9 NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), 4 small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and 6 X intrinsic proteins (XIPs). Functional prediction based on the analysis of the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter, Froger's positions and specificity-determining positions (SDPs) showed a remarkable difference in substrate specificity among subfamilies. Homology analysis supported the expression of 44 HbAQP genes in at least one of the examined tissues. Furthermore, deep sequencing of the laticifer transcriptome in the form of latex revealed a key role of several PIP subfamily members in the laticifer water balance, and qRT-PCR analysis showed diverse expression patterns of laticifer-expressed HbAQP genes upon ethephon treatment, a widely-used practice for the stimulation of latex yield.                  Conclusions:                       This study provides an important genetic resource of HbAQP genes, which will be useful to improve the water use efficiency and latex yield of Hevea.	0
Title: Cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster for naphthoxanthene antibiotic FD-594 from Streptomyces sp. TA-0256 Abstract: FD-594 is an unique pyrano[4',3':6,7]naphtho[1,2-b]xanthene polyketide with a trisaccharide of 2,6-dideoxysugars. In this study, we cloned the FD-594 biosynthetic gene cluster from the producer strain Streptomyces sp. TA-0256 to investigate its biosynthesis. The identified pnx gene cluster was 38143 bp, consisting of 40 open reading frames, including a minimal PKS gene, TDP-olivose biosynthetic genes, two glycosyltransferase genes, two methyltransferase genes and many oxygenase/reductase genes. Most of these enzymes coded in the pnx cluster were reasonably assigned to a plausible biosynthetic pathway for FD-594, in which an unique ring opening process via Baeyer-Villiger-type oxidation catalyzed by a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase, is speculated to lead to the unique xanthene structure. To clarify the involvement of pnx genes in the FD-594 biosynthesis, a glycosyltransferase, PnxGT2, and a methyltransferase, PnxMT2, were characterized enzymatically with the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. As a result, PnxGT2 catalyzed the triple olivose transfers to the FD-594 aglycon with TDP-olivose as the glycosyl donor to afford triolivoside. Surprisingly, in the PnxGT2 enzymatic reaction, tetraolivoside and pentaolivoside were significantly detected along with the expected triolivoside. To our knowledge, PnxGT2 is the first contiguous oligosaccharide-forming glycosyltransferase in secondary metabolism. Furthermore, addition of PnxMT2 and S-adenosyl-L-methionine into the PnxGT2 reaction mixture afforded natural FD-594 to confirm that the PnxGT2 reaction product was the expected regiospecifically glycosylated compound. Consequently, the identified pnx gene cluster appears to be involved in FD-594 biosynthesis.	1
Title: A Phototheranostic Strategy to Continuously Deliver Singlet Oxygen in the Dark and Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment Abstract: Continuous irradiation during photodynamic therapy (PDT) inevitably induces tumor hypoxia, thereby weakening the PDT effect. In PDT-induced hypoxia, providing singlet oxygen from stored chemical energy may enhance the cell-killing effect and boost the therapeutic effect. Herein, we present a phototheranostic (DPPTPE@PEG-Py NPs) prepared by using a 2-pyridone-based diblock polymer (PEG-Py) to encapsulate a semiconducting, heavy-atom-free pyrrolopyrrolidone-tetraphenylethylene (DPPTPE) with high singlet-oxygen-generation ability both in dichloromethane and water. The PEG-Py can trap the 1 O2 generated from DPPTPE under laser irradiation and form a stable intermediate of endoperoxide, which can then release 1 O2 in the dark, hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, fluorescence-imaging-guided phototherapy demonstrates that this phototheranostic could completely inhibit tumor growth with the help of laser irradiation.	0
Title: Metabolic diversification--independent assembly of operon-like gene clusters in different plants Abstract: Operons are clusters of unrelated genes with related functions that are a feature of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we report on an operon-like gene cluster in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that is required for triterpene synthesis (the thalianol pathway). The clustered genes are coexpressed, as in bacterial operons. However, despite the resemblance to a bacterial operon, this gene cluster has been assembled from plant genes by gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and genome reorganization, rather than by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Furthermore, recent assembly of operon-like gene clusters for triterpene synthesis has occurred independently in divergent plant lineages (Arabidopsis and oat). Thus, selection pressure may act during the formation of certain plant metabolic pathways to drive gene clustering.	1
Title: Widespread occurrence of an intranuclear bacterial parasite in vent and seep bathymodiolin mussels Abstract: Many parasitic bacteria live in the cytoplasm of multicellular animals, but only a few are known to regularly invade their nuclei. In this study, we describe the novel bacterial parasite "Candidatus Endonucleobacter bathymodioli" that invades the nuclei of deep-sea bathymodiolin mussels from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Bathymodiolin mussels are well known for their symbiotic associations with sulfur- and methane-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast, the parasitic bacteria of vent and seep animals have received little attention despite their potential importance for deep-sea ecosystems. We first discovered the intranuclear parasite "Ca. E. bathymodioli" in Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis from the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Using primers and probes specific to "Ca. E. bathymodioli" we found this intranuclear parasite in at least six other bathymodiolin species from vents and seeps around the world. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy analyses of the developmental cycle of "Ca. E. bathymodioli" showed that the infection of a nucleus begins with a single rod-shaped bacterium which grows to an unseptated filament of up to 20 microm length and then divides repeatedly until the nucleus is filled with up to 80,000 bacteria. The greatly swollen nucleus destroys its host cell and the bacteria are released after the nuclear membrane bursts. Intriguingly, the only nuclei that were never infected by "Ca. E. bathymodioli" were those of the gill bacteriocytes. These cells contain the symbiotic sulfur- and methane-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting that the mussel symbionts can protect their host nuclei against the parasite. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the "Ca. E. bathymodioli" belongs to a monophyletic clade of Gammaproteobacteria associated with marine metazoans as diverse as sponges, corals, bivalves, gastropods, echinoderms, ascidians and fish. We hypothesize that many of the sequences from this clade originated from intranuclear bacteria, and that these are widespread in marine invertebrates.	0
Title: Catalytic Synthesis of 1 H-2-Benzoxocins: Cobalt(III)-Carbene Radical Approach to 8-Membered Heterocyclic Enol Ethers Abstract: The metallo-radical activation of ortho-allylcarbonyl-aryl N-arylsulfonylhydrazones with the paramagnetic cobalt(II) porphyrin catalyst [CoII(TPP)] (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin) provides an efficient and powerful method for the synthesis of novel 8-membered heterocyclic enol ethers. The synthetic protocol is versatile and practical and enables the synthesis of a wide range of unique 1H-2-benzoxocins in high yields. The catalytic cyclization reactions proceed with excellent chemoselectivities, have a high functional group tolerance, and provide several opportunities for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. The reactions are shown to proceed via cobalt(III)-carbene radical intermediates, which are involved in intramolecular hydrogen transfer (HAT) from the allylic position to the carbene radical, followed by a near-barrierless radical rebound step in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The proposed mechanism is supported by experimental observations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and spin trapping experiments.	0
Title: Function of lanGT3, a glycosyltransferase gene involved in landomycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The glycosyltransferase gene lanGT3, involved in the biosynthesis of the angucyclic antibiotic landomycin A, has been characterised by targeted gene deletion. A lanGT3 mutant was shown to produce landomycin E, which consists of a trisaccharide side chain attached to the polyketide moiety. Expression of lanGT3 in the mutant restored landomycin A production. Our results indicate that LanGT3 is responsible for the transfer of the fourth sugar during landomycin A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genome sequence of Moraxella catarrhalis RH4, an isolate of seroresistant lineage Abstract: Here we report the annotated genome sequence of Moraxella catarrhalis strain RH4, a seroresistant-lineage strain isolated from the blood of an infected patient. This genome sequence will allow us to gain further insight into the genetic diversity of clinical M. catarrhalis isolates and will facilitate study of M. catarrhalis pathogenesis.	0
Title: Escherichia coli RNase II: characterization of the promoters involved in the transcription of rnb Abstract: The rnb gene encodes ribonuclease II (RNase II), one of the two major Escherichia coli exonucleases involved in mRNA degradation. In this paper, the rnb transcript is characterized regarding its promoter and terminator regions. The combined results from S1 nuclease protection analysis, DNase I footprinting and gene fusions with lacZ have shown that rnb is expressed from two promoters. S1 nuclease protection analysis and DNA footprinting have shown that rnb has two promoters, P1 and P2. Transcriptional and translational lacZ reporter fusions, constructed to the rnb gene, revealed that P2, the rnb proximal promoter, is stronger than P1. However, P2 is not transcribed in vitro, suggesting that an additional factor is required in vivo. The 3' end of the rnb transcript mapped to a stem-loop structure immediately after the translated region.	0
Title: Human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron synthesizes 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D- galacto-nononic acid (KDN) Abstract: The proper functioning of the human intestine is dependent on its bacterial symbionts, the most predominant of which belong to the Phylum Bacteroidetes. These bacteria are known to use variable displays of multiple capsular polysaccharides (CPs) to aid in their survival and foraging within the intestine. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent human gut symbiont and a remarkably versatile glycophile. The structure determination of the CPs, encoded by the eight CP loci, is the key to understanding the mechanism of this organism's adaptation on a molecular level. Herein, we report the bioinformatics-based discovery and chemical demonstration of a biosynthetic pathway that forms and cytidylates 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), most likely for inclusion in the CP encoded by B. thetaiotaomicron CP locus 7.	0
Title: NOVEL Escherichia coli dnaB mutant: direct involvement of the dnaB252 gene product in the synthesis of an origin-ribonucleic acid species during initiaion of a round of deoxyribonucleic acid replication Abstract: The initiation process of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication in Escherichia coli has been studied using the thermoreversible dna initiation mutant E. coli HfrHl65/120/6 dna-252. This dna mutation was incorrectly classed as a dnaA mutation. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the dna-252 mutant is a novel dnaB mutant, possessing phenotypic properties which distinguish it from other dnaB mutants. Sensitivity of reinitiation in the dna-252 mutant to specific inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and DNA synthesis was studied. Reinitiation is shown to be sensitive to rifampin and streptolydigin but not to cholramphenicol. Thus, the dna-252 gene product appears to be required during the initiation process for a step occurring either before or during synthesis of an RNA species (origin-RNA). Using reversible inhibition of RNA synthesis by streptolydigin of a streptolydigin-sensitive derivative of the dna-252 mutant, the dna-252 gene product is shown to be directly involved in the synthesis of an orgin-RNA species. These results are included in a schematic model presented in the accompanying paper of the temporal sequence of events occurring during the initiation process.	0
Title: Targeted Discovery of the Polyene Macrolide Hexacosalactone A from Streptomyces by Reporter-Guided Selection of Fermentation Media Abstract: New approaches are still needed to fully explore the biosynthetic potential of microbes. We recently devised a melC reporter-guided fermentation media screening approach for targeted activation of cryptic gene clusters. Using this approach, we successfully activated the expression of the hcl gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. LZ35 and discovered a novel polyene macrolide hexacosalactone A (1).	1
Title: Isolation, synthesis, and biological activity of aphrocallistin, an adenine-substituted bromotyramine metabolite from the Hexactinellida sponge Aphrocallistes beatrix Abstract: A new adenine-substituted bromotyrosine-derived metabolite designated as aphrocallistin (1) has been isolated from the deep-water Hexactinellida sponge Aphrocallistes beatrix. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data and confirmed through a convergent, modular total synthetic route that is amenable toward future analogue preparation. Aphrocallistin inhibits the growth of a panel of human tumor cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 7.5 to >100 microM and has been shown to induce G1 cell cycle arrest in the PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cell line. Aphrocallistin has been fully characterized in the NCI cancer cell line panel and has undergone in vitro ADME pharmacological profiling.	0
Title: An Unusual Extender Unit Is Incorporated into the Modular Polyketide Synthase of Scopranones Biosynthesis Abstract: Scopranones, produced by Streptomyces sp. BYK-11038, are the novel bone morphogenetic protein inhibitors characterized by atypical two scoop-like moieties and a 3-furanone moiety. Two scoop-like moieties connected to a 3-furanone have not previously been reported in natural products, and their biosynthesis must occur via a unique pathway. Feeding experiments using 13C-labeled precursors indicated that scopranones were synthesized from three acetates and three butyrates in polyketide-type biosynthesis. Genome mining of Streptomyces sp. BYK-11038 revealed that the candidate biosynthetic gene cluster contains 21 open reading frames (ORFs), including three modular polyketide synthases (PKSs; SprA, SprB, and SprC), which were composed of 4 modules with one loading module and 18 additional ORFs (SprD to SprU) spanning a distance of 55 kbp. The characterization of in-frame deletion mutants and feeding experiments with the predicted extender units indicated that two genes, sprP and sprR, encoding discrete 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthases, and a gene, sprO, encoding crotonyl-CoA reductase, were involved in assembling an unusual C8 branched extender unit, 2-(2-ethylbutyl)malonyl-CoA. Additionally, three ORFs, sprM, sprN, and sprT, encoding cytochrome P450s and a monooxygenase, are important tailoring enzymes in post-PKS modification. SprT is an essential enzyme for decarboxylative ring contraction via oxidation, which converts the 2-pyranone to a 3-furanone.	1
Title: Nucleoid condensation and cell division in Escherichia coli MX74T2 ts52 after inhibition of protein synthesis Abstract: The reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid of an Escherichia coli mutant, MX74T2 ts52, was studied by electron microscopy after protein synthesis inhibition by using whole mounts of cell ghosts, ultrathin-sectioning, and freeze-etching. The bacterial nucleoid showed two morphological changes after chloramphenicol addition: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) localization and DNA condensation. DNA localization was observed 10 min after chloramphenicol addition; the DNA appeared as a compact, solid mass. DNA condensation was observed at 25 min; the nucleoid appeared as a cytoplasm-filled sphere, often opened at one end. Ribosomes were observed in the center. Giant nucleoids present in some mutant filaments showed fused, spherical nucleoids arranged linearly, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the nucleoid reflects the number of replicated genomes. Inhibitors which directly or indirectly blocked protein synthesis and caused DNA condensation were chloramphenicol, puromycin, amino acid starvation, rifampicin, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. All inhibitors that caused cell division in the mutant also caused condensation, although some inhibitors caused condensation without cell division. Nucleoid condensation appears to be related to chromosome structure rather than to DNA segregation upon cell division.	0
Title: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae does not require urease activity to produce acute swine pleuropneumonia Abstract: The role in virulence of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae urease activity was investigated. A urease-negative mutant was isolated following transposon mutagenesis with a mini-Tn10 derivative. Both the parent strain and the urease-negative mutant exhibited identical LD50 values in a murine infection model. Pig challenge confirmed that the urease-negative mutant was fully virulent, since experimental inoculation with 5 x 10(7) colony forming units resulted in an acute disease indistinguishable from that produced by the wild-type strain at the same dose. Our results demonstrate that urease activity is not required for the development of acute pleuropneumonia.	0
Title: Collaborative Biosynthesis of Maleimide- and Succinimide-Containing Natural Products by Fungal Polyketide Megasynthases Abstract: Fungal polyketide synthases (PKSs) can function collaboratively to synthesize natural products of significant structural diversity. Here we present a new mode of collaboration between a highly reducing PKS (HRPKS) and a PKS-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) in the synthesis of oxaleimides from the Penicillium species. The HRPKS is recruited in the synthesis of an olefin-containing free amino acid, which is activated and incorporated by the adenylation domain of the PKS-NRPS. The precisely positioned olefin from the unnatural amino acid is proposed to facilitate a scaffold rearrangement of the PKS-NRPS product to forge the maleimide and succinimide cores of oxaleimides.	1
Title: A simple strategy for glycosyltransferase-catalyzed aminosugar nucleotide synthesis Abstract: A set of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl glucosamino-/xylosaminosides were synthesized and assessed as potential substrates in the context of glycosyltransferase-catalyzed formation of the corresponding UDP/TDP-α-D-glucosamino-/xylosaminosugars and in single-vessel model transglycosylation reactions. This study highlights a robust platform for aminosugar nucleotide synthesis and reveals OleD Loki to be a proficient catalyst for U/TDP-aminosugar synthesis and utilization	0
Title: Uberolysin: a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus uberis Abstract: Streptococcus uberis is commonly found in the environment and in association with various bovine body sites and is a major cause of bovine mastitis. Moreover, S. uberis is known to produce a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, antimicrobial agents that generally inhibit closely related bacterial species. In this respect, S. uberis strain 42 has previously been shown to produce a novel nisin variant named nisin U. This paper reports that, in addition to nisin U, S. uberis strain 42 produces a second bacteriocin that induces the lysis of metabolically active, susceptible target bacteria and which has therefore been named uberolysin. Isolation of the native active antimicrobial agent revealed that uberolysin is a 7048 Da peptide that is refractory to sequence analysis by Edman degradation. Transposon mutagenesis was used to generate a uberolysin-negative mutant of S. uberis 42 and sequencing of DNA flanking the insertion site revealed, in addition to the structural gene (ublA), several open reading frames likely to be involved in post-translational modification, transport and producer self-protection (immunity), and possibly in regulation of the biosynthetic gene cluster. In addition, a pair of direct repeats that may be involved in bacteriocin acquisition were identified; indeed, ublA could be identified in 18 % of tested S. uberis strains. Enzymic hydrolysis of uberolysin was used to confirm that ublA does indeed encode the precursor of uberolysin, that an unusually short leader sequence of only six amino acids is cleaved during processing of the mature peptide and that uberolysin is post-translationally covalently modified to form a head-to-tail monocycle. Thus, uberolysin is a unique cyclic bacteriocin, belonging to the same family of bacteriocins as enterocin AS-48 and circularin A.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of phosphonoglycans from Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338 Abstract: Two related actinomycetes, Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338, were identified as potential phosphonic acid producers by screening for the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) mutase, which is required for the biosynthesis of most phosphonates. Using a variety of analytical techniques, both strains were subsequently shown to produce phosphonate-containing exopolysaccharides (EPS), also known as phosphonoglycans. The phosphonoglycans were purified by sequential organic solvent extractions, methanol precipitation, and ultrafiltration. The EPS from the Glycomyces strain has a mass of 40 to 50 kDa and is composed of galactose, xylose, and five distinct partially O-methylated galactose residues. Per-deutero-methylation analysis indicated that galactosyl residues in the polysaccharide backbone are 3,4-linked Gal, 2,4-linked 3-MeGal, 2,3-linked Gal, 3,6-linked 2-MeGal, and 4,6-linked 2,3-diMeGal. The EPS from the Stackebrandtia strain is comprised of glucose, galactose, xylose, and four partially O-methylated galactose residues. Isotopic labeling indicated that the O-methyl groups in the Stackebrandtia phosphonoglycan arise from S-adenosylmethionine. The phosphonate moiety in both phosphonoglycans was shown to be 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (2-HEP) by (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry following strong acid hydrolysis of the purified molecules. Partial acid hydrolysis of the purified EPS from Glycomyces yielded 2-HEP in ester linkage to the O-5 or O-6 position of a hexose and a 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Partial acid hydrolysis of Stackebrandtia EPS also revealed the presence of 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Examination of the genome sequences of the two strains revealed similar pepM-containing gene clusters that are likely to be required for phosphonoglycan synthesis.	1
Title: Enzyme-Dependent [4 + 2] Cycloaddition Depends on Lid-like Interaction of the N-Terminal Sequence with the Catalytic Core in PyrI4 Abstract: The Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is one of the most powerful and elegant organic synthesis methods for forming 6-membered molecules and has been known for nearly a century. However, whether and how enzymes catalyze this type of reaction is still not completely clear. Here we focus on PyrI4, an enzyme found in the biosynthetic pathway of pyrroindomycins where it catalyzes the formation of a spiro-conjugate via an enzyme-dependent exo-selective [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. We report the crystal structures of PyrI4 alone and in complex with its product. Comparative analysis of these structures, combined with biochemical analysis, lead us to propose a unique trapping mechanism whereby the lid-like action of the N-terminal tail imposes conformational constraints on the β barrel catalytic core, which enhances the proximity and polarization effects of reactive groups (1,3-diene and alkene) to drive cyclization in a regio- and stereo-specific manner. This work represents an important step toward the wider application of enzyme-catalyzed [4 + 2] cyclization for synthetic purposes.	0
Title: DNA sequence and mutational analysis of genes involved in the production and resistance of the antibiotic peptide trifolitoxin Abstract: The 7.1-kb fragment of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii T24 DNA which confers trifolitoxin production and resistance to nonproducing, sensitive Rhizobium strains (E. W. Triplett, M. J. Schink, and K. L. Noeldner, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2:202-208, 1989) was subcloned, sequenced, and mutagenized with a transcriptional fusion cassette. The sequence of this fragment revealed seven complete open reading frames, tfxABCDEFG, all transcribed in the same direction. TfxA has an 11-amino-acid carboxy terminus identical to the known amino acid sequence of the trifolitoxin backbone, DIGGSRXGCVA, where X is an UV-absorbing chromophore. This is evidence that trifolitoxin is synthesized ribosomally as a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified to yield the active peptide. TfxB shows 27.6% identity with McbC, a protein required for the production of the ribosomally synthesized antibiotic microcin B17. Tn3GUS transcriptional fusion insertions in tfxA, tfxB, tfxD, or tfxF caused a nonproducing, trifolitoxin-resistant phenotype and confirmed the direction of transcription of these frames. No insertion mutations were found in tfxE or tfxG. Sequence analysis along with insertion and deletion mutation analysis suggest that (i) trifolitoxin is synthesized ribosomally from tfxA; (ii) tfxA, tfxE, and tfxG have their own promoters; (iii) TfxG is required for immunity; (iv) TfxB, TfxD, and TfxF are required for trifolitoxin production; and (v) the UV-absorbing chromophore is derived from glutamine.	1
Title: SPC-P1: a pathogenicity-associated prophage of Salmonella paratyphi C Abstract: Background:                       Salmonella paratyphi C is one of the few human-adapted pathogens along with S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B that cause typhoid, but it is not clear whether these bacteria cause the disease by the same or different pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, these typhoid agents have distinct sets of large genomic insertions, which may encode different pathogenicity factors. Previously we identified a novel prophage, SPC-P1, in S. paratyphi C RKS4594 and wondered whether it might be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria.                  Results:                       We analyzed the sequence of SPC-P1 and found that it is an inducible phage with an overall G+C content of 47.24%, similar to that of most Salmonella phages such as P22 and ST64T but significantly lower than the 52.16% average of the RKS4594 chromosome. Electron microscopy showed short-tailed phage particles very similar to the lambdoid phage CUS-3. To evaluate its roles in pathogenicity, we lysogenized S. paratyphi C strain CN13/87, which did not have this prophage, and infected mice with the lysogenized CN13/87. Compared to the phage-free wild type CN13/87, the lysogenized CN13/87 exhibited significantly increased virulence and caused multi-organ damages in mice at considerably lower infection doses.                  Conclusions:                       SPC-P1 contributes pathogenicity to S. paratyphi C in animal infection models, so it is possible that this prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans. Genetic and functional analyses of SPC-P1 may facilitate the study of pathogenic evolution of the extant typhoid agents, providing particular help in elucidating the pathogenic determinants of the typhoid agents.	0
Title: Amino acid sequence of a variant pro-form of insulin-like growth factor II Abstract: Human serum contains, in addition to the "classical" 7.5-kDa insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II, small amounts of larger IGF-II. A 10-kDa IGF-II was isolated by gel filtration, immunoaffinity chromatography, and reversed-phase HPLC. Upon amino acid sequence determination, a substitution of Cys-Gly-Asp for Ser-33 was found as well as a COOH-terminal extension of 21 residues (E peptide). These sequence differences suggest that 10-kDa IGF-II is a precursor of a variant IGF-II. Since the substitution is not located at a known intron/exon hinge region, the finding of this variant IGF-II is evidence for the presence of more than one gene for IGF-II.	0
Title: Daptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces roseosporus: cloning and analysis of the gene cluster and revision of peptide stereochemistry Abstract: Daptomycin is a 13 amino acid, cyclic lipopeptide produced by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanism in Streptomyces roseosporus. A 128 kb region of S. roseosporus DNA was cloned and verified by heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans to contain the daptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (dpt). The cloned region was completely sequenced and three genes (dptA, dptBC, dptD) encoding the three subunits of an NRPS were identified. The catalytic domains in the subunits, predicted to couple five, six or two amino acids, respectively, included a novel activation domain and amino-acid-binding pocket for incorporating the unusual amino acid l-kynurenine (Kyn), three types of condensation domains and an extra epimerase domain (E-domain) in the second module. Novel genes (dptE, dptF) whose products likely work in conjunction with a unique condensation domain to acylate the first amino acid, as well as other genes (dptI, dptJ) probably involved in supply of the non-proteinogenic amino acids l-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn, were located next to the NRPS genes. The unexpected E-domain suggested that daptomycin would have d-Asn, rather than l-Asn, as originally assigned, and this was confirmed by comparing stereospecific synthetic peptides and the natural product both chemically and microbiologically.	1
Title: Cloning and sequencing of the kedarcidin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus sp. ATCC 53650 revealing new insights into biosynthesis of the enediyne family of antitumor antibiotics Abstract: Enediyne natural product biosynthesis is characterized by a convergence of multiple pathways, generating unique peripheral moieties that are appended onto the distinctive enediyne core. Kedarcidin (KED) possesses two unique peripheral moieties, a (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and an iso-propoxy-bearing 2-naphthonate moiety, as well as two deoxysugars. The appendage pattern of these peripheral moieties to the enediyne core in KED differs from the other enediynes studied to date with respect to stereochemical configuration. To investigate the biosynthesis of these moieties and expand our understanding of enediyne core formation, the biosynthetic gene cluster for KED was cloned from Streptoalloteichus sp. ATCC 53650 and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis of the ked cluster revealed the presence of the conserved genes encoding for enediyne core biosynthesis, type I and type II polyketide synthase loci likely responsible for 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthonate formation, and enzymes known for deoxysugar biosynthesis. Genes homologous to those responsible for the biosynthesis, activation, and coupling of the l-tyrosine-derived moieties from C-1027 and maduropeptin and of the naphthonate moiety from neocarzinostatin are present in the ked cluster, supporting 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid as precursors, respectively, for the (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and the 2-naphthonate moieties in KED biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery and in vitro biosynthesis of haloduracin, a two-component lantibiotic Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptides that undergo posttranslational modifications to their mature, antimicrobial form. They are characterized by the unique amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, introduced by means of dehydration of Ser/Thr residues followed by reaction of the resulting dehydro amino acids with cysteines to form thioether linkages. Two-component lantibiotics use two peptides that are each posttranslationally modified to yield two functionally distinct products that act in synergy to provide bactericidal activity. By using genetic data instead of isolation, a two-component lantibiotic, haloduracin, was identified in the genome of the Gram-positive alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans C-125. We show that heterologously expressed and purified precursor peptides HalA1 and HalA2 are processed by the purified modification enzymes HalM1 and HalM2 in an in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of a two-component lantibiotic. The activity of each HalM enzyme is substrate-specific, and the assay products exhibit antimicrobial activity after removal of their leader sequences at an engineered Factor Xa cleavage site, indicating that correct thioether formation has occurred. Haloduracin's biological activity depends on the presence of both modified peptides. The structures of the two mature haloduracin peptides Halalpha and Halbeta were investigated, indicating that they have similarities as well as some distinct differences compared with other two-component lantibiotics.	1
Title: Cladospolide D, a new 12-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Cladosporium sp. FT-0012 Abstract: A new antibiotic termed cladospolide D was isolated along with the known cladospolides A and B from the fermentation broth of Cladosporium sp. FT-0012 by solvent extraction, ODS column chromatography and preparative HPLC. The structure of cladospolide D was deduced to be (E)-2-dodecen-5-hydroxy-11-olide-4-one. Cladospolide D showed antifungal activity against Pyricularia oryzae and Mucor racemosus.	0
Title: Determining α-helical and β-sheet secondary structures via pulsed electron spin resonance spectroscopy Abstract: A new method has been developed to determine α-helical and β-sheet secondary structural components of aqueous and membrane-bound proteins using pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The three-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) technique was used to detect weakly coupled (2)H-labeled nuclei on side chains in the proximity of a strategically placed nitroxide spin-label up to 8 Å away. Changes in the ESEEM spectra for different samples correlate directly to periodic structural differences between α-helical and β-sheet motifs. These distinct trends were demonstrated with α-helical (M2δ subunit of the acetylcholine receptor) and β-sheet (ubiquitin) peptides in biologically relevant sample environments.	0
Title: The human alpha 2 integrin gene promoter. Identification of positive and negative regulatory elements important for cell-type and developmentally restricted gene expression Abstract: The alpha 2 beta 1 serves as a collagen receptor or a collagen/laminin receptor, depending upon cell type. Expression of the integrin is regulated during normal cellular differentiation and is altered during carcinogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that increased expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin during megakaryocytic differentiation is a consequence of increased alpha 2 mRNA due to transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 integrin gene and that the decreased expression of the integrin in breast adenocarcinoma is due to decreased steady-state levels of alpha 2 mRNA. We now report the identification and characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the alpha 2 integrin gene. The 5'-untranslated region of the alpha 2 mRNA extends 129 base pairs 5' to the site of translation initiation. The promoter region lacks TATA and CAAT boxes but contains an abbreviated initiator sequence and six Sp1 binding sites. Consensus binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 complexes, a GATA box, a Pu.1 box, and two palindromic motifs with potential to bind the estrogen receptor are also present. A 961-base pair fragment of the 5'-flanking region directs both cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of a reporter gene in T47-D epithelial cells and in pluripotent hematopoietic K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation.	0
Title: Structural insight into the mechanism of substrate specificity and catalytic activity of an HD-domain phosphohydrolase: the 5'-deoxyribonucleotidase YfbR from Escherichia coli Abstract: HD-domain phosphohydrolases have nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase activities and play important roles in the metabolism of nucleotides and in signaling. We present three 2.1-A-resolution crystal structures (one in the free state and two complexed with natural substrates) of an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, the Escherichia coli 5'-nucleotidase YfbR. The free-state structure of YfbR contains a large cavity accommodating the metal-coordinating HD motif (H33, H68, D69, and D137) and other conserved residues (R18, E72, and D77). Alanine scanning mutagenesis confirms that these residues are important for activity. Two structures of the catalytically inactive mutant E72A complexed with Co(2+) and either thymidine-5'-monophosphate or 2'-deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate disclose the novel binding mode of deoxyribonucleotides in the active site. Residue R18 stabilizes the phosphate on the Co(2+), and residue D77 forms a strong hydrogen bond critical for binding the ribose. The indole side chain of W19 is located close to the 2'-carbon atom of the deoxyribose moiety and is proposed to act as the selectivity switch for deoxyribonucleotide, which is supported by comparison to YfdR, another 5'-nucleotidase in E. coli. The nucleotide bases of both deoxyriboadenosine-5'-monophosphate and thymidine-5'-monophosphate make no specific hydrogen bonds with the protein, explaining the lack of nucleotide base selectivity. The YfbR E72A substrate complex structures also suggest a plausible single-step nucleophilic substitution mechanism. This is the first proposed molecular mechanism for an HD-domain phosphohydrolase based directly on substrate-bound crystal structures.	0
Title: Production of eight different hydride complexes and nitrite release from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Yarrowia lipolytica Abstract: 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) transformation by the yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15 was shown to occur via two different pathways. Direct aromatic ring reduction was the predominant mechanism of TNT transformation, while nitro group reduction was observed to be a minor pathway. Although growth of Y. lipolytica AN-L15 was inhibited initially in the presence of TNT, TNT transformation was observed, indicating that the enzymes necessary for TNT reduction were present initially. Aromatic ring reduction resulted in the transient accumulation of eight different TNT-hydride complexes, which were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography, UV-visible diode array detection, and negative-mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). APCI-MS analysis revealed three different groups of TNT-hydride complexes with molecular ions at m/z 227, 228, and 230, which correspond to TNT-mono- and dihydride complexes and protonated dihydride isomers, respectively. One of the three protonated dihydride complex isomers detected appears to release nitrite in the presence of strain AN-L15. This release of nitrite is of particular interest since it can provide a pathway towards complete degradation and detoxification of TNT.	0
Title: Deciphering the rhizosphere microbiome for disease-suppressive bacteria Abstract: Disease-suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil-borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms. For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the γ-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Our data indicate that upon attack by a fungal root pathogen, plants can exploit microbial consortia from soil for protection against infections.	1
Title: Comparative Investigation into Formycin A and Pyrazofurin A Biosynthesis Reveals Branch Pathways for the Construction of C-Nucleoside Scaffolds Abstract: Formycin A (FOR-A) and pyrazofurin A (PRF-A) are purine-related C-nucleoside antibiotics in which ribose and a pyrazole-derived base are linked by a C-glycosidic bond. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of these molecules has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of the pathways for FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis from diverse actinobacteria and propose that their biosynthesis is likely initiated by a lysine N6-monooxygenase. Moreover, we show that forT and prfT (involved in FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis, respectively) mutants are correspondingly capable of accumulating the unexpected pyrazole-related intermediates 4-amino-3,5-dicarboxypyrazole and 3,5-dicarboxy-4-oxo-4,5-dihydropyrazole. We also decipher the enzymatic mechanism of ForT/PrfT for C-glycosidic bond formation in FOR-A/PRF-A biosynthesis. To our knowledge, ForT/PrfT represents an example of β-RFA-P (β-ribofuranosyl-aminobenzene 5'-phosphate) synthase-like enzymes governing C-nucleoside scaffold construction in natural product biosynthesis. These data establish a foundation for combinatorial biosynthesis of related purine nucleoside antibiotics and also open the way for target-directed genome mining of PRF-A/FOR-A-related antibiotics.IMPORTANCE FOR-A and PRF-A are C-nucleoside antibiotics known for their unusual chemical structures and remarkable biological activities. Deciphering the enzymatic mechanism for the construction of a C-nucleoside scaffold during FOR-A/PRF-A biosynthesis will not only expand the biochemical repertoire for novel enzymatic reactions but also permit target-oriented genome mining of FOR-A/PRF-A-related C-nucleoside antibiotics. Moreover, the availability of FOR-A/PRF-A biosynthetic gene clusters will pave the way for the rational generation of designer FOR-A/PRF-A derivatives with enhanced/selective bioactivity via synthetic biology strategies.	1
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster identification and biological activity of lucilactaene from Fusarium sp. RK97-94 Abstract: We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for lucilactaene, a cell cycle inhibitor from a filamentous fungus Fusarium sp. RK 97-94. The luc1 knockout strain accumulated demethylated analogs, indicating the involvement of Luc1 methyltransferase in lucilactaene biosynthesis. Lucilactaene showed potent antimalarial activity. Our data suggested that methylation and ether ring formation are essential for its potent antimalarial activity.	1
Title: Non-canonical Bromodomain within DNA-PKcs Promotes DNA Damage Response and Radioresistance through Recognizing an IR-Induced Acetyl-Lysine on H2AX Abstract: Regulatory mechanisms underlying γH2AX induction and the associated cell fate decision during DNA damage response (DDR) remain obscure. Here, we discover a bromodomain (BRD)-like module in DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-BRD) that specifically recognizes H2AX acetyl-lysine 5 (K5ac) for sequential induction of γH2AX and concurrent cell fate decision(s). First, top-down mass spectrometry of radiation-phenotypic, full-length H2AX revealed a radiation-inducible, K5ac-dependent induction of γH2AX. Combined approaches of sequence-structure modeling/docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical experiments illustrated that through docking on H2AX K5ac, this non-canonical BRD determines not only the H2AX-targeting activity of DNA-PKcs but also the over-activation of DNA-PKcs in radioresistant tumor cells, whereas a Kac antagonist, JQ1, was able to bind to DNA-PKcs-BRD, leading to re-sensitization of tumor cells to radiation. This study elucidates the mechanism underlying the H2AX-dependent regulation of DNA-PKcs in ionizing radiation-induced, differential DDR, and derives an unconventional, non-catalytic domain target in DNA-PKs for overcoming resistance during cancer radiotherapy.	0
Title: Notch-modifying xylosyltransferase structures support an SNi-like retaining mechanism Abstract: A major question remaining in glycobiology is how a glycosyltransferase (GT) that retains the anomeric linkage of a sugar catalyzes the reaction. Xyloside α-1,3-xylosyltransferase (XXYLT1) is a retaining GT that regulates Notch receptor activation by adding xylose to the Notch extracellular domain. Here, using natural acceptor and donor substrates and active Mus musculus XXYLT1, we report a series of crystallographic snapshots along the reaction, including an unprecedented natural and competent Michaelis reaction complex for retaining enzymes. These structures strongly support the SNi-like reaction as the retaining mechanism for XXYLT1. Unexpectedly, the epidermal growth factor-like repeat acceptor substrate undergoes a large conformational change upon binding to the active site, providing a structural basis for substrate specificity. Our improved understanding of this retaining enzyme will accelerate the design of retaining GT inhibitors that can modulate Notch activity in pathological situations in which Notch dysregulation is known to cause cancer or developmental disorders.	0
Title: The active conformation of avilamycin A is conferred by AviX12, a radical AdoMet enzyme Abstract: The antibiotic avilamycin A is produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57. Avilamycin belongs to the family of orthosomycins with a linear heptasaccharide chain linked to a terminal dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. The gene cluster for avilamycin biosynthesis contains 54 open reading frames. Inactivation of one of these genes, namely aviX12, led to the formation of a novel avilamycin derivative named gavibamycin N1. The structure of the new metabolite was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR analysis. It harbors glucose as a component of the heptasaccharide chain instead of a mannose moiety in avilamycin A. Antibacterial activity tests against a spectrum of Gram-positive organisms showed that the new derivative possesses drastically decreased biological activity in comparison to avilamycin A. Thus, AviX12 seems to be implicated in converting avilamycin to its bioactive conformation by catalyzing an unusual epimerization reaction. Sequence comparisons grouped AviX12 in the radical S-adenosylmethionine protein family. AviX12 engineered with a His tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The iron sulfur cluster [Fe-S] present in radical AdoMet enzymes was detected in purified AviX12 by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.	1
Title: Active site modification of the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase FabF3 of Streptomyces coelicolor affects the fatty acid chain length of the CDA lipopeptides Abstract: Using site directed mutagenesis we altered an active site residue (Phe107) of the enzyme encoded by fabF3 (SCO3248) in the Streptomyces coelicolor gene cluster required for biosynthesis of the calcium dependent antibiotics (CDAs), successfully generating two novel CDA derivatives comprising truncated (C4) lipid side chains and confirming that fabF3 encodes a KAS-II homologue that is involved in determining CDA fatty acid chain length.	1
Title: Real-time analysis of very late antigen-4 affinity modulation by shear Abstract: Shear promotes endothelial recruitment of leukocytes, cell activation, and transmigration. Mechanical stress on cells caused by shear can induce a rapid integrin conformational change and activation, followed by an increase in binding to the extracellular matrix. The molecular mechanism of increased avidity is unknown. We have shown previously that the affinity of the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), measured with an LDV-containing small molecule, varies with cellular avidity, measured from cell disaggregation rates. In this study, we measured in real time affinity changes of VLA-4 in response to shear. The resulting affinity was comparable with the state mediated by receptor signaling and corresponded in time with intracellular Ca(2+) responses. Ca(2+) ionophores and N,N'-[1,2-ethanediyl-bis(oxy-2,1-phenylene)]bis[N-[2-[(acetyloxy)methoxy]-2-oxoethyl]]-, bis[(acetyloxy)methyl]ester demonstrate that the affinity regulation of VLA-4 in the presence of shear was related to Ca(2+) signaling. Pertussis toxin treatment implicates G(i) in an unknown pathway that connects shear, Ca(2+) elevation, VLA-4 affinity, and cell avidity.	0
Title: Transcriptome profiling reveals the roles of pigment formation mechanisms in yellow Paeonia delavayi flowers Abstract: The yellow colour of ornamental varieties of tree peony originated from Paeonia delavayi. However, but P. delavayi and Paeonia suffruticosa belong to different subgroups, so hybridization is difficult and results in a long breeding cycle. However, no comprehensive transcriptomic profiling has focused on the colour formation mechanisms of yellow tree peony petals. Analysing the colour formation mechanism of yellow petals in P. delavayi is very important for directional molecular breeding. In this study, the transcriptional map of yellow pigment development in petals was used to analyse the mechanism of petal colour formation. We analysed the genes related to the metabolism of flavonoids and carotenoids and the transcription factors (TFs) involved in P. delavayi var. lutea (pure yellow individual) yellow pigment development using transcriptome sequence profiling. Transcriptome sequence profiles revealed three and four differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis, respectively. An analysis of DETs in the flavonoid pathway showed that chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone 2´-glucosyltransferases (THC2'GT) act in synergy to synthesize isosalipurposide (ISP). CHS and flavonol synthase (FLS) synergistically synthesize quercetin and kaempferol. DEG analysis of the carotenoid pathway revealed that phytoene synthase (PSY), carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) and β-carotene hydroxylases (CHYB) play a key role in regulating lutein formation, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) plays an important role in the degradation of carotenoids. These two pathways may be regulated by TF families such as bHLH, ARF, and MYB. The results of the transient overexpression of genes showed that CHS and CHI are regulated by PdMYB2. In this study, the molecular mechanism of ISP synthesis was analysed in depth, and the complete metabolic pathway of carotenoids in Paeonia L. was reported for the first time. By studying the formation mechanism of yellow pigment in P. delavayi petals, a breeding strategy for improving flavonol and carotenoid contents and reducing anthocyanin synthesis by genetic engineering was suggested.	0
Title: Discovery, Biosynthesis, and Heterologous Production of Loonamycin, a Potent Anticancer Indolocarbazole Alkaloid Abstract: Genome mining of an indolocarbazole-type gene cluster from a marine-derived Nocardiopsis flavescens NA01583 strain led to the discovery of three new indolocarbazole alkaloids (1-3). Heterologous expression of the intact loo gene cluster in a surrogate host Streptomyces lividans K4-114 led to the successful production of 3. Notably, compound 1 showed potent cytotoxic activities toward eight cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 41 to 283 nM.	1
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and regulatory cascade for the synergistic antibacterial antibiotics griseoviridin and viridogrisein in Streptomyces griseoviridis Abstract: Griseoviridin (GV) and viridogrisein (VG, also referred to as etamycin), produced by Streptomyces griseoviridis, are two chemically unrelated compounds belonging to the streptogramin family. Both of these natural products demonstrate broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and constitute excellent candidates for future drug development. To elucidate the biosynthetic machinery associated with production of these two unique antibiotics, the gene cluster responsible for both GV and VG production was identified within the Streptomyces griseoviridis genome and characterized, and its function in GV and VG biosynthesis was confirmed by inactivation of 30 genes and complementation experiments. This sgv gene cluster is localized to a 105 kb DNA region that consists of 36 open reading frames (ORFs), including four nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) for VG biosynthesis and a set of hybrid polyketide synthases (PKS)-NRPSs with a discrete acyltransferase (AT), SgvQ, to assemble the GV backbone. The enzyme encoding genes for VG versus GV biosynthesis are separated into distinct "halves" of the cluster. A series of four genes: sgvA, sgvB, sgvC, and sgvK, were found downstream of the PKS-NRPS; these likely code for construction of a γ-butyrolactone (GBL)-like molecule. GBLs and the corresponding GBL receptor systems are the highest ranked regulators that are able to coordinate the two streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family positive regulators SgvR2 and SgvR3; both are key biosynthetic activators. Models of GV, VG, and GBL biosynthesis were proposed by using functional gene assignments, determined on the basis of bioinformatics analysis and further supported by in vivo gene inactivation experiments. Overall, this work provides new insights into the biosyntheses of the GV and VG streptogramins that are potentially applicable to a host of combinatorial biosynthetic scenarios.	1
Title: Opening the TRPML gates Abstract: The intracellular TRPML channels have multiple biological roles, but the physiological stimuli that open them remained unknown. In a previous issue of Chemistry & Biology, Grimm et al. report a high-throughput chemical screen that identified a plethora of selective activators of TRPML3 that should open the way to fully characterize these channels and their physiological roles.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides by conserved nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in Actinobacteria Abstract: A putative lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster is conserved in many species of Actinobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. marinum, but the specific function of the encoding proteins has been elusive. Using both in vivo heterologous reconstitution and in vitro biochemical analyses, we have revealed that the five encoding biosynthetic enzymes are capable of synthesizing a family of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLPs) through a thio-template mechanism. The biosynthesis features the generation of isonitrile from a single precursor Gly promoted by a thioesterase and a nonheme iron(II)-dependent oxidase homolog and the acylation of both amino groups of Lys by the same isonitrile acyl chain facilitated by a single condensation domain of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. In addition, the deletion of INLP biosynthetic genes in M. marinum has decreased the intracellular metal concentration, suggesting the role of this biosynthetic gene cluster in metal transport.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the lantibiotic Pep5 biosynthetic gene cluster and functional analysis of PepP and PepC. Evidence for a role of PepC in thioether formation Abstract: The biosynthesis of Pep5, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is directed by the 20-kbp plasmid pED503. We identified a 7.9-kbp DNA-fragment within this plasmid which covers the information for Pep5 synthesis in the homologous host Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 which has been cured of pED503. This fragment contained, in addition to the previously described structural gene pepA and the immunity gene pepI [Reis, M., Eschbach-Bludau, M., Iglesias-Wind, M. I., Kupke, T. & Sahl, H.-G. (1994) Appl. Env. Microbiol. 60, 2876-2883], a gene pepT coding for a translocator of the ABC transporter family, a gene pepP coding for a serine protease and two genes pepB and pepC coding for putative modification enzymes; the gene arrangement is pepTIAPBC. We analyzed the biosynthetic genes with respect to their function in Pep5 biosynthesis. Deletion of PepT reduced Pep5 production to about 10%, indicating that it can be partially replaced by other host-encoded translocators. Inactivation of PepP by site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site His residue resulted in production of incorrectly processed Pep5 fragments with strongly reduced antimicrobial activity. Deletion of pepB and pepC leads to accumulation of Pep5 prepeptide in the cells without excretion of processed peptide. A pepC-deletion clone did not excrete correctly matured Pep5 but it did produce fragments from which serine and threonine were absent. Only one of these fragments contained a single lanthionine residue out of three expected while the remaining, unmodified cysteine residues could be detected by reaction with Ellman's reagent. These results demonstrate that PepC is a thioether-forming protein and strongly suggest that PepB is responsible for dehydration of serine and threonine.	1
Title: Characterization of a Legionella pneumophila relA insertion mutant and toles of RelA and RpoS in virulence gene expression Abstract: To investigate the involvement of RelA in the regulation of Legionella pneumophila virulence, a deletion substitution was constructed in the relA gene. The relA knockout resulted in an undetectable level of ppGpp in the cells during the stationary phase, but the original level was restored when the relA gene product was supplied on a plasmid. The effect of the relA mutation was examined with two systems that are known to be expressed during the stationary phase in L. pneumophila. Pigment production was found to be dependent on the relA gene product, and only one-half as much pigment was produced by the relA mutant as by the wild-type strain. Flagellum gene expression was also found to be dependent on the relA gene product, as determined with a flaA::lacZ fusion. However, the relA gene product was found to be dispensable for intracellular growth both in HL-60-derived human macrophages and in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii. To determine the involvement of the relA gene product in expression of L. pneumophila genes required for intracellular growth (icm/dot genes), nine icm::lacZ fusions were constructed, and expression of these fusions in the wild-type strain was compared with their expression in relA mutant strains. Expression of only one of the icm::lacZ fusions was moderately reduced in the relA mutant strain. Expression of the nine icm::lacZ fusions was also examined in a strain containing an insertion in the gene that codes for the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS, and similar results were obtained. We concluded that RelA is dispensable for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in the two hosts examined and that both RelA and RpoS play minor roles in L. pneumophila icm/dot gene expression.	0
Title: The dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose reductase encoding fcd gene is part of the surface layer glycoprotein glycosylation gene cluster of Geobacillus tepidamans GS5-97T Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Geobacillus tepidamans GS5-97(T) consists of disaccharide repeating units composed of L-rhamnose and D-fucose, the latter being a rare constituent of prokaryotic glycoconjugates. Although biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated L-rhamnose is well established, D-fucose biosynthesis is less investigated. The conversion of alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate into thymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose by the sequential action of RmlA (glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase) and RmlB (dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase) is shared between the dTDP-D-fucose and the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway. This key intermediate is processed by the dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxyglucose reductase Fcd to form dTDP-alpha-D-fucose. We identified the fcd gene in G. tepidamans GS5-97(T) by chromosome walking and performed functional characterization of the recombinant 308-amino acid enzyme. The in vitro activity of the enzymatic cascade (RmlB and Fcd) was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography and the reaction product was confirmed by (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This is the first characterization of the dTDP-alpha-D-fucopyranose biosynthesis pathway in a Gram-positive organism. fcd was identified as 1 of 20 open reading frames contained in a 17471-bp S-layer glycosylation (slg) gene cluster on the chromosome of G. tepidamans GS5-97(T). The sgtA structural gene is located immediately upstream of the slg gene cluster with an intergenic region of 247 nucleotides. By comparison of the SgtA amino acid sequence with the known glycosylation pattern of the S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a, two out of the proposed three glycosylation sites on SgtA could be identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be at positions Ser-792 and Thr-583.	1
Title: Optical Control of Antibody Activity by Using Photocleavable Bivalent Peptide-DNA Locks Abstract: Antibody-based molecular recognition plays a central role in today's life sciences, ranging from immunoassays to molecular imaging and antibody-based therapeutics. Control over antibody activity by using external triggers such as light could further increase the specificity of antibody-based targeting. Here we present bivalent peptide-DNA ligands containing photocleavable linkers as a noncovalent approach by which to allow photoactivation of antibody activity. Light-triggered cleavage of the 3-amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl)propionic acid peptide linker converted the high-affinity bivalent peptide-DNA lock into weakly binding monovalent ligands, effectively restoring antibody targeting of cell-surface receptors. In this work, a proof of principle was provided with an anti-hemagglutinin antibody, but the molecular design of the lock is generic and applicable to any monoclonal antibody for which an epitope or mimotope of sufficient affinity is available.	0
Title: Production of a new thiopeptide antibiotic, TP-1161, by a marine Nocardiopsis species Abstract: Twenty-seven marine sediment- and sponge-derived actinomycetes with a preference for or dependence on seawater for growth were classified at the genus level using molecular taxonomy. Their potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites was analyzed by PCR screening for genes involved in polyketide and nonribosomal peptide antibiotic synthesis. Using microwell cultures, conditions for the production of antibacterial and antifungal compounds were identified for 15 of the 27 isolates subjected to this screening. Nine of the 15 active extracts were also active against multiresistant gram-positive bacterial and/or fungal indicator organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and multidrug-resistant Candida albicans. Activity-guided fractionation of fermentation extracts of isolate TFS65-07, showing strong antibacterial activity and classified as a Nocardiopsis species, allowed the identification and purification of the active compound. Structure elucidation revealed this compound to be a new thiopeptide antibiotic with a rare aminoacetone moiety. The in vitro antibacterial activity of this thiopeptide, designated TP-1161, against a panel of bacterial strains was determined.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of polybrominated aromatic organic compounds by marine bacteria Abstract: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated bipyrroles are natural products that bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. PBDEs have attracted widespread attention because of their persistence in the environment and potential toxicity to humans. However, the natural origins of PBDE biosynthesis are not known. Here we report marine bacteria as producers of PBDEs and establish a genetic and molecular foundation for their production that unifies paradigms for the elaboration of bromophenols and bromopyrroles abundant in marine biota. We provide biochemical evidence of marine brominases revealing decarboxylative-halogenation enzymology previously unknown among halogenating enzymes. Biosynthetic motifs discovered in our study were used to mine sequence databases to discover unrealized marine bacterial producers of organobromine compounds.	1
Title: MIDDAS-M: motif-independent de novo detection of secondary metabolite gene clusters through the integration of genome sequencing and transcriptome data Abstract: Many bioactive natural products are produced as "secondary metabolites" by plants, bacteria, and fungi. During the middle of the 20th century, several secondary metabolites from fungi revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry, for example, penicillin, lovastatin, and cyclosporine. They are generally biosynthesized by enzymes encoded by clusters of coordinately regulated genes, and several motif-based methods have been developed to detect secondary metabolite biosynthetic (SMB) gene clusters using the sequence information of typical SMB core genes such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). However, no detection method exists for SMB gene clusters that are functional and do not include core SMB genes at present. To advance the exploration of SMB gene clusters, especially those without known core genes, we developed MIDDAS-M, a motif-independent de novodetection algorithm for SMB gene clusters. We integrated virtual gene cluster generation in an annotated genome sequence with highly sensitive scoring of the cooperative transcriptional regulation of cluster member genes. MIDDAS-M accurately predicted 38 SMB gene clusters that have been experimentally confirmed and/or predicted by other motif-based methods in 3 fungal strains. MIDDAS-M further identified a new SMB gene cluster for ustiloxin B, which was experimentally validated. Sequence analysis of the cluster genes indicated a novel mechanism for peptide biosynthesis independent of NRPS. Because it is fully computational and independent of empirical knowledge about SMB core genes, MIDDAS-M allows a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of SMB gene clusters, including those with novel biosynthetic mechanisms that do not contain any functionally characterized genes.	1
Title: Construction of a gene knockout system for application in Paenibacillus alvei CCM 2051T, exemplified by the S-layer glycan biosynthesis initiation enzyme WsfP Abstract: The gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus alvei CCM 2051T is covered by an oblique surface layer (S-layer) composed of glycoprotein subunits. The S-layer O-glycan is a polymer of [-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1[alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->6)]-->4)-beta-D-ManpNAc-(1-->] repeating units that is linked by an adaptor of -[GroA-2-->OPO2-->4-beta-D-ManpNAc-(1-->4)]-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1--> to specific tyrosine residues of the S-layer protein. For elucidation of the mechanism governing S-layer glycan biosynthesis, a gene knockout system using bacterial mobile group II intron-mediated gene disruption was developed. The system is further based on the sgsE S-layer gene promoter of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a and on the Geobacillus-Bacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pNW33N. As a target gene, wsfP, encoding a putative UDP-Gal:phosphoryl-polyprenol Gal-1-phosphate transferase, representing the predicted initiation enzyme of S-layer glycan biosynthesis, was disrupted. S-layer protein glycosylation was completely abolished in the insertional P. alvei CCM 2051T wsfP mutant, according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis evidence and carbohydrate analysis. Glycosylation was fully restored by plasmid-based expression of wsfP in the glycan-deficient P. alvei mutant, confirming that WsfP initiates S-layer protein glycosylation. This is the first report on the successful genetic manipulation of bacterial S-layer protein glycosylation in vivo, including transformation of and heterologous gene expression and gene disruption in the model organism P. alvei CCM 2051T.	1
Title: Prevalence and abundance of uncultivated Megasphaera-like bacteria in the human vaginal environment Abstract: Cultivation-independent analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in vaginal samples revealed two previously unrecognized, uncultivated Megasphaera-like phylotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and environmental distribution suggest that these Megasphaera types may be unique to the vaginal environment. Quantitative PCR suggests that both phylotypes are present in higher concentrations in women with bacterial vaginosis.	0
Title: Brucella abortus strain 2308 produces brucebactin, a highly efficient catecholic siderophore Abstract: Brucella abortus is known to produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHBA) and to use this catechol as a siderophore to grow under iron-limited conditions. In this study a mutant (BAM41) is described that is deficient in siderophore production by insertion of Tn5 in the virulent B. abortus strain 2308. This mutant was unable to grow on iron-deprived medium and its growth could not be restored by addition of 2,3-DHBA. Production of catecholic compounds by both the Brucella mutant and parental strains under iron-deprivation conditions was assayed by TLC. Two catecholic substances were identified in the supernatant of the parental strain 2308. The faster migrating spot showed the same retention factor (R(f)) as that of purified 2,3-DHBA. The mutant BAM41 overproduced 2,3-DHBA, but failed to form the slower migrating catechol. This defect could only be complemented by the addition of the slow-migrating catechol from strain 2308. The genomic region containing Tn5 in BAM41 was cloned and the position of the transposon was determined by nucleotide sequencing. The sequence revealed that the insertion had occurred at a gene with homology to Escherichia coli entF, a locus involved in the late steps of the biosynthesis of the complex catecholic siderophore enterobactin. Intracellular survival and growth rates of the B. abortus wild-type and entF mutant strains in mouse-derived J774 macrophages were similar, indicating that production of this siderophore was not essential in this model of infection. It is concluded that B. abortus synthesizes a previously unknown and highly efficient catecholic siderophore, different from 2,3-DHBA, for which the name brucebactin is proposed.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of myxochromides S1-3 in Stigmatella aurantiaca: evidence for an iterative bacterial type I polyketide synthase and for module skipping in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis Abstract: The myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1 harbours an astonishing variety of secondary metabolic gene clusters, at least two of which were found by gene inactivation experiments to be connected to the biosynthesis of previously unknown metabolites. In this study, we elucidate the structures of myxochromides S1-3, novel cyclic pentapeptide natural products possessing unsaturated polyketide side chains, and identify the corresponding biosynthetic gene locus, made up of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules. By analyzing the deduced substrate specificities of the adenylation domains, it is shown that module 4 is most probably skipped during the biosynthetic process. The polyketide synthase MchA harbours only one module and is presumably responsible for the formation of the variable complete polyketide side chains. These data indicate that MchA is responsible for an unusual iterative polyketide chain assembly.	1
Title: Glucose metabolism in the yeast Schwanniomyces castellii: role of phosphorylation site I and an alternative respiratory pathway Abstract: Glucose metabolism in a Crabtree-negative yeast, Schwanniomyces castellii, and a cytochrome b-deficient mutant of this strain was investigated in chemostat culture. The wild-type and mutant strains exhibited the same behavior. Oxidative metabolism was observed when the substrate uptake rate (qS) was low. Fermentative metabolites were excreted when the qS value was higher than 0.40 g.g-1.h-1, indicating the occurrence of a respirofermentative metabolism; however, the respiratory quotient (RQ) remained near 1. When fermentation occurred, the cytochrome pathway was repressed but not the salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM)-sensitive pathway. The presence of an alternative SHAM-sensitive respiratory pathway and the presence of phosphorylation site I in all metabolic conditions explained the RQ value of 1 and accounted for high biomass yields in oxidative metabolism conditions (0.62 g.g-1 for the wild-type strain and 0.31 g.g-1 for the cytochrome b-deficient mutant strain).	0
Title: An ATP-independent strategy for amide bond formation in antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: A-503083 B, a capuramycin-type antibiotic, contains an L-aminocaprolactam and an unsaturated hexuronic acid that are linked via an amide bond. A putative class C beta-lactamase (CapW) was identified within the biosynthetic gene cluster that-in contrast to the expected beta-lactamase activity-catalyzed an amide-ester exchange reaction to eliminate the L-aminocaprolactam with concomitant generation of a small but significant amount of the glyceryl ester derivative of A-503083 B, suggesting a potential role for an ester intermediate in the biosynthesis of capuramycins. A carboxyl methyltransferase, CapS, was subsequently demonstrated to function as an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent carboxyl methyltransferase to form the methyl ester derivative of A-503083 B. In the presence of free L-aminocaprolactam, CapW efficiently converts the methyl ester to A-503083 B, thereby generating a new amide bond. This ATP-independent amide bond formation using methyl esterification followed by an ester-amide exchange reaction represents an alternative to known strategies of amide bond formation.	1
Title: Identification of the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891 Abstract: The novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891 was cloned by using homologous deoxynucleoside diphosphate (dNDP)-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene fragments as probes. Double-stranded sequencing of 25.6 kb revealed the presence of 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs), including the gene for novobiocin resistance, gyrB(r), and at least 11 further ORFs to which a possible role in novobiocin biosynthesis could be assigned. An insertional inactivation experiment with a dNDP-glucose 4, 6-dehydratase fragment resulted in abolishment of novobiocin production, since biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moiety of novobiocin was blocked. Heterologous expression of a key enzyme of novobiocin biosynthesis, i.e., novobiocic acid synthetase, in Streptomyces lividans TK24 further confirmed the involvement of the analyzed genes in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic.	1
Title: Regulation of penicillinase synthesis: a mutation in Staphylococcus aureus unlinked to the penicillinase plasmid that reduced penicillinase inducibility Abstract: A mutant of Staphylococcus aureus strain 655 was isolated that is restricted in penicillinase induction. Wild-type plasmids that bear penicillinase determinants could not be fully induced in this mutant, 655par-1; hence, the responsible mutation is not located on the plasmid. Mutant plasmid PI(258)penI443, which produces penicillinase constitutively in wild-type cells, was fully constitutive for penicillinase production when it was harbored by mutant 655par-1. Therefore, the bacterial mutation does not interfere directly with the transcription of the penZ gene or translation of the penicillinase messenger ribonucleic acid. Mutant plasmid PII(147)penI220 was fully inducible in the mutant bacterium, even though the wild-type plasmid PII(147) was only partially inducible in the par-1 mutant. Thus, in the presence of inducer, complementation appears to occur between the product of the par-1 gene and the product of the penI220 gene. These results suggest that the par-1 gene codes for a penicillinase antire-pressor.	0
Title: [Identification of 3-demethylchuangxinmycin from Actinoplanes tsinanensis CPCC 200056] Abstract: Chuangxinmycin (CM) from Actinoplanes tsinanensis was an antibiotic discovered by Chinese scientists about 40 years ago. It contains a new heterocyclic system of indole fused with dihydrothiopyran, whose biosynthetic mechanism remains unclear. CM is used as an oral medicine in the treatment of bacterial infections in China. The simple structure makes CM as an attractive candidate of structure modification for improvement of antibacterial activity. Recently, we analyzed the secondary metabolites of Actinoplanes tsinanensis CPCC 200056, a CM producing strain, as a natural CM analogue. We discovered the first natural CM analogue 3-demethylchuangxinmycin (DCM) as a new natural product. Compared to CM, DCM exhibited a much weaker activity in the inhibition of the bacterial strains tested. The finding provides valuable information for the structure-activity relationship in the biosynthesis of CM.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and transcriptional analysis of thurincin H, a tandem repeated bacteriocin genetic locus, produced by Bacillus thuringiensis SF361 Abstract: Thurincin H, a bacteriocin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis SF361 isolated from honey, strongly inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus F4552. The bacteriocin was purified by 65% ammonium sulfate precipitation of the culture supernatant, followed by octyl-sepharose CL-4B and reverse-phase HPLC. The molecular mass of the bacteriocin was determined to be 3139.51 Da and the 14 amino acids of the bacteriocin at the N-terminus were identified. The complete amino acid sequence of mature thurincin H was deduced from three structural genes, thnA1, thnA2, and thnA3 found in tandem repeats on the chromosome, all of which encode for the same bacteriocin, thurincin H. The genetic determinants for thurincin H biosynthesis consist of 10 ORFs, including three thurincin H structural genes. Northern hybridization elucidated that the transcription of all three bacteriocin structural genes was regulated by a putative promoter located upstream of thnA1.	1
Title: Disruption of NMDAR-dependent burst firing by dopamine neurons provides selective assessment of phasic dopamine-dependent behavior Abstract: Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons fire in 2 characteristic modes, tonic and phasic, which are thought to modulate distinct aspects of behavior. However, the inability to selectively disrupt these patterns of activity has hampered the precise definition of the function of these modes of signaling. Here, we addressed the role of phasic DA in learning and other DA-dependent behaviors by attenuating DA neuron burst firing and subsequent DA release, without altering tonic neural activity. Disruption of phasic DA was achieved by selective genetic inactivation of NMDA-type, ionotropic glutamate receptors in DA neurons. Disruption of phasic DA neuron activity impaired the acquisition of numerous conditioned behavioral responses, and dramatically attenuated learning about cues that predicted rewarding and aversive events while leaving many other DA-dependent behaviors unaffected.	0
Title: Unveiling the biosynthetic puzzle of destruxins in Metarhizium species Abstract: Insect pathogenic fungi produce a plethora of insecticidally and pharmaceutically active compounds, including 39 cyclohexadepsipeptide destruxins (dtxs). Even though dtxs were first discovered more than 50 y ago, the genes responsible for their biosynthesis were unknown until this study. Based on our comparative genomic information and targeted gene disruptions, we report the gene cluster for dtx biosynthesis in the insect pathogen Metarhizium robertsii. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase DtxS1 has six adenylation domains, two of which are capable of selecting different amino acids to synthesize dtx B and its analogs. The cytochrome P450 enzyme DtxS2 converts dtx B into other dtxs by a chain of reactions, each producing a new derivative. The aldo-keto reductase DtxS3 and aspartic acid decarboxylase DtxS4 are responsible for the conversion and provision of the first and last substrates for the dtx assembly line, respectively. Insect bioassays showed that dtxs could suppress both cellular and humoral immune responses thereby assisting fungal propagation in insects. The differing abilities of Metarhizium species to produce toxins is dependent on the presence of the dtxS1 gene. The toxigenic species are capable of killing multiple orders of insects, whereas the nontoxigenic Metarhizium spp. have narrow host ranges. Thus, the acquisition or retention of the dtx biosynthesis gene cluster in Metarhizium lineages has been coordinated with the evolution of fungal host specificity. The data from this study will facilitate the development of dtxs as bioinsecticides or pharmaceuticals.	1
Title: Nanangenines: drimane sesquiterpenoids as the dominant metabolite cohort of a novel Australian fungus, Aspergillus nanangensis Abstract: Chemical investigation of an undescribed Australian fungus, Aspergillus nanangensis, led to the identification of the nanangenines - a family of seven new and three previously reported drimane sesquiterpenoids. The structures of the nanangenines were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis supported by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The compounds were assayed for in vitro activity against bacteria, fungi, mammalian cells and plants. Bioinformatics analysis, including comparative analysis with other acyl drimenol-producing Aspergilli, led to the identification of a putative nanangenine biosynthetic gene cluster that corresponds to the proposed biosynthetic pathway for nanangenines.	1
Title: Identification and analysis of the paulomycin biosynthetic gene cluster and titer improvement of the paulomycins in Streptomyces paulus NRRL 8115 Abstract: The paulomycins are a group of glycosylated compounds featuring a unique paulic acid moiety. To locate their biosynthetic gene clusters, the genomes of two paulomycin producers, Streptomyces paulus NRRL 8115 and Streptomyces sp. YN86, were sequenced. The paulomycin biosynthetic gene clusters were defined by comparative analyses of the two genomes together with the genome of the third paulomycin producer Streptomyces albus J1074. Subsequently, the identity of the paulomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed by inactivation of two genes involved in biosynthesis of the paulomycose branched chain (pau11) and the ring A moiety (pau18) in Streptomyces paulus NRRL 8115. After determining the gene cluster boundaries, a convergent biosynthetic model was proposed for paulomycin based on the deduced functions of the pau genes. Finally, a paulomycin high-producing strain was constructed by expressing an activator-encoding gene (pau13) in S. paulus, setting the stage for future investigations.	1
Title: Direct measurement of nitric oxide generation in the ischemic heart using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy Abstract: Nitric oxide, NO., exerts numerous important regulatory functions in biological tissues and has been hypothesized to have a role in the pathogenesis of cellular injury in a number of diseases. It has been suggested that alterations in NO. generation are a critical cause of injury in the ischemic heart. However, the precise alterations in NO. generation which occur are not known, and there is considerable controversy regarding whether myocardial ischemia results in increased or decreased NO. formation. Therefore, electron paramagnetic resonance studies were performed to directly measure NO. in isolated rat hearts subjected to global ischemia, using the direct NO. trap Fe(2+)-N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate, which specifically binds NO. giving rise to a characteristic triplet EPR spectrum with g = 2.04 and aN = 13.2 G. While only a small triplet signal was observed in normally perfused hearts, a 10-fold increase in this triplet EPR spectrum was observed after 30 min of ischemia indicating a marked increase in NO. formation and trapping. Measurements were performed as a function of the duration of ischemia, and it was determined that with increased duration of ischemia NO. formation and trapping was also increased. NO. generation was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase blocker, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), suggesting that NO. was generated via nitric oxide synthase. Blockade of NO. generation with L-NAME resulted in more than a 2-fold increase in the recovery of contractile function in hearts reperfused after 30 min of global ischemia. Thus, ischemia causes a marked duration-dependent increase of NO. in the heart which may in turn mediate postischemic injury.	0
Title: A Single Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Is Responsible for the Production of Bagremycin Antibiotics and Ferroverdin Iron Chelators Abstract: Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are organized groups of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites. Typically, one BGC is responsible for the production of one or several similar compounds with bioactivities that usually only vary in terms of strength and/or specificity. Here we show that the previously described ferroverdins and bagremycins, which are families of metabolites with different bioactivities, are produced from the same BGC, whereby the fate of the biosynthetic pathway depends on iron availability. Under conditions of iron depletion, the monomeric bagremycins are formed, representing amino-aromatic antibiotics resulting from the condensation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with p-vinylphenol. Conversely, when iron is abundantly available, the biosynthetic pathway additionally produces a molecule based on p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, which complexes iron to form the trimeric ferroverdins that have anticholesterol activity. Thus, our work shows a unique exception to the concept that BGCs should only produce a single family of molecules with one type of bioactivity and that in fact different bioactive molecules may be produced depending on the environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Access to whole-genome sequences has exposed the general incidence of the so-called cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thereby renewing their interest for natural product discovery. As a consequence, genome mining is the often first approach implemented to assess the potential of a microorganism for producing novel bioactive metabolites. By revealing a new level of complexity of natural product biosynthesis, we further illustrate the difficulty of estimation of the panel of molecules associated with a BGC based on genomic information alone. Indeed, we found that the same gene cluster is responsible for the production of compounds which differ in terms of structure and bioactivity. The production of these different compounds responds to different environmental triggers, which suggests that multiplication of culture conditions is essential for revealing the entire panel of molecules made by a single BGC.	1
Title: Endocytic properties of the M-type 180-kDa receptor for secretory phospholipases A2 Abstract: Endocytic properties of the M-type 180-kDa receptor for secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) were first investigated in rabbit myocytes that express it at high levels. Internalization of the receptor was shown to be clathrin-coated pit-mediated, rapid (ke = 0.1 min-1), and ligand-independent. The signal sequence for internalization was then identified upon transient and stable expression of various receptor constructs with mutated cytoplasmic sequences. Analysis of the internalization efficiency of the mutants suggested that the NSYY motif encodes the major endocytic signal, with the distal tyrosine residue playing the key role. Amino acid substitutions at the putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site of the receptor did not affect internalization. A chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the rabbit sPLA2 receptor and of the cytoplasmic domain of the structurally homologous human macrophage mannose receptor retained the high affinity for sPLA2 and was internalization competent, exhibiting 50% endocytic activity of the M-type sPLA2 receptor. The results indicate the compatibility of the structural domains of the two parent proteins and provide evidence for the interchangeable character of their internalization signals.	0
Title: Attachment of cell-binding ligands to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides enables cytosolic translocation of complexed siRNA Abstract: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as nona-arginine (9R), poorly translocate siRNA into cells. Our studies demonstrate that attaching 9R to ligands that bind cell surface receptors quantitatively increases siRNA uptake and importantly, allows functional delivery of complexed siRNA. The mechanism involved accumulation of ligand-9R:siRNA microparticles on the cell membrane, which induced transient membrane inversion at the site of ligand-9R binding and rapid siRNA translocation into the cytoplasm. siRNA release also occurred late after endocytosis when the ligand was attached to the L isoform of 9R, but not the protease-resistant 9DR, prolonging mRNA knockdown. This critically depended on endosomal proteolytic activity, implying that partial CPP degradation is required for endosome-to-cytosol translocation. The data demonstrate that ligand attachment renders simple polycationic CPPs effective for siRNA delivery by restoring their intrinsic property of translocation.	0
Title: Codon randomization for rapid exploration of chemical space in thiopeptide antibiotic variants Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics exhibit a profound level of chemical diversity that is installed through cascades of posttranslational modifications on ribosomal peptides. Here, we present a technique to rapidly explore the chemical space of the thiopeptide GE37468 through codon randomization, yielding insights into thiopeptide maturation as well as structure and activity relationships. In this incarnation of the methodology, we randomized seven residues of the prepeptide-coding region, enabling the generation of 133 potential thiopeptide variants. Variant libraries were subsequently queried in two ways. First, high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to colony-level expressions to sample mutants that permitted full maturation of the antibiotic. Second, the activity of producing mutants was detected in an antibiotic overlay assay. In total, 29 of the 133 variants produced mature compound, 12 of which retained antibiotic activity and 1 that had improved activity.	0
Title: The pea Sym37 receptor kinase gene controls infection-thread initiation and nodule development Abstract: Phenotypic characterization of pea symbiotic mutants has provided a detailed description of the symbiosis with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strains. We show here that two allelic non-nodulating pea mutants, RisNod4 and K24, are affected in the PsSym37 gene, encoding a LysM receptor kinase similar to Lotus japonicus NFR1 and Medicago truncatula LYK3. Phenotypic analysis of RisNod4 and K24 suggests a role for the SYM37 in regulation of infection-thread initiation and nodule development from cortical-cell division foci. We show that RisNod4 plants carrying an L to F substitution in the LysM1 domain display a restrictive symbiotic phenotype comparable to the PsSym2(A) lines that distinguish 'European' and 'Middle East' Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strains. RisNod4 mutants develop nodules only in the presence of a 'Middle East' Rhizobium strain producing O-acetylated Nod factors indicating the SYM37 involvement in Nod-factor recognition. Along with the PsSym37, a homologous LysM receptor kinase gene, PsK1, was isolated and characterized. We show that PsK1 and PsSym37 are genetically linked to each other and to the PsSym2 locus. Allelic complementation analyses and sequencing of the extracellular regions of PsSym37 and PsK1 in several 'European' and 'Afghan' pea cultivars point towards PsK1 as possible candidate for the elusive PsSym2 gene.	0
Title: Pyxipyrrolones: Structure Elucidation and Biosynthesis of Cytotoxic Myxobacterial Metabolites Abstract: In the search for new secondary metabolites from myxobacteria, a strain from the genus Pyxidicoccus was investigated. This led to the identification of a new class of natural products showing structural novelty and interesting biological activity. Isolation and structure elucidation of two analogues led to the identification of pyxipyrrolone A and B, harboring the novel 3-methylene-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-octahydro-1H-benzo[e]isoindol-1-one scaffold. Mosher's ester analysis combined with NMR studies allowed the determination of all stereocenters but one. Genome sequencing of the producer strain led to the identification of a putative biosynthetic gene cluster for the pyxipyrrolones. The compounds showed activity against several cancer cell lines (μm range) with pyxipyrrolone B having 2- to 11-fold higher activity than A, although they differ only by one methylene group.	1
Title: Transcriptome responses to Ralstonia solanacearum infection in the roots of the wild potato Solanum commersonii Abstract: Background:                       Solanum commersonii is a wild potato species that exhibits high tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses and has been used as a source of genes for introgression into cultivated potato. Among the interesting features of S. commersonii is resistance to the bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, one of the most devastating bacterial diseases of crops.                  Results:                       In this study, we used deep sequencing of S. commersonii RNA (RNA-seq) to analyze the below-ground plant transcriptional responses to R. solanacearum. While a majority of S. commersonii RNA-seq reads could be aligned to the Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja DM reference genome sequence, we identified 2,978 S. commersonii novel transcripts through assembly of unaligned S. commersonii RNA-seq reads. We also used RNA-seq to study gene expression in pathogen-challenged roots of S. commersonii accessions resistant (F118) and susceptible (F97) to the pathogen. Expression profiles obtained from read mapping to the S. tuberosum reference genome and the S. commersonii novel transcripts revealed a differential response to the pathogen in the two accessions, with 221 (F118) and 644 (F97) differentially expressed genes including S. commersonii novel transcripts in the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Interestingly, 22.6% of the F118 and 12.8% of the F97 differentially expressed genes had been previously identified as responsive to biotic stresses and half of those up-regulated in both accessions had been involved in plant pathogen responses. Finally, we compared two different methods to eliminate ribosomal RNA from the plant RNA samples in order to allow dual mapping of RNAseq reads to the host and pathogen genomes and provide insights on the advantages and limitations of each technique.                  Conclusions:                       Our work catalogues the S. commersonii transcriptome and strengthens the notion that this species encodes specific genes that are differentially expressed to respond to bacterial wilt. In addition, a high proportion of S. commersonii-specific transcripts were altered by R. solanacearum only in F118 accession, while phythormone-related genes were highly induced in F97, suggesting a markedly different response to the pathogen in the two plant accessions studied.	0
Title: A Transmissible Plasmid-Borne Pathogenicity Island Confers Piscibactin Biosynthesis in the Fish Pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida Abstract: The fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida produces the siderophore piscibactin. A gene cluster that resembles the Yersinia high-pathogenicity island (HPI) encodes piscibactin biosynthesis. Here, we report that this HPI-like cluster is part of a hitherto-uncharacterized 68-kb plasmid dubbed pPHDP70. This plasmid lacks homologs of genes that mediate conjugation, but we found that it could be transferred at low frequencies from P. damselae subsp. piscicida to a mollusk pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus strain and to other Gram-negative bacteria, likely dependent on the conjugative functions of the coresident plasmid pPHDP60. Following its conjugative transfer, pPHDP70 restored the capacity of a vibrioferrin mutant of V. alginolyticus to grow under low-iron conditions, and piscibactin became detectable in its supernatant. Thus, pPHDP70 appears to harbor all the genes required for piscibactin biosynthesis and transport. P. damselae subsp. piscicida strains cured of pPHDP70 no longer produced piscibactin, had impaired growth under iron-limited conditions, and exhibited markedly decreased virulence in fish. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of pPHDP70, with its capacity for piscibactin-mediated iron acquisition, in the virulence of P. damselae subsp. piscicida. Horizontal transmission of this plasmid-borne piscibactin synthesis gene cluster in the marine environment may facilitate the emergence of new pathogens.	1
Title: Genetic organization and sequence of the Pseudomonas cepacia genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase Abstract: The locations of the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome were determined. This was accomplished through the construction of several subclones into the broad-host-range cloning vectors pRO2317, pRO2320, and pRO2321. The ability of each subclone to complement mutations in protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcaA) was tested in mutant strains derived from P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. These complementation studies also showed that the two subunits were expressed from the same promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence matched that determined by N-terminal analysis of regions of the isolated enzyme. Although over 400 nucleotides were sequenced before the start of the genes, no homology to known promoters was found. However, a terminator stem-loop structure was found immediately after the genes. The deduced amino acid sequence showed extensive homology with the previously determined amino acid sequence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from another Pseudomonas species.	0
Title: The gene cluster for spectinomycin biosynthesis and the aminoglycoside-resistance function of spcM in Streptomyces spectabilis Abstract: The gene cluster for spectinomycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces spectabilis was analyzed completely and registered under the accession number EU255259 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Based on sequence analysis, spcM of the S. spectabilis cluster is the only methyltransferase candidate required for methylation in spectinomycin biosynthesis. It has high similarity with the conserved domain of DNA methylase, which contains both N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases and N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases. Nucleotide methylation can provide antibiotic resistance, such as 16S rRNA methyltransferase, to Enterobacteriaceae. We therefore tested a hypothesis that SpcM offers aminoglycoside resistance to bacteria. The heterologous expression of spcM in Escherichia coli and S. lividans enhanced resistance against spectinomycin and its relative aminoglycoside antibiotics. We therefore propose that one of the functions of SpcM may be conferring aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance to cells.	1
Title: 3-Amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase, the terminal enzyme in the formation of the precursor of mC7N units in rifamycin and related antibiotics Abstract: The biosynthesis of ansamycin antibiotics, like rifamycin B, involves formation of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) by a novel variant of the shikimate pathway. AHBA then serves as the starter unit for the assembly of a polyketide which eventually links back to the amino group of AHBA to form the macrolactam ring. The terminal enzyme of AHBA formation, which catalyzes the aromatization of 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroshikimic acid, has been purified to homogeneity from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, the encoding gene has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme, a (His)6 fusion protein, as well as the native one, are dimers containing one molecule of pyridoxal phosphate per subunit. Mechanistic studies showed that the enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff's base with the amino group of 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroshikimic acid and catalyzes both an alpha, beta-dehydration and a stereospecific 1,4-enolization of the substrate. Inactivation of the gene encoding AHBA synthase in the A. mediterranei genome results in loss of rifamycin formation; production of the antibiotic is restored when the mutant is supplemented with AHBA.	1
Title: An ergot alkaloid biosynthesis gene and clustered hypothetical genes from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The ergot alkaloids are a family of indole-derived mycotoxins with a variety of significant biological activities. Aspergillus fumigatus, a common airborne fungus and opportunistic human pathogen, and several fungi in the relatively distant taxon Clavicipitaceae (clavicipitaceous fungi) produce different sets of ergot alkaloids. The ergot alkaloids of these divergent fungi share a four-member ergoline ring but differ in the number, type, and position of the side chains. Several genes required for ergot alkaloid production are known in the clavicipitaceous fungi, and these genes are clustered in the genome of the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea. We investigated whether the ergot alkaloids of A. fumigatus have a common biosynthetic and genetic origin with those of the clavicipitaceous fungi. A homolog of dmaW, the gene controlling the determinant step in the ergot alkaloid pathway of clavicipitaceous fungi, was identified in the A. fumigatus genome. Knockout of dmaW eliminated all known ergot alkaloids from A. fumigatus, and complementation of the mutation restored ergot alkaloid production. Clustered with dmaW in the A. fumigatus genome are sequences corresponding to five genes previously proposed to encode steps in the ergot alkaloid pathway of C. purpurea, as well as additional sequences whose deduced protein products are consistent with their involvement in the ergot alkaloid pathway. The corresponding genes have similarities in their nucleotide sequences, but the orientations and positions within the cluster of several of these genes differ. The data indicate that the ergot alkaloid biosynthetic capabilities in A. fumigatus and the clavicipitaceous fungi had a common origin.	1
Title: Rapid Construction of Tetralin, Chromane, and Indane Motifs via Cyclative C-H/C-H Coupling: Four-Step Total Synthesis of (±)-Russujaponol F Abstract: The development of practical C-H/C-H coupling reactions remains a challenging yet appealing synthetic venture because it circumvents the need to prefunctionalize both coupling partners for the generation of C-C bonds. Herein we report a cyclative C(sp3)-H/C(sp2)-H coupling reaction of free aliphatic acids enabled by a cyclopentane-based mono-N-protected β-amino acid ligand. This reaction uses inexpensive sodium percarbonate (Na2CO3·1.5H2O2) as the sole oxidant and generates water as the only byproduct. A range of biologically important scaffolds, including tetralins, chromanes, and indanes, can be easily prepared by this protocol. Finally, the synthetic application of this methodology is demonstrated by the concise total synthesis of (±)-russujaponol F in a four-step sequence starting from readily available phenylacetic acid and pivalic acid through sequential functionalizations of four C-H bonds.	0
Title: Gene targeting for O-methyltransferase genes, mycE and mycF, on the chromosome of Micromonospora griseorubida producing mycinamicin with a disruption cassette containing the bacteriophage phi C31 attB attachment site Abstract: Mycinamicin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida, comprises a macrolactone and two deoxysugars: desosamine and mycinose. Mycinose is synthesized through two modification steps: the methylation of 6-deoxyallose in mycinamicin VI and of javose in mycinamicin III. To confirm the role of mycE and mycF genes in mycinamicin biosynthesis in M. griseorubida, disruption mutants of mycE and mycF were constructed by disruption plasmids containing attB in the disruption cassette FRT-neo-oriT-FRT-attB for the integration of phiC31-derivative vector plasmids; the disruption mutants were complemented through the integration of pSET152 derivatives containing intact mycE or mycF into the artificially inserted attB site. These disruption mutants did not produce mycinamicin II, but mainly accumulated mycinamicins VI and III, indicating that MycE and MycF methylated the C2''-OH group of 6-deoxyallose in mycinamicin VI and the C3''-OH group of C2''-methylated 6-deoxyallose in mycinamicin III, respectively. The complemented strains of mycE and mycF recovered the mycinamicin II productivity.	0
Title: Increased Valency Improves Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Targeting Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) Abstract: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide-based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2-8[RRG] or P9-38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100-fold achieved for the P9-38-decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9-38 in in vitro competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9-38-decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell-based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide-based PCSK9 therapeutics.	0
Title: Camphoratins A-J, potent cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory triterpenoids from the fruiting body of Taiwanofungus camphoratus Abstract: Ten new triterpenoids, camphoratins A-J (1-10), along with 12 known compounds were isolated from the fruiting body of Taiwanofungus camphoratus. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis and chemical methods. Compound 10 is the first example of a naturally occurring ergosteroid with an unusual cis-C/D ring junction. Compounds 2-6 and 11 showed moderate to potent cytotoxicity, with EC(50) values ranging from 0.3 to 3 μM against KB and KB-VIN human cancer cell lines. Compounds 6, 10, 11, 14-16, 18, and 21 exhibited anti-inflammatory NO-production inhibition activity with IC(50) values of less than 5 μM, and were more potent than the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.	0
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of the enzymatic domains in the modular polyketide synthase Abstract: The three giant multifunctional polypeptides of the rapamycin (Rp)-producing polyketide synthase (RAPS1, RAPS2 and RAPS3) have recently been shown to contain 14 separate sets, or modules, of enzyme activities, each module catalysing a specific round of polyketide chain extension. Detailed sequence comparison between these protein modules has allowed further characterisation of aa that may be important in catalysis or specificity. The acyl-carrier protein (ACP), beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS) and acyltransferase (AT) domains (the core domains) have an extremely high degree of mutual sequence homology. The KS domains in particular are almost perfect repeats over their entire length. Module 14 shows the least homology and is unique in possessing only core domains. The enoyl reductase (ER), beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR) and dehydratase (DH) domains are present even in certain modules where they are not apparently required. Four DH domains can be recognised as inactive by characteristic deletions in active site sequences, but for two others, and for KR and ER in module 3, the sequence is not distinguishable from that of active counterparts in other modules. The N terminus of RAPS1 contains a novel coenzyme A ligase (CL) domain that activates and attaches the shikimate-derived starter unit, and an ER activity that may modify the starter unit after attachment. The sequence comparison has revealed the surprisingly high sequence similarity between inter-domain 'linker' regions, and also a potential amphipathic helix at the N terminus of each multienzyme subunit which may promote dimerisation into active species.	1
Title: Inhibitors of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases: synthesis, molecular docking, and implications Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases (PhaCs) catalyze the formation of biodegradable PHAs that are considered to be ideal alternatives to non-biodegradable synthetic plastics. However, study of PhaCs has been challenging because the rate of PHA chain elongation is much faster than that of initiation. This difficulty, along with lack of a crystal structure, has become the main hurdle to understanding and engineering PhaCs for economical PHA production. Here we report the synthesis of two carbadethia CoA analogues--sT-CH2-CoA (26 a) and sTet-CH2-CoA (26 b)--as well as sT-aldehyde (saturated trimer aldehyde, 29), as new PhaC inhibitors. Study of these analogues with PhaECAv revealed that 26 a/b and 29 are competitive and mixed inhibitors, respectively. Both the CoA moiety and extension of PHA chain will increase binding affinity; this is consistent with our docking study. Estimation of the Kic values of 26 a and 26 b predicts that a CoA analogue incorporating an octameric hydroxybutanoate (HB) chain might facilitate the formation of a kinetically well-behaved synthase.	0
Title: CloN6, a novel methyltransferase catalysing the methylation of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety of clorobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin contains a 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit. This pyrrole unit is derived from L-proline, and it would be expected that its 5-methyl group should be introduced by a methylation reaction. However, sequence analysis of the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster did not reveal a gene with sequence similarity to the SAM-dependent methyltransferases that could be assigned to this reaction. This study, however, has provided evidence that the gene cloN6 is involved in this methylation reaction. Its gene product CloN6 shares conserved sequence motifs with the recently identified radical SAM protein superfamily, and it has been suggested that members of this family can catalyse methylcobalamin-dependent methylation reactions. cloN6 was inactivated in the clorobiocin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976 by use of the PCR-targeting method. The cloN6(-) mutants accumulated, instead of clorobiocin, a derivative lacking the 5"'-methyl group of the pyrrole moiety (termed novclobiocin 109). A structural isomer carrying the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety at 2"-OH rather than at the 3"-OH of the deoxysugar (novclobiocin 110), and a derivative completely lacking the pyrrole unit (novclobiocin 104) were also identified. The structures of the metabolites were confirmed by NMR and MS analysis. Antibacterial activity tests against Bacillus subtilis showed that novclobiocin 109 and novclobiocin 110 have antibacterial activities about eight times less than that of clorobiocin, whereas novclobiocin 104 showed no activity under the test conditions.	1
Title: Characterization of molecular interactions between ACP and halogenase domains in the Curacin A polyketide synthase Abstract: Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large multidomain proteins present in microorganisms that produce bioactive compounds. Curacin A is such a bioactive compound with potent anti-proliferative activity. During its biosynthesis the growing substrate is bound covalently to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) that is able to access catalytic sites of neighboring domains for chain elongation and modification. While ACP domains usually occur as monomers, the curacin A cluster codes for a triplet ACP (ACP(I)-ACP(II)-ACP(III)) within the CurA PKS module. We have determined the structure of the isolated holo-ACP(I) and show that the ACPs are independent of each other within this tridomain system. In addition, we have determined the structure of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-loaded holo-ACP(I), which is the substrate for the unique halogenase (Hal) domain embedded within the CurA module. We have identified the interaction surface of both proteins using mutagenesis and MALDI-based identification of product formation. Amino acids affecting product formation are located on helices II and III of ACP(I) and form a contiguous surface. Since the CurA Hal accepts substrate only when presented by one of the ACPs within the ACP(I)-ACP(II)-ACP(III) tridomain, our data provide insight into the specificity of the chlorination reaction.	1
Title: Targeted Rediscovery and Biosynthesis of the Farnesyl-Transferase Inhibitor Pepticinnamin E Abstract: The natural product pepticinnamin E potently inhibits protein farnesyl transferases and has potential applications in treating cancer and malaria. Pepticinnamin E contains a rare N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety as well as several nonproteinogenic amino acids, including the unusual 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine. The biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E has remained uncharacterized because its original producing strain is no longer available. Here we identified a gene cluster (pcm) for this natural product in a new producer, Actinobacteria bacterium OK006, by means of a targeted rediscovery strategy. We demonstrated that the pcm cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, a nonribosomal peptide/polyketide hybrid. We also characterized a key O-methyltransferase that modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. Our work has identified the gene cluster for pepticinnamins for the first time and sets the stage for elucidating the unique chemistry required for biosynthesis.	1
Title: Dissection of the Enzymatic Process for Forming a Central Imidazopiperidine Heterocycle in the Biosynthesis of a Series c Thiopeptide Antibiotic Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics are a family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide natural products of significant interest in anti-infective agent development. These antibiotics are classified into five subfamilies according to differences in the central 6-membered heterocycle of the thiopeptide framework. The mechanism through which imidazopiperidine, the most heavily functionalized central domain characteristic of a series c thiopeptide, is formed remains unclear. Based on mining and characterization of the genes specifically involved in the biosynthesis of Sch40832, we here report an enzymatic process for transforming a series b thiopeptide into a series c product through a series a intermediate. This process starts with F420-dependent hydrogenation of the central dehydropiperidine unit to a saturated piperidine unit. With the activity of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, the piperidine-thiazole motif of the intermediate undergoes an unusual oxygenation-mediated rearrangement to provide an imidazopiperidine heterocycle subjected to further S-methylation and aldehyde reduction. This study represents the first biochemical reconstitution of the pathway forming a stable series c thiopeptide.	1
Title: Differential modulation of avian β-defensin and Toll-like receptor expression in chickens infected with infectious bronchitis virus Abstract: The host innate immune response either clears invading viruses or allows the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response. In this study, both pathogenic (passage 3, P3) and attenuated (P110) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were used to study the immune responses of chicken to IBV infection. Expression of avian β-defensins (AvBDs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in 16 tissues of chicken were compared at 7 days PI. The results showed that P3 infection upregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12, while P110 infection downregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 in most tissues. Meanwhile, the expression level of several TLRs showed a general trend of upregulation in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, while they were downregulated in the tissues of P110-infected chickens. The result suggested that compared with the P110 strain, the P3 strain induced a more pronounced host innate immune response. Furthermore, we observed that recombinant AvBDs (including 2, 6, and 12) demonstrated obvious anti-viral activity against IBV in vitro. Our findings contribute to the proposal that IBV infection induces an increase in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of some AvBDs and TLRs, which suggests that AvBDs may play significant roles in the resistance of chickens to IBV replication.	0
Title: Elucidating the Rimosamide-Detoxin Natural Product Families and Their Biosynthesis Using Metabolite/Gene Cluster Correlations Abstract: As microbial genome sequencing becomes more widespread, the capacity of microorganisms to produce an immense number of metabolites has come into better view. Utilizing a metabolite/gene cluster correlation platform, the biosynthetic origins of a new family of natural products, the rimosamides, were discovered. The rimosamides were identified in Streptomyces rimosus and associated with their NRPS/PKS-type gene cluster based upon their high frequency of co-occurrence across 179 strains of actinobacteria. This also led to the discovery of the related detoxin gene cluster. The core of each of these families of natural products contains a depsipeptide bond at the point of bifurcation in their unusual branched structures, the origins of which are definitively assigned to nonlinear biosynthetic pathways via heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans. The rimosamides were found to antagonize the antibiotic activity of blasticidin S against Bacillus cereus.	1
Title: Identification of the thiazolyl peptide GE37468 gene cluster from Streptomyces ATCC 55365 and heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans Abstract: Thiazolyl peptides are bacterial secondary metabolites that potently inhibit protein synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria and malarial parasites. Recently, our laboratory and others reported that this class of trithiazolyl pyridine-containing natural products is derived from ribosomally synthesized preproteins that undergo a cascade of posttranslational modifications to produce architecturally complex macrocyclic scaffolds. Here, we report the gene cluster responsible for production of the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)-targeting 29-member thiazolyl peptide GE37468 from Streptomyces ATCC 55365 and its heterologous expression in the model host Streptomyces lividans. GE37468 harbors an unusual β-methyl-δ-hydroxy-proline residue that may increase conformational rigidity of the macrocycle and impart reduced entropic costs of target binding. Isotope feeding and gene knockout were employed in the engineered S. lividans strain to identify the P450 monooxygenase GetJ as the enzyme involved in posttranslational transformation of isoleucine 8 to β-methyl-δ-hydroxy-proline through a predicted tandem double hydroxylation/cyclization mechanism. Loss of Ile8 oxygenative cyclization or mutation of Ile8 to alanine via preprotein gene replacement resulted in a 4-fold and 2-fold drop in antibiotic activity, respectively. This report of genetic manipulation of a 29-member thiazolyl peptide sets the stage for further genetic examination of structure activity relationships in the EF-Tu targeting class of thiazolyl peptides.	1
Title: Ribosome Mechanics Informs about Mechanism Abstract: The essential aspects of the ribosome's mechanism can be extracted from coarse-grained simulations, including the ratchet motion, the movement together of critical bases at the decoding center, and movements of the peptide tunnel lining that assist in the expulsion of the synthesized peptide. Because of its large size, coarse graining helps to simplify and to aid in the understanding of its mechanism. Results presented here utilize coarse-grained elastic network modeling to extract the dynamics, and both RNAs and proteins are coarse grained. We review our previous results, showing the well-known ratchet motions and the motions in the peptide tunnel and in the mRNA tunnel. The motions of the lining of the peptide tunnel appear to assist in the expulsion of the growing peptide chain, and clamps at the ends of the mRNA tunnel with three proteins ensure that the mRNA is held tightly during decoding and essential for the helicase activity at the entrance. The entry clamp may also assist in base recognition to ensure proper selection of the incoming tRNA. The overall precision of the ribosome machine-like motions is remarkable.	0
Title: Characterization and Engineering of the Adenylation Domain of a NRPS-Like Protein: A Potential Biocatalyst for Aldehyde Generation Abstract: The adenylation (A) domain acts as the first "gate-keeper" to ensure the activation and thioesterification of the correct monomer to nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Our understanding of the specificity-conferring code and our ability to engineer A domains are critical for increasing the chemical diversity of nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). We recently discovered a novel NRPS-like protein (ATEG_03630) that can activate 5-methyl orsellinic acid (5-MOA) and reduce it to 2,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethyl benzaldehyde. A NRPS-like protein is much smaller than multidomain NRPSs, but it still represents the thioesterification half-reaction, which is otherwise missed from a stand-alone A domain. Therefore, a NRPS-like protein may serve as a better model system for A domain engineering. Here, we characterize the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630 and conclude that the hydrogen-bond donor at the 4-position is crucial for substrate recognition. Next, we show that the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630 can be engineered toward our target substrate anthranilate via bioinformatics analysis and mutagenesis. The resultant mutant H358A increased its activity toward anthranilate by 10.9-fold, which led to a 26-fold improvement in specificity. Finally, we demonstrate one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with high yield.	1
Title: Characterization of the 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase McyI, encoded within the microcystin biosynthesis gene cluster of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 Abstract: The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa is widely known for its production of the potent hepatotoxin microcystin. This cyclic heptapeptide is synthesized non-ribosomally by the thio-template function of a large modular enzyme complex encoded within the 55-kb microcystin synthetase gene (mcy) cluster. The mcy gene cluster also encodes several stand-alone enzymes, putatively involved in the tailoring and export of microcystin. This study describes the characterization of the 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase McyI, putatively involved in the production of d-methyl aspartate at position 3 within the microcystin cyclic structure. A combination of bioinformatics, molecular, and biochemical techniques was used to elucidate the structure, function, regulation, and evolution of this unique enzyme. The recombinant McyI enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and enzymatically characterized. The hypothesized native activity of McyI, the interconversion of 3-methyl malate to 3-methyl oxalacetate, was demonstrated using an in vitro spectrophotometric assay. The enzyme was also able to reduce alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate and to catalyze the interconversion of malate and oxalacetate. Although NADP(H) was the preferred cofactor of the McyI-catalyzed reactions, NAD(H) could also be utilized, although rates of catalysis were significantly lower. The combined results of this study suggest that hepatotoxic cyanobacteria such as M. aeruginosa PCC7806 are capable of producing methyl aspartate via a novel glutamate mutase-independent pathway, in which McyI plays a pivotal role.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the first class of potent bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity Abstract: The multisubunit acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis, is broadly conserved among bacteria. Its rate-limiting role in formation of fatty acids makes this enzyme an attractive target for the design of novel broad-spectrum antibacterials. However, no potent inhibitors have been discovered so far. This report describes the identification and characterization of highly potent bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity for the first time. We demonstrate that pseudopeptide pyrrolidine dione antibiotics such as moiramide B inhibit the Escherichia coli enzyme at nanomolar concentrations. Moiramide B targets the carboxyltransferase reaction of this enzyme with a competitive inhibition pattern versus malonyl-CoA (K(i) value = 5 nm). Inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of the pyrrolidine diones is also demonstrated using recombinantly expressed carboxyltransferases from other bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We isolated pyrrolidine dione-resistant strains of E. coli, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, which contain mutations within the carboxyltransferase subunits AccA or AccD. We demonstrate that such mutations confer resistance to pyrrolidine diones. Inhibition values (IC(50)) of >100 microm regarding an eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver indicate high selectivity of pyrrolidine diones for the bacterial multisubunit enzyme. The natural product moiramide B and synthetic analogues show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The knowledge of the target and the availability of facile assays using carboxyltransferases from different pathogens will enable evaluation of the antibacterial potential of the pyrrolidine diones as a promising antibacterial compound class acting via a novel mode of action.	1
Title: Enantioselective CuH-catalyzed anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of 1,1-disubstituted alkenes Abstract: Enantioselective synthesis of β-chiral amines has been achieved via copper-catalyzed hydroamination of 1,1-disubstituted alkenes with hydroxylamine esters in the presence of a hydrosilane. This mild process affords a range of structurally diverse β-chiral amines, including β-deuterated amines, in excellent yields with high enantioselectivities. Furthermore, catalyst loading as low as 0.4 mol% could be employed to deliver product in undiminished yield and selectivity, demonstrating the practicality of this method for large-scale synthesis.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Insights of Calyculin- and Misakinolide-Type Compounds in "Candidatus Entotheonella sp." Abstract: Microbial symbionts are recognized as the important sources of numerous sponge-derived metabolites with potent biological activities. The limitation to cultivate the majority of potential symbionts has hampered attempts to explore and exploit their natural products for further development toward medical applications. Metagenomics-guided approaches have enabled cloning of natural product biosynthesis genes from uncultured microbial symbionts. Subsequent activation of biosynthesis genes in easily culturable bacteria could lead to the sustainable production of rare sponge-derived compounds. In this chapter, we highlight metagenomic strategies to reveal natural product biosynthetic pathways in sponge metagenomes based on the calyculin and misakinolide polyketides. Techniques to identify the compound producer are briefly discussed. We further describe examples of functional studies of the biosynthetic pathways of these two compound types with a special emphasis on the general experimental protocols for the activity assays of key proteins involved in their biosynthesis.	1
Title: Natural abundance solid-state carbon NMR studies of photosynthetic reaction centers with photoinduced polarization Abstract: Solid-state NMR spectra of natural abundance 13C in reaction centers from photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides R-26 was measured. When the quinone acceptors were removed and continuous visible illumination of the sample was provided, exceptionally strong nuclear spin polarization was observed in NMR lines with chemical shifts resembling those of the aromatic carbons in bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin. The observation of spin polarized 15N nuclei in bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin was previously demonstrated with nonspecifically 15N-labeled reaction centers. Both the carbon and the nitrogen NMR studies indicate that the polarization is developed on species that carry unpaired electrons in the early electron transfer steps, including the bacteriochlorophyll dimer donor P860 and probably the bacteriopheophytin acceptor. I. Both enhanced-absorptive and emissive polarization were seen in the carbon spectrum; most lines were absorptive but the methine carbons of the porphyrin ring (alpha, beta, gamma, ) exhibited emissive polarization. The change in the sign of the hyperfine coupling at these sites indicates the existence of nodes in the spin density distribution on the tetrapyrrole cofactors flanking each methine carbon bridge.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthesis gene cluster for the pyrrole polyether antibiotic calcimycin (A23187) in Streptomyces chartreusis NRRL 3882 Abstract: The pyrrole polyether antibiotic calcimycin (A23187) is a rare ionophore that is specific for divalent cations. It is widely used as a biochemical and pharmacological tool because of its multiple, unique biological effects. Here we report on the cloning, sequencing, and mutational analysis of the 64-kb biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces chartreusis NRRL 3882. Gene replacements confirmed the identity of the gene cluster, and in silico analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 27 potential genes, including 3 genes for the biosynthesis of the α-ketopyrrole moiety, 5 genes that encode modular type I polyketide synthases for the biosynthesis of the spiroketal ring, 4 genes for the biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, an N-methyltransferase tailoring gene, a resistance gene, a type II thioesterase gene, 3 regulatory genes, 4 genes with other functions, and 5 genes of unknown function. We propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of calcimycin and assign the genes to the biosynthesis steps. Our findings set the stage for producing much desired calcimycin derivatives using genetic modification instead of chemical synthesis.	1
Title: Exploitation of sulfonylurea resistance marker and non-homologous end joining mutants for functional analysis in Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: The lack of techniques for rapid assembly of gene deletion vectors, paucity of selectable marker genes available for genetic manipulation and low frequency of homologous recombination are major constraints in construction of gene deletion mutants in Zymoseptoria tritici. To address these issues, we have constructed ternary vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of Z. tritici, which enable the single step assembly of multiple fragments via yeast recombinational cloning. The sulfonylurea resistance gene, which is a mutated allele of the Magnaporthe oryzae ILV2 gene, was established as a new dominant selectable marker for Z. tritici. To increase the frequency of homologous recombination, we have constructed Z. tritici strains deficient in the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA double stranded break repair by inactivating the KU70 and KU80 genes. Targeted gene deletion frequency increased to more than 85% in both Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains, compared to ⩽10% seen in the wild type parental strain IPO323. The in vitro growth and in planta pathogenicity of the Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains were comparable to strain IPO323. Together these molecular tools add significantly to the platform available for genomic analysis through targeted gene deletion or promoter replacements and will facilitate large-scale functional characterization projects in Z. tritici.	0
Title: Stabilizing AqdC, a Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal-Cleaving Dioxygenase from Mycobacteria, by FRESCO-Based Protein Engineering Abstract: The mycobacterial PQS dioxygenase AqdC, a cofactor-less protein with an α/β-hydrolase fold, inactivates the virulence-associated quorum-sensing signal molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS) produced by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is therefore a potential anti-virulence tool. We have used computational library design to predict stabilizing amino acid replacements in AqdC. While 57 out of 91 tested single substitutions throughout the protein led to stabilization, as judged by increases in Tappm of >2 °C, they all impaired catalytic activity. Combining substitutions, the proteins AqdC-G40K-A134L-G220D-Y238W and AqdC-G40K-G220D-Y238W showed extended half-lives and the best trade-off between stability and activity, with increases in Tappm of 11.8 and 6.1 °C and relative activities of 22 and 72 %, respectively, compared to AqdC. Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis suggested that stabilized proteins are less flexible than AqdC, and the loss of catalytic activity likely correlates with an inability to effectively open the entrance to the active site.	0
Title: The multicellular morphotypes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli produce cellulose as the second component of the extracellular matrix Abstract: Production of cellulose has been thought to be restricted to a few bacterial species such as the model organism Acetobacter xylinus. We show by enzymatic analysis and mass spectrometry that, besides thin aggregative fimbriae, the second component of the extracellular matrix of the multicellular morphotype (rdar) of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli is cellulose. The bcsA, bcsB, bcsZ and bcsC genes responsible for cellulose biosynthesis are not regulated by AgfD, the positive transcriptional regulator of the rdar morphotype. Transcription of the bcs genes was not co-expressed with the rdar morphotype under any of the environmental conditions examined. However, cellulose biosynthesis was turned on by the sole expression of adrA, a gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein regulated by agfD, indicating a novel pathway for the activation of cellulose synthesis. The co-expression of cellulose and thin aggregative fimbriae leads to the formation of a highly hydrophobic network with tightly packed cells aligned in parallel in a rigid matrix. As the production of cellulose would now appear to be a property widely distributed among bacteria, the function of the cellulose polymer in bacteria will have to be considered in a new light.	0
Title: Investigation of the Genetics and Biochemistry of Roseobacticide Production in the Roseobacter Clade Bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens Abstract: Roseobacterclade bacteria are abundant in surface waters and are among the most metabolically diverse and ecologically significant species. This group includes opportunistic symbionts that associate with micro- and macroalgae. We have proposed that one representative member,Phaeobacter inhibens, engages in a dynamic symbiosis with the microalgaEmiliania huxleyi In one phase, mutualistically beneficial molecules are exchanged, including theRoseobacter-produced antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA), which is thought to protect the symbiotic interaction. In an alternative parasitic phase, triggered by algal senescence, the bacteria produce potent algaecides, the roseobacticides, which kill the algal host. Here, we employed genetic and biochemical screens to identify the roseobacticide biosynthetic gene cluster. By using a transposon mutagenesis approach, we found that genes required for TDA synthesis-thetdaoperon andpaacatabolon-are also necessary for roseobacticide production. Thus, in contrast to the one-cluster-one-compound paradigm, thetdagene cluster can generate two sets of molecules with distinct structures and bioactivities. We further show that roseobacticide production is quorum sensing regulated via anN-acyl homoserine lactone signal (3-OH-C10-HSL). To ensure tight regulation of algaecide production, and thus of a lifestyle switch from mutualism to parasitism, roseobacticide biosynthesis necessitates the presence of both an algal senescence molecule and a quorum sensing signal.IMPORTANCEMarineRoseobacterspecies are abundant in the oceans and engage in symbiotic interactions with microscopic algae. One member,P. inhibens, produces the antibiotic TDA and a growth hormone thought to protect and promote algal growth. However, in the presence of molecules released by senescing algae, the bacteria produce potent algaecides, the roseobacticides, which kill the host. We examined the regulatory networks and biosynthetic genes required for roseobacticide production. We found thatP. inhibensuses largely the same set of genes for production of both TDA and roseobacticides, thus providing a rare case in which one gene cluster synthesizes two structurally and functionally distinct molecules. Moreover, we found roseobacticide production to be regulated by quorum sensing. Thus, two small molecules, the algal metabolite and the quorum-sensing signal, ensure tight control in the production of roseobacticides. These results highlight the role of small molecules in regulating microbial symbioses.	1
Title: Biotransformation of bisphenol A analogues by the biphenyl-degrading bacterium Cupriavidusbasilensis - a structure-biotransformation relationship Abstract: Comparative analyses determined the relationship between the structure of bisphenol A (BPA) as well as of seven bisphenol analogues (bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol C (BPC), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol Z (BPZ), bisphenol AP (BPAP), bisphenol PH (BPPH)) and their biotransformability by the biphenyl-degrading bacterium Cupriavidus basilensis SBUG 290. All bisphenols were substrates for bacterial transformation with conversion rates ranging from 6 to 98% within 216 h and 36 different metabolites were characterized. Transformation by biphenyl-grown cells comprised four different pathways: (a) formation of ortho-hydroxylated bisphenols, hydroxylating either one or both phenols of the compounds; (b) ring fission; (c) transamination followed by acetylation or dimerization; and (d) oxidation of ring substituents, such as methyl groups and aromatic ring systems, present on the 3-position. However, the microbial attack of bisphenols by C. basilensis was limited to the phenol rings and its substituents, while substituents on the carbon bridge connecting the rings were not oxidized. All bisphenol analogues with modifications at the carbon bridge could be oxidized up to ring cleavage, while substituents at the 3-position of the phenol ring other than hydroxyl groups did not allow this reaction. Replacing one methyl group at the carbon bridge of BPA by a hydrophobic aromatic or alicyclic ring system inhibited both dimerization and transamination followed by acetylation. While most of the bisphenol analogues exhibited estrogenic activity, four biotransformation products tested were not estrogenically active.	0
Title: The stability of P2-layered sodium transition metal oxides in ambient atmospheres Abstract: Air-stability is one of the most important considerations for the practical application of electrode materials in energy-harvesting/storage devices, ranging from solar cells to rechargeable batteries. The promising P2-layered sodium transition metal oxides (P2-NaxTmO2) often suffer from structural/chemical transformations when contacted with moist air. However, these elaborate transitions and the evaluation rules towards air-stable P2-NaxTmO2 have not yet been clearly elucidated. Herein, taking P2-Na0.67MnO2 and P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 as key examples, we unveil the comprehensive structural/chemical degradation mechanisms of P2-NaxTmO2 in different ambient atmospheres by using various microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations and first-principle calculations. The extent of bulk structural/chemical transformation of P2-NaxTmO2 is determined by the amount of extracted Na+, which is mainly compensated by Na+/H+ exchange. By expanding our study to a series of Mn-based oxides, we reveal that the air-stability of P2-NaxTmO2 is highly related to their oxidation features in the first charge process and further propose a practical evaluating rule associated with redox couples for air-stable NaxTmO2 cathodes.	0
Title: Microbiota and mitobiota. Putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria Abstract: The recent revival of old theories and setting them on modern scientific rails to a large extent are also relevant to mitochondrial science. Given the widespread belief that mitochondria are symbionts of ancient bacterial origin, the processes inherent to mitochondrial physiology can be revised based on their comparative analysis with possible involvement of bacteria. Such comparison combined with discussion of the role of microbiota in pathogenesis allows discussion of the role of "mitobiota" (we introduce this term) as the combination of different phenotypic manifestations of mitochondria in the organism reflecting pathological changes in the mitochondrial genome. When putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria, we find similarity between the mitochondrial and bacterial theories of cancer. The presence of the term "bacterial infection" suggests "mitochondrial infection", and mitochondrial (oxidative) theory of aging can in some way be transformed into a "bacterial theory of aging". The possible existence of such processes and the data confirming their presence are discussed in this review. If such a comparison has the right to exist, the homeostasis of "mitobiota" is of not lesser physiological importance than homeostasis of microbiota, which has been so intensively discussed recently.	0
Title: Characterization of salivaricin CRL 1328, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 isolated from the human vagina Abstract: Salivaricin CRL 1328 is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328, a strain isolated from healthy human vagina, with potential applications for preventing urogenital infections. The objective of this study was to characterize the locus responsible for salivaricin CRL 1328 production and its mechanism of action against Enterococcus faecalis MP97 as the sensitive strain. Oligonucleotides were designed based on sequences of antimicrobial peptides previously described in the literature. The salivaricin CRL 1328 cluster was identified, sequenced and analyzed. This cluster was similar to the previously described ABP118 which codified for a two-peptide bacteriocin. The putative mature peptides of salivaricin CRL 1328, Salalpha and Salbeta were chemically synthesized. These peptides did not show bacteriocin activity when assayed individually. Both peptides exhibited optimal antimicrobial activity at an equimolar ratio. Spectroscopic fluorescence assays were carried out using the synthetic peptides to study the effect of salivaricin on proton motive force. This bacteriocin was shown to dissipate membrane potential and the transmembrane proton gradient, both components of proton motive force. E. faecalis MP97 cells treated with salivaricin CRL 1328 peptides were observed in transmission electron microscopy which revealed ultrastructural modifications of the cell wall.	1
Title: The anguibactin biosynthesis and transport genes are encoded in the chromosome of Vibrio harveyi: a possible evolutionary origin for the pJM1 plasmid-encoded system of Vibrio anguillarum? Abstract: Many Vibrio anguillarum serotype O1 strains carry 65-kb pJM1-type plasmids harboring genes involved in siderophore anguibactin biosynthesis and transport. The anguibactin system is an essential factor for V. anguillarum to survive under iron-limiting conditions, and as a consequence, it is a very important virulence factor of this bacterium. Our comparative analysis of genomic data identified a cluster harboring homologs of anguibactin biosynthesis and transport genes in the chromosome of Vibrio harveyi. We have purified the putative anguibactin siderophore and demonstrated that it is indeed anguibactin by mass spectrometry and specific bioassays. Furthermore, we characterized two genes, angR and fatA, in this chromosome cluster that, respectively, participate in anguibactin biosynthesis and transport as determined by mutagenesis analysis. Furthermore, we found that the V. harveyi FatA protein is located in the outer membrane fractions as previously demonstrated in V. anguillarum. Based on our data, we propose that the anguibactin biosynthesis and transport cluster in the V. anguillarum pJM1 plasmid have likely evolved from the chromosome cluster of V. harveyi or vice versa.	1
Title: Co-Occurrence of Listeria spp. and Spoilage Associated Microbiota During Meat Processing Due to Cross-Contamination Events Abstract: A large part of foodborne outbreaks related to Listeria monocytogenes are linked to meat and meat products. Especially, recontamination of meat products and deli-meat during slicing, packaging, and repackaging is in the focus of food authorities. In that regard, L. monocytogenes persistence in multi-species biofilms is one major issue, since they survive elaborate cleaning and disinfection measures. Here, we analyzed the microbial community structure throughout a meat processing facility using a combination of high-throughput full-length 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and traditional microbiological methods. Samples were taken at different stages during meat cutting as well as from multiple sites throughout the facility environment to capture the product and the environmental associated microbiota co-occurring with Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. The listeria testing revealed a widely disseminated contamination (50%; 88 of 176 samples were positive for Listeria spp. and 13.6%; 24 of 176 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes). The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing evidenced 14 heterogeneous L. monocytogenes profiles with PCR-serogroup 1/2a, 3a as most dominant. PFGE type MA3-17 contributed to the resilient microbiota of the facility environment and was related to environmental persistence. The core in-house microbiota consisted mainly of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter (Proteobacteria), Anaerobacillus, Bacillus (Firmicutes), and Chryseobacterium (Bacteroidota). While the overall microbial community structure clearly differed between product and environmental samples, we were able to discern correlation patterns regarding the presence/absence of Listeria spp. in both sample groups. Specifically, our longitudinal analysis revealed association of Listeria spp. with known biofilm-producing Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Janthinobacterium species on the meat samples. Similar patterns were also observed on the surface, indicating dispersal of microorganisms from this multispecies biofilm. Our data provided a better understanding of the built environment microbiome in the meat processing context and promoted more effective options for targeted disinfection in the analyzed facility.	0
Title: Restricted expression of Epstein-Barr virus latent genes in murine B cells derived from embryonic stem cells Abstract: Background:                       Several human malignancies are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and more than 95% of the adult human population carries this virus lifelong. EBV efficiently infects human B cells and persists in this cellular compartment latently. EBV-infected B cells become activated and growth transformed, express a characteristic set of viral latent genes, and acquire the status of proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines in vitro. Because EBV infects only primate cells, it has not been possible to establish a model of infection in immunocompetent rodents. Such a model would be most desirable in order to study EBV's pathogenesis and latency in a suitable and amenable host.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       We stably introduced recombinant EBV genomes into mouse embryonic stem cells and induced their differentiation to B cells in vitro to develop the desired model. In vitro differentiated murine B cells maintained the EBV genomes but expression of viral genes was restricted to the latent membrane proteins (LMPs). In contrast to human B cells, EBV's nuclear antigens (EBNAs) were not expressed detectably and growth transformed murine B cells did not arise in vitro. Aberrant splicing and premature termination of EBNA mRNAs most likely prevented the expression of EBNA genes required for B-cell transformation.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Our findings indicate that fundamental differences in gene regulation between mouse and man might block the route towards a tractable murine model for EBV.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the verticillin biosynthetic gene cluster in Clonostachys rogersoniana Abstract: Verticillin is one of the dimeric epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) which are toxic secondary metabolites produced only by fungi. ETPs have received substantial attention since its complex molecular architecture and a wide range of biological activities. Although biosynthesis of the monomeric gliotoxin has been studied extensively, the biosynthetic pathway of dimeric ETPs is far from being studied. To investigate the biosynthesis of dimeric ETPs and expand our understanding of their dimerization, the verticillin biosynthetic gene cluster (ver) was identified and cloned from a genomic DNA fosmid library of the Cordyceps-colonizing fungus Clonostachys rogersoniana with the designed primers based on the sequence of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) ChaP which was predicted to be responsible for chaetocin biosynthesis in Chaetomium virescens. To validate it, the chaP homologous gene verP in the ver cluster was disrupted. HPLC-MS analysis demonstrated that the verP disruption mutant (ΔverP) completely abolished verticillin production, and it could be restored by introducing a copy of the wild-type verP gene. Further gene disruptions and chemical analysis demonstrated that most genes of this ver cluster were essential for verticillin biosynthesis. Intriguingly, disruption of verP almost abolished the conidiation of Clonostachys rogersoniana and it was partially restored by addition of the fermentation extract which contains verticillin, implying that verticillin or its intermediate plays a role in the Cordyceps-colonizing fungal morphological differentiation.	1
Title: Taxol Analogues Exhibit Differential Effects on Photoaffinity Labeling of β-Tubulin and the Multidrug Resistance Associated P-Glycoprotein Abstract: Several next-generation taxanes have been reported to possess high potency against Taxol-resistant cancer cell lines overexpressing βIII-tubulin and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), both of which are involved in drug resistance. Using a photoaffinity Taxol analogue, 2-( m-azidobenzoyl)taxol, two potent next-generation taxanes, SB-T-1214 and SB-CST-10202, exhibited distinct inhibitory effects on photolabeling of β-tubulin from different eukaryotic sources that differ in β-tubulin isotype composition. They also specifically inhibited photolabeling of P-gp, and the inhibitory effect correlated well with the steady-state accumulation of [3H]vinblastine in a multidrug resistant (MDR) cell line, SKVLB1. Several microtubule-stabilizing agents (MSAs)-resistant cell lines from the human ovarian cancer cell line Hey were isolated, and their MDR1 and βIII-tubulin levels determined. Distinct potencies of the two taxanes against different MSA-resistant cells expressing unique levels of MDR1 and βIII-tubulin were found. Cytotoxicity assays, done in the presence of verapamil, indicated that SB-T-1214 is a substrate, although not as good as Taxol, for P-gp. The mechanisms involved in drug resistance are multifactorial, and the effectiveness of new Taxol analogues depends on the interaction between the drugs and all possible targets; in this case the two major cellular targets are β-tubulin and P-gp.	0
Title: Characterisation of Streptomyces spheroides NovW and revision of its functional assignment to a dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 3-epimerase Abstract: Characterisation of recombinant Streptomyces spheroides NovW in vitro suggests that it is not a kinetically competent dual action dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase, but possesses only significant 3-epimerase activity.	1
Title: Going forward laterally: transmembrane passage of hydrophobic molecules through protein channel walls Abstract: Regular phospholipid bilayers do not pose efficient barriers for the transport of hydrophobic molecules. The outer membrane (OM) surrounding Gram-negative bacteria is a nontypical, asymmetric bilayer with an outer layer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The sugar molecules of the LPS layer prevent spontaneous diffusion of hydrophobic molecules across the OM. As regular OM channels such as porins do not allow passage of hydrophobic molecules, specialized OM transport proteins are required for their uptake. Such proteins, exemplified by channels of the FadL family, transport their substrates according to a lateral diffusion mechanism. Here, substrates diffuse from the lumen of the beta-barrel laterally into the OM, through a stable opening in the wall of the barrel. In this way, the lipopolysaccharide barrier is bypassed and, by depositing the substrates into the OM, a driving force for uptake is provided. Lateral diffusion through protein channel walls also occurs in alpha-helical inner membrane proteins, and could represent a widespread mechanism for proteins that transport and interact with hydrophobic substrates.	0
Title: Identification of histone deacetylase inhibitors with benzoylhydrazide scaffold that selectively inhibit class I histone deacetylases Abstract: Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) hold considerable therapeutic promise as clinical anticancer therapies. However, currently known HDACi exhibit limited isoform specificity, off-target activity, and undesirable pharmaceutical properties. Thus, HDACi with new chemotypes are needed to overcome these limitations. Here, we identify a class of HDACi with a previously undescribed benzoylhydrazide scaffold that is selective for the class I HDACs. These compounds are competitive inhibitors with a fast-on/slow-off HDAC-binding mechanism. We show that the lead compound, UF010, inhibits cancer cell proliferation via class I HDAC inhibition. This causes global changes in protein acetylation and gene expression, resulting in activation of tumor suppressor pathways and concurrent inhibition of several oncogenic pathways. The isotype selectivity coupled with interesting biological activities in suppressing tumor cell proliferation support further preclinical development of the UF010 class of compounds for potential therapeutic applications.	0
Title: Chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of homogeneous glycoforms of antibody Fc domain. Presence of a bisecting sugar moiety enhances the affinity of Fc to FcγIIIa receptor Abstract: Structurally well-defined IgG-Fc glycoforms are highly demanded for understanding the effects of glycosylation on an antibody's effector functions. We report in this paper chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of an array of homogeneous IgG-Fc glycoforms. The chemoenzymatic approach consists of the chemical synthesis of defined N-glycan oxazolines as donor substrates, the expression of the Fc domain in a CHO cell line in the presence of an α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, and an endoglycosidase-catalyzed glycosylation of the deglycosylated Fc domain (GlcNAc-Fc homodimer) with the synthetic glycan oxazolines. The enzyme from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) was found to be remarkably efficient to take various modified N-glycan core oxazolines, including the bisecting sugar-containing derivatives, for Fc glycosylation remodeling, resulting in the formation of the corresponding homogeneous Fc glycoforms. Nevertheless, neither Endo-A nor the Mucor hiemalis endoglycosidase mutants (EndoM-N175A and EndoM-N175Q) were able to transfer full-length complex-type N-glycan to the Fc domain, implicating the limitations of these two enzymes in Fc glycosylation remodeling. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies with the synthetic IgG-Fc glycoforms unambiguously proved that the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc moiety could significantly enhance the binding of Fc to FcγRIIIa, the activating Fcγ receptor, independent of Fc core-fucosylation. Interestingly, the Fc glycoforms carrying an unusual bisecting sugar moiety such as a mannose or a LacNAc moiety also demonstrated enhanced affinity to FcγRIIIa. On the orther hand, the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc or core-fucosylation had little effect on the affinity of Fc to the inhibitory Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIb. Our experimental data also showed that the α-linked mannose residues in the pentasaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 core was essential to maintain a high affinity of Fc to both FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb. The synthetic homogeneous Fc glycoforms thus provide a useful tool for elucidating how a fine Fc N-glycan structure precisely affects the function of the Fc domain.	0
Title: Protein Patterns and Oscillations on Lipid Monolayers and in Microdroplets Abstract: The Min proteins from E.coli position the bacterial cell-division machinery through pole-to-pole oscillations. In vitro, Min protein self-organization can be reconstituted in the presence of a lipid membrane as a catalytic surface. However, Min dynamics have so far not been reconstituted in fully membrane-enclosed volumes. Microdroplets interfaced by lipid monolayers were employed as a simple 3D mimic of cellular compartments to reconstitute Min protein oscillations. We demonstrate that lipid monolayers are sufficient to fulfil the catalytic role of the membrane and thus represent a facile platform to investigate Min protein regulated dynamics of the cell-division protein FtsZ-mts. In particular, we show that droplet containers reveal distinct Min oscillation modes, and reveal a dependence of FtsZ-mts structures on compartment size. Finally, co-reconstitution of Min proteins and FtsZ-mts in droplets yields antagonistic localization, thus demonstrating that droplets indeed support the analysis of complex bacterial self-organization in confined volumes.	0
Title: High-throughput bead-based identification of structure-switching aptamer beacons Abstract: We describe a new platform to identify structure-switching DNA beacon aptamers, which detect small molecules in a specific manner. By clonally amplifying a DNA library designed to fluoresce in response to binding events onto microbeads, aptamer beacons can be selected by stringent fluorescence-assisted sorting. We validated this method by isolating known and novel anti-steroid aptamers from two separate DNA libraries that were structurally enriched with three-way junctions. Importantly, aptamers were retrieved in only a few (three) rounds of selection by this approach and did not require further optimization, significantly streamlining the process of beacon development.	0
Title: Identification of homophenylalanine biosynthetic genes from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 and application to its microbial production by Escherichia coli Abstract: L-Homophenylalanine (L-Hph) is a useful chiral building block for synthesis of several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the novel proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. While the chemoenzymatic route of synthesis is fully developed, we investigated microbial production of L-Hph to explore the possibility of a more efficient and sustainable approach to L-Hph production. We hypothesized that L-Hph is synthesized from L-Phe via a mechanism homologous to 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid conversion to 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid during leucine biosynthesis. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we found three putative homophenylalanine biosynthesis genes, hphA (Npun_F2464), hphB (Npun_F2457), and hphCD (Npun_F2458), in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102, located around the gene cluster responsible for anabaenopeptin biosynthesis. We constructed Escherichia coli strains harboring hphABCD-expressing plasmids and achieved the fermentative production of L-Hph from L-Phe. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of the genes responsible for homophenylalanine synthesis in any organism. Furthermore, to improve the low conversion efficiency of the initial strain, we optimized the expression of hphA, hphB, and hphCD, which increased the yield to ∼630 mg/liter. The L-Hph biosynthesis and L-Leu biosynthesis genes from E. coli were also compared. This analysis revealed that HphB has comparatively relaxed substrate specificity and can perform the function of LeuB, but HphA and HphCD show tight substrate specificity and cannot complement the LeuA and LeuC/LeuD functions, and vice versa. Finally, the range of substrate tolerance of the L-Hph-producing strain was examined, which showed that m-fluorophenylalanine, o-fluorophenylalanine, and L-tyrosine were accepted as substrates and that the corresponding homoamino acids were generated.	1
Title: Distinct calcium-dependent pathways of epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation and PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells Abstract: Recently, we have demonstrated that in PC12 cells activation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in response to membrane depolarization or bradykinin is mediated by calcium-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we address the question whether Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) has a role in the EGFR transactivation signal. Using compounds that selectively interfere with either CaM kinase activity or calmodulin function, we show that KCl-mediated membrane depolarization-triggered, but not bradykinin-mediated signals involve CaM kinase function upstream of the EGFR. Although both depolarization-induced calcium influx and bradykinin stimulation of PC12 cells were found to induce c-fos transcription through EGFR activation, the former signal is CaM kinase-dependent and the latter was shown to be independent. As PYK2 is also activated upon elevation of intracellular calcium, we investigated the potential involvement of this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in EGFR transactivation. Interestingly, we observed that inhibition of CaM kinase activity in PC12 cells abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 upon KCl but not bradykinin treatment. Nevertheless, PYK2 activation in response to both stimuli appeared to be mediated by pathways parallel to EGFR transactivation. Our data demonstrate the existence of two distinct calcium-dependent mechanisms leading either to EGFR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated activation or to PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Both pathways either in concert or independently might contribute to the definition of biological responses in neuronal cell types.	0
Title: Synthesis of (2S)-2-amino-7,8-epoxyoctanoic acid and structure of its metal-bridging complex with human arginase I Abstract: The synthesis of (2S)-2-amino-7,8-epoxyoctanoic acid is reported along with the X-ray crystal structure of its complex with human arginase I, revealing unique coordination interactions with two manganese ions in the enzyme active site.	0
Title: Synthesis of alpha-L-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates (tNTPs) Abstract: [structure: see text] The alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates of T, G, and D (tTTP, tGTP, and tDTP) were synthesized from the described 2'-O-DMT-protected derivatives using the Eckstein method, while the corresponding C derivative (tCTP) was prepared from the 2'-O-acetyl derivative. The prepared alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, despite being one carbon shorter than the native 2'-deoxyfuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, are effective substrates for selected DNA polymerases.	0
Title: A genetics-free method for high-throughput discovery of cryptic microbial metabolites Abstract: Bacteria contain an immense untapped trove of novel secondary metabolites in the form of 'silent' biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These can be identified bioinformatically but are not expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions. Methods to access their products would dramatically expand the pool of bioactive compounds. We report a universal high-throughput method for activating silent BGCs in diverse microorganisms. Our approach relies on elicitor screening to induce the secondary metabolome of a given strain and imaging mass spectrometry to visualize the resulting metabolomes in response to ~500 conditions. Because it does not require challenging genetic, cloning, or culturing procedures, this method can be used with both sequenced and unsequenced bacteria. We demonstrate the power of the approach by applying it to diverse bacteria and report the discovery of nine cryptic metabolites with potentially therapeutic bioactivities, including a new glycopeptide chemotype with potent inhibitory activity against a pathogenic virus.	1
Title: Stabilities of lyophilized Staphylococcus aureus typing bacteriophages Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages (25 phages) were lyophilized in aliquots 12 to 18 years ago and stored in vacuo at -20 degrees C. Eight viruses each lost one log titer, while seventeen retained the original titers. The use of lyophilized phages provided more reproducible phage typing and reduced by 75% the complexity and cost. This important test is thus made feasible for more laboratories.	0
Title: Long-chain N-acyl amino acid synthases are linked to the putative PEP-CTERM/exosortase protein-sorting system in Gram-negative bacteria Abstract: Clones that encode the biosynthesis of long-chain N-acyl amino acids are frequently recovered from activity-based screens of soil metagenomic libraries. Members of a diverse set of enzymes referred to as N-acyl amino acid synthases are responsible for the production of all metagenome-derived N-acyl amino acids characterized to date. Based on the frequency at which N-acyl amino acid synthase genes have been identified from metagenomic samples, related genes are expected to be common throughout the global bacterial metagenome. Homologs of metagenome-derived N-acyl amino acid synthase genes are scarce, however, within the sequenced genomes of cultured bacterial species. Toward the goal of understanding the role(s) played by N-acyl amino acids in environmental bacteria, we looked for conserved genetic features that are positionally linked to metagenome-derived N-acyl amino acid synthase genes. This analysis revealed that N-acyl amino acid synthase genes are frequently found adjacent to genes predicted to encode PEP-CTERM motif-containing proteins and, in some cases, other conserved elements of the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system. Although relatively little is known about the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, its core components are believed to represent the putative Gram-negative equivalent of the LPXTG/sortase protein-sorting system of Gram-positive bacteria. During the course of this investigation, we were able to provide evidence that an uncharacterized family of hypothetical acyltransferases, which had previously been linked to the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system by bioinformatics, is a new family of N-acyl amino acid synthases that is widely distributed among the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system-containing Proteobacteria.	1
Title: Structural disorder in expanding the functionome of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases Abstract: Over the past decade, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) have emerged as a new class of regulatory proteins with widespread functions beyond their classic role in protein synthesis. The functional expansion concurs with the incorporation of new domains and motifs to AARSs and coincides with the emergence of the multi-synthetase complex (MSC) during the course of eukaryotic evolution. Notably, the new domains in AARSs are often found to be structurally disordered or to be linked to the enzyme cores via unstructured linkers. We performed bioinformatic analysis and classified the 20 human cytoplasmic AARSs into three groups based on their propensities for structural disorder. The analysis also suggests that, while the assembly of the MSC mainly involves ordered structural domains, structurally disordered regions play an important role in activating and expanding the regulatory functions of AARSs.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of macrolactam BE-14106 involves two distinct PKS systems and amino acid processing enzymes for generation of the aminoacyl starter unit Abstract: BE-14106 is a macrocyclic lactam with an acyl side chain previously identified in a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. The gene cluster for BE-14106 biosynthesis was cloned from a Streptomyces strain newly isolated from marine sediments collected in the Trondheimsfjord (Norway). Bioinformatics and experimental analyses of the genes in the cluster suggested an unusual mechanism for assembly of the molecule. Biosynthesis of the aminoacyl starter apparently involves the concerted action of a distinct polyketide synthase (PKS) system and several enzymes that activate and process an amino acid. The resulting starter unit is loaded onto a second PKS complex, which completes the synthesis of the macrolactam ring. Gene inactivation experiments, enzyme assays with heterologously expressed proteins, and feeding studies supported the proposed model for the biosynthesis and provided new insights into the assembly of macrolactams with acyl side chain.	1
Title: NIK1-mediated translation suppression functions as a plant antiviral immunity mechanism Abstract: Plants and plant pathogens are subject to continuous co-evolutionary pressure for dominance, and the outcomes of these interactions can substantially impact agriculture and food security. In virus-plant interactions, one of the major mechanisms for plant antiviral immunity relies on RNA silencing, which is often suppressed by co-evolving virus suppressors, thus enhancing viral pathogenicity in susceptible hosts. In addition, plants use the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) domain-containing resistance proteins, which recognize viral effectors to activate effector-triggered immunity in a defence mechanism similar to that employed in non-viral infections. Unlike most eukaryotic organisms, plants are not known to activate mechanisms of host global translation suppression to fight viruses. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that the constitutive activation of NIK1, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP), leads to global translation suppression and translocation of the downstream component RPL10 to the nucleus, where it interacts with a newly identified MYB-like protein, L10-INTERACTING MYB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (LIMYB), to downregulate translational machinery genes fully. LIMYB overexpression represses ribosomal protein genes at the transcriptional level, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition, decreased viral messenger RNA association with polysome fractions and enhanced tolerance to begomovirus. By contrast, the loss of LIMYB function releases the repression of translation-related genes and increases susceptibility to virus infection. Therefore, LIMYB links immune receptor LRR-RLK activation to global translation suppression as an antiviral immunity strategy in plants.	0
Title: Release of free DNA by membrane-impaired bacterial aerosols due to aerosolization and air sampling Abstract: We report here that stress experienced by bacteria due to aerosolization and air sampling can result in severe membrane impairment, leading to the release of DNA as free molecules. Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria were aerosolized and then either collected directly into liquid or collected using other collection media and then transferred into liquid. The amount of DNA released was quantified as the cell membrane damage index (ID), i.e., the number of 16S rRNA gene copies in the supernatant liquid relative to the total number in the bioaerosol sample. During aerosolization by a Collison nebulizer, the ID of E. coli and B. atrophaeus in the nebulizer suspension gradually increased during 60 min of continuous aerosolization. We found that the ID of bacteria during aerosolization was statistically significantly affected by the material of the Collison jar (glass > polycarbonate; P < 0.001) and by the bacterial species (E. coli > B. atrophaeus; P < 0.001). When E. coli was collected for 5 min by filtration, impaction, and impingement, its ID values were within the following ranges: 0.051 to 0.085, 0.16 to 0.37, and 0.068 to 0.23, respectively; when it was collected by electrostatic precipitation, the ID values (0.011 to 0.034) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those with other sampling methods. Air samples collected inside an equine facility for 2 h by filtration and impingement exhibited ID values in the range of 0.30 to 0.54. The data indicate that the amount of cell damage during bioaerosol sampling and the resulting release of DNA can be substantial and that this should be taken into account when analyzing bioaerosol samples.	0
Title: Repurposing the Pummerer Rearrangement: Determination of Methionine Sulfoxides in Peptides Abstract: The reversible oxidation of methionine residues in proteins has emerged as a biologically important post-translational modification. However, detection and quantitation of methionine sulfoxide in proteins is difficult. Our aim is to develop a method for specifically derivatizing methionine sulfoxide residues. We report a Pummerer rearrangement of methionine sulfoxide treated sequentially with trimethylsilyl chloride and then 2-mercaptoimidazole or pyridine-2-thiol to produce a dithioacetal product. This derivative is stable to standard mass spectrometry conditions, and its formation identified oxidized methionine residues. The scope and requirements of dithioacetal formation are reported for methionine sulfoxide and model substrates. The reaction intermediates have been investigated by computational techniques and by 13 C NMR spectroscopy. These provide evidence for an α-chlorinated intermediate. The derivatization allows for detection and quantitation of methionine sulfoxide in proteins by mass spectrometry and potentially by immunochemical methods.	0
Title: Steric Enforcement of cis-Epoxide Formation in the Radical C-O-Coupling Reaction by Which ( S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonate Epoxidase (HppE) Produces Fosfomycin Abstract: (S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonate [(S)-2-HPP, 1] epoxidase (HppE) reduces H2O2 at its nonheme-iron cofactor to install the oxirane "warhead" of the antibiotic fosfomycin. The net replacement of the C1 pro-R hydrogen of 1 by its C2 oxygen, with inversion of configuration at C1, yields the cis-epoxide of the drug [(1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonic acid (cis-Fos, 2)]. Here we show that HppE achieves ∼95% selectivity for C1 inversion and cis-epoxide formation via steric guidance of a radical-coupling mechanism. Published structures of the HppE·FeII·1 and HppE·ZnII·2 complexes reveal distinct pockets for C3 of the substrate and product and identify four hydrophobic residues-Leu120, Leu144, Phe182, and Leu193-close to C3 in one of the complexes. Replacement of Leu193 in the substrate C3 pocket with the bulkier Phe enhances stereoselectivity (cis:trans ∼99:1), whereas the Leu120Phe substitution in the product C3 pocket diminishes it (∼82:18). Retention of C1 configuration and trans-epoxide formation become predominant with the bulk-reducing Phe182Ala substitution in the substrate C3 pocket (∼13:87), trifluorination of C3 (∼23:77), or both (∼1:99). The effect of C3 trifluorination is counteracted by the more constrained substrate C3 pockets in the Leu193Phe (∼56:44) and Leu144Phe/Leu193Phe (∼90:10) variants. The ability of HppE to epoxidize substrate analogues bearing halogens at C3, C1, or both is inconsistent with a published hypothesis of polar cyclization via a C1 carbocation. Rather, specific enzyme-substrate contacts drive inversion of the C1 radical-as proposed in a recent computational study-to direct formation of the more potently antibacterial cis-epoxide by radicaloid C-O coupling.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Aspergillus hancockii Unearths Cryptic Polyketide Hancockinone A Featuring a Prenylated 6/6/6/5 Carbocyclic Skeleton Abstract: Activation of a cryptic polyketide synthase gene cluster hkn from Aspergillus hancockii via overexpression of the gene-cluster-specific transcription factor HknR led to the discovery of a novel polycyclic metabolite, which we named hancockinone A. The compound features an unprecedented prenylated 6/6/6/5 tetracarbocyclic skeleton and shows moderate antibacterial activity. Heterologous expression, substrate feeding, and in vitro assays confirmed the role of cytochrome P450 HknE in constructing the five-membered ring in hancockinone A from the precursor neosartoricin B.	1
Title: Semisynthesis and Evaluation of Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Cassane-Type Diterpenoid Taepeenin F and of Some Synthetic Intermediates Abstract: A new strategy for the semisynthesis of the aromatic cassane-type diterpene taepeenin F (6) is reported. The introduction of the methyl group at C-14, characteristic of the target compound, was achieved via dienone 13, easily prepared from abietic acid (10), the major compound in renewable rosin. Biological assays of selected compounds are reported. The antiproliferative activity against HT29, B16-F10, and HepG2 tumor cell lines has been investigated. Salicylaldehyde 21 was the most active compound (IC50 = 7.72 μM). Products 16 and 21 displayed apoptotic effects in B16-F10 cells, with total apoptosis rates of 46 and 38.4%, respectively. This apoptotic process involves a significant arrest of the B16-F10 cell cycle, blocking the G0/G1 phase. Dienone 16 did not cause any loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while salicylaldehyde 21 caused a partial loss of the MMP. The anti-inflammatory activity of the selected compounds was investigated with the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. All compounds showed potent NO inhibition, with percentages between 80 and 99% at subcytotoxic concentrations. Dienone 16 inhibited LPS-induced differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells, by increasing the proportion of cells in the S phase. In addition, salicylaldehyde 21 had effects on the cell cycle, recovering the cells from the G0/G1 full arrest produced in response to LPS action.	0
Title: Isolation, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of an unusual hydroxamic acid ester-containing siderophore from Actinosynnema mirum Abstract: In this study we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and biosynthesis of mirubactin (1), a siderophore containing an unprecedented chemical functionality in natural products, namely, an O-acyl hydroxamic acid ester. Mirubactin represents the first siderophore isolated from the genus Actinosynnema and the first natural product produced by Actinosynnema mirum whose biosynthetic gene cluster could be identified. Structure elucidation was accomplished through a combination of spectroscopic (NMR, IR, and UV/vis) and mass spectrometric methods and revealed the presence of an unusual ester bond between the δ-N-hydroxyl group of δ-N-formyl-δ-N-hydroxyornithine and a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate moiety. Bioinformatic analysis of the A. mirum genome and subsequent biochemical characterization of the putative biosynthetic machinery identified the gene cluster responsible for mirubactin assembly. The proposed biosynthesis of mirubactin comprises the iterative use of a stand-alone carrier-protein-bound substrate, as well as an ester-bond-forming step catalyzed by a C-terminal condensation domain, thus revealing an interesting system for further biochemical studies to gain a deeper understanding of nonribosomal peptide synthetase-catalyzed siderophore biosynthesis.	1
Title: Structure, function and biosynthesis of carotenoids in the moderately halophilic bacterium Halobacillus halophilus Abstract: Inhibitor studies and mutant analysis revealed a C(30) pathway via 4,4'-diapophytoene and 4,4'-diaponeurosporene to 4,4'-diaponeursoporene-4-oic acid esters related to staphyloxanthin in Halobacillus halophilus. Six genes may be involved in this biosynthetic pathway and could be found in two adjacent gene clusters. Two genes of this pathway could be functionally assigned by functional pathway complementation as a 4,4'-diapophytoene synthase and a 4,4'-diapophytoene desaturase gene. These genes were organized in two operons together with two putative oxidase genes, a glycosylase and an acyl transferase ortholog. Pigment mutants were obtained by chemical mutagenesis. Carotenoid analysis showed that a white mutant accumulated 4,4'-diapophytoene due to a block in desaturation. In a yellow mutant carotenogenesis was blocked at the stage of 4,4'-diaponeurosporene and in an orange mutant at the stage of 4,4'-diaponeurosporene-4-oic acid. The protective function of these pigments could be demonstrated for H. halophilus after inhibition of carotenoid synthesis by initiation of oxidative stress. A degree of oxidative stress which still allowed 50% growth of carotenogenic cells resulted in the death of the cells devoid of colored carotenoids.	1
Title: Investigation on the Evolution of Shiga Toxin-Converting Phages Based on Whole Genome Sequencing Abstract: Bacteriophages are pivotal elements in the dissemination of virulence genes. The main virulence determinants of Shiga Toxin producing E. coli, Shiga Toxins (Stx), are encoded by genes localized in the genome of lambdoid bacteriophages. Stx comprise two antigenically different types, Stx1 and Stx2, further divided into subtypes. Among these, certain Stx2 subtypes appear to be more commonly occurring in the most severe forms of the STEC disease, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study aimed at obtaining insights on the evolution of Stx2 bacteriophages, due to their relevance in public health, and we report here on the analysis of the genomic structure of Stx2 converting phages in relation with the known reservoir of the E. coli strains harboring them. Stx2-converting phages conveying the genes encoding different stx2 subtypes have been isolated from STEC strains and their whole genomes have been sequenced, analyzed and compared to those of other Stx2 phages available in the public domain. The phages' regions containing the stx2 genes have been analyzed in depth allowing to make inference on the possible mechanisms of selection and maintenance of certain Stx2 phages in the reservoir. The "stx regions" of different stx2 gene subtypes grouped into three different evolutionary lines in the comparative analysis, reflecting the frequency with which these subtypes are found in different animal niches, suggesting that the colonization of specific reservoir by STEC strains could be influenced by the Stx phage that they carry. Noteworthy, we could identify the presence of nanS-p gene exclusively in the "stx regions" of the phages identified in STEC strains commonly found in cattle. As a matter of fact, this gene encodes an esterase capable of metabolizing sialic acids produced by submaxillary glands of bovines and present in great quantities in their gastrointestinal tract.	0
Title: Precisely Tailoring Upconversion Dynamics via Energy Migration in Core-Shell Nanostructures Abstract: Upconversion emission dynamics have long been believed to be determined by the activator and its interaction with neighboring sensitizers. Herein this assumption is, however, shown to be invalid for nanostructures. We demonstrate that excitation energy migration greatly affects upconversion emission dynamics. "Dopant ions' spatial separation" nanostructures are designed as model systems and the intimate link between the random nature of energy migration and upconversion emission time behavior is unraveled by theoretical modelling and confirmed spectroscopically. Based on this new fundamental insight, we have successfully realized fine control of upconversion emission time behavior (either rise or decay process) by tuning the energy migration paths in various specifically designed nanostructures. This result is significant for applications of this type of materials in super resolution spectroscopy, high-density data storage, anti-counterfeiting, and biological imaging.	0
Title: Genome-Mined Diels-Alderase Catalyzes Formation of the cis-Octahydrodecalins of Varicidin A and B Abstract: Pericyclases are an emerging family of enzymes catalyzing pericyclic reactions. A class of lipocalin-like enzymes recently characterized as Diels-Alderases (DAses) catalyze decalin formation through intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reactions between electron-rich dienes and electron-deficient dienophiles. Using this class of enzyme as a beacon for genome mining, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium variabile and identified that it encodes for the biosynthesis of varicidin A (1), a new antifungal natural product containing a cis-octahydrodecalin core. Biochemical analysis reveals a carboxylative deactivation strategy used in varicidin biosynthesis to suppress the nonenzymatic IMDA reaction of an early acyclic intermediate that favors trans-decalin formation. A P450 oxidizes the reactive intermediate to yield a relatively unreactive combination of an electron-deficient diene and an electron-deficient dienophile. The DAse PvhB catalyzes the final stage IMDA on the carboxylated intermediate to form the cis-decalin that is important for the antifungal activity.	1
Title: Draft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. oscitans DS 12.976, Producer of the Aminocoumarin Antibiotic Clorobiocin Abstract: Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. oscitans DS 12.976 is the producer of the gyrase-inhibiting aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin. Here, we present a draft genome sequence of this strain, in which we identified the clorobiocin gene cluster as well as an unusually high number (43) of further putative secondary metabolite clusters.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Tasikamides via Pathway Coupling and Diazonium-Mediated Hydrazone Formation Abstract: Naturally occurring hydrazones are rare despite the ubiquitous usage of synthetic hydrazones in the preparation of organic compounds and functional materials. In this study, we discovered a family of novel microbial metabolites (tasikamides) that share a unique cyclic pentapeptide scaffold. Surprisingly, tasikamides A-C (1-3) contain a hydrazone group (C═N─N) that joins the cyclic peptide scaffold to an alkyl 5-hydroxylanthranilate (AHA) moiety. We discovered that the biosynthesis of 1-3 requires two discrete gene clusters, with one encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for assembling the cyclic peptide scaffold and another encoding the AHA-synthesizing pathway. The AHA gene cluster encodes three ancillary enzymes that catalyze the diazotization of AHA to yield an aryl diazonium species (diazo-AHA). The electrophilic diazo-AHA undergoes nonenzymatic Japp-Klingemann coupling with a β-keto aldehyde-containing cyclic peptide precursor to furnish the hydrazone group and yield 1-3. The studies together unraveled a novel mechanism whereby specialized metabolites are formed by the coupling of two biosynthetic pathways via an unprecedented in vivo Japp-Klingemann reaction. The findings raise the prospect of exploiting the arylamine-diazotizing enzymes (AAD) for the in vivo synthesis of aryl compounds and modification of biological macromolecules.	1
Title: Engineering anthracycline biosynthesis toward angucyclines Abstract: The biosynthesis pathways of two anthracyclines, nogalamycin and aclacinomycin, were directed toward angucyclines by using an angucycline-specific cyclase, pgaF, isolated from a silent antibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster. Addition of pgaF to a gene cassette that harbored the early biosynthesis genes of nogalamycin resulted in the production of two known angucyclinone metabolites, rabelomycin and its precursor, UWM6. Substrate flexibility of pgaF was demonstrated by replacement of the nogalamycin minimal polyketide synthase genes in the gene cassette with the equivalent aclacinomycin genes together with aknE2 and aknF, which specify the unusual propionate starter unit in aclacinomycin biosynthesis. This modification led to the production of a novel angucyclinone, MM2002, in which the expected ethyl side chain was incorporated into the fourth ring.	1
Title: Identification of the verruculogen prenyltransferase FtmPT3 by a combination of chemical, bioinformatic and biochemical approaches Abstract: Previous studies showed that verruculogen is the end product of a biosynthetic gene cluster for fumitremorgin-type alkaloids in Aspergillus fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri. In this study, we isolated fumitremorgin A from N. fischeri. This led to the identification of the responsible gene, ftmPT3, for O-prenylation of an aliphatic hydroxy group in verruculogen. This gene was found at a different location in the genome of N. fischeri than the identified cluster. The coding sequence of ftmPT3 was amplified by fusion PCR and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme product of the soluble His(8)-FtmPT3 with verruculogen and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) was identified unequivocally as fumitremorgin A by NMR and MS analyses. K(M) values of FtmPT3 were determined for verruculogen and DMAPP at 5.7 and 61.5 μM, respectively. Average turnover number (k(cat)) was calculated from kinetic parameters of verruculogen and DMAPP to be 0.069 s(-1). FtmPT3 also accepted biosynthetic precursors of fumitremorgin A, for example, fumitremorgin B and 12,13-dihydroxyfumitremorgin C, as substrates and catalyses their prenylation.	1
Title: Echinocandin B biosynthesis: a biosynthetic cluster from Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 8112 and reassembly of the subclusters Ecd and Hty from Aspergillus pachycristatus NRRL 11440 reveals a single coherent gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Echinocandins are nonribosomal lipopeptides produced by ascommycete fungi. Due to their strong inhibitory effect on fungal cell wall biosynthesis and lack of human toxicity, they have been developed to an important class of antifungal drugs. Since 2012, the biosynthetic gene clusters of most of the main echinocandin variants have been characterized. Especially the comparison of the clusters allows a deeper insight for the biosynthesis of these complex structures.                  Results:                       In the genome of the echinocandin B producer Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 8112 we have identified a gene cluster (Ani) that encodes echinocandin biosynthesis. Sequence analyses showed that Ani is clearly delimited from the genomic context and forms a monophyletic lineage with the other echinocandin gene clusters. Importantly, we found that the disjunct genomic location of the echinocandin B gene cluster in A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 on two separate subclusters, Ecd and Hty, at two loci was likely an artifact of genome misassembly in the absence of a reference sequence. We show that both sequences can be aligned resulting a single cluster with a gene arrangement collinear compared to other clusters of Aspergillus section Nidulantes. The reassembled gene cluster (Ecd/Hty) is identical to a putative gene cluster (AE) that was previously deposited at the NCBI as a sequence from A. delacroxii NRRL 3860. PCR amplification of a part of the gene cluster resulted a sequence that was very similar (97 % identity), but not identical to that of AE.                  Conclusions:                       The Echinocandin B biosynthetic cluster from A. nidulans NRRL 8112 (Ani) is particularly similar to that of A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 (Ecd/Hty). Ecd/Hty was originally reported as two disjunct sub-clusters Ecd and Hty, but is in fact a continuous sequence with the same gene order as in Ani. According to sequences of PCR products amplified from genomic DNA, the echinocandin B producer A. delacroxii NRRL 3860 is closely related to A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440. A PCR-product from the gene cluster was very similar, but clearly distinct from the sequence published for A. delacroxii NRRL 3860 at the NCBI (No. AB720074). As the NCBI entry is virtually identical with the re-assembled Ecd/Hty cluster, it is likely that it originates from A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440 rather than A. delacroxii NRRL 3860.	1
Title: Topology-directed design of porous organic frameworks and their advanced applications Abstract: Porous organic frameworks (POFs) as an important subclass of nanoporous materials are of great interest in materials science. In recent years, the discovery and creation of POFs with excellent properties for advanced applications have attracted much attention and intensive efforts have been contributed to this field. As a result, the design of materials with multi-functionalities is an ever-pursued dream of materials scientists and engineers. In this respect, a new concept based on topology chemistry is introduced for the rational and targeted synthesis of POF materials. The present feature article provides an overview of the relationship between building blocks or starting monomers, underlying topological nets, and pre-determined structures. Several important nets are included successively from one to three dimensions. In addition, special emphasis is given to the advanced applications of designed POF materials in the current paper.	0
Title: Discovery and characterization of a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase in a lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Lasso peptides belong to a peculiar family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)-natural products with an unusual isopeptide-bonded slipknot structure. Except for assembling of this unusual lasso fold, several further post-translational modifications of lasso peptides, including C-terminal methylation, phosphorylation/poly-phosphorylation, citrullination, and acetylation, have been reported recently. However, most of their biosynthetic logic have not been elucidated except the phosphorylated paeninodin lasso peptide. Herein, we identified two novel lassomycin-like lasso peptide biosynthetic pathways and, for the first time, characterized a novel C-terminal peptide carboxyl methyltransferase involved in these pathways. Our investigations revealed that this new family of methyltransferase could specifically methylate the C terminus of precursor peptide substrates, eventually leading to lassomycin-like C-terminal methylated lasso peptides. Our studies offer another rare insight into the extraordinary strategies of chemical diversification adopted by lasso peptide biosynthetic machinery and predicated two valuable sources for methylated lasso peptide discovery.	1
Title: Fusarium Tri4 encodes a key multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for four consecutive oxygenation steps in trichothecene biosynthesis Abstract: Fusarium Tri4 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) for hydroxylation at C-2 of the first committed intermediate trichodiene (TDN) in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes. To examine whether this CYP further participates in subsequent oxygenation steps leading to isotrichotriol (4), we engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for de novo production of the early intermediates by introducing cDNAs of Fusarium graminearum Tri5 (FgTri5 encoding TDN synthase) and Tri4 (FgTri4). From a culture of the engineered yeast grown on induction medium (final pH 2.7), we identified two intermediates, 2alpha-hydroxytrichodiene (1) and 12,13-epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2alpha-ol (2), and a small amount of non-Fusarium trichothecene 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT). Other intermediates isotrichodiol (3) and 4 were identified in the transgenic yeasts grown on phosphate-buffered induction medium (final pH 5.5-6.0). When Trichothecium roseum Tri4 (TrTri4) was used in place of FgTri4, 4 was not detected in the culture. The three intermediates, 1, 2, and 3, were converted to 4,15-diacetylnivalenol (4,15-diANIV) when fed to a toxin-deficient mutant of F. graminearum with the FgTri4+ genetic background (viz., by introducing a FgTri5- mutation), but were not metabolized by an FgTri4- mutant. These results provide unambiguous evidence that FgTri4 encodes a multifunctional CYP for epoxidation at C-12,13, hydroxylation at C-11, and hydroxylation at C-3 in addition to hydroxylation at C-2.	1
Title: Refactoring the Concise Biosynthetic Pathway of Cyanogramide Unveils Spirooxindole Formation Catalyzed by a P450 Enzyme Abstract: Cyanogramide (1) from the marine actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6 features a unique spirooxindole skeleton and exhibits significant bioactivity to efficiently reverse drug resistance in tumor cells. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 in A. cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6 was identified and refactored by promoter engineering for heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor YF11, thereby enabling the production of 1 and five new derivatives. Interesting, four of them, including 1, were identified as enantiomeric mixtures in different ratios. The functions of tailoring enzymes, including two methyltransferases (CyaEF), and three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CyaGHI) were confirmed by gene inactivation and feeding experiments, leading to the elucidation of a concise biosynthetic pathway for 1. Notably, CyaH was biochemically verified to catalyze the formation of the spirooxindole skeleton in 1 through an unusual carbocation-mediated semipinacol-type rearrangement reaction.	1
Title: d-Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate is a common precursor for the heptoses of septacidin and hygromycin B Abstract: Seven-carbon-chain-containing sugars exist in several groups of important bacterial natural products. Septacidin represents a group of l-heptopyranoses containing nucleoside antibiotics with antitumor, antifungal, and pain-relief activities. Hygromycin B, an aminoglycoside anthelmintic agent used in swine and poultry farming, represents a group of d-heptopyranoses-containing antibiotics. To date, very little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds. Here we sequenced the genome of the septacidin producer and identified the septacidin gene cluster by heterologous expression. After determining the boundaries of the septacidin gene cluster, we studied septacidin biosynthesis by in vivo and in vitro experiments and discovered that SepB, SepL, and SepC can convert d-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S-7-P) to ADP-l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose, exemplifying the involvement of ADP-sugar in microbial natural product biosynthesis. Interestingly, septacidin, a secondary metabolite from a gram-positive bacterium, shares the same ADP-heptose biosynthesis pathway with the gram-negative bacterium LPS. In addition, two acyltransferase-encoding genes sepD and sepH, were proposed to be involved in septacidin side-chain formation according to the intermediates accumulated in their mutants. In hygromycin B biosynthesis, an isomerase HygP can recognize S-7-P and convert it to ADP-d-glycero-β-d-altro-heptose together with GmhA and HldE, two enzymes from the Escherichia coli LPS heptose biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that the d-heptopyranose moiety of hygromycin B is also derived from S-7-P. Unlike the other S-7-P isomerases, HygP catalyzes consecutive isomerizations and controls the stereochemistry of both C2 and C3 positions.	1
Title: Characterization of variation in rumen methanogenic communities under different dietary and host feed efficiency conditions, as determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis Abstract: Understanding ruminal methanogens is essential for greenhouse gas mitigation, as well as for improving animal performance in the livestock industry. It has been speculated that ruminal methanogenic diversity affects host feed efficiency and results in differences in methane production. This study examined methanogenic profiles in the rumen using culture-independent PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis for 56 beef cattle which differed in feed efficiency, as well as diet (the cattle were fed a low-energy diet or a high-energy diet). The methanogenic PCR-DGGE profiles detected were greatly affected by diet, and the major pattern changed from a community containing predominantly Methanobrevibacter ruminantium NT7 with the low-energy diet to a community containing predominantly Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter sp. AbM4, and/or M. ruminantium NT7 with the high-energy diet. For each diet, the methanogenic PCR-DGGE pattern was strongly associated with the feed efficiency of the host. Diet-associated bands for Methanobrevibacter sp. AbM4 and M. smithii SM9 and a feed efficiency-related band for M. smithii PS were identified. The abundance of total methanogens was estimated by determining the numbers of copies of the 16S rRNA genes of methanogens. However, the size of the methanogen population did not correlate with differences in feed efficiency, diet, or metabolic measurements. Thus, the structure of the methanogenic community at the species or strain level may be more important for determining host feed efficiency under different dietary conditions.	0
Title: Analysis of two chromosomal regions adjacent to genes for a type II polyketide synthase involved in the biosynthesis of the antitumor polyketide mithramycin in Streptomyces argillaceus Abstract: Mithramycin is an aromatic antitumour polyketide synthesized by Streptomyces argillaceus. Two chromosomal regions located upstream and downstream of the locus for the mithramycin type II polyketide synthase were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of eight genes encoding three oxygenases (mtmOI, mtmOII and mtmOIII), three reductases (mtmTI, mtmTII and mtmTIII), a cyclase (mtm Y) and an acyl CoA ligase (mtmL). The three oxygenase genes were each inactivated by gene replacement. Inactivation of one of them (mtmOII) generated a non-producing mutant, while inactivation of the other two (mtmOl and mtmOIII) did not affect the biosynthesis of mithramycin. The mtmOII gene may code for an oxygenase responsible for the introduction of oxygen atoms at early steps in the biosynthesis of mithramycin leading to 4-demethylpremithramycinone. One of the reductases may be responsible for reductive cleavage of an intermediate from an enzyme and another for the reduction of a keto group in the side-chain of the mithramycin aglycon moiety. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway showing in particular the involvement of oxygenase MtmOII and of various other gene products in mithramycin biosynthesis is proposed.	1
Title: Identification of Novel Gymnodimines and Spirolides from the Marine Dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii Abstract: Cyclic imine toxins are neurotoxic, macrocyclic compounds produced by marine dinoflagellates. Mass spectrometric screenings of extracts from natural plankton assemblages revealed a high chemical diversity among this toxin class, yet only few toxins are structurally known. Here we report the structural characterization of four novel cyclic-imine toxins (two gymnodimines (GYMs) and two spirolides (SPXs)) from cultures of Alexandrium ostenfeldii. A GYM with m/z 510 (1) was identified as 16-desmethylGYM D. A GYM with m/z 526 was identified as the hydroxylated degradation product of (1) with an exocyclic methylene at C-17 and an allylic hydroxyl group at C-18. This compound was named GYM E (2). We further identified a SPX with m/z 694 as 20-hydroxy-13,19-didesmethylSPX C (10) and a SPX with m/z 696 as 20-hydroxy-13,19-didesmethylSPX D (11). This is the first report of GYMs without a methyl group at ring D and SPXs with hydroxyl groups at position C-20. These compounds can be conceived as derivatives of the same nascent polyketide chain, supporting the hypothesis that GYMs and SPXs are produced through common biosynthetic genes. Both novel GYMs 1 and 2 were detected in significant amounts in extracts from natural plankton assemblages (1: 447 pg; 2: 1250 pg; 11: 40 pg per mL filtered seawater respectively).	0
Title: Characterization of anti-BCG benz[α]anthraquinones and new siderophores from a Xinjiang desert-isolated rare actinomycete Nocardia sp. XJ31 Abstract: The current global demand for novel anti-TB drugs has drawn urgent attention on the discovery of natural product compounds with anti-TB activity. Lots of efforts have emphasized on environmental samples from unexplored or underexplored natural habits and identified numerous rare actinomycete taxa producing structurally diverse bioactive natural products. Herein, we report a survey of the rare actinobacteria diversity in Xinjiang region together with the discovery of anti-TB active natural products from these strains. We have collected 17 soil samples at different sites with different environmental conditions, from which 39 rare actinobacteria were identified by using a selective isolation strategy with 5 media variations. Among those isolated strains, XJ31 was identified as a new Nocardia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Through one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy combined with anti-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bioassay-guided isolation, two groups of compounds were identified. They were twelve siderophores (nocardimicins, 1-12) and two anthraquinones (brasiliquinones, 13 and 14) and ten of them were identified as new compounds. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using HR-ESI-MS, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR techniques. The anti-TB bioassays revealed that the two benz[α]anthraquinones have potent activity against BCG (MICs = 25 μM), which can be used as a promising start point for further anti-TB drug development. KEY POINTS: • Ten new natural products were identified from Nocardia sp. XJ31. • Brasiliquinones 13 and 14 showed moderate anti-BCG activity.	0
Title: Leader peptidase is found in both the inner and outer membranes of Escherichia coli Abstract: Many membrane proteins are synthesized as transient precursors with an NH2-terminal leader (or signal) peptide. During insertion of these proteins into the membrane, leader peptides are removed by leader peptidase. One such enzyme has been detected in detergent extracts of Escherichia coli membranes and extensively purified using as an assay the removal of the leader sequence of procoat, the precursor of the major coat protein of bacteriophage M13. We now report that this leader peptidase is found in equal abundance in the inner and outer membranes of E. coli. Enzyme from each membrane accurately cleaves procoat to mature M13 coat protein. The salt, pH, and Mg2+ optima and inhibitor sensitivities of enzyme from each membrane are identical. Furthermore, the activities are indistinguishable upon ion exchange chromatography and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Finally, a strain of E. coli with a plasmid which causes overproduction of leader peptidase has elevated levels of enzyme in both the inner and outer membranes. Leader peptidase is the only known enzyme which is found in both inner and outer membrane fractions of E. coli; this may reflect its role in membrane biogenesis.	0
Title: (4+1) vs (4+2): Catalytic Intramolecular Coupling between Cyclobutanones and Trisubstituted Allenes via C-C Activation Abstract: Herein we describe a rhodium-catalyzed (4+1) cyclization between cyclobutanones and allenes, which provides a distinct [4.2.1]-bicyclic skeleton containing two quaternary carbon centers. The reaction involves C-C activation of cyclobutanones and employs allenes as a one-carbon unit. A variety of functional groups can be tolerated, and a diverse range of polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed. Excellent enantioselectivity can be obtained, which is enabled by a TADDOL-derived phosphoramidite ligand. The bridged bicyclic products can be further functionalized or derivatized though simple transformations.	0
Title: Inhibiting Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosRST Signaling by Targeting Response Regulator DNA Binding and Sensor Kinase Heme Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) possesses a two-component regulatory system, DosRST, that enables Mtb to sense host immune cues and establish a state of nonreplicating persistence (NRP). NRP bacteria are tolerant to several antimycobacterial drugs in vitro and are thought to play a role in the long course of tuberculosis therapy. Previously, we reported the discovery of six novel chemical inhibitors of DosRST, named HC101A-106A, from a whole cell, reporter-based phenotypic high throughput screen. Here, we report functional and mechanism of action studies of HC104A and HC106A. RNaseq transcriptional profiling shows that the compounds downregulate genes of the DosRST regulon. Both compounds reduce hypoxia-induced triacylglycerol synthesis by ∼50%. HC106A inhibits Mtb survival during hypoxia-induced NRP; however, HC104A did not inhibit survival during NRP. An electrophoretic mobility assay shows that HC104A inhibits DosR DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that HC104A may function by directly targeting DosR. In contrast, UV-visible spectroscopy studies suggest HC106A directly targets the sensor kinase heme, via a mechanism that is distinct from the oxidation and alkylation of heme previously observed with artemisinin (HC101A). Synergistic interactions were observed when DosRST inhibitors were examined in pairwise combinations with the strongest potentiation observed between artemisinin paired with HC102A, HC103A, or HC106A. Our data collectively show that the DosRST pathway can be inhibited by multiple distinct mechanisms.	0
Title: Bacillus anthracis requires siderophore biosynthesis for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence Abstract: Systemic anthrax infections can be characterized as proceeding in stages, beginning with an early intracellular establishment stage within phagocytes that is followed by extracelluar stages involving massive bacteraemia, sepsis and death. Because most bacteria require iron, and the host limits iron availability through homeostatic mechanisms, we hypothesized that B. anthracis requires a high-affinity mechanism of iron acquisition during its growth stages. Two putative types of siderophore synthesis operons, named Bacillus anthracis catechol, bac (anthrabactin), and anthrax siderophore biosynthesis, asb (anthrachelin), were identified. Directed gene deletions in both anthrabactin and anthrachelin pathways were generated in a B. anthracis (Sterne) 34F2 background resulting in mutations in asbA and bacCEBF. A decrease in siderophore production was observed during iron-depleted growth in both the DeltaasbA and DeltabacCEBF strains, but only the DeltaasbA strain was attenuated for growth under these conditions. In addition, the DeltaasbA strain was severely attenuated both for growth in macrophages (MPhi) and for virulence in mice. In contrast, the DeltabacCEBF strain did not differ phenotypically from the parental strain. These findings support a requirement for anthrachelin but not anthrabactin in iron assimilation during the intracellular stage of anthrax.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of genes required for biosynthesis and transport of the siderophore vibrioferrin in Vibrio parahaemolyticus Abstract: In response to low iron availability, Vibrio parahaemolyticus synthesizes and secretes a polyhydroxycarboxylate-type siderophore vibrioferrin which is composed of 1 mol each of 2-ketoglutaric acid, L-alanine, ethanolamine, and citric acid. We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of the pvuA gene, which encodes the 78-kDa outer membrane receptor protein for ferric vibrioferrin. In this study, nine genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of vibrioferrin have been identified in the genomic regions surrounding the pvuA gene. The genes were sequenced, and gene disruptants were constructed by insertion mutation for phenotype analysis. Five of the genes, named pvsABCDE, constitute an operon that is expressed under iron-limiting conditions. Homology searches of their predicted protein products suggested that the four genes pvsABDE are implicated in the biosynthesis of the siderophore. Another gene in the same operon, pvsC, encodes a putative exporter that is homologous to members of the major facilitator superfamily of multidrug efflux pumps. The remaining four genes, named pvuBCDE, encode proteins strongly homologous to Escherichia coli FecBCDE, respectively, which are components of the ATP-binding cassette transporter system for ferric dicitrate. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that these transport genes are transcribed as a single mRNA with the upstream genes, psuA and pvuA. Phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions for the respective operons that were expected on the basis of the homology search.	1
Title: Structure and Biosynthesis of Isatropolones, Bioactive Amine-Scavenging Fluorescent Natural Products from Streptomyces Gö66 Abstract: The natural products isatropolone A-C (1-3) were reisolated from Streptomyces Gö66, with 1 and 3 showing potent activity against Leishmania donovani. They contain a rare tropolone ring derived from a type II polyketide biosynthesis pathway. Their biosynthesis was elucidated by labeling experiments, analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, its partial heterologous expression, and structural characterization of various intermediates. Owing to their 1,5-diketone moiety, they can react with ammonia, amines, lysine, and lysine-containing peptides and proteins, which results in the formation of a covalent bond and subsequent pyridine ring formation. Their fluorescence properties change upon amine binding, enabling the simple visualization of reacted amines including proteins.	1
Title: Comparison of genetic maps for two Leptospira interrogans serovars provides evidence for two chromosomes and intraspecies heterogeneity Abstract: Genetic maps were constructed for Leptospira interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona. Previously we independently constructed physical maps of the genomes for these two serovars. The genomes of both serovars consist of a large replicon (4.4 to 4.6 Mb) and a small replicon (350 kb). Genes were localized on the physical maps by using Southern blot analysis with specific probes. Among the probes used were genes encoding a variety of essential enzymes and genes usually found near bacterial chromosomal replication origins. Most of the essential genes are on the larger replicon of each serovar. However, the smaller replicons of both serovars contain the asd gene. The asd gene encodes aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential in amino acid and cell wall biosyntheses. The finding that both L. interrogans replicons contain essential genes suggests that both replicons are chromosomes. Comparison of the genetic maps of the larger replicons of the two serovars showed evidence of large rearrangements. These data show that there is considerable intraspecies heterogeneity in L. interrogans.	0
Title: An efficient synthesis of (+/-)-Lycoricidine featuring a Stille-IMDAF cycloaddition cascade Abstract: [reaction: see text] A highly efficient total synthesis of (+/-)-Lycoricidine is described. The synthesis features the ready preparation of the Lycoricidine skeleton by a Stille-IMDAF cycloaddition cascade. The resulting cycloadduct is then used for the stereocontrolled installation of the other functionality present in the C-ring of the target molecule.	0
Title: Mechanistic analysis of a type II polyketide synthase. Role of conserved residues in the beta-ketoacyl synthase-chain length factor heterodimer Abstract: Type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of multienzyme systems that catalyze the biosynthesis of polyfunctional aromatic natural products such as actinorhodin, frenolicin, tetracenomycin, and doxorubicin. A central component in each of these systems is the beta-ketoacyl synthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) heterodimer. In the presence of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and a malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyl transferase (MAT), this enzyme synthesizes a polyketide chain of defined length from malonyl-CoA. We have investigated the role of the actinorhodin KS-CLF in priming, elongation, and termination of its octaketide product by subjecting the wild-type enzyme and selected mutants to assays that probe key steps in the overall catalytic cycle. Under conditions reflecting steady-state turnover of the PKS, a unique acyl-ACP intermediate is detected that carries a long, possibly full-length, acyl chain. This species cannot be synthesized by the C169S, H309A, K341A, and H346A mutants of the KS, all of which are blocked in early steps in the PKS catalytic cycle. These four residues are universally conserved in all known KSs. Malonyl-ACP alone is sufficient for kinetically and stoichiometrically efficient synthesis of polyketides by the wild-type KS-CLF, but not by heterodimers that carry the mutations listed above. Among these mutants, C169S is an efficient decarboxylase of malonyl-ACP, but the H309A, K341A, and H346A mutants are unable to catalyze decarboxylation. Transfer of label from [(14)C]malonyl-ACP to the nucleophile at position 169 in the KS can be detected for the wild-type enzyme and for the C169S and K341A mutants, but not for the H309A mutant and only very weakly for the H346A mutant. A model is proposed for decarboxylative priming and extension of a polyketide chain by the KS, where C169 and H346 form a catalytic dyad for acyl chain attachment, H309 positions the malonyl-ACP in the active site and supports carbanion formation by interacting with the thioester carbonyl, and K341 enhances the rate of malonyl-ACP decarboxylation via electrostatic interaction. Our data also suggest that the ACP and the KS dissociate after each C-C bond forming event, and that the newly extended acyl chain is transferred back from the ACP pantetheine to the KS cysteine before dissociation can occur. Chain termination is most likely the rate-limiting step in polyketide biosynthesis. Within the act CLF, neither the universally conserved S145 residue nor Q171, which aligns with the active site cysteine of the ketosynthase, is essential for PKS activity. The results described here provide a basis for a better understanding of the catalytic cycle of type II PKSs and fatty acid synthases.	1
Title: Genetic insights into pyralomicin biosynthesis in Nonomuraea spiralis IMC A-0156 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the pyralomicin antibiotics has been cloned and sequenced from Nonomuraea spiralis IMC A-0156. The 41 kb gene cluster contains 27 ORFs predicted to encode all of the functions for pyralomicin biosynthesis. This includes nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) required for the formation of the benzopyranopyrrole core unit, as well as a suite of tailoring enzymes (e.g., four halogenases, an O-methyltransferase, and an N-glycosyltransferase) necessary for further modifications of the core structure. The N-glycosyltransferase is predicted to transfer either glucose or a pseudosugar (cyclitol) to the aglycone. A gene cassette encoding C7-cyclitol biosynthetic enzymes was identified upstream of the benzopyranopyrrole-specific ORFs. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding the N-glycosyltransferase, prlH, abolished pyralomicin production, and recombinant expression of PrlA confirms the activity of this enzyme as a sugar phosphate cyclase involved in the formation of the C7-cyclitol moiety.	1
Title: Isolation of the lysolipin gene cluster of Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 Abstract: Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 produces the aromatic polyketide antibiotic lysolipin. Lysolipin has strong antibacterial activity against a variety of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The complete lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and fully sequenced. Within a 42-kb genomic region, 42 genes were identified that code for a type II polyketide synthase (llpF, E, and D), cyclases (llpCI-CIII), methyltransferases (llpMI-MVI), a halogenase (llpH), an amidotransferase (llpA), a ferredoxin (llpK), a transporter (llpN) and regulatory proteins (llpRI-RV). In addition, 15 genes encoding enzymes involved in redox modifications of the polyketide precursor molecule (llpOI-OVIII, ZI-ZIV, U, L, and S) were present in the lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster. With this high number of oxidoreductases, lysolipin is among the most highly modified aromatic polyketides known to date. The heterologous expression of the cluster in Streptomyces albus led to lysolipin production with a yield comparable to that of wild-type, indicating that all biosynthetic genes were successfully cloned.	1
Title: Sequencing, physical organization and kinetic expression of the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium expansum Abstract: Patulin is a polyketide-derived mycotoxin produced by numerous filamentous fungi. Among them, Penicillium expansum is by far the most problematic species. This fungus is a destructive phytopathogen capable of growing on fruit, provoking the blue mold decay of apples and producing significant amounts of patulin. The biosynthetic pathway of this mycotoxin is chemically well-characterized, but its genetic bases remain largely unknown with only few characterized genes in less economic relevant species. The present study consisted of the identification and positional organization of the patulin gene cluster in P. expansum strain NRRL 35695. Several amplification reactions were performed with degenerative primers that were designed based on sequences from the orthologous genes available in other species. An improved genome Walking approach was used in order to sequence the remaining adjacent genes of the cluster. RACE-PCR was also carried out from mRNAs to determine the start and stop codons of the coding sequences. The patulin gene cluster in P. expansum consists of 15 genes in the following order: patH, patG, patF, patE, patD, patC, patB, patA, patM, patN, patO, patL, patI, patJ, and patK. These genes share 60-70% of identity with orthologous genes grouped differently, within a putative patulin cluster described in a non-producing strain of Aspergillus clavatus. The kinetics of patulin cluster genes expression was studied under patulin-permissive conditions (natural apple-based medium) and patulin-restrictive conditions (Eagle's minimal essential medium), and demonstrated a significant association between gene expression and patulin production. In conclusion, the sequence of the patulin cluster in P. expansum constitutes a key step for a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to patulin production in this fungus. It will allow the role of each gene to be elucidated, and help to define strategies to reduce patulin production in apple-based products.	1
Title: Integrated Approach to Identify Heparan Sulfate Ligand Requirements of Robo1 Abstract: An integrated methodology is described to establish ligand requirements for heparan sulfate (HS) binding proteins based on a workflow in which HS octasaccharides are produced by partial enzymatic degradation of natural HS followed by size exclusion purification, affinity enrichment using an immobilized HS-binding protein of interest, putative structure determination of isolated compounds by a hydrophilic interaction chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry platform, and chemical synthesis of well-defined HS oligosaccharides for structure-activity relationship studies. The methodology was used to establish the ligand requirements of human Roundabout receptor 1 (Robo1), which is involved in a number of developmental processes. Mass spectrometric analysis of the starting octasaccharide mixture and the Robo1-bound fraction indicated that Robo1 has a preference for a specific set of structures. Further analysis was performed by sequential permethylation, desulfation, and pertrideuteroacetylation followed by online separation and structural analysis by MS/MS. Sequences of tetrasaccharides could be deduced from the data, and by combining the compositional and sequence data, a putative octasaccharide ligand could be proposed (GlA-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNAc6S). A modular synthetic approach was employed to prepare the target compound, and binding studies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed it to be a high affinity ligand for Robo1. Further studies with a number of tetrasaccharides confirmed that sulfate esters at C-6 are critical for binding, whereas such functionalities at C-2 substantially reduce binding. High affinity ligands were able to reverse a reduction in endothelial cell migration induced by Slit2-Robo1 signaling.	0
Title: Plantaricyclin A, a Novel Circular Bacteriocin Produced by Lactobacillus plantarum NI326: Purification, Characterization, and Heterologous Production Abstract: Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of increasing interest in recent years due to their potential as natural preservatives against food and beverage spoilage microorganisms. In a screening study for LAB, we isolated from olives a strain, Lactobacillus plantarum NI326, with activity against the beverage-spoilage bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Genome sequencing of NI326 enabled the identification of a gene cluster (designated plc) encoding a putative circular bacteriocin and proteins involved in its modification, transport, and immunity. This novel bacteriocin, named plantaricyclin A (PlcA), was grouped into the circular bacteriocin subgroup II due to its high degree of similarity with other gassericin A-like bacteriocins. Purification of PlcA from the supernatant of Lb. plantarum NI326 resulted in an active peptide with a molecular mass of 5,570 Da, corresponding to that predicted from the (processed) PlcA amino acid sequence. The plc gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, resulting in the production of an active 5,570-Da bacteriocin in the supernatant. PlcA is believed to be produced as a 91-amino-acid precursor with a 33-amino-acid leader peptide, which is predicted to be removed, followed by joining of the N and C termini via a covalent linkage to form the mature 58-amino-acid circular bacteriocin PlcA. We report the characterization of a circular bacteriocin produced by Lb. plantarum The inhibition displayed against A. acidoterrestris highlights its potential use as a preservative in food and beverages.IMPORTANCE In this work, we describe the purification and characterization of an antimicrobial peptide, termed plantaricyclin A (PlcA), produced by a Lactobacillus plantarum strain isolated from olives. This peptide has a circular structure, and all genes involved in its production, circularization, and secretion were identified. PlcA shows antimicrobial activity against different strains, including Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, a common spoilage bacterium, which causes substantial economic losses in the beverage industry every year. In this study, we describe a circular antimicrobial peptide, PlcA, for a Lactobacillus plantarum strain.	1
Title: Evolution of vitamin B2 biosynthesis: 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases of Brucella Abstract: The penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2) involves the condensation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate with 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, which is catalyzed by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (lumazine synthase). Pathogenic Brucella species adapted to an intracellular lifestyle have two genes involved in riboflavin synthesis, ribH1 and ribH2, which are located on different chromosomes. The ribH2 gene was shown previously to specify a lumazine synthase (type II lumazine synthase) with an unusual decameric structure and a very high Km for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. Moreover, the protein was found to be an immunodominant Brucella antigen and was able to generate strong humoral as well as cellular immunity against Brucella abortus in mice. We have now cloned and expressed the ribH1 gene, which is located inside a small riboflavin operon, together with two other putative riboflavin biosynthesis genes and the nusB gene, specifying an antitermination factor. The RibH1 protein (type I lumazine synthase) is a homopentamer catalyzing the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at a rate of 18 nmol mg(-1) min(-1). Sequence comparison of lumazine synthases from archaea, bacteria, plants, and fungi suggests a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases.	0
Title: Insights into bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase and its engineering to orsellinic acid synthase for spirotetronate generation Abstract: The enzymes 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthases (6-MSASs) are involved in the building of an aryl moiety in many bioactive secondary metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. Using the bacterial 6-MSAS ChlB1 in the biosynthesis of spirotetronate antibiotic chlorothricin (CHL) as a model, functional analysis of its dehydratase (DH) and ketoreductase (KR) domains by site-specific mutagenesis revealed that selective ketoreduction is not essential for polyketide chain extension. Promiscuity of the ketoacylsynthase domain in beta functionality recognition allows for engineering ChlB1 to an orsellinic acid (OSA) synthase (OSAS) by inactivating KR at the active site. The engineered ChlB1 is compatible with the enzymes for late-stage tailoring in CHL biosynthesis, featuring specific protein recognitions that facilitate variable aryl group incorporation. The resulting spirotetronates, which bear an OSA-derived aryl group, exhibited antibacterial activities comparable to those of the parent products.	1
Title: Substrate Recognition by the Peptidyl-( S)-2-mercaptoglycine Synthase TglHI during 3-Thiaglutamate Biosynthesis Abstract: 3-Thiaglutamate is a recently identified amino acid analog originating from cysteine. During its biosynthesis, cysteinyl-tRNA is first enzymatically appended to the C-terminus of TglA, a 50-residue ribosomally translated peptide scaffold. After hydrolytic removal of the tRNA, this cysteine residue undergoes modification on the scaffold before eventual proteolysis of the nascent 3-thiaglutamyl residue to release 3-thiaglutamate and regenerate TglA. One of the modifications of TglACys requires a complex of two polypeptides, TglH and TglI, which uses nonheme iron and O2 to catalyze the removal of the peptidyl-cysteine β-methylene group, oxidation of this Cβ atom to formate, and reattachment of the thiol group to the α carbon. Herein, we use in vitro transcription-coupled translation and expressed protein ligation to characterize the role of the TglA scaffold in TglHI recognition and determine the specificity of TglHI with respect to the C-terminal residues of its substrate TglACys. The results of these experiments establish a synthetically accessible TglACys fragment sufficient for modification by TglHI and identify the l-selenocysteine analog of TglACys, TglASec, as an inhibitor of TglHI. These insights as well as a predicted structure and native mass spectrometry data set the stage for deeper mechanistic investigation of the complex TglHI-catalyzed reaction.	1
Title: Genome Mining and Assembly-Line Biosynthesis of the UCS1025A Pyrrolizidinone Family of Fungal Alkaloids Abstract: UCS1025A is a fungal polyketide/alkaloid that displays strong inhibition of telomerase. The structures of UCS1025A and related natural products are featured by a tricyclic furopyrrolizidine connected to a trans-decalin fragment. We mined the genome of a thermophilic fungus and activated the ucs gene cluster to produce UCS1025A at a high titer. Genetic and biochemical analysis revealed a PKS-NRPS assembly line that activates 2S,3S-methylproline derived from l-isoleucine, followed by Knoevenagel condensation to construct the pyrrolizidine moiety. Oxidation of the 3S-methyl group to a carboxylate leads to an oxa-Michael cyclization and furnishes the furopyrrolizidine. Our work reveals a new strategy used by nature to construct heterocyclic alkaloid-like ring systems using assembly line logic.	1
Title: The molecular basis of conjugated polyyne biosynthesis in phytopathogenic bacteria Abstract: Polyynes (polyacetylenes), which are produced by a variety of organisms, play important roles in ecology. Whereas alkyne biosynthesis in plants, fungi, and insects has been studied, the biogenetic origin of highly unstable bacterial polyynes has remained a riddle. Transposon mutagenesis and genome sequencing unveiled the caryoynencin (cay) biosynthesis gene cluster in the plant pathogen B. caryophylli, and homologous gene clusters were found in various other bacteria by comparative genomics. Gene inactivation and phylogenetic analyses revealed that novel desaturase/acetylenase genes mediate bacterial polyyne assembly. A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is involved in the formation of the allylic alcohol moiety, as evidenced by analysis of a fragile intermediate, which was stabilized by an in situ click reaction. This work not only grants first insight into bacterial polyyne biosynthesis but also demonstrates that the click reaction can be employed to trap fragile polyynes from crude mixtures.	1
Title: Cloning and analysis of the simocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic simocyclinone D8 was cloned by screening a cosmid library of Streptomyces antibioticusTü 6040 with a heterologous probe from a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. Sequence analysis of a 39.4-kb region revealed the presence of 38 ORFs. Six of the identified ORFs showed striking similarity to genes from the biosynthetic gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and coumermycin A(1). Simocyclinone also contains an angucyclinone moiety, and 12 of the ORFs showed high sequence similarity to biosynthetic genes of other angucyclinone antibiotics. Possible functions within the biosynthesis of simocyclinone D8 could be assigned to 23 ORFs by comparison with sequences in GenBank. Experimental proof for the function of the identified gene cluster was provided by a gene inactivation experiment, which resulted in the abolishment of the formation of the aminocoumarin moiety of simocyclinone. Feeding of the mutant with the aminocoumarin moiety of novobiocin led to a new, artificial simocyclinone derivative.	1
Title: Generation of novel-substrate-accepting biphenyl dioxygenases through segmental random mutagenesis and identification of residues involved in enzyme specificity Abstract: Aryl-hydroxylating dioxygenases are of interest for the degradation of persistant aromatic pollutants, such as polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), or as catalysts for the functionalization of aromatic scaffolds. In order to achieve dioxygenation of technical mixtures of PCBs, enzymes with broadened or altered substrate ranges are essential. To alter the substrate specificity of the biphenyl dioxygenase (BphA) of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, we applied a directed evolution approach that used structure-function relationship data to target random mutageneses to specific segments of the enzyme. The limitation of random amino acid (AA) substitutions to regions that are critical for substrate binding and the exclusion of AA exchanges from positions that are essential for catalytic activity yielded enzyme variants of interest at comparatively high frequencies. After only a single mutagenic cycle, 10 beneficial variants were detected in a library of fewer than 1,000 active enzymes. Compared to the parental BphA, they showed between 5- and 200-fold increased turnover of chlorinated biphenyls, with substituent patterns that rendered them largely recalcitrant to attack by BphA-LB400. Determination of their sequences identified AAs that prevent the acceptance of specific PCBs by the wild-type enzyme, such as Pro334 and Phe384. The results suggest prime targets for subsequent cycles of BphA modification. Correlations with a three-dimensional model of the enzyme indicated that most of the exchanges with major influence on substrate turnover do not involve pocket-lining residues and had not been predictable through structural modeling.	0
Title: The act cluster contains regulatory and antibiotic export genes, direct targets for translational control by the bldA tRNA gene of Streptomyces Abstract: The actII region, flanked by biosynthetic genes in the 25 kb act cluster of S. coelicolor, consists of four open reading frames, including a transcriptional activator for the biosynthetic genes, and genes controlling antibiotic export. A TTA codon (extremely rare in Streptomyces) is present both in actII-ORF2 (encoding a putative transmembrane export protein) and actII-ORF4 (the transcriptional activator gene). Change of the TTA in ORF4 to TTG reverses the normal interruption of actinorhodin synthesis caused by mutation in the pleiotropic regulatory gene bldA (which encodes the cell's tRNA(Leu)(UUA)). We conclude that initiation of actinorhodin synthesis via the actII-ORF4 product, and the final step in production, antibiotic export, are twin targets via which bldA exerts developmental control of actinorhodin production.	1
Title: Microcyclamide biosynthesis in two strains of Microcystis aeruginosa: from structure to genes and vice versa Abstract: Comparative analysis of related biosynthetic gene clusters can provide new insights into the versatility of these pathways and allow the discovery of new natural products. The freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa NIES298 produces the cytotoxic peptide microcyclamide. Here, we provide evidence that the cyclic hexapeptide is formed by a ribosomal pathway through the activity of a set of processing enzymes closely resembling those recently shown to be involved in patellamide biosynthesis in cyanobacterial symbionts of ascidians. Besides two subtilisin-type proteases and a heterocyclization enzyme, the gene cluster discovered in strain NIES298 encodes six further open reading frames, two of them without similarity to enzymes encoded by the patellamide gene cluster. Analyses of genomic data of a second cyanobacterial strain, M. aeruginosa PCC 7806, guided the discovery and structural elucidation of two novel peptides of the microcyclamide family. The identification of the microcyclamide biosynthetic genes provided an avenue by which to study the regulation of peptide synthesis at the transcriptional level. The precursor genes were strongly and constitutively expressed throughout the growth phase, excluding the autoinduction of these peptides, as has been observed for several peptide pheromone families in bacteria.	1
Title: ZnCl2 Mediated Synthesis of InAs Nanocrystals with Aminoarsine Abstract: The most developed approaches for the synthesis of InAs nanocrystals (NCs) rely on pyrophoric, toxic, and not readily available tris-trimethylsilyl (or tris-trimethylgermil) arsine precursors. Less toxic and commercially available chemicals, such as tris(dimethylamino)arsine, have recently emerged as alternative As precursors. Nevertheless, InAs NCs made with such compounds need to be further optimized in terms of size distribution and optical properties in order to meet the standard reached with tris-trimethylsilyl arsine. To this aim, in this work we investigated the role of ZnCl2 used as an additive in the synthesis of InAs NCs with tris(dimethylamino)arsine and alane N,N-dimethylethylamine as the reducing agent. We discovered that ZnCl2 helps not only to improve the size distribution of InAs NCs but also to passivate their surface acting as a Z-type ligand. The presence of ZnCl2 on the surface of the NCs and the excess of Zn precursor used in the synthesis enable the subsequent in situ growth of a ZnSe shell, which is realized by simply adding the Se precursor to the crude reaction mixture. The resulting InAs@ZnSe core@shell NCs exhibit photoluminescence emission at ∼860 nm with a quantum yield as high as 42±4%, which is a record for such heterostructures, given the relatively high mismatch (6%) between InAs and ZnSe. Such bright emission was ascribed to the formation, under our peculiar reaction conditions, of an In-Zn-Se intermediate layer between the core and the shell, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analyses, which helps to release the strain between the two materials.	0
Title: Identification of the gene cluster for bistropolone-humulene meroterpenoid biosynthesis in Phoma sp Abstract: Eupenifeldin, a bistropolone meroterpenoid, was first discovered as an antitumor agent from the fungus Eupenicillium brefeldianum. We also isolated this compound and a new congener from a strain of Phoma sp. (CGMCC 10481), and evaluated their antitumor effects. Eupenifeldin showed potent in vitro anti-glioma activity. This tropolone-humulene-tropolone meroterpenoid could be originated from two units of tropolone orthoquinone methides and a 10-hydroxyhumulene moiety via hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. To explore the biosynthesis of this class of tropolonic sesquiterpenes, the genome of a eupenifeldin-producing Phoma sp. was sequenced and analyzed. The biosynthetic gene cluster of eupenifeldin (eup) was identified and partially validated by genomic analysis, gene disruption, and product analysis. A nonreducing polyketide synthase EupA, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase EupB, and a non-heme Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenase EupC, were identified as the enzymes responsible for tropolone formation. While the terpene cyclase EupE of an unknown family was characterized to catalyze humulene formation, and a cytochrome P450 enzyme EupD was responsible for hydroxylation of humulene. This study sheds light on the biosynthesis of eupenifeldin, and paves the way to further decipher its biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Characterization of a large sex determination region in Salix purpurea L. (Salicaceae) Abstract: Dioecy has evolved numerous times in plants, but heteromorphic sex chromosomes are apparently rare. Sex determination has been studied in multiple Salix and Populus (Salicaceae) species, and P. trichocarpa has an XY sex determination system on chromosome 19, while S. suchowensis and S. viminalis have a ZW system on chromosome 15. Here we use whole genome sequencing coupled with quantitative trait locus mapping and a genome-wide association study to characterize the genomic composition of the non-recombining portion of the sex determination region. We demonstrate that Salix purpurea also has a ZW system on chromosome 15. The sex determination region has reduced recombination, high structural polymorphism, an abundance of transposable elements, and contains genes that are involved in sex expression in other plants. We also show that chromosome 19 contains sex-associated markers in this S. purpurea assembly, along with other autosomes. This raises the intriguing possibility of a translocation of the sex determination region within the Salicaceae lineage, suggesting a common evolutionary origin of the Populus and Salix sex determination loci.	0
Title: A chain initiation factor common to both modular and aromatic polyketide synthases Abstract: Antibiotic-producing polyketide synthases (PKSs) are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis in Streptomyces and related filamentous bacteria of a remarkably broad range of bioactive metabolites, including antitumour aromatic compounds such as mithramycin and macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin. The molecular basis for the selection of the starter unit on aromatic PKSs is unknown. Here we show that a component of aromatic PKS, previously named 'chain-length factor', is a factor required for polyketide chain initiation and that this factor has decarboxylase activity towards malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein). We have re-examined the mechanism of initiation on modular PKSs and have identified as a specific initiation factor a domain of previously unknown function named KSQ, which operates like chain-length factor. Both KSQ and chain-length factor are similar to the ketosynthase domains that catalyse polyketide chain extension in modular multifunctional PKSs and in aromatic PKSs, respectively, except that the ketosynthase domain active-site cysteine residue is replaced by a highly conserved glutamine in KSQ and in chain-length factor. The glutamine residue is important both for decarboxylase activity and for polyketide synthesis.	1
Title: Lantibiotic biosynthesis: interactions between prelacticin 481 and its putative modification enzyme, LctM Abstract: Class AII and AIII lantibiotics and mersacidin are antibacterial peptides containing unusual residues obtained by posttranslational modifications of prepeptides, presumably catalyzed by LanM. LctM, the LanM for lacticin 481, is essential for the production of this class AII lantibiotic. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed direct contact between the prelacticin 481 and LctM, supporting the proposed LctM function. Sixteen domains are conserved between the 10 known LanM proteins, whereas three additional domains were found only in class AII LanM proteins and in MrsM, the LanM for mersacidin. All the truncated LctM proteins that we tested presented impaired LctA-binding activity.	1
Title: HTS by NMR of combinatorial libraries: a fragment-based approach to ligand discovery Abstract: Fragment-based ligand design (FBLD) approaches have become more widely used in drug discovery projects from both academia and industry, and are even often preferred to traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) of large collection of compounds (>10(5)). A key advantage of FBLD approaches is that these often rely on robust biophysical methods such as NMR spectroscopy for detection of ligand binding, hence are less prone to artifacts that too often plague the results from HTS campaigns. In this article, we introduce a screening strategy that takes advantage of both the robustness of protein NMR spectroscopy as the detection method, and the basic principles of combinatorial chemistry to enable the screening of large libraries of fragments (>10(5) compounds) preassembled on a common backbone. We used the method to identify compounds that target protein-protein interactions.	0
Title: Enzymatic total synthesis of enterocin polyketides Abstract: Polyketides are clinically important natural products that often require elaborate organic syntheses owing to their complex chemical structures. Here we report the multienzyme total synthesis of the Streptomyces maritimus enterocin and wailupemycin bacteriostatic agents in a single reaction vessel from simple benzoate and malonate substrates. To our knowledge, our results represent the first in vitro assembly of a complete type II polyketide synthase enzymatic pathway to natural products.	1
Title: Carbohydrate post-glycosylational modifications Abstract: Carbohydrate modification is a common phenomenon in nature. Many carbohydrate modifications such as some epimerization, O-acetylation, O-sulfation, O-methylation, N-deacetylation, and N-sulfation, take place after the formation of oligosaccharide or polysaccharide backbones. These modifications can be categorized as carbohydrate post-glycosylational modifications (PGMs). Carbohydrate PGMs further extend the complexity of the structures and the synthesis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. They also increase the capacity of the biological regulation that is achieved by finely tuning the structures of carbohydrates. Developing efficient methods to obtain structurally defined naturally occurring oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates with carbohydrate PGMs is essential for understanding the biological significance of carbohydrate PGMs. Combined with high-throughput screening methods, synthetic carbohydrates with PGMs are invaluable probes in structure-activity relationship studies. We illustrate here several classes of carbohydrates with PGMs and their applications. Recent progress in chemical, enzymatic, and chemoenzymatic syntheses of these carbohydrates and their derivatives are also presented.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Cittilins, Unusual Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptides from Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Cittilins are secondary metabolites from myxobacteria comprised of three l-tyrosines and one l-isoleucine forming a bicyclic tetrapeptide scaffold with biaryl and aryl-oxygen-aryl ether bonds. Here we reveal that cittilins belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) family of natural products, for which only the crocagins have been reported from myxobacteria. A 27 amino acid precursor peptide harbors a C-terminal four amino acid core peptide, which is enzymatically modified and finally exported to yield cittilins. The small biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for cittilin biosynthesis also encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a methyltransferase, whereas a gene encoding a prolyl endopeptidase for the cleavage of the precursor peptide is located outside of the cittilin biosynthetic gene cluster. We confirm the roles of the biosynthetic genes responsible for the formation of cittilins using targeted gene inactivation and heterologous expression in Streptomyces ssp. We also report first steps toward the biochemical characterization of the proposed biosynthetic pathway in vitro. An investigation of the cellular uptake properties of cittilin A connected it to a potential biological function as an inhibitor of the prokaryotic carbon storage regulator A (CsrA).	1
Title: Evaluation of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as a heterologous expression host for the cyanobacterial protein kinase C activator lyngbyatoxin A Abstract: Filamentous marine cyanobacteria are extremely rich sources of bioactive natural products and often employ highly unusual biosynthetic enzymes in their assembly. However, the current lack of techniques for stable DNA transfer into these filamentous organisms, combined with the absence of heterologous expression strategies for nonribosomal cyanobacterial gene clusters, prohibit the creation of mutant strains or the heterologous production of these cyanobacterial compounds in other bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the capability of a derivative of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to express enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the protein kinase C activator lyngbyatoxin A from a Hawaiian strain of Moorea producta (previously classified as Lyngbya majuscula). Despite large differences in GC content between these two bacteria and the presence of rare TTA/UUA leucine codons in lyngbyatoxin ORFs we were able to achieve expression of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase LtxB and reverse prenyltransferase LtxC in S. coelicolor M512 and confirmed the in vitro functionality of S. coelicolor overexpressed LtxC. Attempts to express the entire lyngbyatoxin A gene cluster in S. coelicolor M512 were not successful because of transcript termination observed for the ltxA gene, which encodes a large nonribosomal peptide synthetase. However, these attempts did show a detectable level of cyanobacterial promoter recognition in Streptomyces. Successful expression of lyngbyatoxin A proteins in Streptomyces provides a new platform for biochemical investigation of natural product enzymes from Moorea strains.	1
Title: Coproduction of acetaldehyde and hydrogen during glucose fermentation by Escherichia coli Abstract: Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655 was engineered to coproduce acetaldehyde and hydrogen during glucose fermentation by the use of exogenous acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) reductase (for the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde) and the native formate hydrogen lyase. A putative acetaldehyde dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA reductase from Salmonella enterica (SeEutE) was cloned, produced at high levels, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. In vitro assays showed that this enzyme had both acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (68.07 ± 1.63 μmol min(-1) mg(-1)) and the desired acetyl-CoA reductase activity (49.23 ± 2.88 μmol min(-1) mg(-1)). The eutE gene was engineered into an E. coli mutant lacking native glucose fermentation pathways (ΔadhE, ΔackA-pta, ΔldhA, and ΔfrdC). The engineered strain (ZH88) produced 4.91 ± 0.29 mM acetaldehyde while consuming 11.05 mM glucose but also produced 6.44 ± 0.26 mM ethanol. Studies showed that ethanol was produced by an unknown alcohol dehydrogenase(s) that converted the acetaldehyde produced by SeEutE to ethanol. Allyl alcohol was used to select for mutants with reduced alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Three allyl alcohol-resistant mutants were isolated; all produced more acetaldehyde and less ethanol than ZH88. It was also found that modifying the growth medium by adding 1 g of yeast extract/liter and lowering the pH to 6.0 further increased the coproduction of acetaldehyde and hydrogen. Under optimal conditions, strain ZH136 converted glucose to acetaldehyde and hydrogen in a 1:1 ratio with a specific acetaldehyde production rate of 0.68 ± 0.20 g h(-1) g(-1) dry cell weight and at 86% of the maximum theoretical yield. This specific production rate is the highest reported thus far and is promising for industrial application. The possibility of a more efficient "no-distill" ethanol fermentation procedure based on the coproduction of acetaldehyde and hydrogen is discussed.	0
Title: Sensitive detection of a novel class of toluene-degrading denitrifiers, Azoarcus tolulyticus, with small-subunit rRNA primers and probes Abstract: Azoarcus tolulyticus is a new class of widely distributed toluene-degrading denitrifiers of potential importance in remediating benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX)-contaminated environments. To detect these organisms in the environment, 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic probes were developed. Two sets of specific PCR amplification primers and two oligonucleotide hybridization probes were designed and tested against both closely and distantly related environmental isolates. All of these primers and probes were specific to the species A. tolulyticus. The sensitivity of the PCR amplification primer sets was evaluated with DNA isolated from A. tolulyticus Tol-4 pure culture and from sterile soils seeded with a known number of Tol-4 and Escherichia coli cells. These primer sets were able to detect 1 fg to 1 pg of template DNA from the pure culture and 1.11 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(8) Tol-4 cells per g of soil in the presence of 1.56 x 10(10) E. coli cells. These two PCR amplification primers were also successfully tested at two field sites. The primers identified the A. tolulyticus strains among the toluene-degrading bacteria isolated from a low-O2-high-NO(3)- aquifer at Moffett Field, Calif. Also, the presence of A. tolulyticus was detected in the groundwater samples from a BTEX-contaminated aquifer at an industrial site in Detroit, Mich., which showed anaerobic toluene degradation.	0
Title: Biochemical analysis of the biosynthetic pathway of an anticancer tetracycline SF2575 Abstract: SF2575 1 is a tetracycline polyketide produced by Streptomyces sp. SF2575 and displays exceptionally potent anticancer activity toward a broad range of cancer cell lines. The structure of SF2575 is characterized by a highly substituted tetracycline aglycon. The modifications include methylation of the C-6 and C-12a hydroxyl groups, acylation of the 4-(S)-hydroxyl with salicylic acid, C-glycosylation of the C-9 of the D-ring with D-olivose and further acylation of the C4'-hydroxyl of D-olivose with the unusual angelic acid. Understanding the biosynthesis of SF2575 can therefore expand the repertoire of enzymes that can modify tetracyclines, and facilitate engineered biosynthesis of SF2575 analogues. In this study, we identified, sequenced, and functionally analyzed the ssf biosynthetic gene cluster which contains 40 putative open reading frames. Genes encoding enzymes that can assemble the tetracycline aglycon, as well as installing these unique structural features, are found in the gene cluster. Biosynthetic intermediates were isolated from the SF2575 culture extract to suggest the order of pendant-group addition is C-9 glycosylation, C-4 salicylation, and O-4' angelylcylation. Using in vitro assays, two enzymes that are responsible for C-4 acylation of salicylic acid were identified. These enzymes include an ATP-dependent salicylyl-CoA ligase SsfL1 and a putative GDSL family acyltransferase SsfX3, both of which were shown to have relaxed substrate specificity toward substituted benzoic acids. Since the salicylic acid moiety is critically important for the anticancer properties of SF2575, verification of the activities of SsfL1 and SsfX3 sets the stage for biosynthetic modification of the C-4 group toward structure-activity relationship studies of SF2575. Using heterologous biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans, we also determined that biosynthesis of the SF2575 tetracycline aglycon 8 parallels that of oxytetracycline 4 and diverges after the assembly of 4-keto-anhydrotetracycline 51. The minimal ssf polyketide synthase together with the amidotransferase SsfD produced the amidated decaketide backbone that is required for the formation of 2-naphthacenecarboxamide skeleton. Additional enzymes, such as cyclases C-6 methyltransferase and C-4/C-12a dihydroxylase, were functionally reconstituted.	1
Title: Heterologous reconstitution of ikarugamycin biosynthesis in E. coli Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) are a family of biomedically promising natural products with challenging molecular frameworks. Despite these interesting properties, so far only relatively little is known about the biosynthetic origin of PTMs, in particular concerning the mechanism by which their ring systems are formed. Herein we present the first insights into these processes by using the biosynthesis of ikarugamycin as an example. This has been facilitated by the first heterologous expression of a PTM biosynthetic gene cluster in Escherichia coli. With this approach it will not only become possible to mechanistically investigate already known PTM biosynthetic pathways in more detail in the future, but also to interrogate cryptic PTM biosynthetic pathways chemically and biochemically.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of fimsbactins A-F, siderophores from Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter baylyi Abstract: Novel chatechol/hydroxamate siderophores (named "fimsbactins") were identified in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The major compound, fimsbactin A, was isolated from low-iron cultures of A. baylyi ADP1, and its chemical structure was elucidated by mass spectrometry, and detailed (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy. From inverse feeding experiments following HPLC-MS analysis, the structures of five additional derivatives were elucidated. The gene cluster encoding the fimsbactin synthetase (fbs) was identified in both genomes, and mutants in fbs genes in A. baylyi were analyzed, thus allowing prediction of the fimsbactin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: In vitro and in vivo production of new aminocoumarins by a combined biochemical, genetic, and synthetic approach Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin, novobiocin, and coumermycin A(1) are inhibitors of bacterial gyrase. Their chemical structures contain amide bonds, formed between an aminocoumarin ring and an aromatic acyl component, which is 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate in the case of novobiocin and clorobiocin. These amide bonds are formed under catalysis of the gene products of cloL, novL, and couL, respectively. We first examined the substrate specificity of the purified amide synthetases CloL, NovL, and CouL for the various analogs of the prenylated benzoate moiety. We then generated new aminocoumarin antibiotics by feeding synthetic analogs of the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate moiety to a mutant strain defective in the biosynthesis of the prenylated benzoate moiety. This resulted in the formation of 32 new aminocoumarin compounds. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using FAB-MS and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy.	1
Title: DNA damage by histone radicals in nucleosome core particles Abstract: Although DNA binding proteins shield the genetic material from diffusible reactive oxygen species by reacting with them, the resulting protein (peroxyl) radicals can oxidize the bound DNA. To explore this possible DNA damage by protein radicals, histone H4 proteins containing an azoalkane radical precursor at defined sites were prepared. Photolysis of a nucleosome core particle containing the modified protein produces DNA damage that is consistent with selective C4'-oxidation. The nucleotide(s) damaged is highly dependent on proximity to the protein radical. These experiments provide insight into the effects of oxidative stress on protein-bound DNA, revealing an additional layer of complexity concerning nucleic acid damage.	0
Title: Sorting signals, N-terminal modifications and abundance of the chloroplast proteome Abstract: Characterization of the chloroplast proteome is needed to understand the essential contribution of the chloroplast to plant growth and development. Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86% had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that 'spectral counting' can provide large scale protein quantification for Arabidopsis. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction. No evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system. This study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded Plant Proteome Database (PPDB) in which all MS data are projected on identified gene models.	0
Title: Phallusialides A-E, Pyrrole-Derived Alkaloids Discovered from a Marine-Derived Micromonospora sp. Bacterium Using MS-Based Metabolomics Approaches Abstract: Integrating MS-based metabolomics approaches, LC-MS-PCA and molecular networking enabled the targeted isolation of five new pyrrole-derived alkaloids, phallusialides A-E (1-5), from a marine-derived Micromonospora sp. bacterium. The structures of 1-5 were elucidated by analysis of their HRMS, MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration of phallusialide A (1) was determined on the basis of comparisons of experimental and theoretically calculated ECD spectra. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and E. coli, with MIC values of 32 and 64 μg/mL, respectively, whereas 3-5 showed no antibacterial activity even at 256 μg/mL, yielding important SAR insights for this class of compounds.	0
Title: Conformation and lipid binding of a C-terminal (198-243) peptide of human apolipoprotein A-I Abstract: Human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principle apolipoprotein of high-density lipoproteins that are critically involved in reverse cholesterol transport. The intrinsically flexibility of apoA-I has hindered studies of the structural and functional details of the protein. Our strategy is to study peptide models representing different regions of apoA-I. Our previous report on [1-44]apoA-I demonstrated that this N-terminal region is unstructured and folds into approximately 60% alpha-helix with a moderate lipid binding affinity. We now present details of the conformation and lipid interaction of a C-terminal 46-residue peptide, [198-243]apoA-I, encompassing putative helix repeats 10 and 9 and the second half of repeat 8 from the C-terminus of apoA-I. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra show that [198-243]apoA-I is also unfolded in aqueous solution. However, self-association induces approximately 50% alpha-helix in the peptide. The self-associated peptide exists mainly as a tetramer, as determined by native electrophoresis, cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, and unfolding data from circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the presence of a number of lipid-mimicking detergents, above their CMC, approximately 60% alpha-helix was induced in the peptide. In contrast, SDS, an anionic lipid-mimicking detergent, induced helical folding in the peptide at a concentration of approximately 0.003% (approximately 100 microM), approximately 70-fold below its typical CMC (0.17-0.23% or 6-8 mM). Both monomeric and tetrameric peptide can solubilize dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes and fold into approximately 60% alpha-helix. Fractionation by density gradient ultracentrifugation and visualization by negative staining electromicroscopy demonstrated that the peptide binds to DMPC with a high affinity to form at least two sizes of relatively homogeneous discoidal HDL-like particles depending on the initial lipid:peptide ratio. The characteristics (lipid:peptide weight ratio, diameter, and density) of both complexes are similar to those of plasma A-I/DMPC complexes formed under similar conditions: small discoidal complexes (approximately 3:1 weight ratio, approximately 110 A, and approximately 1.10 g/cm3) formed at an initial 1:1 weight ratio and larger discoidal complexes (approximately 4.6:1 weight ratio, approximately 165 A, and approximately 1.085 g/cm3) formed at initial 4:1 weight ratio. The cross-linking data for the peptide on the complexes of two sizes is consistent with the calculated peptide numbers per particle. Compared to the approximately 100 A disk-like complex formed by the N-terminal peptide in which helical structure was insufficient to cover the disk edge by a single belt, the compositions of these two types of complexes formed by the C-terminal peptide are more consistent with a "double belt" model, similar to that proposed for full-length apoA-I. Thus, our data provide direct evidence that this C-terminal region of apoA-I is responsible for the self-association of apoA-I, and this C-terminal peptide model can mimic the interaction with the phospholipid of plasma apoA-I to form two sizes of homogeneous discoidal complexes and thus may be responsible for apoA-I function in the formation and maintenance of HDL subspecies in plasma.	0
Title: Genome Mining Reveals Neurospora crassa Can Produce the Salicylaldehyde Sordarial Abstract: A highly reducing polyketide synthase gene cluster from the Magnaporthe oryzae genome was previously identified to produce phytotoxic compounds including pyriculol. A homologous gene cluster was found in Neurospora crassa through bioinformatics analysis. Heterologous expression of this cluster led to the production of the salicylic aldehyde sordarial and related intermediates. A series of combinatorial gene expression experiments established the set of enzymes required to produce sordarial and the likely biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the 2-pyridone tenellin in the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Genomic DNA from the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana was used as a template in a PCR with degenerate primers designed to amplify a fragment of a C-methyl transferase (CMeT) domain from a highly reduced fungal polyketide synthase (PKS). The resulting 270-bp PCR product was homologous to other fungal PKS CMeT domains and was used as a probe to isolate a 7.3-kb fragment of genomic DNA from a BamH1 library. Further library probing and TAIL-PCR then gave a 21.9-kb contig that encoded a 12.9-kb fused type I PKS-NRPS ORF together with ORFs encoding other oxidative and reductive enzymes. A directed knockout experiment with a BaR cassette, reported for the first time in B. bassiana, identified the PKS-NRPS as being involved in the biosynthesis of the 2-pyridone tenellin. Other fungal PKS-NRPS genes are known to be involved in the formation of tetramic acids in fungi, and it thus appears likely that related compounds are precursors of 2-pyridones in fungi. B. bassiana tenellin KO and WT strains proved to be equally pathogenic towards insect larvae; this indicated that tenellin is not involved in insect pathogenesis.	1
Title: Enzymes catalyzing the early steps of clavulanic acid biosynthesis are encoded by two sets of paralogous genes in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Genes encoding the proteins required for clavulanic acid biosynthesis and for cephamycin biosynthesis are grouped into a "supercluster" in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Nine open reading frames (ORFs) associated with clavulanic acid biosynthesis were located in a 15-kb segment of the supercluster, including six ORFs encoding known biosynthetic enzymes or regulatory proteins, two ORFs that have been reported previously but whose involvement in clavulanic acid biosynthesis is unclear, and one ORF not previously reported. Evidence for the involvement of these ORFs in clavulanic acid production was obtained by generating mutants and showing that all were defective for clavulanic acid production when grown on starch asparagine medium. However, when five of the nine mutants, including mutants defective in known clavulanic acid biosynthetic enzymes, were grown in a soy-based medium, clavulanic acid-producing ability was restored. This ability to produce clavulanic acid when seemingly essential biosynthetic enzymes have been mutated suggests that paralogous genes encoding functionally equivalent proteins exist for each of the five genes but that these paralogues are expressed only in the soy-based medium. The five genes that have paralogues encode proteins involved in the early steps of the pathway common to the biosynthesis of both clavulanic acid and the other clavam metabolites produced by this organism. No evidence was seen for paralogues of the four remaining genes involved in late, clavulanic acid-specific steps in the pathway.	1
Title: Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biosynthesis of a Cysteate-Containing Nonribosomal Peptide in Streptomyces lincolnensis Abstract: The species Streptomyces lincolnensis is known as a producer of lincomycin A, a clinically important lincosamide antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report that S. lincolnensis produces a new cysteate-containing lactone product, cysteoamide (1), which arises from nonribosomal peptide synthetase-programmed sequential assembly of the monomers phenylacetic acid, valine, cysteate, threonine, β-hydroxyleucine, and β-alanine and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form a lactone ring. The structure of 1 was determined by combined analysis of NMR and MS spectra, while the amino acid absolute configurations in 1 were assigned by Marfey's analysis following acid hydrolysis. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 was defined in the genome of S. lincolnensis by bioinformatics analysis and in vivo genetic study. In addition, in vitro assay revealed that OrfA, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent protein, is responsible for the formation of the unusual cysteate unit. Cysteate-containing nonribosomal peptides appear to be widely present in various Streptomyces strains, and this study generates interest in their intrinsic functions that remain poorly understood.	1
Title: Oxidative Ring Contraction by a Multifunctional Dioxygenase Generates the Core Cycloocatadiene in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Dimeric Anhydride Zopfiellin Abstract: To elucidate the biosynthesis of a fungicidal dimeric anhydride zopfiellin, the putative biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. We conducted heterologous expression of candidate genes for the synthesis of maleic anhydride and its dimerization and identified the two isomeric dimers with 9-membered rings as products. Notably, α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ZopK oxidized one of the dimers, giving the 8-membered ring of zopfiellin. The mechanism of oxidative rearrangement is proposed by analyzing the incorporation of 13C-labeled precursors.	1
Title: SimReg1 is a master switch for biosynthesis and export of simocyclinone D8 and its precursors Abstract: Analysis of the simocyclinone biosynthesis (sim) gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040 led to the identification of a putative pathway specific regulatory gene simReg1. In silico analysis places the SimReg1 protein in the OmpR-PhoB subfamily of response regulators. Gene replacement of simReg1 from the S. antibioticus chromosome completely abolishes simocyclinone production indicating that SimReg1 is a key regulator of simocyclinone biosynthesis. Results of the DNA-shift assays and reporter gene expression analysis are consistent with the idea that SimReg1 activates transcription of simocyclinone biosynthesis, transporter genes, regulatory gene simReg3 and his own transcription. The presence of extracts (simocyclinone) from S. antibioticus Tü6040 × pSSimR1-1 could dissociate SimReg1 from promoter regions. A preliminary model for regulation of simocyclinone biosynthesis and export is discussed.	1
Title: Structure, biosynthetic origin, and engineered biosynthesis of calcium-dependent antibiotics from Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA), from Streptomyces coelicolor, is an acidic lipopeptide comprising an N-terminal 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl fatty acid side chain and several nonproteinogenic amino acid residues. S. coelicolor grown on solid media was shown to produce several previously uncharacterized peptides with C-terminal Z-dehydrotryptophan residues. The CDA biosynthetic gene cluster contains open reading frames encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases, fatty acid synthases, and enzymes involved in precursor supply and tailoring of the nascent peptide. On the basis of protein sequence similarity and chemical reasoning, the biosynthesis of CDA is rationalized. Deletion of SCO3229 (hmaS), a putative 4-hydroxymandelic acid synthase-encoding gene, abolishes CDA production. The exogenous supply of 4-hydroxymandelate, 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate, or 4-hydroxyphenylglycine re-establishes CDA production by the DeltahmaS mutant. Feeding analogs of these precursors to the mutant resulted in the directed biosynthesis of novel lipopeptides with modified arylglycine residues.	1
Title: Lactobacillus plantarum ccl gene is non-essential, arginine-repressed and codes for a conserved protein in Firmicutes Abstract: Among proteins specifically found in most gram-positive bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, conserved proteins of the family pfam06177-DUF988-COG4708 are of unknown function. The citrulline cluster-linked (ccl) gene of Lactobacillus plantarum codes one such protein and is adjacent to the citrulline biosynthesis operon argCJBDF, a situation also found in Lactococcus lactis. This gene is well conserved among L. plantarum species, and 1 isolate out of 24 harbored two ccl copies. Northern hybridization with a ccl probe revealed two arginine-repressed transcripts with sizes corresponding to the predicted argCJBDF-ccl operon and the ccl gene alone. Transcription start sites of both transcripts were characterized. Four different 5' ends were mapped at the argF-ccl intergenic region, resulting from either regulated transcription initiation or maturation of the transcripts. Transcriptional ccl-gusA gene fusion confirmed the promoter activity of the argF-ccl intergenic region. Thus, the ccl gene is arginine-repressed and transcribed both monocistronically and polycistronically in the argCJBDF-ccl operon. The ccl gene is not essential in L. plantarum, because a ccl gene deletion was obtained in strain CCM 1904. Although no functions were found in the tested laboratory conditions, the Ccl-like proteins may play a role in environmental conditions of life.	1
Title: Heterologous Gene Expression of N-Terminally Truncated Variants of LipPks1 Suggests a Functionally Critical Structural Motif in the N-terminus of Modular Polyketide Synthase Abstract: Streptomyces genomes have a high G + C content and typically use an ATG or GTG codon to initiate protein synthesis. Although gene-finding tools perform well in low GC genomes, it is known that the accuracy in predicting a translational start site (TSS) is much less for high GC genomes. LipPks1 is a Streptomyces-derived, well-characterized modular polyketide synthase (PKS). Using this enzyme as a model, we experimentally investigated the effects of alternative TSSs using a heterologous host, Streptomyces venezuelae. One of the TSSs employed boosted the protein level by 59-fold and the product yield by 23-fold compared to the originally annotated start codon. Interestingly, a structural model of the PKS indicated the presence of a structural motif in the N-terminus, which may explain the observed different protein levels together with a proline and arginine-rich sequence that may inhibit translational initiation. This structure was also found in six other modular PKSs that utilize noncarboxylated starter substrates, which may guide the selection of optimal TSSs in conjunction with start-codon prediction software.	0
Title: Terfestatins B and C, New p-Terphenyl Glycosides Produced by Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8 Abstract: Terfestatins B (1) and C (2), new p-terphenyls bearing a novel unsaturated hexuronic acid (4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronate), a unique β-D-glycosyl ester of 5-isoprenylindole-3-carboxylate (3) and the same rare sugar, and two new hygromycin precursors, were characterized as metabolites of the coal mine fire isolate Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8. EtOH damage neuroprotection assays using rat hippocampal-derived primary cell cultures with 1, 2, 3 and echoside B (a terfestatin C-3'-β-D-glucuronide from Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8) revealed 1 as potently neuroprotective, highlighting a new potential application of the terfestatin scaffold.	1
Title: PCR fragmentation of DNA Abstract: A method has been developed to prepare random DNA fragments using PCR. First, two cycles are carried out at 16 degrees C with the Klenow's fragment and oligonucleotides (random primers) with random 3'-sequences and the 5'-constant part containing the site for cloning with the site-specific endonuclease. The random primers can link to any DNA site, and random DNA fragments are formed during DNA synthesis. During the second cycle, after denaturation of the DNA and addition of the Klenow's fragment, the random primers can link to newly synthesized DNA strands, and after DNA synthesis single-stranded DNA fragments are produced which have a constant primer sequence at the 5'-end and a complementary to it sequence at the 3'-end. During the third cycle, the constant primer is added and double-stranded fragments with the constant primer sequences at both ends are formed during DNA synthesis. Incubation for 1 h at 37 degrees C degrades the oligonucleotides used at the first stage due to endonuclease activity of the Klenow's fragment. Then routine PCR amplification is carried out using the constant primer. This method is more advantageous than hydrodynamic methods of DNA fragmentation widely used for "shotgun" cloning.	0
Title: An efficient and novel screening model for assessing the bioactivity of extracts against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa using Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: As a large number of multidrug-resistant bacteria have emerged, and there is an urgent need for the development of new antibacterial agents. In this study, we developed a liquid-based slow killing assay to be carried out in standard 96-well microtiter plates. This screening method was designed to facilitate high-throughput screening of small molecules and extracts. In antibiotic rescue assays, the Caenorhabditis elegans multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model displayed a high degree of drug resistance in vivo and in vitro. We used the method to screen 1,300 extracts, and found 36 extracts (2.7%) which prolonged the survival of infected nematodes, and four (0.3%) of these extracts showed in vitro and in vivo anti-multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa activity. These results indicate that the whole-animal C. elegans multidrug-resistant bacterial model can be used to screen antibacterial compounds, and can also be useful for bioactive compounds which most likely cannot be identified in vitro.	0
Title: Rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unprotected NH imines assisted by a thiourea Abstract: Asymmetric hydrogenation of unprotected NH imines catalyzed by rhodium/bis(phosphine)-thiourea provided chiral amines with up to 97% yield and 95% ee. (1)H NMR studies, coupled with control experiments, implied that catalytic chloride-bound intermediates were involved in the mechanism through a dual hydrogen-bonding interaction. Deuteration experiments proved that the hydrogenation proceeded through a pathway consistent with an imine.	0
Title: Capture of uropathogenic E. coli by using synthetic glycan ligands specific for the pap-pilus Abstract: Biotinylated mono- and biantennary di-/trisaccharides were synthesized to evaluate their ability to capture E. coli strains that express pilus types with different receptor specificities. The synthesized biotinylated di-/trisaccharides contain Galα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)GalNHAc, GalNHAcα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and GalNHAcα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc as carbohydrate epitopes. These biotinylated oligosaccharides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and incubated with different strains of live E. coli. Capturing ability was assessed by using a luciferase assay that detects bacterial ATP. The trisaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and the disaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Gal as the epitopes exhibited strong capturing ability for uropathogenic E. coli strains with the pap pilus genotype, including CFT073, J96 and J96 pilE. The same ligands failed to capture E. coli strains with fim, prs, or foc genotypes. Uropathogenic CFT073 was also captured moderately by biantennary disaccharides containing a GalNHAc moiety at the reducing end; however, other saccharides containing GalNHAc at the nonreducing end did not capture the CFT073 strain. These synthetic glycoconjugates could potentially be adapted as rapid diagnostic agents to differentiate between different E. coli pathovars.	0
Title: Quantitative detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes in dental plaque Abstract: We developed quantitative fimA genotype assays and applied them in a pilot study investigating the fimbrial genotype distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis in European subjects with or without chronic periodontitis. P. gingivalis was found in 71% and 9% of the samples from patients and healthy subjects, respectively. Enumeration of total P. gingivalis cell numbers by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence showed excellent correspondence (r = 0.964). 73% of positive samples contained multiple fimA genotypes, but generally one genotype predominated by one to three orders of magnitude. Genotype II predominated in 60% of the samples. Genotype IV occurred with similar prevalence (73%) as genotype II but predominated in only 20% of the samples. Genotypes I, III and V were of much lower prevalence and cell densities of the latter two remained sparse. Our results suggest marked differences among the fimA genotypes' ability to colonize host sites with high cell numbers.	0
Title: Palladium-catalyzed C3-benzylation of indoles Abstract: A general method for regioselective C3-benzylation of indoles has been developed. Various 3-substituted indoles and benzyl methyl carbonates with different electronic properties react under mild conditions to afford a diverse range of 3-benzylindolenine products in good yields.	0
Title: Glycopeptide biosynthesis: Dbv21/Orf2 from dbv/tcp gene clusters are N-Ac-Glm teicoplanin pseudoaglycone deacetylases and Orf15 from cep gene cluster is a Glc-1-P thymidyltransferase Abstract: The unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activities of glycopeptide antibiotics are conferred from the tailoring steps occurring on the aglycone. It was hypothesized that the sugar moiety attached to the aglycone is derived from an unusual UDP-glucosamine and is followed by an acylation reaction in the biosynthesis of teicoplanin/A40926. Here we report that three homologous (>65% identical) proteins Dbv21, Orf2*, and Orf15, previously assigned as hypothetical proteins in the biosynthesis of A40926, teicoplanin, and chloroeremomycin, respectively, are novel deacetylases (Dbv21 and Orf2*) and thymidyltransferase (Orf15). Dbv21 and Orf2* catalyze the deacetylation reaction of N-acetylglucosaminyl-teicoplanin pseudoaglycone, while Orf15 catalyzes the formation of dTDP-glucose that is required for the epi-vancosamine/vancosamine decoration of chloroeremomycin/vancomycin.	1
Title: In vivo conversion of L-serine to D-alanine in a ribosomally synthesized polypeptide Abstract: In the course of characterizing the bacteriocin lactocin S and its encoding gene, we discovered three alanine-for-serine substitutions which, apparently, is a violation of the genetic code. Subsequent chiral analysis of lactocin S hydrolysates revealed a correlation between D-alanine content and the three substitutions, implying a conversion of L-serine to D-alanine in lactocin S maturation. In order to explain this observation, we suggest a sequence of events initiated by the dehydration of serine, which is common in the biosynthesis of the lanthionine-containing polycyclic lantibiotics (Schnell, N., Entian, K.-D., Schneider, U., Götz, F., Zähner, H., Kellner, R. & Jung, G. (1988) Nature 333, 276-278; Jung, G. (1991) Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30, 1051-1068; Bierbaum, G. & Sahl, H.-G. (1993) Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 278, 1-22) and completed by the stereospecific reduction of dehydroalanine residues. The occurrence of non-lanthionine alpha-carbon stereoinversion in lactocin S maturation substantiates the hypothetical alpha-epimerization scheme originally put forward by Bycroft (Bycroft, B. W. (1969) Nature 224, 595-597), and we propose a revision of this model to accommodate the lactocin S-type stereoinversion. Lactocin S is the first prokaryotic exception to the rule that only L-amino acids are included in ribosomally synthesized peptides.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of Burkholderia rhizoxinica, an Endosymbiont of Rhizopus microsporus Abstract: Burkholderia rhizoxinica is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizopus microsporus. The vertically transmitted endosymbiont not only delivers the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin to its host but is also essential for vegetative spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism, we sequenced the whole genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454, thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a fungal species. The 3.75-Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain-specific plasmids. The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of fungal metabolites. Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. Furthermore, the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence-related factors, which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.	1
Title: Toward a Microparticle-Based System for Pooled Assays of Small Molecules in Cellular Contexts Abstract: Experimental approaches to the discovery of small molecule probes and drug candidates often use biochemical or cell-based screening of large libraries (>105) of small molecules. Small molecules of interest are tested one at a time in individual wells of a microtiter plate, at a significant cost in time and resources. Furthermore, evaluation of large numbers of compounds in such assays requires robust cellular or biochemical screening formats that may not be relevant to the contexts found in human patients. We envision a solution to these issues that involves a pooled system of small molecule screening, which would require development of numerous new technologies, and solutions to several key challenges. We report here that a microparticle-based screening system can allow for screening of small molecules in such a pooled fashion, analogous to the pooled screens of genetic reagents that have been powerfully deployed in recent years. We developed a cleavable linker that can link small molecules of interest to silica microparticle beads, a DNA tag encoding the identity of the small molecule on each bead that was attached to the silica beads through a photocleavable linker to enable its amplification, and a bead-based fluorescent sensor that can report on the activity of small molecules in cells. We suggest that this pooled small molecule screening system could ultimately be useful for drug and probe discovery, allowing rapid and inexpensive screening of small molecules in assays of relevance to human diseases.	0
Title: Highly diverse cyanobactins in strains of the genus Anabaena Abstract: Cyanobactins are small, cyclic peptides recently found in cyanobacteria. They are formed through proteolytic cleavage and posttranslational modification of short precursor proteins and exhibit antitumor, cytotoxic, or multi-drug-reversing activities. Using genome project data, bioinformatics, stable isotope labeling, and mass spectrometry, we discovered novel cyclic peptides, anacyclamides, in 27 Anabaena strains. The lengths of the anacylamides varied greatly, from 7 to 20 amino acids. Pronounced sequence variation was also detected, and only one amino acid, proline, was present in all anacyclamides. The anacyclamides identified included unmodified proteinogenic or prenylated amino acids. We identified an 11-kb gene cluster in the genome of Anabaena sp. 90, and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli confirmed that this cluster was responsible for anacyclamide production. The discovery of anacyclamides greatly increases the structural diversity of cyanobactins.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of versipelostatin: identification of an enzyme-catalyzed [4+2]-cycloaddition required for macrocyclization of spirotetronate-containing polyketides Abstract: Versipelostatin (VST) is an unusual 17-membered macrocyclic polyketide product that contains a spirotetronate skeleton. In this study, the entire VST biosynthetic gene cluster (vst) spanning 108 kb from Streptomyces versipellis 4083-SVS6 was identified by heterologous expression using a bacterial artificial chromosome vector. Here, we demonstrate that an enzyme, VstJ, catalyzes the stereoselective [4+2]-cycloaddition between the conjugated diene and the exocyclic olefin of a newly identified tetronate-containing intermediate to form the spirotetronate skeleton during VST biosynthesis.	1
Title: Carbon-starvation induction of the ugp operon, encoding the binding protein-dependent sn-glycerol-3-phosphate transport system in Escherichia coli Abstract: The gene products of the ugp operon of Escherichia coli are responsible for the uptake of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and certain glycerophosphodiesters. The regulation of ugp is mainly phoBR-dependent. Significant expression, however, can be observed even in the presence of high concentrations of phosphate, a condition which normally completely represses pho expression. Pho-independent ugp expression was found to be derepressed during the late logarithmic growth phase due to carbon starvation. Among different carbon sources tested, glucose caused the most complete repression. Addition of cAMP prevented glucose repression, indicating that a cAMP-CRP control mechanism may be directly or indirectly involved in the carbon-starvation response. This conclusion is supported by the fact that pho-independent ugp expression correlated with the presence of the cya and crp gene products.	0
Title: Modification of the second translation initiation site restricts the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus in PK-15 cells Abstract: The translation initiation of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) occurs at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). Usually, the Lb AUG is more favorably used to initiate protein synthesis than the Lab AUG. To explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, this initiation codon was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA). Fortunately, the modifications did not prevent viral viability but influenced replication characteristics of some FMDV mutants in a cell-specific manner, as was shown by the similar replication in BHK-21 cells and delayed growth kinetics in PK-15 cells. This attenuated phenotype of FMDV mutants in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with reduced abilities to cleave eIF4GI and suppress interference (IFN) expression. As leader (L) protein was reported to be responsible for eIF4GI cleavage and inhibition of IFN expression, the in vivo L protein synthesis was examined during the infection of FMDV mutants. Our results showed that not only the total yield of L proteins was severely influenced but also the individual yield of L protein was seen to be affected, which implied that both the relative usage of the two initiation sites and overall translation efficiency were changed by Lb AUG modifications. In addition, the in vitro translation activity was also negatively regulated by Lb AUG mutations. Collectively, these findings suggested that the restricted replications of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs were related to the delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression but were mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation. FMDVs precisely with modifications of Lb AUG initiation codon may represent safer seed viruses for vaccine production. KEY POINTS: • The polyprotein translation of FMDV initiates at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). In order to explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, the Lb initiation AUG was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA), and four FMDV mutants with Lb AUG modification were generated. • We found that partial FMDV mutants grew almost as well as WT virus in BHK-21 cells, a typical cell line used for FMD vaccine production, but displayed impaired replication in IFN-competent PK-15 cells. • The attenuation of mutant FMDVs in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression. • We proved that the attenuated phenotype of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs was mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation, as demonstrated by the decrease of total yield of L proteins and individual production of L protein. • We successfully generated genetically engineered FMDV with attenuated phenotype. The approach of precise engineering of FMDV with the modification of initiation codon provides a safe platform to produce inactivated antigen vaccines.	0
Title: Dalmanol biosyntheses require coupling of two separate polyketide gene clusters Abstract: Polyketide-polyketide hybrids are unique natural products with promising bioactivity, but the hybridization processes remain poorly understood. Herein, we present that the biosynthetic pathways of two immunosuppressants, dalmanol A and acetodalmanol A, result from an unspecific monooxygenase triggered hybridization of two distinct polyketide (naphthalene and chromane) biosynthetic gene clusters. The orchestration of the functional dimorphism of the polyketide synthase (ChrA) ketoreductase (KR) domain (shortened as ChrA KR) with that of the KR partner (ChrB) in the bioassembly line increases the polyketide diversity and allows the fungal generation of plant chromanes (e.g., noreugenin) and phloroglucinols (e.g., 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone). The simultaneous fungal biosynthesis of 1,3,6,8- and 2-acetyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalenes was addressed as well. Collectively, the work may symbolize a movement in understanding the multiple-gene-cluster involved natural product biosynthesis, and highlights the possible fungal generations of some chromane- and phloroglucinol-based phytochemicals.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of a biosynthetic gene cluster required for the synthesis of BII-Rafflesfungin from the fungus Phoma sp. F3723 Abstract: Background:                       Phomafungin is a recently reported broad spectrum antifungal compound but its biosynthetic pathway is unknown. We combed publicly available Phoma genomes but failed to find any putative biosynthetic gene cluster that could account for its biosynthesis.                  Results:                       Therefore, we sequenced the genome of one of our Phoma strains (F3723) previously identified as having antifungal activity in a high-throughput screen. We found a biosynthetic gene cluster that was predicted to synthesize a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that differs in the amino acid composition compared to Phomafungin. Antifungal activity guided isolation yielded a new compound, BII-Rafflesfungin, the structure of which was determined.                  Conclusions:                       We describe the NRPS-t1PKS cluster 'BIIRfg' compatible with the synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide BII-Rafflesfungin [HMHDA-L-Ala-L-Glu-L-Asn-L-Ser-L-Ser-D-Ser-D-allo-Thr-Gly]. We report new Stachelhaus codes for Ala, Glu, Asn, Ser, Thr, and Gly. We propose a mechanism for BII-Rafflesfungin biosynthesis, which involves the formation of the lipid part by BIIRfg_PKS followed by activation and transfer of the lipid chain by a predicted AMP-ligase on to the first PCP domain of the BIIRfg_NRPS gene.	1
Title: Lateral gene transfer of dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase revisited Abstract: In contrast to previous findings, we demonstrate that the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase genes (dsrAB) of Desulfobacula toluolica were vertically inherited. Furthermore, Desulfobacterium anilini and strain mXyS1 were identified, by dsrAB sequencing of 17 reference strains, as members of the donor lineage for those gram-positive Desulfotomaculum species which laterally acquired dsrAB.	0
Title: Gravity field of the Orientale basin from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Mission Abstract: The Orientale basin is the youngest and best-preserved major impact structure on the Moon. We used the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft to investigate the gravitational field of Orientale at 3- to 5-kilometer (km) horizontal resolution. A volume of at least (3.4 ± 0.2) × 106 km3 of crustal material was removed and redistributed during basin formation. There is no preserved evidence of the transient crater that would reveal the basin's maximum volume, but its diameter may now be inferred to be between 320 and 460 km. The gravity field resolves distinctive structures of Orientale's three rings and suggests the presence of faults associated with the outer two that penetrate to the mantle. The crustal structure of Orientale provides constraints on the formation of multiring basins.	0
Title: Plant, animal, and fungal micronutrient queuosine is salvaged by members of the DUF2419 protein family Abstract: Queuosine (Q) is a modification found at the wobble position of tRNAs with GUN anticodons. Although Q is present in most eukaryotes and bacteria, only bacteria can synthesize Q de novo. Eukaryotes acquire queuine (q), the free base of Q, from diet and/or microflora, making q an important but under-recognized micronutrient for plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic type tRNA-guanine transglycosylases (eTGTs) are composed of a catalytic subunit (QTRT1) and a homologous accessory subunit (QTRTD1) forming a complex that catalyzes q insertion into target tRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of eTGT subunits revealed a patchy distribution pattern in which gene losses occurred independently in different clades. Searches for genes co-distributing with eTGT family members identified DUF2419 as a potential Q salvage protein family. This prediction was experimentally validated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by confirming that Q was present by analyzing tRNA(Asp) with anticodon GUC purified from wild-type cells and by showing that Q was absent from strains carrying deletions in the QTRT1 or DUF2419 encoding genes. DUF2419 proteins occur in most Eukarya with a few possible cases of horizontal gene transfer to bacteria. The universality of the DUF2419 function was confirmed by complementing the S. pombe mutant with the Zea mays (maize), human, and Sphaerobacter thermophilus homologues. The enzymatic function of this family is yet to be determined, but structural similarity with DNA glycosidases suggests a ribonucleoside hydrolase activity.	0
Title: Three pathway-specific regulators control streptolydigin biosynthesis in Streptomyces lydicus Abstract: The streptolydigin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433 contains three putative regulatory genes, slgR1, slgR2 and slgY, encoding proteins belonging to TetR and LuxR transcriptional regulator families and ATP/GTP-binding proteins of DNA and RNA helicase superfamily I, respectively. Inactivation of slgR1 or slgR2 resulted in the abolition of streptolydigin production, suggesting that these proteins are pathway-specific positive regulators. In the case of the slgR1 mutant, low amounts of streptolydigin C were produced instead of streptolydigin. RT-PCR transcription analysis of streptolydigin biosynthesis genes revealed a hierarchical regulation process. SlgY was found to control the expression of the regulator slgR2. SlgR2 regulates the expression of structural genes involved in the formation of the streptolydigin bicyclic ketal moiety, incorporation and processing of 3-methylaspartate, and the regulator slgR1. On the other hand, SlgR1 controls the expression of slgE1-E2, involved in the conversion of glutamate to 3-methylaspartate, and putative glycoside hydrolases slgC1 and slgC2. Ectopic expression of slgR1, slgR2 and slgY regulatory genes in S. lydicus led to considerable increases in streptolydigin yields, 18-, 11- and 8.5-fold, respectively. Ectopic expression of slgY in an slgR1 mutant led to a 14-fold increase of streptolydigin C yields, while no effect was observed to result from expression of slgR2.	1
Title: Effective approaches to discover new microbial metabolites in a large strain library Abstract: Natural products have provided many molecules to treat and prevent illnesses in humans, animals and plants. While only a small fraction of the existing microbial diversity has been explored for bioactive metabolites, tens of thousands of molecules have been reported in the literature over the past 80 years. Thus, the main challenge in microbial metabolite screening is to avoid the re-discovery of known metabolites in a cost-effective manner. In this perspective, we report and discuss different approaches used in our laboratory over the past few years, ranging from bioactivity-based screening to looking for metabolic rarity in different datasets to deeply investigating a single Streptomyces strain. Our results show that it is possible to find novel chemistry through a limited screening effort, provided that appropriate selection criteria are in place.	0
Title: Single-cell FRET imaging of transferrin receptor trafficking dynamics by Sfp-catalyzed, site-specific protein labeling Abstract: Fluorescence imaging of living cells depends on an efficient and specific method for labeling the target cellular protein with fluorophores. Here we show that Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling is suitable for fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins that spend at least part of their membrane trafficking cycle at the cell surface. In this study, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was fused to peptide carrier protein (PCP), and the TfR1-PCP fusion protein was specifically labeled with fluorophore Alexa 488 by Sfp. The trafficking of transferrin-TfR1-PCP complex during the process of transferrin-mediated iron uptake was imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescently labeled transferrin ligand and TfR1 receptor. We thus demonstrated that Sfp-catalyzed small molecule labeling of the PCP tag represents a practical and efficient tool for molecular imaging studies in living cells.	0
Title: A phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene essential for biosynthesis of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from Moritella marina strain MP-1 Abstract: A phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene (pfaE), cloned from the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-producing bacterium Moritella marina strain MP-1, has an open reading frame of 861 bp encoding a 287-amino acid protein. When the pfaE gene was expressed with pfaA-D, which are four out of five essential genes for biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) derived from Shewanella pneumatophori SCRC-2738 in Escherichia coli, the recombinant produced 12% EPA of total fatty acids. This suggests that pfaE encodes a PPTase required for producing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is probably involved in the synthesis of DHA in M. marina strain MP-1.	1
Title: The BCCT family of carriers: from physiology to crystal structure Abstract: Increases in the environmental osmolarity are key determinants for the growth of microorganisms. To ensure a physiologically acceptable level of cellular hydration and turgor at high osmolarity, many bacteria accumulate compatible solutes. Osmotically controlled uptake systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective osmoprotectants. A number of these systems belong to the BCCT family (betaine-choline-carnitine-transporter), sodium- or proton-coupled transporters (e.g. BetP and BetT respectively) that are ubiquitous in microorganisms. The BCCT family also contains CaiT, an L-carnitine/γ-butyrobetaine antiporter that is not involved in osmotic stress responses. The glycine betaine transporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a representative for osmoregulated symporters of the BCCT family and functions both as an osmosensor and osmoregulator. The crystal structure of BetP in an occluded conformation in complex with its substrate glycine betaine and two crystal structures of CaiT in an inward-facing open conformation in complex with L-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine were reported recently. These structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of BetP in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity. Molecular determinants governing the high-affinity binding of the compatible solutes by BetP and CaiT, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for BetP and various BCCT carriers.	0
Title: Designed post-self-assembly structural and functional modifications of a truncated tetrahedron Abstract: Post-self-assembly modifications of a discrete metal-organic supramolecular structure have been developed. Such modifications allow the properties of the self-assembled supramolecular species to be changed in a simple and efficient manner (>90% yield). Initiated by the application of chemical stimuli, the post-self-assembly modifications described herein result in three distinct changes to the supramolecular system: an individual building-block component change, an overall structural modification, and a functional evolution of a [6+4] metal-organic supramolecular structure. The three modifications have been carefully examined by a range of characterization methods, including NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR measurements, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulations.	0
Title: Cell-specific RNA aptamer against human CCR5 specifically targets HIV-1 susceptible cells and inhibits HIV-1 infectivity Abstract: The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages that serves as a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. Loss of CCR5 is associated with resistance to HIV-1. Here, we combine the live-cell-based SELEX with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate CCR5 RNA aptamers capable of specifically targeting HIV-1 susceptible cells (as small interfering RNA [siRNA] delivery agent) and inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity (as antiviral agent) via block of the CCR5 required for HIV-1 to enter cells. One of the best candidates, G-3, efficiently bound and was internalized into human CCR5-expressing cells. The G-3 specifically neutralized R5 virus infection in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in vivo generated human CD4(+) T cells with a nanomolar inhibitory concentration 50%. G-3 was also capable of transferring functional siRNAs to CCR5-expressing cells. Collectively, the cell-specific, internalizing, CCR5-targeted aptamers and aptamer-siRNA conjugates offer promise for overcoming some of the current challenges of drug resistance in HIV-1 by providing cell-type- or tissue-specific delivery of various therapeutic moieties.	0
Title: Structure elucidation and biosynthetic locus of trinickiabactin from the plant pathogenic bacterium Trinickia caryophylli Abstract: Within the framework of our effort to discover new bioactive metabolites from Gram-negative bacteria, trinickiabactin (1) was isolated from the plant pathogenic strain Trinickia caryophylli DSM 50341. Whole genome sequencing allowed the identification of its biosynthetic gene cluster. The structure of 1 bears a rare diazeniumdiolate ligand system and was elucidated by a combination of NMR- and MS-spectroscopic techniques and bioinformatics. Trinickiabactin was found to be antibacterial toward several Gram-negative bacteria (MIC values ranged from 3.5 to 34.0 µg ml-1).	1
Title: DNA sequences required for translational frameshifting in production of the transposase encoded by IS1 Abstract: The transposase encoded by insertion sequence IS1 is produced from two out-of-phase reading frames (insA and B'-insB) by translational frameshifting, which occurs within a run of six adenines in the -1 direction. To determine the sequence essential for frameshifting, substitution mutations were introduced within the region containing the run of adenines and were examined for their effects on frameshifting. Substitutions at each of three (2nd, 3rd and 4th) adenine residues in the run, which are recognized by tRNA(Lys) reading insA, caused serious defects in frameshifting, showing that the three adenine residues are essential for frameshifting. The effects of substitution mutations introduced in the region flanking the run of adenines and in the secondary structures located downstream were, however, small, indicating that such a region and structures are not essential for frameshifting. Deletion of a region containing the termination codon of insA caused a decrease in beta-galactosidase activity specified by the lacZ fusion plasmid in frame with B'-insB. Exchange of the wild-type termination codon of insA for a different one or introduction of an additional termination codon in the region upstream of the native termination codon caused an increase in beta-galactosidase activity, indicating that the termination codon in insA affects the efficiency of frameshifting.	0
Title: A fluorogenic histone deacetylase assay well suited for high-throughput activity screening Abstract: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important enzymes for the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Recent findings suggest that HDACs could be key targets for chemotherapeutic intervention in malignant diseases. A convenient and sensitive fluorogenic assay for HDAC activity would therefore expedite studies of HDAC in transcriptional regulation and in vitro screening for drug discovery. In this study, novel fluorogenic substrates of HDACs were synthesized with an epsilon-acetylated lysyl moiety and an adjacent MCA moiety at the C terminus of the peptide chain. Upon deacetylation of the acetylated lysyl moiety, molecules became substrates for trypsin, which released highly fluorescent AMC molecules in a subsequent step of the assay. The fluorescence increased in direct proportion to the amount of deacetylated substrate molecules, i.e., HDAC activity. The nonisotopic, homogeneous assay is well suited for high-throughput HDAC inhibitor screening.	0
Title: Chemical proteomic probes for profiling cytochrome p450 activities and drug interactions in vivo Abstract: The cytochrome P450 (P450) superfamily metabolizes many endogenous signaling molecules and drugs. P450 enzymes are regulated by posttranslational mechanisms in vivo, which hinders their functional characterization by conventional genomic or proteomic methods. Here we describe a chemical proteomic strategy to profile P450 activities directly in living systems. Derivatization of a mechanism-based inhibitor with a "clickable" handle provided an activity-based probe that labels multiple P450s both in proteomic extracts and in vivo. This probe was used to record alterations in liver P450 activities triggered by chemical agents, including inducers of P450 expression and direct P450 inhibitors. The chemical proteomic strategy described herein thus offers a versatile method to monitor P450 activities and small-molecule interactions in any biological system and, through doing so, should facilitate the functional characterization of this large and diverse enzyme class.	0
Title: Discovery of C-Glycosylpyranonaphthoquinones in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 by a Combined NMR-Based Metabolomics and Bioinformatics Workflow Abstract: Mining of microbial genomes has revealed that actinomycetes harbor far more biosynthetic potential for bioactive natural products than anticipated. Activation of (cryptic) biosynthetic gene clusters and identification of the corresponding metabolites has become a focal point for drug discovery. Here, we applied NMR-based metabolomics combined with bioinformatics to identify novel C-glycosylpyranonaphthoquinones in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 and to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway. Following activation of the cryptic qin gene cluster for a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) by constitutive expression of its pathway-specific activator, bioinformatics coupled to NMR profiling facilitated the chromatographic isolation and structural elucidation of qinimycins A-C (1-3). The intriguing structural features of the qinimycins, including 8-C-glycosylation, 5,14-epoxidation, and 13-hydroxylation, distinguished these molecules from the model pyranonaphthoquinones actinorhodin, medermycin, and granaticin. Another novelty lies in the unusual fusion of a deoxyaminosugar to the pyranonaphthoquinone backbone during biosynthesis of the antibiotics BE-54238 A and B (4, 5). Qinimycins showed weak antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Our work shows the utility of combining bioinformatics, targeted activation of cryptic gene clusters, and NMR-based metabolic profiling as an effective pipeline for the discovery of microbial natural products with distinctive skeletons.	0
Title: Cebulantin, a Cryptic Lanthipeptide Antibiotic Uncovered Using Bioactivity-Coupled HiTES Abstract: The majority of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in bacteria are silent under standard laboratory growth conditions, making it challenging to uncover any antibiotics that they may encode. Herein, bioactivity assays are combined with high-throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) to access cryptic, bioactive metabolites. Application of this strategy in Saccharopolyspora cebuensis, with inhibition of Escherichia coli growth as a read-out, led to the identification of a novel lanthipeptide, cebulantin. Extensive NMR spectroscopic analysis allowed the elucidation of the structure of cebulantin. Subsequent bioactivity assays revealed it to be an antibiotic selective for Gram-negative bacteria, especially against Vibrio species. This approach, referred to as bioactivity-HiTES, has the potential to uncover cryptic metabolites with desired biological activities that are hidden in microbial genomes.	1
Title: Two-Enzyme Pathway Links l-Arginine to Nitric Oxide in N-Nitroso Biosynthesis Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) has wide-ranging roles in biology, but less is known about its role in building chemical diversity. Here we report a new route to NO from the biosynthetic pathway to the N-nitroso compound streptozocin. We show that the N-nitroso group of streptozocin comes from the biosynthetic reassembly of l-arginine, with the guanidino nitrogens forming a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. To understand this biosynthetic process, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of streptozocin and demonstrate that free l-arginine is N-methylated by StzE to give Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine. We show that this product is then oxidized by StzF, a nonheme iron-dependent enzyme unrelated to known nitric oxide synthases, generating a urea compound and NO. Our work implies that formation and capture of NO is the likely route to N-nitroso formation in vivo. Altogether, our work unveils a new enzyme pair for the production of NO from l-arginine and sets the stage for understanding biosynthetic routes to N-nitroso natural products.	1
Title: Zelkovamycin, a new cyclic peptide antibiotic from Streptomyces sp. K96-0670. I. Production, isolation and biological properties Abstract: A new antibiotic termed zelkovamycin was isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp.

Zelkovamycin showed antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae, Acholeplasma laidlawii, Pyricularia oryzae and Staphylococcus aureus.	0
Title: Structural basis of nonribosomal peptide macrocyclization in fungi Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) in fungi biosynthesize important pharmaceutical compounds, including penicillin, cyclosporine and echinocandin. To understand the fungal strategy of forging the macrocyclic peptide linkage, we determined the crystal structures of the terminal condensation-like (CT) domain and the holo thiolation (T)-CT complex of Penicillium aethiopicum TqaA. The first, to our knowledge, structural depiction of the terminal module in a fungal NRPS provides a molecular blueprint for generating new macrocyclic peptide natural products.	0
Title: Use of a scaffold peptide in the biosynthesis of amino acid-derived natural products Abstract: Genome sequencing of environmental bacteria allows identification of biosynthetic gene clusters encoding unusual combinations of enzymes that produce unknown natural products. We identified a pathway in which a ribosomally synthesized small peptide serves as a scaffold for nonribosomal peptide extension and chemical modification. Amino acids are transferred to the carboxyl terminus of the peptide through adenosine triphosphate and amino acyl-tRNA-dependent chemistry that is independent of the ribosome. Oxidative rearrangement, carboxymethylation, and proteolysis of a terminal cysteine yields an amino acid-derived small molecule. Microcrystal electron diffraction demonstrates that the resulting product is isosteric to glutamate. We show that a similar peptide extension is used during the biosynthesis of the ammosamides, which are cytotoxic pyrroloquinoline alkaloids. These results suggest an alternative paradigm for biosynthesis of amino acid-derived natural products.	1
Title: Improved production of A40926 by Nonomuraea sp. through deletion of a pathway-specific acetyltransferase Abstract: Nonomuraea strain ATCC 39727 produces the glycopeptide A40926, used for manufacturing dalbavancin, currently in advanced clinical trials. From the gene cluster involved in A40926 biosynthesis, a strain deleted in dbv23 was constructed. This mutant can produce only the glycopeptides lacking the O-linked acetyl residue at position 6 of the mannose moiety, while, under identical fermentation conditions, the wild-type strain produces mostly glycopeptides carrying an acetylated mannose. Furthermore, the total amount of glycopeptides produced by the mutant strain was found to be approximately twice that of the wild type. The reduced level of glycopeptides observed in the wild-type strain may be due to an inhibitory effect exerted by the acetylated compound on the biosynthesis of A40926. Indeed, spiking production cultures with > or =1 microg/ml of the acetylated glycopeptide inhibited A40926 production in the mutant strain.	1
Title: Synthesis of the isoxazolo[4,3,2-de]phenanthridinone moiety of the parnafungins Abstract: A practical route to the labile tetracyclic isoxazolo[4,3,2-de]phenanthridinone moiety of the antifungal parnafungins has been developed. Zinc reduction of a methyl 2'-hydroxymethyl-2-nitro-3-biphenylcarboxylate, which was prepared by a Suzuki coupling, afforded a benzisoxazolone that was treated with MsCl and base to generate the labile tetracyclic ring system in 37-47% yield. This compound decomposes to the phenanthridine in CDCl(3) and the phenanthridine N-oxide in aqueous base.	0
Title: Dominance of blaCTX-M within an Australian extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene pool Abstract: bla(CTX-M) genes, particularly bla(CTX-M-15), are the dominant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Sydney, Australia, where we also found one example of bla(CTX-M-62), encoding a novel enzyme conferring ceftazidime resistance. ESBL genes were present in diverse community isolates and in a variety of associated conjugative plasmids.	0
Title: Role of a major facilitator superfamily transporter in adaptation capacity of Penicillium funiculosum under extreme acidic stress Abstract: Fungal species present in extreme low pH environments are expected to have adapted for tolerance to high H(+) concentrations. However, their adaptability mechanism is unclear. In this study, we isolated an acid-tolerant strain of Penicillium funiculosum, which can grow actively at pH 1.0 and thrived in pH 0.6. A major facilitator superfamily transporter (PfMFS) was isolated from an acid-sensitive random insertional mutant (M4) of the fungus. It encodes a putative protein of 551 residues and contains 14 transmembrane-spanning segments. A targeted mutant (M7) carrying an inactivated copy of PfMFS showed an obvious reduction of growth compared with the wild type (WT) and complementation of M7 with PfMFS restored the wild-type level of growth at pH 1.0. Further data showed that the wild-type showed higher intracellular pH than M7 in response to pH 1. Subcellular localization showed that PfMFS was a cell membrane protein. Homology modeling showed structural similarity with an MFS transporter EmrD from Escherichiacoli. These results demonstrate that the PfMFS transporter is involved in the acid resistance and intracellular pH homeostasis of P. funiculosum.	0
Title: Activation and characterization of a cryptic polycyclic tetramate macrolactam biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) are a widely distributed class of natural products with important biological activities. However, many of these PTMs have not been characterized. Here we apply a plug-and-play synthetic biology strategy to activate a cryptic PTM biosynthetic gene cluster SGR810-815 from Streptomyces griseus and discover three new PTMs. This gene cluster is highly conserved in phylogenetically diverse bacterial strains and contains an unusual hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase, which resembles iterative polyketide synthases known in fungi. To further characterize this gene cluster, we use the same synthetic biology approach to create a series of gene deletion constructs and elucidate the biosynthetic steps for the formation of the polycyclic system. The strategy we employ bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit gene cluster expression and should be generally applicable to many other silent or cryptic gene clusters for discovery and characterization of new natural products.	1
Title: Crystallisation and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of cyclophilin-tetrapeptide and cyclophilin-cyclosporin complexes Abstract: Recombinant human cyclophilin has been co-crystallised with a number of peptides to give crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The crystal complexes for which heavy-atom derivatives have been prepared and X-ray data collected are: cyclophilin with N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-amidomethyl-coumarin (I) which crystallises in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 108.2, b = 123.0, c = 35.8 A, and cyclophilin with cyclosporin (II) which crystallises as tetragonal plates in space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with a = b = 94.98, c = 278.55 A.	0
Title: Bioorthogonally Applicable Fluorescence Deactivation Strategy for Receptor Kinetics Study and Theranostic Pretargeting Approaches Abstract: The availability of a receptor for theranostic pretargeting approaches was assessed by use of a new click-chemistry-based deactivatable fluorescence-quenching concept. The efficacy was evaluated in a cell-based model system featuring both membranous (available) and internalized (unavailable) receptor fractions of the clinically relevant receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Proof of concept was achieved with a deactivatable tracer consisting of a CXCR4-specific peptide functionalized with a Cy5 dye bearing a chemoselective azide handle (N3 -Cy5-AcTZ14011). Treatment with a Cy7 quencher dye (Cy7-DBCO) resulted in optically silent Cy7-[click]-Cy5-AcTZ14011. In situ, a >90 % FRET-based reduction of the signal intensity of N3 -Cy5-AcTZ14011 [KD =(222.4±25.2) nm] was seen within minutes after quencher addition. In cells, discrimination between the membranous and the internalized receptor fraction could be achieved through quantitative assessment of quenching/internalization kinetics. Similar evaluation of an activatable tracer variant based on the same targeting moiety (Cy5-S-S-Cy3-AcTZ14011) was unsuccessful in vitro. As such, using the described deactivatable approach to screen membrane receptors and their applicability in receptor-(pre-)targeted theranostics can become straightforward.	0
Title: Terpendole E, a kinesin Eg5 inhibitor, is a key biosynthetic intermediate of indole-diterpenes in the producing fungus Chaunopycnis alba Abstract: Terpendole E is the first natural product inhibitor of kinesin Eg5. Because terpendole E production is unstable, we isolated and analyzed the terpendole E biosynthetic gene cluster, which consists of seven genes encoding three P450 monooxygenases (TerP, TerQ, and TerK), an FAD-dependent monooxygenase (TerM), a terpene cyclase (TerB), and two prenyltransferases (TerC and TerF). Gene knockout and feeding experiments revealed that terpendole E is a key intermediate in terpendole biosynthesis and is produced by the action of the key enzyme TerQ from paspaline, a common biosynthetic intermediate of indole-diterpenes. TerP converts terpendole E to a downstream intermediate specific to terpendole biosynthesis and converts paspaline to shunt metabolites. We successfully overproduced terpendole E by disrupting the terP gene. We propose that terpendole E is a key biosynthetic intermediate of terpendoles and related indole-diterpenes.	1
Title: Myxobacterial Predation: A Standardised Lawn Predation Assay Highlights Strains with Unusually Efficient Predatory Activity Abstract: Myxobacteria prey upon a broad range of microorganisms. Lawn assays are commonly used to quantify myxobacterial predation-myxobacterial suspensions are spotted onto prey lawns, and monitored via spot expansion. The diversity in motility behaviours of myxobacterial strains and differing assay protocols in myxobacteriology laboratories led us to develop a highly-specified assay, which was applied to 28 myxobacterial strains preying on seven phytopathogenic prey species. Generally, prey organisms showed no qualitative differences in their susceptibility/resistance to myxobacterial predation. For most myxobacteria, prey did not stimulate, and in ~50% of cases actively hindered colony expansion. Only ~25% of predator/prey strain combinations exhibited greater colony expansion than in the absence of nutrients. The activity of predatory strains against different prey correlated, implying effective predators may have relatively non-specific predation mechanisms (e.g., broad specificity proteases/lipases), but no correlation was observed between predatory activity and phylogeny. Predation on dead (but intact) or lysed prey cells gave greater colony expansion than on live prey. Occasional strains grew substantially faster on dead compared to lysed cells, or vice-versa. Such differences in accessing nutrients from live, dead and lysed cells indicates there are strain-specific differences in the efficiencies/machineries of prey killing and nutrient acquisition, which has important implications for the ecology of myxobacterial predators and their prey.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus WAP-8294A2 biosynthetic gene cluster from Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11 Abstract: Lysobactor enzymogenes strain OH11 is an emerging biological control agent of fungal and bacterial diseases. We recently completed its genome sequence and found it contains a large number of gene clusters putatively responsible for the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and polyketides, including the previously identified antifungal dihydromaltophilin (HSAF). One of the gene clusters contains two huge open reading frames, together encoding 12 modules of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Gene disruption of one of the NRPS led to the disappearance of a metabolite produced in the wild type and the elimination of its antibacterial activity. The metabolite and antibacterial activity were also affected by the disruption of some of the flanking genes. We subsequently isolated this metabolite and subjected it to spectroscopic analysis. The mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that its chemical structure is identical to WAP-8294A2, a cyclic lipodepsipeptide with potent anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity and currently in phase I/II clinical trials. The WAP-8294A2 biosynthetic genes had not been described previously. So far, the Gram-positive Streptomyces have been the primary source of anti-infectives. Lysobacter are Gram-negative soil/water bacteria that are genetically amendable and have not been well exploited. The WAP-8294A2 synthetase represents one of the largest NRPS complexes, consisting of 45 functional domains. The identification of these genes sets the foundation for the study of the WAP-8294A2 biosynthetic mechanism and opens the door for producing new anti-MRSA antibiotics through biosynthetic engineering in this new source of Lysobacter.	1
Title: Bioactivity and Mode of Action of Bacterial Tetramic Acids Abstract: Microbially produced 3-acyltetramic acids display a diverse range of biological activities. The pyreudiones are new members of this class that were isolated from bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Here, we performed a structure-activity relationship study and determined their mode of action. An efficient biomimetic synthesis was developed to synthesize pyreudione A. Pyreudiones and synthetic analogs thereof were tested for their amoebicidal, antibacterial, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic activities. The length of the alkyl side chain and the nature of the amino acid residues within the tetramic acid moiety strongly affected activity, in particular against mycobacteria. The mode of action was shown to correlate with the ability of pyreudiones to act as protonophores. Removal of the acidic proton by methylation of pyreudione A resulted in a loss of bioactivity.	1
Title: Structural and biochemical characterization of the salicylyl-acyltranferase SsfX3 from a tetracycline biosynthetic pathway Abstract: SsfX3 is a GDSL family acyltransferase that transfers salicylate to the C-4 hydroxyl of a tetracycline intermediate in the penultimate step during biosynthesis of the anticancer natural product SF2575. The C-4 salicylate takes the place of the more common C-4 dimethylamine functionality, making SsfX3 the first acyltransferase identified to act on a tetracycline substrate. The crystal structure of SsfX3 was determined at 2.5 Å, revealing two distinct domains as follows: an N-terminal β-sandwich domain that resembles a carbohydrate-binding module, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that contains the atypical α/β-hydrolase fold found in the GDSL hydrolase family of enzymes. The active site lies at one end of a large open binding pocket, which is spatially defined by structural elements from both the N- and C-terminal domains. Mutational analysis in the putative substrate binding pocket identified residues from both domains that are important for binding the acyl donor and acceptor. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module-like domain rendered the stand-alone α/β-hydrolase domain inactive. The additional noncatalytic module is therefore proposed to be required to define the binding pocket and provide sufficient interactions with the spatially extended tetracyclic substrate. SsfX3 was also demonstrated to accept a variety of non-native acyl groups. This relaxed substrate specificity toward the acyl donor allowed the chemoenzymatic biosynthesis of C-4-modified analogs of the immediate precursor to the bioactive SF2575; these were used to assay the structure activity relationships at the C-4 position.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the ansamycin antibiotic rifamycin: deductions from the molecular analysis of the rif biosynthetic gene cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699 Abstract: Background:                       The ansamycin class of antibiotics are produced by various Actinomycetes. Their carbon framework arises from the polyketide pathway via a polyketide synthase (PKS) that uses an unusual starter unit. Rifamycin (rif), produced by Amycolatopsis mediterranei, is the archetype ansamycin and it is medically important. Although its basic precursors (3-amino-5-hydroxy benzoic acid AHBA, and acetic and propionic acids) had been established, and several biosynthetic intermediates had been identified, very little was known about the origin of AHBA nor had the PKS and the various genes and enzymes that modify the initial intermediate been characterized.                  Results:                       A set of 34 genes clustered around the rifK gene encoding AHBA synthase were defined by sequencing all but 5 kilobases (kb) of a 95 kb contiguous region of DNA from A. mediterranei. The involvement of some of the genes in the biosynthesis of rifamycin B was examined. At least five genes were shown to be essential for the synthesis of AHBA, five genes were determined to encode the modular type I PKS that uses AHBA as the starter unit, and 20 or more genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework, and rifamycin resistance and export. Putative regulatory genes were also identified. Disruption of the PKS genes at the end of rifA abolished rifamycin B production and resulted in the formation of P8/1-OG, a known shunt product of rifamycin biosynthesis, whereas disruption of the orf6 and orf9 genes, which may encode deoxysugar biosynthesis enzymes, had no apparent effect.                  Conclusions:                       Rifamycin production in A. mediterranei is governed by a single gene cluster consisting of structural, resistance and export, and regulatory genes. The genes characterized here could be modified to produce novel forms of the rifamycins that may be effective against rifamycin-resistant microorganisms.	1
Title: Nutrient-regulated transcriptional responses in the brown tide-forming alga Aureococcus anophagefferens Abstract: Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) was used to profile the transcriptome of the brown tide-forming alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, under nutrient replete (control), and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiency to understand how this organism responds at the transcriptional level to varying nutrient conditions. This approach has aided A. anophagefferens genome annotation efforts and identified a suite of genes upregulated by N and P deficiency, some of which have known roles in nutrient metabolism. Genes upregulated under N deficiency include an ammonium transporter, an acetamidase/formamidase and two peptidases. This suggests an ability to utilize reduced N compounds and dissolved organic nitrogen, supporting the hypothesized importance of these N sources in A. anophagefferens bloom formation. There are also a broad suite of P-regulated genes, including an alkaline phosphatase, and two 5'-nucleotidases, suggesting A. anophagefferens may use dissolved organic phosphorus under low phosphate conditions. These N- and P-regulated genes may be important targets for exploring nutrient controls on bloom formation in field populations.	0
Title: Enzymatic Intermolecular Hetero-Diels-Alder Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Tropolonic Sesquiterpenes Abstract: Diels-Alder reactions are among the most powerful synthetic transformations to construct complex natural products. Despite that increasing of enzymatic intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions have been discovered, natural intermolecular Diels-Alderases are rarely described. Here, we report an intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction in the biosynthesis of tropolonic sesquiterpenes and functionally characterize EupfF as the first fungal intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alderase. We demonstrate that EupfF catalyzed the dehydration of a hydroxymethyl-containing tropolone (5) to generate a reactive tropolone o-quinone methide (6) and might further stereoselectively control the subsequent intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with (1E,4E,8Z)-humulenol (8) to produce enantiomerically pure neosetophomone B (1). Our results reveal the biosynthetic pathway of 1 and expand the repertoire of activities of Diels-Alder cyclases.	1
Title: Characterization of integration host factor (IHF) binding upstream of the cysteine-rich protein operon (omcAB) promoter of Chlamydia trachomatis LGV serovar L2 Abstract: Chlamydiae are bacterial parasites that carry out a distinct developmental cycle within host cells; however, the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate stage-specific gene expression are not known. We identified a DNA element located between nucleotide (nt) -135 and -90 upstream from the transcription start point of the late stage-specific CRP operon (omcAB) of Chlamydia trachomatis, to which a protein in extracts of chlamydiae harvested at 23 h after infection binds. A recombinant protein of C. trachomatis open reading frame (ORF) CT267, which is homologous to bacterial integration host factor (IHF) and the heat-unstable nucleoid protein (HU), bound to the same element and produced the same DNase I footprint as the protein in chlamydial extracts. Recombinant ORF CT267 protein bound with high affinity to the DNA element and induced a sharp bend in a DNA fragment containing the binding site, suggesting that ORF CT267 encodes a protein with IHF-like activity, and recombinant protein had a positive effect on in vitro transcription of the CRP operon. IHF-binding activity and IHF protein were detected in extracts of C. trachomatis during the early to intermediate phases of the late stage of the developmental cycle (between 17 and 30 h after infection), but were absent in the extreme late phase of the cycle and in the infectious form of chlamydiae. The presence of an IHF binding site upstream of the CRP operon and the presence of chlamydial IHF-like protein when late stage genes are transcribed suggests that the chlamydial IHF may play a role in stage-specific gene expression.	0
Title: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei: characterization of the enzyme, cloning and sequencing of the gene, and expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei (optimal growth temperature, 100 to 103 degrees C) was purified to homogeneity. This enzyme was strictly phosphate dependent, utilized either NAD+ or NADP+, and was insensitive to pentalenolactone like the enzyme from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanothermus fervidus. The enzyme exhibited a considerable thermostability, with a 44-min half-life at 100 degrees C. The amino acid sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from P. woesei was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the coding gene. Compared with the enzyme homologs from mesophilic archaebacteria (Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanobacterium formicicum) and an extremely thermophilic archaebacterium (Methanothermus fervidus), the primary structure of the P. woesei enzyme exhibited a strikingly high proportion of aromatic amino acid residues and a low proportion of sulfur-containing residues. The coding gene of P. woesei was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, thus providing an ideal basis for detailed structural and functional studies of that enzyme.	0
Title: Cloning of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of diterpene aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha Abstract: The fungal diterpene, aphidicolin, is a well-known specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. Terpenoids are an important class of natural products. However, identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster in terpenoids is relatively rare compared with another important class of natural products, polyketides. To explore a reliable identification method for the biosynthetic gene cluster in fungal diterpenoids, cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster of aphidicolin was employed. The application of a simple PCR method for genome walking based on the sequence of cDNA encoding aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase (ACS) allowed us to analyze a 15.6-kb region of the Phoma betae genomic DNA. Six ORFs, PbGGS, ACS, PbP450-1, PbP450-2, PbTP, and PbTF were found in this region, and respectively expected to encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, diterpene synthase, two cytochrome P-450s, the transporter and transcription factor. Their amino acid sequences and introns were deduced by a corresponding cDNA analysis. This study shows that simple PCR-based genome walking without constructing a genomic DNA library is useful for identification of a small gene cluster. We propose a general strategy for the cloning the biosynthetic genes of fungal diterpenoids by using fungal GGS.	1
Title: Modular architecture of the hexameric human mitochondrial DNA helicase Abstract: We have probed the structure of the human mitochondrial DNA helicase, an enzyme that uses the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to unwind duplex DNA during mitochondrial DNA replication. This novel helicase shares substantial amino acid sequence and functional similarities with the bacteriophage T7 primase-helicase. We show in velocity sedimentation and gel filtration analyses that the mitochondrial DNA helicase exists as a hexamer. Limited proteolysis by trypsin results in the production of several stable fragments, and N-terminal sequencing reveals distinct N and C-terminal polypeptides that represent minimal structural domains. Physical analysis of the proteolytic products defines the region required to maintain oligomeric structure to reside within amino acid residues approximately 405-590. Truncations of the N and C termini affect differentially DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and whereas a C-terminal domain polypeptide is functional, an N-terminal domain polypeptide lacks ATPase activity. Sequence similarity and secondary structural alignments combined with biochemical data suggest that amino acid residue R609 serves as the putative arginine finger that is essential for ATPase activity in ring helicases. The hexameric conformation and modular architecture revealed in our study document that the mitochondrial DNA helicase and bacteriophage T7 primase-helicase share physical features. Our findings place the mitochondrial DNA helicase firmly in the DnaB-like family of replicative DNA helicases.	0
Title: Cyclization of fungal nonribosomal peptides by a terminal condensation-like domain Abstract: Cyclization of linear peptidyl precursors produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is an important step in the biosynthesis of bioactive cyclic peptides. Whereas bacterial NRPSs use thioesterase domains to perform the cyclization, fungal NRPSs have apparently evolved to use a different enzymatic route. In verified fungal NRPSs that produce macrocyclic peptides, each megasynthetase terminates with a condensation-like (C(T)) domain that may perform the macrocyclization reaction. To probe the role of such a C(T) domain, we reconstituted the activities of the Penicillium aethiopicum trimodular NPRS TqaA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Together with the reconstituted bimodular NRPS AnaPS, we dissected the cyclization steps of TqaA in transforming the linear anthranilate-D-tryptophan-L-alanyl tripeptide into fumiquinazoline F. Extensive biochemical and mutational studies confirmed the essential role of the C(T) domain in catalyzing cyclization in a thiolation domain-dependent fashion. Our work provides evidence of a likely universal macrocyclization strategy used by fungal NRPSs.	1
Title: A scalable synthesis of the IP7 isomer, 5-PP-Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5 Abstract: The phosphorylated inositol diphosphates, including the diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate regioisomers, play critical roles in signal transduction and cellular regulation. In particular, the IP(7) isomer 5-PP-Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P(5) is implicated in a nonenzymatic phosphate transfer converting a protein serine phosphate residue to a serine diphosphate. A scalable, practical new synthesis of 5-PP-Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P(5) is described that also allows access to a variety of IP(7) and IP(8) regioisomers. The identity of the synthetic 5-PP-Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P(5) was validated using IP6K1 to catalyze the conversion of IP(7) + ADP to ATP + IP(6).	0
Title: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Title: Opening the TRPML gates Abstract: The intracellular TRPML channels have multiple biological roles, but the physiological stimuli that open them remained unknown. In a previous issue of Chemistry & Biology, Grimm et al. report a high-throughput chemical screen that identified a plethora of selective activators of TRPML3 that should open the way to fully characterize these channels and their physiological roles.	0
Title: [Substrate specificity of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid unit in the viridogrisein biosynthetic pathway] Abstract: Objective:                       To explore the role of sgvS in the biosynthesis of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid moiety of viridogrsein, and to analyze the substrate specificity of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid moiety in the viridogrsein biosynthetic pathway.                  Methods:                       Through gene insertion inactivation and in trans complementation strategies, we obtained the gene inactivation mutant sgvS andits complementation mutant deltasgvS :: sgvS. Meanwhile, we fed 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, picolinic acid, 2-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 3-chloropyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-chloropyridinecarboxylic acid, 3,5-chloropyridinecarboxylic acid, nicotinic acid, 2-chloronicotinic acid, 2-fluoronicotinic acid acid, 5-fluoronicotinic acid and 6-fluoronicotinic acid to the sgvS mutant, respectively. The fermentation extracts were analyzed by HPLC.                  Results:                       sgvS mutant abolished the viridogrsein production; viridogrsein production was restored through in trans complementation of sgvS mutant or by feeding 3-hydroxypicolinic acid to the sgvS mutant. No new viridogrsein analogues were observed by feeding other above mentioned 3-hydroxypicolinic acid analogues tothe deltasgvS mutant.                  Conclusion:                       sgvS is necessary for the biosynthesis of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid moiety. The biosynthetic protein, SgvD1, activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, showing strict substrate specificity en route to the viridogrsein biosynthesis.	1
Title: Cross-species hybridization of a Borrelia burgdorferi DNA array reveals infection- and culture-associated genes of the unsequenced genome of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia hermsii Abstract: The known genome sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi, an agent of Lyme borreliosis, was used to study the genetic content and gene expression in B. hermsii, another spirochete pathogen and a cause of relapsing fever. Cross-species hybridization of a DNA array representing 1628 open reading frames (ORF) of B. burgdorferi with genomic DNA of B. hermsii indicated that the latter organism has at least 81% of the chromosomal genes and 43% of the plasmid genes of B. burgdorferi. We then carried out quantitative hybridization of the arrays with multiple replicates of cDNA produced from B. hermsii cells growing in the blood of infected mice or in culture medium that was adjusted to the same pH, temperature and a spirochete density as infected blood. Of 642 B. burgdorferi ORFs hybridized by all replicates under both conditions, 12 (1.9%) demonstrated differential expression by a regularized t-test and stringent criteria. BBP07 and BBG30, two plasmid-borne ORFs with the greatest measurable difference in expression between in vivo and in vitro conditions, putatively encode proteins of unknown function. Orthologues of BBP07 in B. hermsii were identified, and increased expression in infected mice was demonstrated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.	0
Title: Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyene macrolactam sceliphrolactam in a Streptomyces strain isolated from mangrove sediment Abstract: Streptomyces are a genus of Actinobacteria capable of producing structurally diverse natural products. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a biosynthetically talented Streptomyces (Streptomyces sp. SD85) from tropical mangrove sediments. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that Streptomyces sp. SD85 harbors at least 52 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which constitute 21.2% of the 8.6-Mb genome. When cultivated under lab conditions, Streptomyces sp. SD85 produces sceliphrolactam, a 26-membered polyene macrolactam with unknown biosynthetic origin. Genome mining yielded a putative sceliphrolactam BGC (sce) that encodes a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system, several β-amino acid starter biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and transcriptional regulators. Using the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout method, we demonstrated that the sce BGC is essential for sceliphrolactam biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, the PKS system encoded by sce is short of one module required for assembling the 26-membered macrolactam skeleton according to the collinearity rule. With experimental data disfavoring the involvement of a trans-PKS module, the biosynthesis of sceliphrolactam seems to be best rationalized by invoking a mechanism whereby the PKS system employs an iterative module to catalyze two successive chain extensions with different outcomes. The potential violation of the collinearity rule makes the mechanism distinct from those of other polyene macrolactams.	1
Title: Evaluating the estimation of genetic correlation and heritability using summary statistics Abstract: While novel statistical methods quantifying the shared heritability of traits and diseases between ancestral distinct populations have been recently proposed, a thorough evaluation of these approaches under differing circumstances remain elusive. Brown et al.2016 proposed the method Popcorn to estimate the shared heritability, i.e. genetic correlation, using only summary statistics. Here, we evaluate Popcorn under several parameters and circumstances: sample size, number of SNPs, sample size of external reference panel, various population pairs, inappropriate external reference panel, and admixed population involved. Our results determined the minimum sample size of the external reference panel, summary statistics, and number of SNPs required to accurately estimate both the genetic correlation and heritability. Moreover, the number of individuals and SNPs required to produce accurate and stable estimates was directly proportional with heritability in Popcorn. Misrepresentation of the reference panel overestimated the genetic correlation by 20% and heritability by 60%. Lastly, applying Popcorn to homogeneous (EUR) and admixed (ASW) populations underestimated the genetic correlation by 15%. Although statistical approaches estimating the shared heritability between ancestral populations will provide novel etiologic insight, caution is required ensuring results are based on the appropriate sample size, number of SNPs, and the generalizability of the reference panel to the discovery populations.	0
Title: Disulfide-mediated stabilization of the IκB kinase binding domain of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) Abstract: Human NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) is a 419 residue scaffolding protein that, together with catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, forms the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, a key regulator of NF-κB pathway signaling. NEMO is an elongated homodimer comprising mostly α-helix. It has been shown that a NEMO fragment spanning residues 44-111, which contains the IKKα/β binding site, is structurally disordered in the absence of bound IKKβ. Herein we show that enforcing dimerization of NEMO1-120 or NEMO44-111 constructs through introduction of one or two interchain disulfide bonds, through oxidation of the native Cys54 residue and/or at position 107 through a Leu107Cys mutation, induces a stable α-helical coiled-coil structure that is preorganized to bind IKKβ with high affinity. Chemical and thermal denaturation studies showed that, in the context of a covalent dimer, the ordered structure was stabilized relative to the denatured state by up to 3 kcal/mol. A full-length NEMO-L107C protein formed covalent dimers upon treatment of mammalian cells with H2O2. Furthermore, NEMO-L107C bound endogenous IKKβ in A293T cells, reconstituted TNF-induced NF-κB signaling in NEMO-deficient cells, and interacted with TRAF6. Our results indicate that the IKKβ binding domain of NEMO possesses an ordered structure in the unbound state, provided that it is constrained within a dimer as is the case in the constitutively dimeric full-length NEMO protein. The stability of the NEMO coiled coil is maintained by strong interhelix interactions in the region centered on residue 54. The disulfide-linked constructs we describe herein may be useful for crystallization of NEMO's IKKβ binding domain in the absence of bound IKKβ, thereby facilitating the structural characterization of small-molecule inhibitors.	0
Title: TRI6 and TRI10 play different roles in the regulation of deoxynivalenol (DON) production by cAMP signalling in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: The biosynthesis of mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in Fusarium graminearum is regulated by two pathway-specific transcription factors Tri6 and Tri10 and affected by various host and environmental factors. In this study, we showed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) treatment induced DON production by stimulating TRI gene expression and DON-associated cellular differentiation in F. graminearum. Interestingly, exogenous cAMP had no effects on the tri6 mutant but partially recovered the defect of tri10 mutant in DON biosynthesis. Although the two cAMP phosphodiesterase genes PDE1 and PDE2 had overlapping functions in vegetative growth, conidiation, sexual reproduction and plant infection, deletion of PDE2 but not PDE1 activated intracellular PKA activities and increased DON production. Whereas the tri6 pde2 mutant failed to produce DON, the tri10 pde2 double mutant produced a significantly higher level of DON than the tri10 mutant. Cellular differentiation associated with DON production was stimulated by exogenous cAMP or deletion of PDE2 in both tri10 and tri6 mutants. These data indicate that TRI6 is essential for the regulation of DON biosynthesis by cAMP signalling but elevated PKA activities could partially bypass the requirement of TRI10 for TRI gene-expression and DON production, and Pde2 is the major cAMP phosphodiesterase to negatively regulate DON biosynthesis in F. graminearum.	1
Title: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC6 gene is transcribed at late mitosis and encodes a ATP/GTPase controlling S phase initiation Abstract: We have compared the periodic fluctuation of mRNAs encoded by CDC6, a cell cycle gene controlling initiation of DNA replication, and CLN1, a G1 cyclin gene expressed at late G1. The maxima of CDC6 mRNA precede those of CLN1 mRNA by about 15 min in cells synchronized by release from pheromone arrest or from a cdc15 thermal arrest. CDC6 mRNA accumulates in cdc15-arrested telophase cells, decays around cell separation, and reappears during telophase and nuclear division of the next cycle. CDC6 transcription at late mitosis is not affected by the pheromone signaling pathway. The CDC6 mRNA fluctuation pattern is imposed to a CLN1-derived reporter gene if fused to the CDC6 promoter. The CDC6 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. The Cdc6 protein binds rATP and rGTP upon UV cross-linking and catalyzes the DNA-independent hydrolysis of purine nucleoside triphosphates, but does not appear to interact directly with DNA. The Cdc6 protein may control the ATP-dependent initiation of replication by conferring ATPase activity to an origin-recognizing complex.	0
Title: Analogues of the Potent Antitumor Compound Leiodermatolide from a Deep-Water Sponge of the Genus Leiodermatium Abstract: Two new analogues of the potent antitumor compound leiodermatolide, which we call leiodermatolides B and C, have been isolated from specimens of a deep-water sponge of the genus Leiodermatium collected off Florida. The compounds were purified using standard chromatographic methods, and the structures defined through interpretation of the HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR data. Leiodermatolide B (2) lacks the C-21 hydroxy group found in leiodermatolide and has equal potency as the parent compound, providing a simpler analogue for possible clinical development. It inhibits the proliferation of the AsPC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line with an IC50 of 43 nM. Leiodermatolide C (3) has a modified macrolide ring and is over 85-fold less potent with an IC50 of 3.7 μM against the same cell line. These compounds add to the knowledge of the pharmacophore of this class of potent antitumor agents.	0
Title: Production of proteasome inhibitor syringolin A by the endophyte Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 Abstract: Syringolin A, the product of a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase encoded by the syl gene cluster, is a virulence factor secreted by certain Pseudomonas syringae strains. Together with the glidobactins produced by a number of beta- and gammaproteobacterial human and animal pathogens, it belongs to the syrbactins, a structurally novel class of proteasome inhibitors. In plants, proteasome inhibition by syringolin A-producing P. syringae strains leads to the suppression of host defense pathways requiring proteasome activity, such as the ones mediated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Here we report the discovery of a syl-like gene cluster with some unusual features in the alphaproteobacterial endophyte Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 that encodes a putative syringolin A-like synthetase whose components share 55% to 65% sequence identity (72% to 79% similarity) at the amino acid level. As revealed by average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculations, this strain likely belongs to the same species as biocontrol strain R. rhizogenes K84 (formely known as Agrobacterium radiobacter K84), which, however, carries a nonfunctional deletion remnant of the syl-like gene cluster. Here we present a functional analysis of the syl-like gene cluster of Rhizobium sp. strain AP16 and demonstrate that this endophyte synthesizes syringolin A and some related minor variants, suggesting that proteasome inhibition by syrbactin production can be important not only for pathogens but also for endophytic bacteria in the interaction with their hosts.	1
Title: Transcriptome profiling of wheat glumes in wild emmer, hulled landraces and modern cultivars Abstract: Background:                       Wheat domestication is considered as one of the most important events in the development of human civilization. Wheat spikelets have undergone significant changes during evolution under domestication, resulting in soft glumes and larger kernels that are released easily upon threshing. Our main goal was to explore changes in transcriptome expression in glumes that accompanied wheat evolution under domestication.                  Methods:                       A total of six tetraploid wheat accessions were selected for transcriptome profiling based on their rachis brittleness and glumes toughness. RNA pools from glumes of the central spikelet at heading time were used to construct cDNA libraries for sequencing. The trimmed reads from each library were separately aligned to the reference sub-genomes A and B, which were extracted from wheat survey sequence. Differentially expression analysis and functional annotation were performed between wild and domesticated wheat, to identity candidate genes associated with evolution under domestication. Selected candidate genes were validated using real time PCR.                  Results:                       Transcriptome profiles of wild emmer wheat, wheat landraces, and wheat cultivars were compared using next generation sequencing (RNA-seq). We have found a total of 194,893 transcripts, of which 73,150 were shared between wild, landraces, and cultivars. From 781 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 336 were down-regulated and 445 were up-regulated in the domesticated compared to wild wheat genotypes. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation assigned 293 DEGs (37.5 %) to GO term groups, of which 134 (17.1 %) were down-regulated and 159 (20.4 %) up-regulated in the domesticated wheat. Some of the down-regulated DEGs in domesticated wheat are related to the biosynthetic pathways that eventually define the mechanical strength of the glumes, such as cell wall, lignin, pectin and wax biosynthesis. The reduction in gene expression of such genes, may explain the softness of the glumes in the domesticated forms. In addition, we have identified genes involved in nutrient remobilization that may affect grain size and other agronomic traits evolved under domestication.                  Conclusions:                       The comparison of RNA-seq profiles between glumes of wheat groups differing in glumes toughness and rachis brittleness revealed a few DEGs that may be involved in glumes toughness and nutrient remobilization. These genes may be involved in processes of wheat improvement under domestication.	0
Title: Syntheses and biological activities of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates Abstract: Twenty-two kinds of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates were synthesized by the reaction of 4-hydroxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one or 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (HMP) with a variety of substituted cinnamic acids, and their antifungal and plant growth inhibitory activities were investigated. Among the compounds prepared, 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)propenoate (H5) showed the strongest antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium dellfinii, and 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(2-methylphenyl)propenoate (H2) had the highest plant growth inhibitory activity toward Brassica rapa.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of an iterative type I polyketide synthase gene cluster for biosynthesis of the antitumor chlorinated polyenone neocarzilin in "Streptomyces carzinostaticus" Abstract: Neocarzilins (NCZs) are antitumor chlorinated polyenones produced by "Streptomyces carzinostaticus" var. F-41. The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of NCZs was cloned and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of a 33-kb region revealed a cluster of 14 open reading frames (ORFs), three of which (ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6) encode type I polyketide synthase (PKS), which consists of four modules. Unusual features of the modular organization is the lack of an obvious acyltransferase domain on modules 2 and 4 and the presence of longer interdomain regions more than 200 amino acids in length on each module. Involvement of the PKS genes in NCZ biosynthesis was demonstrated by heterologous expression of the cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999, which produced the apparent NCZ biosynthetic intermediates dechloroneocarzillin A and dechloroneocarzilin B. Disruption of ORF5 resulted in a failure of NCZ production, providing further evidence that the cluster is essential for NCZ biosynthesis. Mechanistic consideration of NCZ formation indicates the iterative use of at least one module of the PKS, which subsequently releases its product by decarboxylation to generate an NCZ skeleton, possibly catalyzed by a type II thioesterase encoded by ORF7. This is a novel type I PKS system of bacterial origin for the biosynthesis of a reduced polyketide chain. Additionally, the protein encoded by ORF3, located upstream of the PKS genes, closely resembles the FADH(2)-dependent halogenases involved in the formation of halometabolites. The ORF3 protein could be responsible for the halogenation of NCZs, presenting a unique example of a halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of an aliphatic halometabolite.	1
Title: Structure, Total Synthesis, and Biosynthesis of Chloromyxamides: Myxobacterial Tetrapeptides Featuring an Uncommon 6-Chloromethyl-5-methoxypipecolic Acid Building Block Abstract: Soil-living microbes are an important resource for the discovery of new natural products featuring great structural diversity that are reflective of the underlying biosynthetic pathways as well as incorporating a wide range of intriguing small-molecule building blocks. We report here the full structural elucidation, total synthesis, and biosynthesis of chloromyxamides, a new class of tetrapeptides that display an unprecedented 6-chloromethyl-5-methoxypipecolic acid (CMPA) substructure. Chemical synthesis-including an approach to access the CMPA unit-was pursued to confirm the structure of the chloromyxamides and enabled determination of the absolute configuration in the CMPA ring. A model for the nonribosomal assembly of chloromyxamides was devised on the basis of the combined evaluation of the biosynthetic gene cluster sequence and the feeding of stable isotope-labeled precursors. This provided insight into the formation of the various chloromyxamide derivatives and the biogenesis of the CMPA unit.	1
Title: Characterization of the microbial community and polyketide biosynthetic potential in the palmerolide-producing tunicate Synoicum adareanum Abstract: Palmerolide A (1) is a macrolide isolated from the Antarctic tunicate Synoicum adareanum that is of interest due to its potential as an antimelanoma drug. Biosynthesis is predicted to occur via a hybrid PKS-NRPS pathway within S. adareanum, but the identity of the palmerolide-producing organism (host or putative host-associated microorganism) has not been established. Microscopic observation revealed a dense microbial community inside the tunicate, and evidence from 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles and clone library sequences suggests that the bacterial community has moderate phylogenetic complexity. The alpha and gamma classes of Proteobacteria account for ∼75% of the cloned 16S rRNA genes, and the majority of these sequences are affiliated with the genera Pseudovibrio and Microbulbifer. DNA sequences encoding type I PKS ketosynthase (KS) domains were detected by PCR. The S. adareanum KS sequences, which affiliate with the trans-AT clade, are similar to portions of PKS proteins that lack integrated acyltransferase domains in pathways for generating bioactive polyketide compounds, including bryostatin, leinamycin, and pederin.	1
Title: Visualization of lipid metabolism in the zebrafish intestine reveals a relationship between NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake and dietary fatty acid Abstract: The small intestine is the primary site of dietary lipid absorption in mammals. The balance of nutrients, microorganisms, bile, and mucus that determine intestinal luminal environment cannot be recapitulated ex vivo, thus complicating studies of lipid absorption. We show that fluorescently labeled lipids can be used to visualize and study lipid absorption in live zebrafish larvae. We demonstrate that the addition of a BODIPY-fatty acid to a diet high in atherogenic lipids enables imaging of enterocyte lipid droplet dynamics in real time. We find that a lipid-rich meal promotes BODIPY-cholesterol absorption into an endosomal compartment distinguishable from lipid droplets. We also show that dietary fatty acids promote intestinal cholesterol absorption by rapid re-localization of NPC1L1 to the intestinal brush border. These data illustrate the power of the zebrafish system to address longstanding questions in vertebrate digestive physiology.	0
Title: Heterologous expression, purification, reconstitution and kinetic analysis of an extended type II polyketide synthase Abstract: Background:                       Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are bacterial multienzyme systems that synthesize a broad range of natural products. The 'minimal' PKS consists of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein and a malonyl transferase. Auxiliary components (ketoreductases, aromatases and cyclases are involved in controlling the oxidation level and cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain. We describe the heterologous expression and reconstitution of several auxiliary PKS components including the actinorhodin ketoreductase (act KR), the griseusin aromatase/cyclase (gris ARO/CYC), and the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase (tcm ARO/CYC).                  Results:                       The polyketide products of reconstituted act and tcm PKSs were identical to those identified in previous in vivo studies. Although stable protein-protein interactions were not detected between minimal and auxiliary PKS components, kinetic analysis revealed that the extended PKS comprised of the act minimal PKS, the act KR and the gris ARO/CYC had a higher turnover number than the act minimal PKS plus the act KR or the act minimal PKS alone. Adding the tcm ARO/CYC to the tcm minimal PKS also increased the overall rate.                  Conclusions:                       Until recently the principal strategy for functional analysis of PKS subunits was through heterologous expression of recombinant PKSs in Streptomyces. Our results corroborate the implicit assumption that the product isolated from whole-cell systems is the dominant product of the PKS. They also suggest that an intermediate is channeled between the various subunits, and pave the way for more detailed structural and mechanistic analysis of these multienzyme systems.	0
Title: A MADS-box transcription factor MoMcm1 is required for male fertility, microconidium production and virulence in Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: Appressorium formation is a key step in the infection cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae. Mst12 is a transcription factor essential for appressorium penetration and invasive growth. In this study we used the affinity purification approach to identify proteins that physically associate with Mst12. One of the Mst12-interacting genes identified was MoMCM1, which encodes a MADS-box protein orthologous to yeast Mcm1. MoMcm1 interacted with both Mst12 and Mata-1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Deletion of MoMCM1 resulted in the loss of male fertility and microconidium production. The Momcm1 mutant was defective in appressorium penetration and formed narrower invasive hyphae, which may be responsible for its reduced virulence. In transformants expressing MoMCM1-eGFP fusion, GFP signals were observed in the nucleus. We also generated the Momcm1 mst12 double mutant, which was defective in penetration and non-pathogenic. On hydrophilic surfaces, germ tubes produced by the double mutant were severely curved, and 20% of them formed appressoria. In contrast, the Momcm1 or mst12 mutant did not form appressoria on hydrophilic surfaces. These results suggest that MoMCM1 and MST12 have overlapping functions to suppress appressorium formation under non-conducive conditions. MoMcm1 may interact with Mst12 and MatA-1 to regulate germ tube identity and male fertility respectively.	0
Title: Elucidating CO2 Hydrogenation over In2 O3 Nanoparticles using Operando UV/Vis and Impedance Spectroscopies Abstract: In2 O3 has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO2 activation, but a fundamental understanding of its mode of operation in CO2 hydrogenation is still missing, as the application of operando vibrational spectroscopy is challenging due to absorption effects. In this mechanistic study, we systematically address the redox processes related to the reverse water-gas shift reaction (rWGSR) over In2 O3 nanoparticles, both at the surface and in the bulk. Based on temperature-dependent operando UV/Vis spectra and a novel operando impedance approach for thermal powder catalysts, we propose oxidation by CO2 as the rate-determining step for the rWGSR. The results are consistent with redox processes, whereby hydrogen-containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Our findings demonstrate that oxygen/hydrogen dynamics, in addition to surface processes, are important for the activity, which is expected to be of relevance not only for In2 O3 but also for other reducible oxide catalysts.	0
Title: Identification of a fluorometabolite from Streptomyces sp. MA37: (2 R 3 S 4 S)-5-fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid Abstract: (2R3S4S)-5-Fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid (5-FHPA) has been discovered as a new fluorometabolite in the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. MA37. Exogenous addition of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose (5-FDR) into the cell free extract of MA37 demonstrated that 5-FDR was an intermediate to a range of unidentified fluorometabolites, distinct from fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Bioinformatics analysis allowed identification of a gene cluster (fdr), encoding a pathway to the biosynthesis of 5-FHPA. Over-expression and in vitro assay of FdrC indicated that FdrC is a NAD+ dependent dehydrogenase responsible for oxidation of 5-FDR into 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-lactone, followed by hydrolysis to 5-FHPA. The identity of 5-FHPA in the fermentation broth was confirmed by synthesis of a reference compound and then co-correlation by 19F-NMR and GC-MS analysis. The occurrence of 5-FHPA proves the existence of a new fluorometabolite pathway.	1
Title: Selective polymerization catalysis: controlling the metal chain end group to prepare block copolyesters Abstract: Selective catalysis is used to prepare block copolyesters by combining ring-opening polymerization of lactones and ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides/anhydrides. By using a dizinc complex with mixtures of up to three different monomers and controlling the chemistry of the Zn-O(polymer chain) it is possible to select for a particular polymerization route and thereby control the composition of block copolyesters.	0
Title: A set of ordered cosmids and a detailed genetic and physical map for the 8 Mb Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) chromosome Abstract: A Supercos-1 library carrying chromosomal DNA of a plasmid-free derivative of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was organized into an ordered encyclopaedia of overlapping clones by hybridization. The minimum set of overlapping clones representing the entire chromosome (with three short gaps) consists of 319 cosmids. The average insert size is 37.5 kb and the set of clones therefore divides the chromosome into 637 alternating unique and overlapping segments which have an average length of approx. 12.5 kb. More than 170 genes, gene clusters and other genetic markers were mapped to their specific segment by hybridization to the encyclopaedia. Genes could be cloned by direct transformation and complementation of S. coelicolor mutants with cosmids isolated from Escherichia coli, selecting for insertion into the chromosome by homologous recombination. As in other streptomycetes, the ends of the chromosome have long terminal inverted repeats.	1
Title: Direct and quantitative characterization of dynamic ligand exchange between coordination-driven self-assembled supramolecular polygons Abstract: The direct observation of dynamic ligand exchange between Pt-N coordination-driven self-assembled supramolecular polygons (triangles and rectangles) has been achieved using stable (1)H/(2)D isotope labeling of the pyridyl donors and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry combined with NMR spectroscopy. Both the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of such exchange processes have been established on the basis of quantitative mass spectral results. Further investigation has shown that the exchange is highly dependent on experimental conditions such as temperature, solvent, and the counteranions.	0
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide macrolide mycinamicin in Micromonospora griseorubida Abstract: Mycinamicin, composed of a branched lactone and two sugars, desosamine and mycinose, at the C-5 and C-21 positions, is a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida A11725, which shows strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The nucleotide sequence (62 kb) of the mycinamicin biosynthetic gene cluster, in which there were 22 open reading frames (ORFs), was completely determined. All of the products from the 22 ORFs are responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinamicin II and self-protection against the compounds synthesized. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus (mycA), which encodes a seven-module system comprised of five multifunctional proteins. Immediately downstream of mycA, there is a set of genes for desosamine biosynthesis (mydA-G and mycB). Moreover, mydH, whose product is responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinose, lies between mydA and B. On the other hand, eight ORFs were detected upstream of the mycinamicin PKS gene. The myrB, mycG, and mycF genes had already been characterized by Inouye et al. The other five ORFs (mycCI, mycCII, mydI, mycE, and mycD) lie between mycA1 and mycF, and these five genes and mycF are responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinose. In the PKS gene, four regions of KS and AT domains in modules 1, 4, 5, and 6 indicated that it does not show the high GC content typical for Streptomyces genes, nor the unusual frame plot patterns for Streptomyces genes. Methylmalonyl-CoA was used as substrate in the functional units of those four modules. The relationship between the substrate and the unusual frame plot pattern of the KS and AT domains was observed in the other PKS genes, and it is suggested that the KS-AT original region was horizontally transferred into the PKS genes on the chromosomal DNA of several actinomycetes strains.	1
Title: Prevalence of viral photosynthetic and capsid protein genes from cyanophages in two large and deep perialpine lakes Abstract: Cyanophages are important components of aquatic ecosystems, but their genetic diversity has been little investigated in freshwaters. A yearlong survey was conducted in surface waters of the two largest natural perialpine lakes in France (Lake Annecy and Lake Bourget) to investigate part of this cyanophage diversity through the analysis of both structural (e.g., g20) and functional (e.g., psbA) genes. We found that these cyanophage signature genes were prevalent throughout the year but that the community compositions of g20 cyanomyoviruses were significantly different between the two lakes. In contrast, psbA-containing cyanophages seemed to be more similar between the two ecosystems. We also found that a large proportion of g20 sequences grouped with cyanomyophage isolates. psbA sequences, belonging to phages of Synechococcus spp., were characterized by distinct triplet motifs (with a novel viral triplet motif, EFE). Thus, our results show that cyanophages (i) are a diverse viral community in alpine lakes and (ii) are clearly distinct from some other freshwater and marine environments, suggesting the influence of unique biogeographic factors.	0
Title: Ultrastructural Imaging of Salmonella-Host Interactions Using Super-resolution Correlative Light-Electron Microscopy of Bioorthogonal Pathogens Abstract: The imaging of intracellular pathogens inside host cells is complicated by the low resolution and sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy and by the lack of ultrastructural information to visualize the pathogens. Herein, we present a new method to visualize these pathogens during infection that circumvents these problems: by using a metabolic hijacking approach to bioorthogonally label the intracellular pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium and by using these bioorthogonal groups to introduce fluorophores compatible with stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and placing this in a correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) workflow, the pathogen can be imaged within its host cell context Typhimurium with a resolution of 20 nm. This STORM-CLEM approach thus presents a new approach to understand these pathogens during infection.	0
Title: Carboxyethylarginine synthase genes show complex cross-regulation in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Carboxyethylarginine synthase is the first dedicated enzyme of clavam biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus and is present in two isoforms encoded by two separate genes. When grown on a liquid soy medium, strains with ceaS1 deleted showed only a mild reduction of clavam biosynthesis, while disruption of ceaS2 abolished all clavam biosynthesis. Creation of an in-frame ceaS2 deletion mutant to avoid polarity did not restore clavam production, nor did creation of a site-directed mutant altered only in a single amino acid residue important for activity. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses of these mutants indicated that the failure to produce clavam metabolites could be traced to reduced or abolished transcription of ceaS1 in the ceaS2 mutants, despite the location of ceaS1 on a replicon completely separate from that of ceaS2. Western analyses further showed that the CeaS1 protein (as well as the CeaS2 protein) was absent from the ceaS2 mutants. Complementation experiments were able to restore clavam production partially, but only by virtue of restoring CeaS2 production. CeaS1 was still absent from the complemented strains. While this dependence of CeaS1 production on the expression of ceaS2 from its native chromosomal location was seen in all of the ceaS2 mutants, the effect was limited to growth in liquid medium. When the same mutants were grown on solid soy medium, clavam production was restored and CeaS1 was produced, albeit at low levels compared to the wild type.	1
Title: Cloning and physical mapping of the EcoRI fragments of the giant linear plasmid SCP1 Abstract: A cosmid library was constructed for the 350-kb giant linear plasmid SCP1 and aligned on a successive linear map. Only a 0.8-kb gap has remained uncloned in the terminal inverted repeats close to both ends. Partial digestion of the aligned cosmids with EcoRI and hybridization with the flanking fragments of the vector enabled physical mapping of all of the EcoRI fragments. On this map, the methylenomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, the insertion sequence IS466, and the sapCDE genes coding for spore-associated proteins were localized.	1
Title: SseA acts as the chaperone for the SseB component of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 translocon Abstract: The Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) shown to be critical for adaptation to the intracellular environment within both phagocytic and epithelial cell types. Within SPI2, the Effector region encodes several exported proteins that comprise the SPI2 translocon (SseB, C, D). SseA is the first protein encoded within the Effector region but remains an unclassified factor that is essential for SPI2 function. In the present study, we determined that SseA shares several features with TTSS chaperones: it is small (12.5 kDa), located directly upstream of a TTSS export target (SseB), and contains an amphipathic, C-terminal alpha-helix. Construction and analysis of a DeltasseA mutant demonstrated that the total amount of SseB is significantly reduced and SPI2 export of SseB to the bacterial surface is prevented. SseB accumulation and export were restored when SseA was provided in trans. Loss of SseA does not cause a generalized defect in SPI2 secretory function as export of SseC, encoded downstream of SseB, still occurs in the DeltasseA strain. Quantitative PCR indicates that the loss of SseB in DeltasseA does not occur at the transcriptional level. Co-purification studies demonstrate that SseA directly binds to SseB. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SseA functions as a TTSS chaperone for the SPI2 translocon component, SseB.	0
Title: Genetic organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor angucycline oviedomycin in Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891 Abstract: The oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891 has been sequenced and characterized. It contains all the necessary genes for oviedomycin biosynthesis, together with several genes for the generation of malonyl-CoA extender units. Production of this unusual angucyclinone in its natural host occurs only in solid cultures in parallel with aerial mycelium and spore formation. A mutant that did not produce oviedomycin was generated by disruption of the beta-ketoacyl synthase gene ovmK. No other physiological process in the mutant appears to be affected; this rules out a direct relationship between oviedomycin production and cell differentiation in S. antibioticus.	1
Title: Characteristics of σ-dependent pausing by RNA polymerases from Escherichia coli and Thermus aquaticus Abstract: The σ(70) subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the major transcription initiation factor in Escherichia coli. During transcription initiation, conserved region 2 of the σ(70) subunit interacts with the -10 promoter element and plays a key role in DNA melting around the starting point of transcription. During transcription elongation, the σ(70) subunit can induce pauses in RNA synthesis owing to interactions of region 2 with DNA regions similar to the -10 promoter element. We demonstrated that the major σ subunit from Thermus aquaticus (σ(A)) is also able to induce transcription pausing by T. aquaticus RNAP. However, hybrid RNAP containing the σ(A) subunit and E. coli core RNAP is unable to form pauses during elongation, while being able to recognize promoters and initiate transcription. Inability of the σ(A) subunit to induce pausing by E. coli RNAP is explained by the substitutions of non-conserved amino acids in region 2, in the subregions interacting with the RNAP core enzyme. Thus, changes in the structure of region 2 of the σ(70) subunit have stronger effects on transcription pausing than on promoter recognition, likely by weakening the interactions of the σ subunit with the core RNAP during transcription elongation.	0
Title: The effect of anode potential on current production from complex substrates in bioelectrochemical systems: a case study with glucose Abstract: Anode potential can affect the degradation pathway of complex substrates in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), thereby influencing current production and coulombic efficiency. However, the intricacies behind this interplay are poorly understood. This study used glucose as a model substrate to comprehensively investigate the effect of different anode potentials (- 150 mV, 0 mV and + 200 mV) on the relationship between current production, the electrogenic pathway and the abundance of the electrogenic microorganisms involved in batch mode fed BESs. Current production in glucose-acclimatized reactors was a function of the abundance of Geobacteraceae and of the availability of acetate and formate produced by glucose degradation. Current production was increased by high anode potentials during acclimation (0 mV and + 200 mV), likely due to more Geobacteraceae developing. However, this effect was much weaker than a stimulus from an artificial high acetate supply: acetate was the rate-limiting intermediate in these systems. The supply of acetate could not be influenced by anode potential; altering the flow regime, batch time and management of the upstream fermentation processes may be a greater engineering tool in BES. However, these findings suggest that if high current production is the focus, it will be extremely difficult to achieve success with complex waste streams such as domestic wastewater.	0
Title: Transport by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 enhances the cytotoxicity of epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate and several quercetin derivatives Abstract: Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 1B1 and 1B3 are transporters that are expressed selectively in human hepatocytes under normal conditions. OATP1B3 is also expressed in certain cancers. Flavonoids such as green tea catechins and quercetin glycosides have been shown to modulate the function of some OATPs. In the present study, the extent to which six substituted quercetin derivatives (1-6) affected the function of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was investigated. Uptake of the radiolabeled model substrates estradiol 17β-glucuronide, estrone 3-sulfate, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was determined in the absence and presence of compounds 1-6 using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Several of compounds 1-6 inhibited OATP-mediated uptake of all three model substrates, suggesting that they could also be potential substrates. Compound 6 stimulated OATP1B3-mediated estradiol 17β-glucuronide uptake by increasing the apparent affinity of OATP1B3 for its substrate. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCG) and most of compounds 1-6 killed preferentially OATP-expressing CHO cells. EGCG, 1, and 3 were the most potent cytotoxic compounds, with EGCG and 3 selectively killing OATP1B3-expressing cells. Given that OATP1B3 is expressed in several cancers, EGCG and some of the quercetin derivatives studied might be promising lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer drugs.	0
Title: Structure and Biosynthesis of Crocagins: Polycyclic Posttranslationally Modified Ribosomal Peptides from Chondromyces crocatus Abstract: Secondary metabolome mining efforts in the myxobacterial multiproducer of natural products, Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, resulted in the isolation and structure elucidation of crocagins, which are novel polycyclic peptides containing a tetrahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole core. The gene cluster was identified through an approach combining genome analysis, targeted gene inactivation in the producer, and in vitro experiments. Based on our findings, we developed a biosynthetic scheme for crocagin biosynthesis. These natural products are formed from the three C-terminal amino acids of a precursor peptide and thus belong to a novel class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). We demonstrate that crocagin A binds to the carbon storage regulator protein CsrA, thereby inhibiting the ability of CsrA to bind to its cognate RNA target.	1
Title: EcdGHK are three tailoring iron oxygenases for amino acid building blocks of the echinocandin scaffold Abstract: The echinocandins are a small group of fungal N-acylated cyclic hexapeptides that are fungicidal for candida strains and fungistatic for aspergilli by targeting cell wall 1,3-β-glucan synthases. The side chains of all six amino acid building blocks have hydroxyl groups, including the nonproteinogenic 4R,5R-dihydroxy-Orn1, 4R-OH-Pro3, 3S,4S-dihydroxy-homoTyr4, and 3S-OH-4S-Me-Pro6. The echinocandin (ecd) gene cluster contains two predicted nonheme mononuclear iron oxygenase genes (ecdG,K) and one encoding a P450 type heme protein (ecdH). Deletion of the ecdH gene in the producing strain Emericella rugulosa generates an echinocandin scaffold (echinocandin D) lacking both hydroxyl groups on Orn1. Correspondingly, the ΔecdG strain failed to hydroxylate C3 of the homoTyr residue, and purified EcdG hydroxylated free L-homoTyr at C3. The ΔecdK strain failed to generate mature echinocandin unless supplemented with either 4R-Me-Pro or 3S-OH-4S-Me-Pro, indicating blockage of a step upstream of Me-Pro formation. Purified EcdK is a Leu 5-hydroxylase, acting iteratively at C5 to yield γ-Me-Glu-γ-semialdehyde in equilibrium with the cyclic imine product. Evaluation of deshydroxyechinocandin scaffolds in the in vitro anticandidal assays revealed up to a 3-fold loss of potency for the ΔecdG scaffolds, but a 3-fold gain of potency for the ΔecdH scaffold, in line with prior results on deoxyechinocandin homologues.	1

Selective bPNA targeting of both DNA and RNA substrates suggests possible application of bPNAs as synthetic regulators of nucleic acid function.	0
Title: TxtH is a key component of the thaxtomin biosynthetic machinery in the potato common scab pathogen Streptomyces scabies Abstract: Streptomyces scabies causes potato common scab disease, which reduces the quality and market value of affected tubers. The predominant pathogenicity determinant produced by S. scabies is the thaxtomin A phytotoxin, which is essential for common scab disease development. Production of thaxtomin A involves the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) TxtA and TxtB, both of which contain an adenylation (A-) domain for selecting and activating the appropriate amino acid during thaxtomin biosynthesis. The genome of S. scabies 87.22 contains three small MbtH-like protein (MLP)-coding genes, one of which (txtH) is present in the thaxtomin biosynthesis gene cluster. MLP family members are typically required for the proper folding of NRPS A-domains and/or stimulating their activities. This study investigated the importance of TxtH during thaxtomin biosynthesis in S. scabies. Biochemical studies showed that TxtH is required for promoting the soluble expression of both the TxtA and TxtB A-domains in Escherichia coli, and amino acid residues essential for this activity were identified. Deletion of txtH in S. scabies significantly reduced thaxtomin A production, and deletion of one of the two additional MLP homologues in S. scabies completely abolished production. Engineered expression of all three S. scabies MLPs could restore thaxtomin A production in a triple MLP-deficient strain, while engineered expression of MLPs from other Streptomyces spp. could not. Furthermore, the constructed MLP mutants were reduced in virulence compared to wild-type S. scabies. The results of our study confirm that TxtH plays a key role in thaxtomin A biosynthesis and plant pathogenicity in S. scabies.	1
Title: Cloning and identification of the lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from marine Streptomyces olivaceus strain FXJ7.023 Abstract: A full length about 105 kb gene cluster containing 35 open reading frames involved in the biosynthesis of lobophorins was cloned and sequenced from a fosmid genomic library of Streptomyces olivaceus strain FXJ7.023. The cluster was identified by genome wide annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters by anti SMASH and knockout of loading module-contained region of polyketide skeleton synthesis gene (the starter of lobS1). Gene cluster comparative analysis suggested that the cluster encoded the complete genes for lobophorin polyketide assembly, modification, substrate catalysis, regulation, transportation and resistance, and shows great identity to the newest reported lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127, but with a significant gene rearrangement in the PKS modules.	1
Title: A gene cluster for biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Streptomyces avermitilis, an industrial organism responsible for the production of the anthelminthic avermectins, harbors a 13.4 kb gene cluster containing 13 unidirectionally transcribed open reading frames corresponding to the apparent biosynthetic operon for the sesquiterpene antibiotic pentalenolactone. The advanced intermediate pentalenolactone F, along with the shunt metabolite pentalenic acid, could be isolated from cultures of S. avermitilis, thereby establishing that the pentalenolactone biosynthetic pathway is functional in S. avermitilis. Deletion of the entire 13.4 kb cluster from S. avermitilis abolished formation of pentalenolactone metabolites, while transfer of the intact cluster to the pentalenolactone nonproducer Streptomyces lividans 1326 resulted in production of pentalenic acid. Direct evidence for the biochemical function of the individual biosynthetic genes came from expression of the ptlA gene (SAV2998) in Escherichia coli. Assay of the resultant protein established that PtlA is a pentalenene synthase, catalyzing the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to pentalenene, the parent hydrocarbon of the pentalenolactone family of metabolites. The most upstream gene in the cluster, gap1 (SAV2990), was shown to correspond to the pentalenolactone resistance gene, based on expression in E. coli and demonstration that the resulting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the normal target of pentalenolactone, was insensitive to the antibiotic. Furthermore, a second GAPDH isozyme (gap2, SAV6296) has been expressed in E. coli and shown to be inactivated by pentalenolactone.	1
Title: Bipartite interactions, antibiotic production and biosynthetic potential of the Arabidopsis leaf microbiome Abstract: Plants are colonized by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms that affect plant growth and health. Representative genome-sequenced culture collections of bacterial isolates from model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, have recently been established. These resources provide opportunities for systematic interaction screens combined with genome mining to discover uncharacterized natural products. Here, we report on the biosynthetic potential of 224 strains isolated from the A. thaliana phyllosphere. Genome mining identified more than 1,000 predicted natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), hundreds of which are unknown compared to the MIBiG database of characterized BGCs. For functional validation, we used a high-throughput screening approach to monitor over 50,000 binary strain combinations. We observed 725 inhibitory interactions, with 26 strains contributing to the majority of these. A combination of imaging mass spectrometry and bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most potent inhibitor, the BGC-rich Brevibacillus sp. Leaf182, revealed three distinct natural product scaffolds that contribute to the observed antibiotic activity. Moreover, a genome mining-based strategy led to the isolation of a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase-derived antibiotic, macrobrevin, which displays an unprecedented natural product structure. Our findings demonstrate that the phyllosphere is a valuable environment for the identification of antibiotics and natural products with unusual scaffolds.	1
Title: Genetic structure and parasitization-related ability divergence of a nematode fungal pathogen Hirsutella minnesotensis following founder effect in China Abstract: The fungal parasitoid, Hirsutella minnesotensis, is a dominant parasitoid of the soybean cyst nematode, which is a destruction pest of soybean crops. We investigated population structure and parasitism pattern in samples of H. minnesotensis in China to reveal the spreading pattern of this fungal species and the underlying mechanism generating the parasitization-related ability variability in Chinese population. In cross-inoculation experiments using different combinations of H. minnesotensis and soybean cyst nematode samples from China, most H. minnesotensis isolates fitted the criterion for "local versus foreign" parasitism profile, exhibiting local adaptation pattern to the SCN host. However, the genetic analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphisms with clone-corrected samples based on ten DNA fragments in 56 isolates of H. minnesotensis from China revealed that the Chinese H. minnesotensis population was a clonal lineage that underwent a founder event. The results demonstrated that the Chinese H. minnesotensis population had generated parasitization-related ability diversity after a founder event through individual variation or phenotypic plasticity other than local adaptation. The rapid divergence of parasitization-related abilities with simple genetic structure in Chinese H. minnesotensis population indicates a fundamental potential for the establishment of invasive fungal species, which is a prerequisite for biological control agents.	0
Title: Discovery and engineered overproduction of antimicrobial nucleoside antibiotic A201A from the deep-sea marine actinomycete Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652 Abstract: Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652, originating from a deep-sea marine sediment of the South China Sea, was discovered to produce antimicrobial nucleoside antibiotic A201A. Whole-genome scanning and annotation strategies enabled us to localize the genes responsible for A201A biosynthesis and to experimentally identify the gene cluster; inactivation of mtdF, an oxidoreductase gene within the suspected gene cluster, abolished A201A production. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that a gene designated mtdA furthest upstream within the A201A biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a GntR family transcriptional regulator. To determine the role of MtdA in regulating A201A production, the mtdA gene was inactivated in frame and the resulting ΔmtdA mutant was fermented alongside the wild-type strain as a control. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of fermentation extracts revealed that the ΔmtdA mutant produced A201A in a yield ∼25-fold superior to that of the wild-type strain, thereby demonstrating that MtdA is a negative transcriptional regulator governing A201A biosynthesis. By virtue of its high production capacity, the ΔmtdA mutant constitutes an ideal host for the efficient large-scale production of A201A. These results validate M. thermotolerans as an emerging source of antibacterial agents and highlight the efficiency of metabolic engineering for antibiotic titer improvement.	1
Title: Structural studies on the Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 indicate that matrix proteins of enveloped RNA viruses are analogues but not homologues Abstract: Matrix proteins are the driving force of assembly of enveloped viruses. Their main function is to interact with and polymerize at cellular membranes and link other viral components to the matrix-membrane complex resulting in individual particle shapes and ensuring the integrity of the viral particle. Although matrix proteins of different virus families show functional analogy, they share no sequence or structural homology, Their diversity is also evident in that they use a variety of late domain motifs to commit the cellular vacuolar protein sorting machinery to virus budding. Here, we discuss the structural and functional aspects of teh filovirus matrix protein VP40 and compare them to other known matrix protein structures from vesicular stomatitis virus adn retroviral matrix protein.	0
Title: Characterization of the lnmKLM genes unveiling key intermediates for β-alkylation in leinamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Leinamycin (LNM, 1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve β-alkylation of the polyketide intermediate, catalyzed by LnmKLM. Inactivation of lnmK, lnmL, or lnmM afforded mutant strains that accumulated LNM K-1 (2), K-2 (3), K-3 (4), and isomers LNM K-1' (5), K-2' (6), and K-3' (7) whose polyketide origin was established by feeding experiments with sodium [1-(13)C]acetate. These findings confirm the indispensability of LnmKLM in 1 biosynthesis and suggest that β-alkylation proceeds on the growing polyketide intermediate while bound to the LNM polyketide synthase.	1
Title: Elucidation of post-PKS tailoring steps involved in landomycin biosynthesis Abstract: The functional roles of all proposed enzymes involved in the post-PKS redox reactions of the biosynthesis of various landomycin aglycones were thoroughly studied, both in vivo and in vitro. The results revealed that LanM2 acts as a dehydratase and is responsible for concomitant release of the last PKS-tethered intermediate to yield prejadomycin (10). Prejadomycin (10) was confirmed to be a general pathway intermediate of the biosynthesis. Oxygenase LanE and the reductase LanV are sufficient to convert 10 into 11-deoxylandomycinone (5) in the presence of NADH. LanZ4 is a reductase providing reduced flavin (FMNH) co-factor to the partner enzyme LanZ5, which controls all remaining steps. LanZ5, a bifunctional oxygenase-dehydratase, is a key enzyme directing landomycin biosynthesis. It catalyzes hydroxylation at the 11-position preferentially only after the first glycosylation step, and requires the presence of LanZ4. In the absence of such a glycosylation, LanZ5 catalyzes C5,6-dehydration, leading to the production of anhydrolandomycinone (8) or tetrangulol (9). The overall results provided a revised pathway for the biosynthesis of the four aglycones that are found in various congeners of the landomycin group.	1
Title: Analysis of a Coxiella burnetti gene product that activates capsule synthesis in Escherichia coli: requirement for the heat shock chaperone DnaK and the two-component regulator RcsC Abstract: A 1.2-kb EcoRI genomic DNA fragment of Coxiella burnetti, when cloned onto a multicopy plasmid, was found to induce capsule synthesis (mucoidy) in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 270 amino acids. Insertion of a tet cassette into a unique NruI restriction site resulted in the loss of induction of mucoidy. Because of its ability to induce mucoidy, we designated this gene mucZ. Computer search for homologies to mucZ revealed 42% identity to an open reading frame located at 1 min of the E. coli chromosome. Interestingly, the C-terminal amino acid residues of MucZ share significant homology with the J domain of the DnaJ protein and its homologs, suggesting potential interactions between MucZ and components of the DnaK-chaperone machinery. Results presented in this paper suggest that E. coli requires DnaK-chaperone machinery for Lon-RcsA-mediated induction of capsule synthesis, as noticed first by S. Gottesman (personal communication). The induction caused by MucZ is independent of Lon-RcsA and is mediated through the two-component regulators RcsC and RcsB. DnaK and GrpE but not DnaJ are also required for the RcsB-mediated MucZ induction, and we propose that MucZ is a DnaJ-like chaperone protein that might be required for the formation of an active RcsA-RcsB complex and for the RcsC-dependent phosphorylation of RcsB. Discussions are presented that suggest three different roles for alternative forms of the DnaK-chaperone machinery in capsule production.	0
Title: A sigmaB-like factor responsible for carotenoid biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Self-cloning experiments with a high-copy-number plasmid and Streptomyces griseus IFO13350 led to the cloning of a 11-kb DNA fragment that conferred yellow pigment production on the host. The cloned fragment contained a gene cluster for carotenoid biosynthesis, in which two polycistrons, crtE (encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase)-crtI (phytoene dehydrogenase)-crtB (phytoene synthase)-crtV (functionally unknown methyltransferase-like protein) and crtY (lycopene cyclase)-crtT (functionally unknown methyltransferase-like protein)-crtU (beta-carotene dehydrogenase), were present in a convergent way. Since strain IFO13350 produced no detectable amount of carotenoids, an increase in the copy number of the crt gene cluster led to production of carotenoids at a detectable level. Overexpression of the stress-responsive sigmaB-like protein CrtS from Streptomyces setonii also activated the cryptic crt genes in S. griseus and conferred pigmentation. A CrtS homologue (sigmaCrtS) in S. griseus, which was predicted by a computer-aided homology search, caused carotenogenesis to the same extent as CrtS of S. setonii, indicating that the two sigmaB-like proteins were functionally the same. Yellow pigment production by S. griseus containing crtS under the control of a strong promoter on a high-copy-number plasmid resulted from activation of transcription of the crt genes, because overexpression of sigmaCrtS in S. griseus led to transcriptional activation of the promoters in front of crtE and crtY. S1 nuclease mapping showed that crtS itself was transcribed at a low level under the laboratory conditions, which may account for undetectable production of carotenoids. The crt genes were suggested to locate very near one end of the linear chromosome, since they were completely deleted in mutant HH1 having large deletions at both ends. The gene organization of crt in S. griseus is similar to that in S. coelicolor A3(2) where the whole crt gene set is near one end of the chromosome.	1
Title: Genes from a Dietzia sp. for synthesis of C40 and C50 beta-cyclic carotenoids Abstract: Dietzia sp. CQ4 accumulated the C(40) beta-cyclic carotenoids (canthaxanthin and echinenone) and the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid (C.p.450 monoglucoside). A plant-type lycopene beta-cyclase gene crtL was identified for beta-cyclization of the C(40) carotenoids. A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster was identified away from the crtL gene, which contained the crtEBI genes for the synthesis of lycopene followed by the lbtABC genes for lycopene elongation and beta-cyclization of the C(50) carotenoids. This C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid synthesis gene cluster from Dietzia sp. CQ4 showed high homology with the gene clusters for synthesizing the C(50) epsilon-cyclic carotenoids (decaprenoxanthin and glucosides) from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Agromyces mediolanus. One unique feature of the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid synthesis genes in Dietzia sp. CQ4 was that the gene encoding a C(50) carotenoid beta-cyclase subunit and the gene encoding the lycopene elongase appeared to be fused as a single gene (lbtBC). Expression of the gene (lbtA) encoding another subunit of the C(50) carotenoid beta-cyclase and the lbtBC gene in lycopene-accumulating Escherichia coli produced almost exclusively the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoid C.p.450. One gene (crtX) with high homology to glycosyl transferases was transcribed in the opposite orientation downstream of the lbtBC gene. The crtX gene was likely involved in C.p.450 glucosylation in Dietzia sp. CQ4. The pathway analogous to the synthesis of the C(50) epsilon-cyclic carotenoids was proposed for the synthesis of the C(50) beta-cyclic carotenoids.	1
Title: A simple reverse genetics approach to elucidating the biosynthetic pathway of nocathiacin Abstract: Genomic library screening and genome mining are currently employed to identify biosynthetic gene clusters of thiopeptides. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of nocathiacin, we present a new approach with the application of simple reverse genetics. A relationship between structural features of thiopeptides and their biosynthetic pathways is established and is a starting point for speedily elucidating biosynthetic genes of various ribosomally-synthesized bioactive peptides with diverse modifications.	1
Title: Chemical characterisation of disruptants of the Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) actVI genes involved in actinorhodin biosynthesis Abstract: The actVI genetic region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is part of the biosynthetic gene cluster of actinorhodin (ACT), the act cluster, consisting of six ORFs: ORFB, ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4. A newly devised method of ACT detection with a combination of HPLC and LC/MS was applied to the analysis of the disruptants of each ORF. ACT was produced by those of ORFB, ORFA, ORF3, and ORF4. Instead of ACT, the ORF1 disruptant produced 3,8-dihydroxy-1-methylanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid (DMAC) and aloesaponarin II as shunt products. The ORF2 disruptant gave 4-dihydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-10-oxo-3-H-naphtho-[2,3-c]-pyran-3-(S)-acet ic acid, (S)-DNPA. These results support our previous proposal for stereospecific pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of ACT, most importantly suggesting that the actVI-ORF2 product would recognize (S)-DNPA as a substrate for stereospecific reduction at C-15. The disruptant of ORFA produced (S)-DNPA together with ACT, suggesting that actVI-ORFA might play a role such as stabilising the multicomponent, type II PKS complex.	1
Title: High-level expression of the Streptomyces clavuligerus isopenicillin N synthase gene in Escherichia coli Abstract: The pcbC gene, which encodes isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), was subcloned from Streptomyces clavuligerus into Escherichia coli by using the pT7 series of plasmid vectors. The polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce an NdeI site at the translation initiation codon of pcbC, allowing the gene to be inserted behind an E. coli type of ribosome binding site. This construction directed high-level expression of IPNS, but the IPNS was in an inactive form in inclusion bodies. Active IPNS was recovered by solubilizing and renaturing the protein.	1
Title: Lactobacillus saerimneri and Lactobacillus ruminis: novel human-derived probiotic strains with immunomodulatory activities Abstract: Human-derived lactobacilli were isolated from fecal samples of healthy volunteers. Forty-six isolates from different volunteers were selected and investigated for their immunomodulatory properties. Conditioned medium from each isolate was assessed for its effect on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated THP-1 monocytes. Of 46 Lactobacillus isolates, 12 significantly inhibited TNF production in varying magnitude. Lactobacillus strain TH58 displayed the most potent TNF-inhibitory activity (70% inhibition). In contrast, Lactobacillus strain TH14 exhibited immunostimulatory property by activating TNF production in THP-1 monocytes. Lactobacillus TH14 induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in the absence of lipopolysaccharide stimulation, whereas Lactobacillus TH58 had no effect on NF-kappaB signaling, irrespective of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Strain TH58 was identified as Lactobacillus saerimneri and strain TH14 as Lactobacillus ruminis by sequence analysis of their 16S rRNA genes. This is the first report of a human isolate of L. saerimneri with TNF-inhibitory activity and L. ruminis, an indigenous species to humans, with TNF stimulatory activity. Our data suggest the potential use of these two strains as immunoprobiotic candidates.	0
Title: Bacterial Analogs of Plant Tetrahydropyridine Alkaloids Mediate Microbial Interactions in a Rhizosphere Model System Abstract: Plants expend significant resources to select and maintain rhizosphere communities that benefit their growth and protect them from pathogens. A better understanding of assembly and function of rhizosphere microbial communities will provide new avenues for improving crop production. Secretion of antibiotics is one means by which bacteria interact with neighboring microbes and sometimes change community composition. In our analysis of a taxonomically diverse consortium from the soybean rhizosphere, we found that Pseudomonas koreensis selectively inhibits growth of Flavobacterium johnsoniae and other members of the Bacteroidetes grown in soybean root exudate. A genetic screen in P. koreensis identified a previously uncharacterized biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the inhibitory activity. Metabolites were isolated based on biological activity and were characterized using tandem mass spectrometry, multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, and Mosher ester analysis, leading to the discovery of a new family of bacterial tetrahydropyridine alkaloids, koreenceine A to D (metabolites 1 to 4). Three of these metabolites are analogs of the plant alkaloid γ-coniceine. Comparative analysis of the koreenceine cluster with the γ-coniceine pathway revealed distinct polyketide synthase routes to the defining tetrahydropyridine scaffold, suggesting convergent evolution. Koreenceine-type pathways are widely distributed among Pseudomonas species, and koreenceine C was detected in another Pseudomonas species from a distantly related cluster. This work suggests that Pseudomonas and plants convergently evolved the ability to produce similar alkaloid metabolites that can mediate interbacterial competition in the rhizosphere.IMPORTANCE The microbiomes of plants are critical to host physiology and development. Microbes are attracted to the rhizosphere due to massive secretion of plant photosynthates from roots. Microorganisms that successfully join the rhizosphere community from bulk soil have access to more abundant and diverse molecules, producing a highly competitive and selective environment. In the rhizosphere, as in other microbiomes, little is known about the genetic basis for individual species' behaviors within the community. In this study, we characterized competition between Pseudomonas koreensis and Flavobacterium johnsoniae, two common rhizosphere inhabitants. We identified a widespread gene cluster in several Pseudomonas spp. that is necessary for the production of a novel family of tetrahydropyridine alkaloids that are structural analogs of plant alkaloids. We expand the known repertoire of antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas in the rhizosphere and demonstrate the role of the metabolites in interactions with other rhizosphere bacteria.	1
Title: A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spore formers and other misplaced clostridia Abstract: The class Clostridia in the phylum Firmicutes (formerly low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria) includes diverse bacteria of medical, environmental and biotechnological importance. The Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa branch, which unifies members of the Firmicutes with Gram-negative-type cell envelopes, was recently moved from Clostridia to a separate class Negativicutes. However, draft genome sequences of the spore-forming members of the Negativicutes revealed typically clostridial sets of sporulation genes. To address this and other questions in clostridial phylogeny, we have compared a phylogenetic tree for a concatenated set of 50 widespread ribosomal proteins with the trees for beta subunits of the RNA polymerase (RpoB) and DNA gyrase (GyrB) and with the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny. The results obtained by these methods showed remarkable consistency, suggesting that they reflect the true evolutionary history of these bacteria. These data put the Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa group back within the Clostridia. They also support placement of Clostridium difficile and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae; we suggest resolving the long-standing naming conundrum by renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile. These data also indicate the existence of a group of cellulolytic clostridia that belong to the family Ruminococcaceae. As a tentative solution to resolve the current taxonomical problems, we propose assigning 78 validly described Clostridium species that clearly fall outside the family Clostridiaceae to six new genera: Peptoclostridium, Lachnoclostridium, Ruminiclostridium, Erysipelatoclostridium, Gottschalkia and Tyzzerella. This work reaffirms that 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein sequences are better indicators of evolutionary proximity than phenotypic traits, even such key ones as the structure of the cell envelope and Gram-staining pattern.	0
Title: High-throughput imaging assay of multiple proteins via target-induced DNA assembly and cleavage Abstract: This work integrates target-induced DNA assembly and cleavage on a DNA chip to design a versatile imaging strategy as an assay for multiple proteins. The DNA assembly is achieved via immunological recognition to trigger the proximity hybridization for releasing a DNA sequence, which then hybridizes with FITC-DNA1 immobilized on the chip to induce the enzymatic cleavage of DNA1 and thus decrease the signals. The signal readout is performed with both fluorescent imaging of the left FITC and chemiluminescent (CL) imaging, by adding peroxidase labelled anti-FITC in assembly solution and CL substrates to produce CL emission. This one-step incubation can be completed in 30 min. The imaging method shows wide detection ranges and detection limits down to pg mL-1 for the simultaneous detection of 4 protein biomarkers. This high-throughput strategy with good practicability can be easily extended to other protein analytes, providing a powerful protocol for protein analysis and clinical diagnosis.	0
Title: Enantioselective Phenol Coupling by Laccases in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Dimeric Naphthopyrones Abstract: Biaryl compounds are ubiquitous metabolites that are often formed by dimerization through oxidative phenol coupling. Hindered rotation around the biaryl bond can cause axial chirality. In nature, dimerizations are catalyzed by oxidative enzymes such as laccases. This class of enzymes is known for non-specific oxidase reactions while inherent enantioselectivity is hitherto unknown. Here, we describe four related fungal laccases that catalyze γ-naphthopyrone dimerization in a regio- and atropselective manner. In vitro assays revealed that three enzymes were highly P-selective (ee >95 %), while one enzyme showed remarkable flexibility. Its selectivity for M- or P-configured dimers varied depending on the reaction conditions. For example, a lower enzyme concentration yielded primarily (P)-ustilaginoidin A, whereas the M atropisomer was favored at higher concentration. These results demonstrate inherent enantioselectivity in an enzyme class that was previously thought to comprise only non-selective oxidases.	1
Title: The genome sequence of Streptomyces lividans 66 reveals a novel tRNA-dependent peptide biosynthetic system within a metal-related genomic island Abstract: The complete genome sequence of the original isolate of the model actinomycete Streptomyces lividans 66, also referred to as 1326, was deciphered after a combination of next-generation sequencing platforms and a hybrid assembly pipeline. Comparative analysis of the genomes of S. lividans 66 and closely related strains, including S. coelicolor M145 and S. lividans TK24, was used to identify strain-specific genes. The genetic diversity identified included a large genomic island with a mosaic structure, present in S. lividans 66 but not in the strain TK24. Sequence analyses showed that this genomic island has an anomalous (G + C) content, suggesting recent acquisition and that it is rich in metal-related genes. Sequences previously linked to a mobile conjugative element, termed plasmid SLP3 and defined here as a 94 kb region, could also be identified within this locus. Transcriptional analysis of the response of S. lividans 66 to copper was used to corroborate a role of this large genomic island, including two SLP3-borne "cryptic" peptide biosynthetic gene clusters, in metal homeostasis. Notably, one of these predicted biosynthetic systems includes an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase--tRNA-dependent transferase biosynthetic hybrid organization. This observation implies the recruitment of members of the leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase family to catalyze peptide bond formation within the biosynthesis of natural products. Thus, the genome sequence of S. lividans 66 not only explains long-standing genetic and phenotypic differences but also opens the door for further in-depth comparative genomic analyses of model Streptomyces strains, as well as for the discovery of novel natural products following genome-mining approaches.	1
Title: Circumventing the effect of product toxicity: development of a novel two-stage production process for the lantibiotic gallidermin Abstract: Lantibiotics such as gallidermin are lanthionine-containing polypeptide antibiotics produced by gram-positive bacteria that might become relevant for the treatment of various infectious diseases. So far, self-toxicity has prevented the isolation of efficient overproducing strains, thus hampering their thorough investigation and preventing their exploitation in fields other than the food area. We wanted to investigate the effect of lantibiotic precursor peptides on the producing strains in order to evaluate novel strategies for the overproduction of these promising peptides. In this study, gallidermin was chosen as a representative example of the type A lantibiotics. A Staphylococcus gallinarum Tü3928 mutant, whose gene for the extracellular pregallidermin protease GdmP was replaced by a kanamycin-resistance gene, was constructed. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis indicated that this mutant produced fully posttranslationally modified gallidermin precursors with truncated versions of the leader peptide, but not the entire leader as predicted from the gdmA sequence. In filter-on-plate assays, these truncated pregallidermins showed no toxicity against Staphylococcus gallinarum Tü3928 up to a concentration of 8 g/liter (corresponding to approximately 2.35 mM), while gallidermin produced clear inhibitory zones at concentrations as low as 0.25 g/liter (0.12 mM). We showed that the lack of toxicity is due entirely to the presence of the truncated leader, since MS as well as bioassay analysis showed that the peptides resulting from tryptic cleavage of pregallidermins and gallidermin produced by S. gallinarum Tü3928 had identical masses and approximately the same specific activity. This demonstrates that even a shortened leader sequence is sufficient to prevent the toxicity of mature gallidermin. In nonoptimized fermentations, the gdmP mutant produced pregallidermin to a 50%-higher molar titer, suggesting that the absence of self-toxicity has a beneficial effect on gallidermin production and giving a first confirmation of the suitability of the overproduction strategy.	1
Title: Virgin Olive Oil Quality Is Affected by the Microbiota that Comprise the Biotic Fraction of the Oil Abstract: This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effects of oil-borne yeasts on the physicochemical, sensorial, and health-related characteristics of virgin olive oil (VOO) during storage. Bacteria, yeasts, and molds constitute the biotic fraction of freshly produced VOO. During storage, the bacteria and molds often die after a short period, while the yeasts survive and condition the quality of VOO. To date, approximately twenty-four yeast species have been isolated from different types of olive oil and its by-products, and seven of these species have been identified as new species. The activity of some yeasts of the biotic fraction of olive oil improves the sensorial characteristics of VOO. Some yeasts can also worsen the quality of the product by allowing the appearance of defects, oxidation of polar phenols, and triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Some yeast species of VOO show in vitro beneficial health effects, such as probiotic and antioxidant activities.	0
Title: Branched Aramid Nanofibers Abstract: Interconnectivity of components in three-dimensional networks (3DNs) is essential for stress transfer in hydrogels, aerogels, and composites. Entanglement of nanoscale components in the network relies on weak short-range intermolecular interactions. The intrinsic stiffness and rod-like geometry of nanoscale components limit the cohesive energy of the physical crosslinks in 3DN materials. Nature realizes networked gels differently using components with extensive branching. Branched aramid nanofibers (BANFs) mimicking polymeric components of biological gels were synthesized to produce 3DNs with high efficiency stress transfer. Individual BANFs are flexible, with the number of branches controlled by base strength in the hydrolysis process. The extensive connectivity of the BANFs allows them to form hydro- and aerogel monoliths with an order of magnitude less solid content than rod-like nanocomponents.

Title: Insights into the evolution of macrolactam biosynthesis through cloning and comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for a novel macrocyclic lactam, ML-449 Abstract: A new compound, designated ML-449, structurally similar to the known 20-membered macrolactam BE-14106, was isolated from a marine sediment-derived Streptomyces sp. Cloning and sequencing of the 83-kb ML-449 biosynthetic gene cluster revealed its high level of similarity to the BE-14106 gene cluster. Comparison of the respective biosynthetic pathways indicated that the difference in the compounds' structures stems from the incorporation of one extra acetate unit during the synthesis of the acyl side chain. A phylogenetic analysis of the beta-ketosynthase (KS) domains from polyketide synthases involved in the biosynthesis of macrolactams pointed to a common ancestry for the two clusters. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated the formation of a macrolactam-specific subclade for the majority of the KS domains from several macrolactam-biosynthetic gene clusters, indicating a closer relationship between macrolactam clusters than with the macrolactone clusters included in the analysis. Some KS domains from the ML-449, BE-14106, and salinilactam gene clusters did, however, show a closer relationship with KS domains from the polyene macrolide clusters, suggesting potential acquisition rather than duplication of certain PKS genes. Comparison of the ML-449, BE-14106, vicenistatin, and salinilactam biosynthetic gene clusters indicated an evolutionary relationship between them and provided new insights into the processes governing the evolution of small-ring macrolactam biosynthesis.	1
Title: Angucyclines Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 from Streptomyces sp. SCC-2136: cloning, sequencing, and characterization Abstract: The entire gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of angucyclines Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA spanning 77.5-kb revealed a total of 55 open reading frames, and the deduced products exhibited strong sequence similarities to type II polyketide synthases, deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, and a variety of accessory enzymes. The involvement of this gene cluster in the pathway of Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 was confirmed by genetic inactivation of the aromatase, including a portion of the ketoreductase, which was disrupted by inserting the thiostrepton gene.	1

Title: Generation, identification, and functional analysis of monoclonal antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nucleocapsid Abstract: The variant strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) severely threaten the pig industry worldwide and cause up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets. It is critically important and urgent to develop tools for detection of PEDV infection. In this study, we developed six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting N protein of PEDV and analyzed their applications on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), western blot assay, and flow cytometry assay. The results demonstrated that all these six mAbs were IgG1 isotype and κ chain. Among these six mAbs, 3F12 recognizes a linear epitope (VAAVKDALKSLGI) while the other five mAbs recognize different conformational epitopes formed by a specific peptide fragment or the full length of N protein. The functional analysis showed that all these six mAbs were applicable to ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry assay. In conclusion, we developed six mAbs against PEDV-N protein to facilitate the early detection of PEDV infection using ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry.	0
Title: Engineered l-Lactate Responding Promoter System Operating in Glucose-Rich and Anoxic Environments Abstract: Bacteria equipped with genetically encoded lactate biosensors are promising tools for biopharmaceutical production, diagnostics, and cellular therapies. However, many applications involve glucose-rich and anoxic environments, in which current whole-cell lactate biosensors show low performance. Here we engineer an optimized, synthetic lactate biosensor system by repurposing the natural LldPRD promoter regulated by the LldR transcriptional regulator. We removed glucose catabolite and anoxic repression by designing a hybrid promoter, containing LldR operators and tuned both regulator and reporter gene expressions to optimize biosensor signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting lactate biosensor, termed ALPaGA (A Lactate Promoter Operating in Glucose and Anoxia), can operate in glucose-rich, aerobic and anoxic conditions. We show that ALPaGA works reliably in the probiotic chassisEscherichia coliNissle 1917 and can detect endogenous l-lactate produced by 3D tumor spheroids with an improved dynamic range. In the future, the ALPaGA system could be used to monitor bioproduction processes and improve the specificity of engineered bacterial cancer therapies by restricting their activity to the lactate-rich microenvironment of solid tumors.	0
Title: Large disk intermediate precedes formation of apolipoprotein A-I-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine small disks Abstract: Small approximately 8.5 nm disks formed spontaneously when dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were incubated with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (100:1 molar ratio). However, in a time course study, the transient production of approximately 11 nm large disks was detected and isolated by gel filtration. The intermediate large disks contained three apoA-I molecules and were stable over time; however, when additional apoA-I was added, they formed small disks containing two molecules of apoA-I. The reaction kinetics of apoA-I with DMPC LUVs was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and two phases were observed, supporting the presence of the intermediate in the formation of small disks. The lipid dynamics of LUVs and disks were assayed, revealing the presence of sequestered lipid-protein domains upon apoA-I binding to DMPC LUVs. In addition, the lipids in the intermediate large disks were more constrained than those in the small disks. We propose that apoA-I binds with DMPC LUVs to form small lipid-protein domains on the LUV; then the domains are released to form large disks, which can mature in the presence of additional apoA-I to form small disks. Thus, the formation of small apoA-I lipid disks proceeds through the formation of a large disk intermediate.	0
Title: A simplified method for purification of an antitumor acidic glycoprotein from Streptococcus pyogenes (Su strain) by immunoadsorbent chromatography Abstract: A simplified method for purification of an antitumor acidic glycoprotein (SAGP) from Streptococcus pyogenes (Su strain) by immunoaffinity chromatography is described. A cell-free crude extract prepared from the cocci was applied to the anti-SAGP IgG coupled Sepharose column, and elution was conducted with an alkaline buffer. The material eluted was confirmed to be homogeneous and identical with SAGP as demonstrated by both relative mobility on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel column and the antigenicity on the double diffusion agar plate. The cell-growth inhibitory activity of SAGP prepared by the present method was almost the same as that of SAGP purified by the previous time-consuming method. Since this simplified method provides a higher yield of SAGP, it will be useful in further studies on the biological properties of SAGP.	0
Title: Alternative epimerization in C(7)N-aminocyclitol biosynthesis is catalyzed by ValD, a large protein of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily Abstract: Gene valD, encodes a large vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily protein, has been identified in the validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Inactivation of valD significantly reduced validamycin A production, which was fully restored with the full-length valD and partially restored with either N-terminal or C-terminal half by complementation. Heterologously expressed ValD catalyzed the epimerization of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone to 5-epi-valiolone. This metalloenzyme is a homodimer with a metal ion-binding ratio of 0.73 mol/mole protein toward Fe(2+), Mn(2+), Ni(2+), and Zn(2+). Individual and combined site-directed mutations of eight putative active site residues revealed that the N-terminal H44/E107 and the C-terminal H315/E366 are more critical for the activity than the internal H130, E183, H229, and E291. Our data have established ValD as one of the largest proteins of the VOC superfamily, catalyzing an alternative epimerization for C(7)N-aminocyclitol biosynthesis.	0
Title: Differential Utilization of Basic Proline-Rich Glycoproteins during Growth of Oral Bacteria in Saliva Abstract: Although saliva is widely recognized as a primary source of carbon and nitrogen for growth of the dental plaque biofilm community, little is known about how different oral bacteria utilize specific salivary components. To address this question, 32 strains representing 16 genera commonly isolated from early plaque biofilms were compared for growth over two transfers in stimulated (by chewing Parafilm) whole saliva that was stabilized by heat treatment and dialysis. The cell densities, measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), ranged from ∼1 × 10(6) to 1 × 10(7)/ml for strains of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mitis and one strain of Streptococcus sanguinis Strains of Streptococcus mutans, Gemella haemolysans, and Granulicatella adiacens reached ∼1 × 10(5) to 1 × 10(6)/ml. In contrast, little or no growth was noted for three other strains of S. sanguinis, as well as for strains of Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces spp., Abiotrophia defectiva, and Rothia dentocariosa SDS-PAGE, lectin blotting, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of saliva from cultures of S. gordonii, S. oralis, and S. mitis revealed species-specific differences in the degradation of basic proline-rich glycoproteins (PRG). In contrast, saliva from cultures of other bacteria was indistinguishable from control saliva. Species-dependent differences in the utilization of individual host sugars were minor. Thus, differences in salivary glycan foraging between oral species may be important to cross-feeding and cooperation between organisms in dental plaque biofilm development.                  Importance:                       Bacteria in the mouth use saliva for nutrition. How each of the many types of bacteria uses saliva is not clear. We show that a major protein in saliva, called PRG, is an important nutrition source for certain bacteria but not for others. PRG has many sugar molecules linked in chains, but the sugar is not available for bacteria until the chains are degraded. The bacteria that can grow by digesting this protein break the sugar chains into parts which not only support their own growth but could also be available to support the growth of those bacteria that cannot use the intact protein.	0
Title: Antimicrobial Effects of Antipyretics Abstract: Antipyretics are some of the most commonly used drugs. Since they are often coadministered with antimicrobial therapy, it is important to understand the interactions between these two classes of drugs. Our review is the first to summarize the antimicrobial effects of antipyretic drugs and the underlying mechanisms involved. Antipyretics can inhibit virus replication, inhibit or promote bacterial or fungal growth, alter the expression of virulence factors, change the surface hydrophobicity of microbes, influence biofilm production, affect the motility, adherence, and metabolism of pathogens, interact with the transport and release of antibiotics by leukocytes, modify the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, and induce or reduce the frequency of mutations leading to antimicrobial resistance. While antipyretics may compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, they can also be beneficial, for example, in the management of biofilm-associated infections, in reducing virulence factors, in therapy of resistant pathogens, and in inducing synergistic effects. In an era where it is becoming increasingly difficult to find new antimicrobial drugs, targeting virulence factors, enhancing the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, and reducing resistance may be important strategies.	0
Title: Lipid-like Peptides can Stabilize Integral Membrane Proteins for Biophysical and Structural Studies Abstract: A crucial bottleneck in membrane protein structural biology is the difficulty in identifying a detergent that can maintain the stability and functionality of integral membrane proteins (IMPs). Detergents are poor membrane mimics, and their common use in membrane protein crystallography may be one reason for the challenges in obtaining high-resolution crystal structures of many IMP families. Lipid-like peptides (LLPs) have detergent-like properties and have been proposed as alternatives for the solubilization of G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane proteins. Here, we systematically analyzed the stabilizing effect of LLPs on integral membrane proteins of different families. We found that LLPs could significantly stabilize detergent-solubilized IMPs in vitro. This stabilizing effect depended on the chemical nature of the LLP and the intrinsic stability of a particular IMP in the detergent. Our results suggest that screening a subset of LLPs is sufficient to stabilize a particular IMP, which can have a substantial impact on the crystallization and quality of the crystal.	0
Title: Sequence analysis and heterologous expression of the lincomycin biosynthetic cluster of the type strain Streptomyces lincolnensis ATCC 25466 Abstract: A cosmid bearing an insert of 38 217 bp covering the gene cluster and its flanking regions of type strain Streptomyces lincolnensis ATCC 25466 was sequenced. Two relatively extensive sequence changes and several hundred point mutations were identified if compared with the previously published sequence of the lincomycin (Lin) industrial strain S. lincolnensis 78-11. Analysis of the cluster-flanking regions revealed its localization within the genome of the ATCC 25466 strain. The cluster-bearing cosmid was integrated into the chromosome of Lin non-producing strains S. coelicolor CH 999 and S. coelicolor M 145. The modified strains heterologously produced Lin but the level dropped to approximately 1-3% of the production in the ATCC 25466 strain.	1
Title: Elimination of a Free Cysteine by Creation of a Disulfide Bond Increases the Activity and Stability of Candida boidinii Formate Dehydrogenase Abstract: NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.2.1.2) is an industrial enzyme widely used for NADH regeneration. However, enzyme inactivation caused by the oxidation of cysteine residues is a flaw of native FDH. In this study, we relieved the oxidation of the free cysteine of FDH from Candida boidinii (CboFDH) through the construction of disulfide bonds between A10 and C23 as well as I239 and C262. Variants A10C, I239C, and A10C/I239C were obtained by the site-directed mutagenesis and their properties were studied. Results showed that there were no significant changes in the optimum temperature and pH between variants and wild-type CboFDH. However, the stabilities of all variant enzymes were improved. Specifically, the CboFDH variant A10C (A10Cfdh) showed a significant increase in copper ion resistance and acid resistance, a 6.7-fold increase in half-life at 60°C, and a 1.4-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared with the wild type. Asymmetric synthesis of l-tert-leucine indicated that the process time was reduced by 40% with variant A10Cfdh, which benefited from the increase in catalytic efficiency. Circular dichroism analysis and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that variants that contained disulfide bonds lowered the overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) and consequently increased the protein rigidity without affecting the secondary structure of enzyme. This work is expected to provide a viable strategy to avoid the microbial enzyme inactivation caused by the oxidation of the free cysteine residues and improving their performances.                  Importance:                       FDH is widely used for NADH regeneration in dehydrogenase-based synthesis of optically active compounds to decrease the cost of production. This study highlighted a viable strategy that was used to eliminate the oxidation of free cysteine residues of FDH from Candida boidinii by the introduction of disulfide bonds. Using this strategy, we obtained a variant FDH with improved activity and stability. The improvement of activity and stability of FDH is expected to reduce its price and then further to decrease the cost of its application.	0
Title: Initiation of the flexirubin biosynthesis in Chitinophaga pinensis Abstract: Bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum are known producers of the chemotaxonomic relevant flexirubins. These orange pigments comprise a non-isoprenoid aryl-polyene carboxylic acid esterified with a dialkylresorcinol. Herein, we report a gene cluster from Chitinophaga pinensis encoding the biosynthesis of the polyene moiety and the biochemical characterization of a tyrosine ammonia-lyase and a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase responsible for the initiation of the polyene biosynthesis. Additionally, the flexirubin of C. pinensis was characterized by a combination of feeding experiments, high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.	1
Title: A two-phase comprehensive NSCLC prognostic study identifies lncRNAs with significant main effect and interaction Abstract: Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are involved in regulating physiological behaviors for various malignant tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies comprehensively evaluated both lncRNA-lncRNA interaction effects and main effects of lncRNA on overall survival of NSCLC. Hence, we performed a two-phase designed study of lncRNA expression in tumor tissues using 604 NSCLC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as the discovery phase and 839 patients from Gene Expression Omnibus as the validation phase. In the discovery phase, we adopted a two-step strategy, Screening before Testing, for dimension reduction and signal detection. These candidate lncRNAs first screened out by the weighted random forest (Ranger), were then tested through the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for covariates. Significant lncRNAs with either type of effects aforementioned were carried forward into the validation phase to confirm their significances again. As a result, in the discovery phase, 19 lncRNAs were identified by Ranger, among which five lncRNAs and one pair of lncRNA-lncRNA interaction exhibited significant effects (FDR-q ≤ 0.05) main and interaction effects on NSCLC survival, respectively, through Cox model. After the independent validation, we finally observed that one lncRNA (ENSG00000227403.1) with main effect was robustly associated with NSCLC prognosis (HRdiscovery = 0.90, P = 1.20 × 10-3; HRvalidation = 0.94, P = 4.11 × 10-3) and one pair of lncRNAs (ENSG00000267121.4 and ENSG00000272369.1) had significant interaction effect on NSCLC survival (HRdiscovery = 1.12, P = 3.07 × 10-4; HRvalidation = 1.11, P = 0.0397). Our comprehensive NSCLC prognostic study of lncRNA provided population-level evidence for further functional study.	0
Title: Substrate specificity of 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase, a bacterial cytochrome P450 of erythromycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase (EryF) is a soluble cytochrome P450 responsible for the stereospecific C-6 hydroxylation of the erythromycin precursor, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. Using the expression of the eryF gene in Escherichia coli [Andersen, J. F., & Hutchinson, C. R. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 725-735] as the enzyme source, we examined the catalytic activity of the EryF protein toward several macrolide substrates related to 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The results of these studies were compared with measurements of the apparent dissociation constants for various substrates and with information from molecular modeling studies of the substrates and the enzyme-substrate complex. Only minor changes in the structure of 6-deoxyerythronolide B resulted in substrates with catalytic rates less than 1% of those seen with the natural substrate. Although the 9S epimer of 9-deoxo-9-hydroxy-6-deoxyerythronolide B was hydroxylated at a rate approximately equal to the natural substrate, the 9R epimer was hydroxylated at a 2-fold lower rate. Examination of molecular models revealed that the position of the 9-hydroxyl oxygen in the 9S epimer resembles that of the 9-oxo oxygen in the natural substrate more closely than in the 9R epimer. 8,8a-Deoxyoleandolide, which is identical to 6-deoxyerythronolide B except for the presence of a C-13 methyl group, and its (9S)-9-deoxo-9-hydroxy derivative were C-6 hydroxylated at a 4-fold lower rate than the natural substrate, and the 9-oxo form showed a substantially larger apparent dissociation constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1
Title: Investigations into the Biosynthesis, Regulation, and Self-Resistance of Toxoflavin in Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 Abstract: Pseudomonas spp. are prolific producers of natural products from many structural classes. Here we show that the soil bacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 is capable of producing trace levels of the triazine natural product toxoflavin (1) under microaerobic conditions. We evaluated toxoflavin production by derivatives of Pf-5 with deletions in specific biosynthesis genes, which led us to propose a revised biosynthetic pathway for toxoflavin that shares the first two steps with riboflavin biosynthesis. We also report that toxM, which is not present in the well-characterized cluster of Burkholderia glumae, encodes a monooxygenase that degrades toxoflavin. The toxoflavin degradation product of ToxM is identical to that of TflA, the toxoflavin lyase from Paenibacillus polymyxa. Toxoflavin production by P. protegens causes inhibition of several plant-pathogenic bacteria, and introduction of toxM into the toxoflavin-sensitive strain Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 results in resistance to toxoflavin.	1
Title: The role of carbon starvation in the induction of enzymes that degrade plant-derived carbohydrates in Aspergillus niger Abstract: Fungi are an important source of enzymes for saccharification of plant polysaccharides and production of biofuels. Understanding of the regulation and induction of expression of genes encoding these enzymes is still incomplete. To explore the induction mechanism, we analysed the response of the industrially important fungus Aspergillus niger to wheat straw, with a focus on events occurring shortly after exposure to the substrate. RNA sequencing showed that the transcriptional response after 6h of exposure to wheat straw was very different from the response at 24h of exposure to the same substrate. For example, less than half of the genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes that were induced after 24h of exposure to wheat straw, were also induced after 6h exposure. Importantly, over a third of the genes induced after 6h of exposure to wheat straw were also induced during 6h of carbon starvation, indicating that carbon starvation is probably an important factor in the early response to wheat straw. The up-regulation of the expression of a high number of genes encoding CAZymes that are active on plant-derived carbohydrates during early carbon starvation suggests that these enzymes could be involved in a scouting role during starvation, releasing inducing sugars from complex plant polysaccharides. We show, using proteomics, that carbon-starved cultures indeed release CAZymes with predicted activity on plant polysaccharides. Analysis of the enzymatic activity and the reaction products, indicates that these proteins are enzymes that can degrade various plant polysaccharides to generate both known, as well as potentially new, inducers of CAZymes.	0
Title: Extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables imported from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam Abstract: To examine to what extent fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland represent carriers of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 169 samples of different types of fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam were analyzed. Overall, 25.4% of the vegetable samples yielded one or more ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 78.3% of which were multidrug resistant. Sixty isolates were obtained: Escherichia coli, 26; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and Cronobacter sakazakii, 1. We found 29 isolates producing CTX-M-15, 8 producing CTX-M-14, 7 producing CTX-M-55, 3 producing CTX-M-65, 1 each producing CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-27, and CTX-M-63, 5 producing SHV-2, 3 producing SHV-12, and 1 producing SHV-2a. Four of the E. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: CTX-M-15-producing B2:ST131 (1 isolate), D:ST405 (1 isolate), and D:ST38 (2 isolates). One of the D:ST38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) D:ST38 lineage. Two of the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (ST15) and ST147. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal Enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of ESBL genes and a concern for food safety.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster of simocyclinone, a natural multihybrid antibiotic Abstract: The entire simocyclinone biosynthetic cluster (sim gene cluster) from the producer Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040 was identified on six overlapping cosmids (1N1, 5J10, 2L16, 2P6, 4G22, and 1K3). In total, 80.7 kb of DNA from these cosmids was sequenced, and the analysis revealed 49 complete open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs include genes responsible for the formation and attachment of four different moieties originating from at least three different pools of primary metabolites. Also in the sim gene cluster, four ORFs were detected that resemble putative regulatory and export functions. Based on the putative function of the gene products, a model for simocyclinone D8 biosynthesis was proposed. Biosynthetic mutants were generated by insertional gene inactivation experiments, and culture extracts of these mutants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Production of simocyclinone D8 was clearly detectable in the wild-type strain but was not detectable in the mutant strains. This indicated that indeed the sim gene cluster had been cloned.	1
Title: The antimicrobial effect of Octenidine-dihydrochloride coated polymer tracheotomy tubes on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation Abstract: Background:                       The surface of polymeric tracheotomy tubes is a favourable environment for biofilm formation and therefore represents a potential risk factor for the development of pneumonia after tracheotomy. The aim of this in-vitro study was to develop octenidine-dihydrochloride (OCT) coated polymer tracheotomy tubes and investigate any effects on Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa colonization. Additionally the resistance of the OCT coating was tested using reprocessing procedures like brushing, rinsing and disinfection with glutaraldehyde                  Results:                       Contamination with S. aureus: Before any reprocessing, OCT coated tracheotomy tubes were colonized with 103 cfu/ml and uncoated tracheotomy tubes with 105 cfu/ml (P = 0.045). After reprocessing, no differences in bacterial concentration between modified and conventional tubes were observed.Contamination with P. aeruginosa: Before reprocessing, OCT coated tubes were colonized with 106 cfu/ml and uncoated tubes with 107 cfu/ml (P = 0.006). After reprocessing, no significant differences were observed.                  Conclusion:                       OCT coating initially inhibits S. aureus and P. aeruginosa colonisation on tracheotomy tubes. This effect, however, vanishes quickly after reprocessing of the tubes due to poor adhesive properties of the antimicrobial compound. Despite the known antimicrobial effect of OCT, its use for antimicrobial coating of tracheotomy tubes is limited unless methods are developed to allow sustained attachment to the tube.	0
Title: Total synthesis of (+/-)-symbioimine Abstract: The synthesis of (+/-)-symbioimine (1) has been completed in only 12 linear steps in 8% overall yield. The key step is the treatment of 13b with BF3.Et2O to generate N-carboalkoxydihydropyridinium cation 14b, which undergoes a novel stereospecific intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction to give adduct 16b in 42% yield. Cleavage of the N-Troc group of 16b afforded imine 24b stereospecifically. Cleavage of the TBDMS ethers and sulfation provided (+/-)-symbioimine (1). [reaction: see text].	0
Title: Genetic organization of Pasteurella multocida cap Loci and development of a multiplex capsular PCR typing system Abstract: Current serotyping methods classify Pasteurella multocida into five capsular serogroups (serogroups A, B, D, E, and F) and 16 somatic serotypes (serotypes 1 to 16). In the present study, we have developed a multiplex PCR assay as a rapid alternative to the conventional capsular serotyping system. The serogroup-specific primers used in this assay were designed following identification, sequence determination, and analysis of the capsular biosynthetic loci of each capsular serogroup. The entire capsular biosynthetic loci of P. multocida A:1 (X-73) and B:2 (M1404) have been cloned and sequenced previously (J. Y. Chung, Y. M. Zhang, and B. Adler, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 166:289-296, 1998; J. D. Boyce, J. Y. Chung, and B. Adler, Vet. Microbiol. 72:121-134, 2000). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the biosynthetic region (region 2) from each of the remaining three serogroups, serogroups D, E, and F, identified serogroup-specific regions and gave an indication of the capsular polysaccharide composition. The multiplex capsular PCR assay was highly specific, and its results, with the exception of those for some serogroup F strains, correlated well with conventional serotyping results. Sequence analysis of the strains that gave conflicting results confirmed the validity of the multiplex PCR and indicated that these strains were in fact capsular serogroup A. The multiplex PCR will clarify the distinction between closely related serogroups A and F and constitutes a rapid assay for the definitive classification of P. multocida capsular types.	1
Title: The ppuI-rsaL-ppuR quorum-sensing system regulates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 by controlling biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides putisolvins I and II Abstract: Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 produces two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess surface tension-reducing abilities and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down existing biofilms of several Pseudomonas spp., including P. aeruginosa. Putisolvins are secreted in the culture medium during growth at late exponential phase, indicating that production is possibly regulated by quorum sensing. In the present study, we identified a quorum-sensing system in PCL1445 that is composed of ppuI, rsaL, and ppuR and shows very high similarity with gene clusters of P. putida strains IsoF and WCS358. Strains with mutations in ppuI and ppuR showed a severe reduction of putisolvin production. Expression analysis of the putisolvin biosynthetic gene in a ppuI background showed decreased expression, which could be complemented by the addition of synthetic 3-oxo-C(10)-N-acyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(10)-AHL) or 3-oxo-C(12)-AHL to the medium. An rsaL mutant overproduces AHLs, and production of putisolvins is induced early during growth. Analysis of biofilm formation on polyvinylchloride showed that ppuI and ppuR mutants produce a denser biofilm than PCL1445, which correlates with decreased production of putisolvins, whereas an rsaL mutant shows a delay in biofilm production, which correlates with early production of putisolvins. The results demonstrate that quorum-sensing signals induce the production of cyclic lipopeptides putisolvin I and II and consequently control biofilm formation by Pseudomonas putida.	1
Title: Cochinmicins, novel and potent cyclodepsipeptide endothelin antagonists from a Microbispora sp. II. Structure determination Abstract: Cochinmicins I, II, and III are competitive endothelin antagonists produced by Microbispora sp. ATCC 55140. The cochinmicins are cyclic depsipeptides containing six alpha-amino acids and a pyrrolecarboxylic acid. Based upon MS, 1D and 2D NMR, and LC data, the structures and absolute stereochemistries of the cochinmicins have been assigned. All three components have the same basic sequence and contain one equivalent each of D-allo-threonine, D-alanine, L-phenylalanine, D-phenylalanine, 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (or pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid in cochinmicin I), plus two equivalents of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). The phenylalanine residues were differentiated via a methanolysis product which contained only one of the phenylalanine residues. Both DHPG residues have the D configuration in the more active cochinmicins I and III. Cochinmicin II contains both D- and L-DHPG and these residues have been differentiated in the sequence based upon 1H NMR data.	0
Title: Structure of the prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins biosynthesized from L-proline by a short pathway involving polyketide synthases. Proline is first loaded onto AnaD, an acyl carrier protein, and prolyl-AnaD is then oxidized to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD by a flavoprotein, AnaB. Three polyketide synthases then transform this imine into anatoxin-a or homoanatoxin-a. AnaB was crystallized in its holo form and its three-dimensional structure was determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.8 Å resolution. AnaB is a homotetramer and its fold is very similar to that of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs). The active-site base of AnaB, Glu244, superimposed very well with that of human isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, confirming previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments and mechanistic proposals. The substrate-binding site of AnaB is small and is likely to be fitted for the pyrrolidine ring of proline. However, in contrast to ACADs, which use an electron-transport protein, AnaB uses molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor, as in acyl-CoA oxidases. Calculation of the solvent-accessible surface area around the FAD in AnaB and in several homologues showed that it is significantly larger in AnaB than in its homologues. A protonated histidine near the FAD in AnaB is likely to participate in oxygen activation. Furthermore, an array of water molecules detected in the AnaB structure suggests a possible path for molecular oxygen towards FAD. This is consistent with AnaB being an oxidase rather than a dehydrogenase. The structure of AnaB is the first to be described for a prolyl-ACP oxidase and it will contribute to defining the structural basis responsible for oxygen reactivity in flavoenzymes.	1
Title: Functional analysis of a biosynthetic cluster essential for production of 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, a germination-arrest factor from Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 Abstract: Rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 produces the germination-arrest factor 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG). FVG has previously been shown to both arrest the germination of weedy grasses and inhibit the growth of the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Very little is known about the mechanism by which FVG is produced. Although a previous study identified a region of the genome that may be involved in FVG biosynthesis, it has not yet been determined which genes within that region are sufficient and necessary for FVG production. In the current study, we explored the role of each of the putative genes encoded in that region by constructing deletion mutations. Mutant strains were assayed for their ability to produce FVG with a combination of biological assays and TLC analyses. This work defined the core FVG biosynthetic gene cluster and revealed several interesting characteristics of FVG production. We determined that FVG biosynthesis requires two small ORFs of less than 150 nucleotides and that multiple transporters have overlapping but distinct functionality. In addition, two genes in the centre of the biosynthetic gene cluster are not required for FVG production, suggesting that additional products may be produced from the cluster. Transcriptional analysis indicated that at least three active promoters play a role in the expression of genes within this cluster. The results of this study enrich our knowledge regarding the diversity of mechanisms by which bacteria produce non-proteinogenic amino acids like vinylglycines.	1
Title: Inhibiting the protein ubiquitination cascade by ubiquitin-mimicking short peptides Abstract: Short heptapeptides were identified to function as ubiquitin (UB) mimics that are activated by E1 and form thioester conjugates with E1, E2, and HECT type E3 enzymes. The activities (k(cat)/K(1/2)) of E1 with the UB-mimicking peptides are 130-1,400-fold higher than the equally long peptide with the native C-terminal sequence of UB. By forming covalent conjugates with E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the UB-mimicking peptides can block the transfer of native UB through the cascade.	0
Title: Characterization of the Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 29050 genes encoding doxorubicin polyketide synthase Abstract: The dps genes of Streptomyces peucetius, encoding daunorubicin (DNR)-doxorubicin (DXR) polyketide synthase (PKS), are largely within an 8.7-kb region of DNA that has been characterized by Southern analysis, and gene sequencing, mutagenesis and expression experiments. This region contains nine ORFs, many of whose predicted products are homologous to known PKS enzymes. Surprisingly, the gene encoding the DXR PKS acyl carrier protein is not in this region, but is located about 10 kb distant from the position it usually occupies in other gene clusters encoding type-II PKS. An in-frame deletion in the dpsB gene, encoding a putative subunit of the DXR PKS, resulted in loss of production of DXR and the known intermediates of its biosynthetic pathway, confirming that this gene and, by implication, the adjacent dps genes are required for DXR biosynthesis. This was verified by expression of the dps genes in the heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, which resulted in the production of aklanonic acid, an early intermediate of DXR biosynthesis.	1
Title: Novel Methoxymethacrylate Natural Products Uncovered by Statistics-Based Mining of the Myxococcus fulvus Secondary Metabolome Abstract: This study reports the uncovering of new myxobacterial natural products through comprehensive analysis of the Myxococcus fulvus secondary metabolome. Statistics-based mining of mass spectrometry data paved the way for full structure elucidation of two new secondary metabolites named fulvuthiacene A and B, and investigation of the underlying biosynthetic pathway revealed an evolutionary link between the fulvuthiacene hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster and the related myxothiazol and melithiazol assembly lines. Detailed characterization of the post-PKS modification enzyme cascade responsible for the fulvuthiacenes' terminal β-methoxy-methyl acrylate moiety was pursued by heterologous expression of these enzymes in the myxothiazol producer Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1. The discovery of fulvuthiacenes provides new insights into the overall structure-activity relationship picture for the β-methoxyacrylate class of respiratory chain inhibitors and might thus serve as starting point for the development of next-generation β-methoxymethacrylate fungicides.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and role in virulence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depudecin from Alternaria brassicicola Abstract: Depudecin, an eleven-carbon linear polyketide made by the pathogenic fungus Alternaria brassicicola, is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). A chemically unrelated HDAC inhibitor, HC toxin, was earlier shown to be a major virulence factor in the interaction between Cochliobolus carbonum and its host, maize. In order to test whether depudecin is also a virulence factor for A. brassicicola, we identified the genes for depudecin biosynthesis and created depudecin-minus mutants. The depudecin gene cluster contains six genes (DEP1 to DEP6), which are predicted to encode a polyketide synthase (AbPKS9 or DEP5), a transcription factor (DEP6), two monooxygenases (DEP2 and DEP4), a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (DEP3), and one protein of unknown function (DEP1). The involvement in depudecin production of DEP2, DEP4, DEP5, and DEP6 was demonstrated by targeted gene disruption. DEP6 is required for expression of DEP1 through DEP5 but not the immediate flanking genes, thus defining a coregulated depudecin biosynthetic cluster. The genes flanking the depudecin gene cluster but not the cluster itself are conserved in the same order in the related fungi Stagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Depudecin-minus mutants have a small (10%) but statistically significant reduction in virulence on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) but not on Arabidopsis. The role of depudecin in virulence is, therefore, less dramatic than that of HC toxin.	1
Title: Fusarin C biosynthesis in Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum Abstract: Fragments of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) of the fusarin C producing filamentous fungi Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum by using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to select for fungal PKS C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domains. The PCR products, which were highly homologous to fragments of known fungal PKS CMeT domains, were used to probe cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries of F. moniliforme and F. venenatum. A 4.0 kb cDNA clone from F. venenatum was isolated and used to prepare a hygromycin-resistance knockout cassette, which was used to produce a fusarin-deficient strain of F. venenatum (kb = 1000 bp). Similarly, a 26 kb genomic fragment, isolated on two overlapping clones from F. moniliforme, encoded a complete iterative Type I PKS fused to an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthase module. Once again, targeted gene disruption produced a fusarin-deficient strain, thereby proving that this synthase is responsible for the first steps of fusarin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of genes for dimethyl sulfide production in bacteria in the gut of Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus) Abstract: Phytoplankton are the primary producers of the sulfur-containing compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). These cells are consumed by mesozooplankton, which, in turn, may be eaten by marine vertebrates. From the gut of one such animal, the Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, we isolated strains of the gamma-proteobacteria Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter that grew on DMSP as sole carbon source, and which produced the environmentally important sulfurous volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS). In both bacterial genera, this ability was because of the previously identified gene dddD, which specifies an enzyme that liberates DMS from DMSP. DMS production was stimulated by pre-growth of cells on the substrate DMSP. This is the first identification of DMSP-degrading bacteria and their relevant genes in the gut microflora of any vertebrate.	1
Title: The stress response protein Gls24 is induced by copper and interacts with the CopZ copper chaperone of Enterococcus hirae Abstract: Intracellular copper routing in Enterococcus hirae is accomplished by the CopZ copper chaperone. Under copper stress, CopZ donates Cu(+) to the CopY repressor, thereby releasing its bound zinc and abolishing repressor-DNA interaction. This in turn induces the expression of the cop operon, which encodes CopY and CopZ, in addition to two copper ATPases, CopA and CopB. To gain further insight into the function of CopZ, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins interacting with the copper chaperone. This led to the identification of Gls24, a member of a family of stress response proteins. Gls24 is part of an operon containing eight genes. The operon was induced by a range of stress conditions, but most notably by copper. Gls24 was overexpressed and purified, and was shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis to also interact with CopZ in vitro. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that Gls24 is partially unstructured. The current findings establish a novel link between Gls24 and copper homeostasis.	0
Title: Inheritance and genetic mapping of resistance to Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici in Lycopersicon pennellii Abstract: The fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici produces AAL-toxins that function as chemical determinants of the Alternaria stem canker disease in the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). In resistant cultivars, the disease is controlled by the Asc locus on chromosome 3. Our aim was to characterize novel sources of resistance to the fungus and of insensitivity to the host-selective AAL-toxins. To that end, the degree of sensitivity of wild tomato species to AAL-toxins was analyzed. Of all members of the genus Lycopersicon, only L. cheesmanii was revealed to be sensitive to AAL-toxins and susceptible to fungal infection. Besides moderately insensitive responses from some species, L. pennellii and L. peruvianum were shown to be highly insensitive to AAL-toxins as well as resistant to the pathogen. Genetic analyses showed that high insensitivity to AAL-toxins from L. pennellii is inherited in tomato as a single complete dominant locus. This is in contrast to the incomplete dominance of insensitivity to AAL-toxins of L. esculentum. Subsequent classical genetics, RFLP mapping and allelic testing indicated that high insensitivity to AAL-toxins from L. pennellii is conferred by a new allele of the Asc locus.	0
Title: Construction of alkyl-substituted pentaphosphido ligands in the coordination sphere of cobalt Abstract: Rare mono- and diorganopentaphosphido cobalt complexes are accessible by P-P condensation using the unprecedented, reactive cobalt-gallium tetraphosphido complex [K(dme)2{(MesBIAN)Co(μ-η4:η2-P4)Ga(nacnac)}] (2). Compound 2 was prepared in good yield by reaction of [K(Et2O){(MesBIAN)Co(η4-1,5-cod)}] [1, BIAN = bis(mesitylimino)acenaphthene diimine, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene] with [Ga(nacnac)(η2-P4)] (nacnac = CH[CMeN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)]2). Reactions with R2PCl (R = iPr, tBu, and Cy) selectively afford [(MesBIAN)Co(cyclo-P5R2)] (3a-c), which feature η4-coordinated 1,1-diorganopentaphosphido ligands. The mechanism of formation of these species has been studied by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. In the case of 3a (R = iPr), it was possible to identify the intermediate [(MesBIAN)Co(μ-η4:η2-P5iPr2)Ga(nacnac)] (4) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A related, monosubstituted organopentaphosphido cobalt complex [(MesBIAN)Co(μ-η4:η1-P5 tBu)GaCl(nacnac)] (5) was isolated by reacting dichloroalkylphosphane tBuPCl2 with 2. Heterobimetallic complexes such as 2 thus may enable the targeted construction of a range of new metal-coordinated polyphosphorus frameworks by P-P condensation.	0
Title: Single Amino Acid Variation Underlies Species-Specific Sensitivity to Amphibian Skin-Derived Opioid-like Peptides Abstract: It has been suggested that the evolution of vertebrate opioid receptors (ORs) follow a vector of increased functionality. Here, we test this idea by comparing human and frog ORs. Interestingly, some of the most potent opioid peptides known have been isolated from amphibian skin secretions. Here we show that such peptides (dermorphin and deltorphin) are highly potent in the human receptors and inactive in frog ORs. The molecular basis for the insensitivity of the frog ORs to these peptides was studied using chimeras and molecular modeling. The insensitivity of the delta OR (DOR) to deltorphin was due to variation of a single amino acid, Trp7.35, which is a leucine in mammalian DORs. Notably, Trp7.35 is completely conserved in all known DOR sequences from lamprey, fish, and amphibians. The deltorphin-insensitive phenotype was verified in fish. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the species selectivity of skin-derived opioid peptides.	0

Title: Insights into the bioactivity of mensacarcin and epoxide formation by MsnO8 Abstract: Mensacarcin, a potential antitumour drug, is produced by Streptomyces bottropensis. The structure consists of a three-membered ring system with many oxygen atoms. Of vital importance in this context is an epoxy moiety in the side chain of mensacarcin. Our studies with different mensacarcin derivatives have demonstrated that this epoxy group is primarily responsible for the cytotoxic effect of mensacarcin. In order to obtain further information about this epoxy moiety, inactivation experiments in the gene cluster were carried out to identify the epoxy-forming enzyme. Therefore the cosmid cos2, which covers almost the complete type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster, was heterologously expressed in Streptomyces albus. This led to production of didesmethylmensacarcin, due to the fact that methyltransferase genes are missing in the cosmid. Further gene inactivation experiments on this cosmid showed that MsnO8, a luciferase-like monooxygenase, introduces the epoxy group at the end of the biosynthesis of mensacarcin. In addition, the protein MsnO8 was purified, and its crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 1.80 Å.	1
Title: Analysis of the ambruticin and jerangolid gene clusters of Sorangium cellulosum reveals unusual mechanisms of polyketide biosynthesis Abstract: Ambruticins and jerangolids are structurally related antifungal polyketides produced by Sorangium cellulosum strains. Comparative analysis of the gene clusters and characterization of compounds produced by gene knockout strains suggested hypothetical schemes for biosynthesis of these compounds. Polyketide synthase (PKS) architecture suggests that the pyran ring structure common to ambruticins and jerangolids forms by an intramolecular reaction on a PKS-bound intermediate. Disrupting ambM, encoding a discrete enzyme homologous to PKS C-methyltransferase domains, gave 15-desmethylambruticins. Thus, AmbM is required for C-methylation, but not pyran ring formation. Several steps in the post-PKS modification of ambruticin involve new enzymology. Remarkably, the methylcyclopropane ring and putative carbon atom excision during ambruticin biosynthesis apparently occur on the PKS assembly line. The mechanism probably involves a Favorskii rearrangement, but further work is required to elucidate these complex events.	1
Title: Chemoproteomic Strategy to Quantitatively Monitor Transnitrosation Uncovers Functionally Relevant S-Nitrosation Sites on Cathepsin D and HADH2 Abstract: S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous transnitrosation donor involved in S-nitrosation of a variety of cellular proteins, thereby regulating diverse protein functions. Quantitative proteomic methods are necessary to establish which cysteine residues are most sensitive to GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Here, a competitive cysteine-reactivity profiling strategy was implemented to quantitatively measure the sensitivity of >600 cysteine residues to transnitrosation by GSNO. This platform identified a subset of cysteine residues with a high propensity for GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Functional characterization of previously unannotated S-nitrosation sites revealed that S-nitrosation of a cysteine residue distal to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2) active site impaired catalytic activity. Similarly, S-nitrosation of a non-catalytic cysteine residue in the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin D (CTSD) inhibited proteolytic activation. Together, these studies revealed two previously uncharacterized cysteine residues that regulate protein function, and established a chemical-proteomic platform with capabilities to determine substrate specificity of other cellular transnitrosation agents.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of Catenulispora acidiphila type strain (ID 139908) Abstract: Catenulispora acidiphila Busti et al. 2006 is the type species of the genus Catenulispora, and is of interest because of the rather isolated phylogenetic location it occupies within the scarcely explored suborder Catenulisporineae of the order Actinomycetales. C. acidiphilia is known for its acidophilic, aerobic lifestyle, but can also grow scantly under anaerobic conditions. Under regular conditions, C. acidiphilia grows in long filaments of relatively short aerial hyphae with marked septation. It is a free living, non motile, Gram-positive bacterium isolated from a forest soil sample taken from a wooded area in Gerenzano, Italy. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of the actinobacterial family Catenulisporaceae, and the 10,467,782 bp long single replicon genome with its 9056 protein-coding and 69 RNA genes is a part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.	1
Title: Automated image analysis for quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization with environmental samples Abstract: When fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses are performed with complex environmental samples, difficulties related to the presence of microbial cell aggregates and nonuniform background fluorescence are often encountered. The objective of this study was to develop a robust and automated quantitative FISH method for complex environmental samples, such as manure and soil. The method and duration of sample dispersion were optimized to reduce the interference of cell aggregates. An automated image analysis program that detects cells from 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) micrographs and extracts the maximum and mean fluorescence intensities for each cell from corresponding FISH images was developed with the software Visilog. Intensity thresholds were not consistent even for duplicate analyses, so alternative ways of classifying signals were investigated. In the resulting method, the intensity data were divided into clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering, and the resulting clusters were classified as target (positive) or nontarget (negative). A manual quality control confirmed this classification. With this method, 50.4, 72.1, and 64.9% of the cells in two swine manure samples and one soil sample, respectively, were positive as determined with a 16S rRNA-targeted bacterial probe (S-D-Bact-0338-a-A-18). Manual counting resulted in corresponding values of 52.3, 70.6, and 61.5%, respectively. In two swine manure samples and one soil sample 21.6, 12.3, and 2.5% of the cells were positive with an archaeal probe (S-D-Arch-0915-a-A-20), respectively. Manual counting resulted in corresponding values of 22.4, 14.0, and 2.9%, respectively. This automated method should facilitate quantitative analysis of FISH images for a variety of complex environmental samples.	0
Title: High throughput assay to detect compounds that enhance the proton permeability of Candida albicans membranes Abstract: We describe a 96-well microtiter plate format assay to detect changes in proton permeability in membranes of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans. Candida albicans cells were incubated with the lipophilic ester of 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), a pH-sensitive fluorescein derivative. Inside the cells, BCECF was released and trapped in the vacuole. Compounds that destroyed membrane integrity increased the pH value of the vacuole due to proton leakage into the cytoplasm. This was paralleled by an increase in BCECF fluorescence intensity, which could be quantified. The test assay was validated with amphotericin B, as well as with other membrane-active compounds known to increase membrane permeability. Possible applications and limitations of this assay in the field of antifungal drug discovery are discussed.	0
Title: Importance of Marine-Derived Nutrients Supplied by Planktivorous Seabirds to High Arctic Tundra Plant Communities Abstract: We studied the relative importance of several environmental factors for tundra plant communities in five locations across Svalbard (High Arctic) that differed in geographical location, oceanographic and climatic influence, and soil characteristics. The amount of marine-derived nitrogen in the soil supplied by seabirds was locally the most important of the studied environmental factors influencing the tundra plant community. We found a strong positive correlation between δ15N isotopic values and total N content in the soil, confirming the fundamental role of marine-derived matter to the generally nutrient-poor Arctic tundra ecosystem. We also recorded a strong correlation between the δ15N values of soil and of the tissues of vascular plants and mosses, but not of lichens. The relationship between soil δ15N values and vascular plant cover was linear. In the case of mosses, the percentage ground cover reached maximum around a soil δ 15N value of 8‰, as did plant community diversity. This soil δ15N value clearly separated the occurrence of plants with low nitrogen tolerance (e.g. Salix polaris) from those predominating on high N content soils (e.g. Cerastium arcticum, Poa alpina). Large colonies of planktivorous little auks have a great influence on Arctic tundra vegetation, either through enhancing plant abundance or in shaping plant community composition at a local scale.	0
Title: Two Fis regulators directly repress the expression of numerous effector-encoding genes in Legionella pneumophila Abstract: Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular human pathogen that utilizes the Icm/Dot type IVB secretion system to translocate a large repertoire of effectors into host cells. For most of these effectors, there is no information regarding their regulation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the three L. pneumophila Fis homologs in the regulation of effector-encoding genes. Deletion mutants constructed in the genes encoding the three Fis regulators revealed that Fis1 (lpg0542 gene) and Fis3 (lpg1743) but not Fis2 (lpg1370) are partially required for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in Acanthamoeba castellanii. To identify pathogenesis-related genes directly regulated by Fis, we established a novel in vivo system which resulted in the discovery of numerous effector-encoding genes directly regulated by Fis. Further examination of these genes revealed that Fis1 and Fis3 repress the level of expression of effector-encoding genes during exponential phase. Three groups of effector-encoding genes were identified: (i) effectors regulated mainly by Fis1, (ii) effectors regulated mainly by Fis3, and (iii) effectors regulated by both Fis1 and Fis3. Examination of the upstream regulatory region of all of these effector-encoding genes revealed multiple putative Fis regulatory elements, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that a few of these sites constitute part of a repressor binding element. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the direct relation between the Fis1 and Fis3 regulators and these regulatory elements. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that two of the three L. pneumophila Fis regulators directly repress the expression of Icm/Dot effector-encoding genes.	0
Title: Synthesis of a peripherally conjugated 5-6-7 nanographene Abstract: A heteroaromatic nanographene containing a unique assembly of five-, six- and seven-membered rings is synthesized using oxidative coupling of an indole-containing precursor. Near-infrared absorption and emission properties of the nanographene core are enhanced by peripheral expansion and ring fusion at all oxidation levels. The dicationic state shows distinct aromaticity originating from a peripheral π-conjugated circuit. A partially coupled intermediate, trapped in the synthesis of the 5-6-7 nanographene, is explored as a reference system, showing an unexpected reduction of the optical band gap due to intramolecular charge transfer.	0
Title: Merocyclophanes C and D from the Cultured Freshwater Cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (UIC 10110) Abstract: Merocyclophanes C and D (1 and 2) were isolated from the cell extract of the cultured cyanobacterium UIC 10110. The structures were determined by one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and confirmed by 2D NMR techniques. The absolute configurations were determined using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Merocyclophanes C and D represent the first known analogues of the merocyclophane core structure, a recently discovered scaffold of [7,7] paracyclophanes characterized by an α-branched methyl at C-1/C-14; 1 and 2 showed antiproliferative activity against the MDA-MB-435 cell line with IC50 values of 1.6 and 0.9 μM, respectively. Partial 16S analysis determined UIC 10110 to be a Nostoc sp., and it was found to clade with UIC 10062 Nostoc sp., the only other strain known to produce merocyclophanes. The genome of UIC 10110 was sequenced, and a biosynthetic gene cluster was identified that is proposed to encode type I and type III polyketide synthases that are potentially responsible for production of the merocyclophanes; however, further experiments will be required to verify the true function of the gene cluster. The gene cluster provides a genetic basis for the observed structural differences of the [7,7] paracyclophane core structures.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of meridamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30748 Abstract: Meridamycin is a non-immunosuppressive, FKBP12-binding natural macrolide with potential therapeutic applications in a variety of medical conditions. To set the stage for structural modification of meridamycin by genetic engineering, we have cloned and completely sequenced approximately 117 kb of DNA encompassing the meridamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from the producing strain, Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30748. Clustered in the center of the cloned DNA stretch are six genes responsible for the construction of the core structure of meridamycin, including merP encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthase for pipecolate-incorporation, four PKS genes (merA-D) together encoding 1 loading module and 14 extension modules, and merE encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. A number of genes with potential pathway-specific regulatory or resistance functions have also been identified. The absence of the gene encoding lysine cyclodeaminase in the sequenced gene cluster and the rest of the genome of NRRL 30748 indicated the synthesis of pipecolate in this strain is not through the common lysine cyclodeamination route previously described for rapamycin and FK506/FK520 biosynthesis. An efficient conjugation method has been developed for Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30748 to facilitate the genetic manipulation of meridamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Disruption of merP resulted in the complete abolition of meridamycin production, proving the identity of the gene cluster. A novel meridamycin analogue, C36-keto-meridamycin, has been successfully generated through deletion of a DNA fragment encoding KR1 domain of MerA from the chromosomal DNA.	1
Title: Engineered biosynthesis of a novel amidated polyketide, using the malonamyl-specific initiation module from the oxytetracycline polyketide synthase Abstract: Tetracyclines are aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by bacterial type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Understanding the biochemistry of tetracycline PKSs is an important step toward the rational and combinatorial manipulation of tetracycline biosynthesis. To this end, we have sequenced the gene cluster of oxytetracycline (oxy and otc genes) PKS genes from Streptomyces rimosus. Sequence analysis revealed a total of 21 genes between the otrA and otrB resistance genes. We hypothesized that an amidotransferase, OxyD, synthesizes the malonamate starter unit that is a universal building block for tetracycline compounds. In vivo reconstitution using strain CH999 revealed that the minimal PKS and OxyD are necessary and sufficient for the biosynthesis of amidated polyketides. A novel alkaloid (WJ35, or compound 2) was synthesized as the major product when the oxy-encoded minimal PKS, the C-9 ketoreductase (OxyJ), and OxyD were coexpressed in CH999. WJ35 is an isoquinolone compound derived from an amidated decaketide backbone and cyclized with novel regioselectivity. The expression of OxyD with a heterologous minimal PKS did not afford similarly amidated polyketides, suggesting that the oxy-encoded minimal PKS possesses novel starter unit specificity.	1
Title: Milk protein fragments induce the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 Abstract: The aim of the present work was to study the mode of the induction of the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of alpha(S1)- and beta-casein as well as beta-lactoglobulin. The chemically synthesized alpha(S1)-casein fragment 37-55 (2,253.65 Da) was proven to be able to induce macedocin biosynthesis. This is the first time that milk protein degradation fragments are reported to exhibit a bacteriocin induction activity.	1
Title: Total Synthesis of (+)-Arborisidine Abstract: The first total synthesis of arborisidine, a unique Kopsia indole alkaloid possessing a fully substituted cyclohexanone ring system with two quaternary carbons, has been achieved in seven steps in racemic format from tryptamine and in nine steps in asymmetric format from d-tryptophan methyl ester. Key elements of the design include a carefully orchestrated decyanation protocol to finalize the asymmetric formation of an aza-quaternary center that is challenging to access in optically active format via direct Pictet-Spengler cyclizations with tryptamine, a metal-promoted 6- endo-dig cyclization of an enyne to establish the second core quaternary center, and regiospecific functionalizations of the resultant complex diene to finalize the target structure. The distinct and efficient nature of the developed solution is highlighted by several unsuccessful approaches and unexpected rearrangements.	0
Title: Alternative Biosynthetic Starter Units Enhance the Structural Diversity of Cyanobacterial Lipopeptides Abstract: Puwainaphycins (PUWs) and minutissamides (MINs) are structurally analogous cyclic lipopeptides possessing cytotoxic activity. Both types of compound exhibit high structural variability, particularly in the fatty acid (FA) moiety. Although a biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for synthesis of several PUW variants has been proposed in a cyanobacterial strain, the genetic background for MINs remains unexplored. Herein, we report PUW/MIN biosynthetic gene clusters and structural variants from six cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of biosynthetic gene clusters indicates a common origin of the PUW/MIN hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase. Surprisingly, the biosynthetic gene clusters encode two alternative biosynthetic starter modules, and analysis of structural variants suggests that initiation by each of the starter modules results in lipopeptides of differing lengths and FA substitutions. Among additional modifications of the FA chain, chlorination of minutissamide D was explained by the presence of a putative halogenase gene in the PUW/MIN gene cluster of Anabaena minutissima strain UTEX B 1613. We detected PUW variants bearing an acetyl substitution in Symplocastrum muelleri strain NIVA-CYA 644, consistent with an O-acetyltransferase gene in its biosynthetic gene cluster. The major lipopeptide variants did not exhibit any significant antibacterial activity, and only the PUW F variant was moderately active against yeast, consistent with previously published data suggesting that PUWs/MINs interact preferentially with eukaryotic plasma membranes.IMPORTANCE Herein, we deciphered the most important biosynthetic traits of a prominent group of bioactive lipopeptides. We reveal evidence for initiation of biosynthesis by two alternative starter units hardwired directly in the same gene cluster, eventually resulting in the production of a remarkable range of lipopeptide variants. We identified several unusual tailoring genes potentially involved in modifying the fatty acid chain. Careful characterization of these biosynthetic gene clusters and their diverse products could provide important insight into lipopeptide biosynthesis in prokaryotes. Some of the variants identified exhibit cytotoxic and antifungal properties, and some are associated with a toxigenic biofilm-forming strain. The findings may prove valuable to researchers in the fields of natural product discovery and toxicology.	1
Title: A cellulolytic fungal biofilm enhances the consolidated bioconversion of cellulose to short chain fatty acids by the rumen microbiome Abstract: The ability of the multispecies biofilm membrane reactors (MBM reactors) to provide distinguished niches for aerobic and anaerobic microbes at the same time was used for the investigation of the consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). A consortium based consolidated bioprocess (CBP) was designed. The rumen microbiome was used as the converting microbial consortium, co-cultivated with selected individual aerobic fungi which formed a biofilm on the tubular membrane flushed with oxygen. The beneficial effect of the fungal biofilm on the process yields and productivities was attributed to the enhanced cellulolytic activities compared with those achieved by the rumen microbiome alone. At 30 °C, the MBM system with Trichoderma reesei biofilm reached a concentration 39% higher (7.3 g/L SCFAs), than the rumen microbiome alone (5.1 g/L) using 15 g/L crystalline cellulose as the substrate. Fermentation temperature was crucial especially for the composition of the short chain fatty acids produced. The temperature increase resulted in shorter fatty acids produced. While a mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric, and caproic acids was produced at 30 °C with Trichoderma reesei biofilm, butyric and caproic acids were not detected during the fermentations at 37.5 °C carried out with Coprinopsis cinerea as the biofilm forming fungus. Apart from the presence of the fungal biofilm, no parameter studied had a significant impact on the total yield of organic acids produced, which reached 0.47 g of total SCFAs per g of cellulose (at 30 °C and at pH 6, with rumen inoculum to total volume ratio equal to 0.372).	0
Title: A new strategy for aromatic ring alkylation in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis Abstract: Alkylation of aromatic rings with alkyl halides is an important transformation in organic synthesis, yet an enzymatic equivalent is unknown. Here, we report that cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis in Cylindrospermum licheniforme ATCC 29412 involves chlorination of an unactivated carbon center by a novel halogenase, followed by a previously uncharacterized enzymatic dimerization reaction featuring sequential, stereospecific alkylations of resorcinol aromatic rings. Discovery of the enzymatic machinery underlying this unique biosynthetic carbon-carbon bond formation has implications for biocatalysis and metabolic engineering.	1
Title: Stelleralides D-J and Anti-HIV Daphnane Diterpenes from Stellera chamaejasme Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of a petroleum ether extract of the roots of Stellera chamaejasme led to the isolation of seven new (stelleralides D-J, 1-7) and 12 known (8-19) daphnane diterpenoids. The structures and relative configurations of 1-7 were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including HRESIMS and comprehensive NMR techniques. All isolates were evaluated for anti-HIV activity in MT4 cells. All compounds tested, except 2, showed anti-HIV activity, and, especially, five 1α-alkyldaphnane diterpenoids (3, 4, 5, 10, and 11) exhibited extremely potent anti-HIV activity, with EC50 values of 0.06-1.1 nM and selectivity index values of more than 10,000.	0
Title: Synthesis of 2-arylindole derivatives and evaluation as nitric oxide synthase and NFκB inhibitors Abstract: Development of small molecule drug-like inhibitors blocking both nitric oxide synthase and NFκB could offer a synergistic therapeutic approach in the prevention and treatment of inflammation and cancer. During the course of evaluating the biological potential of a commercial compound library, 2-phenylindole (1) displayed inhibitory activity against nitrite production and NFκB with IC(50) values of 38.1 ± 1.8 and 25.4 ± 2.1 μM, respectively. Based on this lead, synthesis and systematic optimization have been undertaken in an effort to find novel and more potent nitric oxide synthase and NFκB inhibitors with antiinflammatory and cancer preventive potential. First, chemical derivatizations of 1 and 2-phenylindole-3-carboxaldehyde (4) were performed to generate a panel of N-alkylated indoles and 3-oxime derivatives 2–7. Second, a series of diversified 2-arylindole derivatives (10) were synthesized from an array of substituted 2-iodoanilines (8) and terminal alkynes (9) by applying a one-pot palladium catalyzed Sonogashira-type alkynylation and base-assisted cycloaddition. Subsequent biological evaluations revealed 3-carboxaldehyde oxime and cyano substituted 2-phenylindoles 5 and 7 exhibited the strongest nitrite inhibitory activities (IC(50) = 4.4 ± 0.5 and 4.8 ± 0.4 μM, respectively); as well as NFκB inhibition (IC(50) = 6.9 ± 0.8 and 8.5 ± 2.0 μM, respectively). In addition, the 6′-MeO-naphthalen-2′-yl indole derivative 10at displayed excellent inhibitory activity against NFκB with an IC(50) value of 0.6 ± 0.2 μM.	0
Title: Transcriptional regulation of the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin is a gyrase inhibitor formed by a Streptomyces strain. The biosynthetic gene cluster of novobiocin spans 23.4 kb and contains 20 coding sequences, among them the two regulatory genes novE and novG. We investigated the location of transcriptional promoters within this cluster by insertion of transcriptional terminator cassettes and RT-PCR analysis of the resulting mutants. The cluster was found to contain eight DNA regions with promoter activity. The regulatory protein NovG binds to a previously identified binding site within the promoter region located upstream of novH, but apparently not to any of the other seven promoters. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare the number of transcripts in a strain carrying an intact novobiocin cluster with strains carrying mutated clusters. Both in-frame deletion of the regulatory gene novG and insertion of a terminator cassette into the biosynthetic gene novH led to a strong reduction of the number of transcripts of the genes located between novH and novW. This suggested that these 16 biosynthetic genes form a single operon. Three internal promoters are located within this operon but appear to be of minor importance, if any, under our experimental conditions. Transcription of novG was found to depend on the presence of NovE, suggesting that the two regulatory genes, novE and novG, act in a cascade-like mechanism. The resistance gene gyrB(R), encoding an aminocoumarin-resistant gyrase B subunit, may initially be co-transcribed with the genes from novH to novW. However, when the gyrase inhibitor novobiocin accumulates in the cultures, gyrB(R) is transcribed from its own promoter. Previous work has suggested that this promoter is controlled by the superhelical density of chromosomal DNA.	1
Title: Metal ions binding to recA inteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Abstract: Zinc has been found in the crystal structures of inteins and the zinc ion can inhibit intein splicing both in vitro and in vivo. The interactions between metal ions and three minimized recA inteins have been studied in this work. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results show that the zinc binding affinity to three inteins is in the order of DeltaI-SM > DeltaDeltaI(hh)-SM approximately DeltaDeltaI(hh)-CM, but is much weaker than to EDTA. These data explain the reversible inhibition and the presence of zinc only in the crystal structure of DeltaI-SM of recA intein. A positive correlation between binding constants and inhibition efficiency was observed upon the titration of different metal ions. Single-site binding modes were detected in all interactions, except DeltaDeltaI(hh)-CM which has two Zn sites. Zinc binding sites on DeltaDeltaI(hh)-CM were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and ITC titration on inteins with chemical modifications. Results indicate that the Cys1 and His73 are the second zinc binding sites in DeltaDeltaI(hh)-CM. CD studies show the metal coordinations have negligible influence on protein structure. This work suggests that the mobility restriction of key residues from metal coordination is likely the key cause of metal inhibition of intein splicing.	0
Title: Engineering the substrate specificity of the DhbE adenylation domain by yeast cell surface display Abstract: The adenylation (A) domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) activate aryl acids or amino acids to launch their transfer through the NRPS assembly line for the biosynthesis of many medicinally important natural products. In order to expand the substrate pool of NRPSs, we developed a method based on yeast cell surface display to engineer the substrate specificities of the A-domains. We acquired A-domain mutants of DhbE that have 11- and 6-fold increases in k(cat)/K(m) with nonnative substrates 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-aminobenzoic acid, respectively and corresponding 3- and 33-fold decreases in k(cat)/K(m) values with the native substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, resulting in a dramatic switch in substrate specificity of up to 200-fold. Our study demonstrates that yeast display can be used as a high throughput selection platform to reprogram the "nonribosomal code" of A-domains.	0
Title: Cloning of genes governing the deoxysugar portion of the erythromycin biosynthesis pathway in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) Abstract: Genes that govern the formation of deoxysugars or their attachment to erythronolide B and 3 alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, intermediates of the biosynthesis of the 14-membered macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, were cloned from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreus). Segments of DNA that complement the eryB25, eryB26, eryB46, eryC1-60, and eryD24 mutations blocking the formation of erythronolide B or 3 alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, when cloned in Escherichia coli-Streptomyces shuttle cosmids or plasmid vectors that can transform S. erythraea, were located in a ca. 18-kilobase-pair region upstream of the erythromycin resistance (ermE) gene. The eryC1 gene lies just to the 5' side of ermE, and one (or possibly two) eryB gene is approximately 12 kilobase pairs farther upstream. Another eryB gene may be in the same region, while an additional eryB mutation appears to be located elsewhere. The eryD gene lies between the eryB and eryC1 genes and may regulate their function on the basis of the phenotype of an EryD- mutant.	1
Title: Immunological relationships among some species of extremely halophilic bacteria Abstract: Rabbits were immunized with four strains of halobacteria, Halobacterium halobium NRL, H. halobium R-1, H. salinarium NRL-9, and H. cutirubrum NRL-10, that had been fixed with formaldehyde. The antisera obtained detected the presence of an antigen common to the Halobacterium genus and, after absorption, detected three distinct antigenic groups within the Halobacterium genus. A fourth group was agglutinated only by unabsorbed sera.	0
Title: A methyltransferase initiates terpene cyclization in teleocidin B biosynthesis Abstract: Teleocidin B is an indole terpenoid isolated from Streptomyces. Due to its unique chemical structure and ability to activate protein kinase C, it has attracted interest in the areas of organic chemistry and cell biology. Here, we report the identification of genes encoding enzymes for teleocidin B biosynthesis, including nonribosomal peptide synthetase (tleA), P-450 monooxygenase (tleB), prenyltransferase (tleC), and methyltransferase (tleD). The tleD gene, which is located outside of the tleABC cluster on the chromosome, was identified by transcriptional analysis and heterologous expression. Remarkably, TleD not only installs a methyl group on the geranyl moiety of the precursor but also facilitates the nucleophilic attack from the electron-rich indole to the resultant cation, to form the indole-fused six-membered ring. This is the first demonstration of a cation, generated from methylation, triggering successive terpenoid ring closure.	1
Title: Australia antigen as a marker of propagation of the serum hepatitis virus in liver cultures Abstract: ATTEMPTS to isolate the human hepatitis viruses in tissue culture have resulted in a collection of “hepatitis-candidate” viruses, none of which has since been shown to be the causal agent of human hepatitis1. The discovery of Australia antigen provided a specific serological marker of infection with or carriage of the serum hepatitis virus, although the nature of the antigen remains unsettled2.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of deoxy-polyamine in Xenorhabdus bovienii Abstract: Polyamine moieties have been described as part of the fabclavine and zeamine family of natural products. While the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters have been found in many different proteobacteria, a unique BGC was identified in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii. Mass spectrometric analysis of a X. bovienii mutant strain revealed a new deoxy-polyamine. The corresponding biosynthesis includes two additional reductive steps, initiated by an additional dehydratase (DH) domain, which was not found in any other Xenorhabdus strain. Moreover, this DH domain could be successfully integrated into homologous biosynthesis pathways, leading to the formation of other deoxy-polyamines. Additional heterologous production experiments revealed that the DH domain could act in cis as well as in trans.	0
Title: Role of hydrophilic residues in proton transfer during catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase II Abstract: Catalysis by the zinc metalloenzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) is limited in maximal velocity by proton transfer between His64 and the zinc-bound solvent molecule. Asn62 extends into the active site cavity of HCA II adjacent to His64 and has been shown to be one of several hydrophilic residues participating in a hydrogen-bonded solvent network within the active site. We compared several site-specific mutants of HCA II with replacements at position 62 (Ala, Val, Leu, Thr, and Asp). The efficiency of catalysis in the hydration of CO 2 for the resulting mutants has been characterized by (18)O exchange, and the structures of the mutants have been determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.5-1.7 A resolution. Each of these mutants maintained the ordered water structure observed by X-ray crystallography in the active site cavity of wild-type HCA II; hence, this water structure was not a variable in comparing with wild type the activities of mutants at residue 62. Crystal structures of wild-type and N62T HCA II showed both an inward and outward orientation of the side chain of His64; however, other mutants in this study showed predominantly inward (N62A, N62V, N62L) or predominantly outward (N62D) orientations of His64. A significant role of Asn62 in HCA II is to permit two conformations of the side chain of His64, the inward and outward, that contributes to maximal efficiency of proton transfer between the active site and solution. The site-specific mutant N62D had a mainly outward orientation of His64, yet the difference in p K a between the proton donor His64 and zinc-bound hydroxide was near zero, as in wild-type HCA II. The rate of proton transfer in catalysis by N62D HCA II was 5% that of wild type, showing that His64 mainly in the outward orientation is associated with inefficient proton transfer compared with His64 in wild type which shows both inward and outward orientations. These results emphasize the roles of the residues of the hydrophilic side of the active site cavity in maintaining efficient catalysis by carbonic anhydrase.	0
Title: Characterization and evolution of an activator-independent methanol dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator N-1 Abstract: Methanol utilization by methylotrophic or non-methylotrophic organisms is the first step toward methanol bioconversion to higher carbon-chain chemicals. Methanol oxidation using NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) is of particular interest because it uses NAD(+) as the electron carrier. To our knowledge, only a limited number of NAD-dependent Mdhs have been reported. The most studied is the Bacillus methanolicus Mdh, which exhibits low enzyme specificity to methanol and is dependent on an endogenous activator protein (ACT). In this work, we characterized and engineered a group III NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (Mdh2) from Cupriavidus necator N-1 (previously designated as Ralstonia eutropha). This enzyme is the first NAD-dependent Mdh characterized from a Gram-negative, mesophilic, non-methylotrophic organism with a significant activity towards methanol. Interestingly, unlike previously reported Mdhs, Mdh2 does not require activation by known activators such as B. methanolicus ACT and Escherichia coli Nudix hydrolase NudF, or putative native C. necator activators in the Nudix family under mesophilic conditions. This enzyme exhibited higher or comparable activity and affinity toward methanol relative to the B. methanolicus Mdh with or without ACT in a wide range of temperatures. Furthermore, using directed molecular evolution, we engineered a variant (CT4-1) of Mdh2 that showed a 6-fold higher K cat/K m for methanol and 10-fold lower K cat/K m for n-butanol. Thus, CT4-1 represents an NAD-dependent Mdh with much improved catalytic efficiency and specificity toward methanol compared with the existing NAD-dependent Mdhs with or without ACT activation.	0
Title: Pharmacokinetics of cefetamet in plasma and skin blister fluid Abstract: Cefetamet pivoxil is an oral cephalosporin with enhanced affinity for the target penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 3 and an increased stability to beta-lactamases compared with older cephalosporins, such as cefalexin or cefaclor. The pharmacokinetics of cefetamet pivoxil was determined after the seventh and final dose of 500 mg of cefetamet pivoxil in eight healthy volunteers. Concentrations in plasma and cantharidin-induced skin blister fluid were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. In addition, protein binding was assessed. Cmax was 4.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml in skin blister fluid and 5.1 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml in plasma. Tmax was delayed in skin blister fluid compared with plasma (3.9 +/- 1 versus 2.8 +/- 0.8 h; P < 0.001), and t1/2 was longer in skin blister fluid than in plasma (3.1 +/- 0.5 versus 2.3 +/- 0.3; P < 0.005). The mean percent penetration into cantharide blister fluid was 129% +/- 24% when measured as total drug and 149% +/- 28% when measured as free drug (P < 0.001). These data suggest that cefetamet has an excellent penetration into inflammatory interstitial fluid.	0
Title: Identification of Thermotoga maritima MSB8 GH57 α-amylase AmyC as a glycogen-branching enzyme with high hydrolytic activity Abstract: AmyC, a glycoside hydrolase family 57 (GH57) enzyme of Thermotoga maritima MSB8, has previously been identified as an intracellular α-amylase playing a role in either maltodextrin utilization or storage polysaccharide metabolism. However, the α-amylase specificity of AmyC is questionable as extensive phylogenetic analysis of GH57 and tertiary structural comparison suggest that AmyC could actually be a glycogen-branching enzyme (GBE), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycogen. This communication presents phylogenetic and biochemical evidence that AmyC is a GBE with a relatively high hydrolytic (α-amylase) activity (up to 30% of the total activity), creating a branched α-glucan with 8.5% α-1,6-glycosidic bonds. The high hydrolytic activity is explained by the fact that AmyC has a considerably shorter catalytic loop (residues 213-220) not reaching the acceptor side. Secondly, in AmyC, the tryptophan residue (W 246) near the active site has its side chain buried in the protein interior, while the side chain is at the surface in Tk1436 and Tt1467 GBEs. The putative GBEs from three other Thermotogaceae, with very high sequence similarities to AmyC, were found to have the same structural elements as AmyC, suggesting that GH57 GBEs with relatively high hydrolytic activity may be widespread in nature.	0
Title: Draft genome sequence of Brevibacillus brevis strain X23, a biocontrol agent against bacterial wilt Abstract: Brevibacillus brevis X23 is an appropriate biocontrol agent against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. We report herein the draft genome sequence (6,566,879 bp) and a circular plasmid (6,600 bp) of B. brevis X23, data which may be helpful for mining the antagonistic activity against R. solanacearum.	1
Title: The complete genome sequence of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13, an organism with great industrial potential Abstract: The genome of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 consists of a single chromosome that has a size of 4,222,748 base pairs. The average G+C ratio is 46.2%. 4,286 open reading frames, 72 tRNA genes, 7 rRNA operons and 20 transposase genes were identified. The genome shows a marked co-linearity with Bacillus subtilis but contains defined inserted regions that can be identified at the sequence as well as at the functional level. B. licheniformis DSM13 has a well-conserved secretory system, no polyketide biosynthesis, but is able to form the lipopeptide lichenysin. From the further analysis of the genome sequence, we identified conserved regulatory DNA motives, the occurrence of the glyoxylate bypass and the presence of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase explaining that B. licheniformis is able to grow on acetate and 2,3-butanediol as well as anaerobically on glucose. Many new genes of potential interest for biotechnological applications were found in B. licheniformis; candidates include proteases, pectate lyases, lipases and various polysaccharide degrading enzymes.	1
Title: Characterization of garvicin ML, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus garvieae DCC43, isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) Abstract: Lactococcus garvieae DCC43 produces a bacteriocin, garvicin ML (GarML), with a molecular mass of 6,004.2 Da. Data from de novo amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry and nucleotide sequencing by reverse genetics suggested that the bacteriocin is synthesized as a 63-amino-acid precursor with a 3-amino-acid leader peptide that is removed by cleavage. Subsequently, a covalent linkage between the N and C termini forms the mature version of this novel 60-amino-acid circular bacteriocin.	1
Title: Plant-Soil-Microbiota Combination for the Removal of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH): An In-Field Experiment Abstract: The contamination of soil with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) may result in dramatic consequences and needs great attention, as soil rehabilitation would need more effort from a sustainability perspective. However, there is still no known general method since the remediation technology is strictly site-specific. Adaptive biological system dynamics can play a key role in understanding and addressing the potential of situ-specific biological combinations for soil pollutants removal. The potential worst-case of TPH contamination reflects soil affected by heavy industrial activities, such as oil refineries. Therefore, the experimental trial was conducted on a 2,000 m2 area from a contaminated site located in northern Italy. We evaluated the remediation potential over time (270 days) assessing (i) the phytoremediation efficiency of two species of Poaceae (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. and Dactylis glomerata L.) and two species of Fabaceae (Medicago sativa L. and Lotus corniculatus L.) and (ii) the role of the indigenous bacteria flora and endo-mycorrhizae consortium addition in plant growth promotion. We also induced resistance to contamination stress in a field experiment. Thirty-three indigenous bacteria selected from the contaminated soils showed marked plant growth promotion. Moreover, functional metagenomics confirmed the metabolic capability of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms living in the polluted soil. Our data showed that soil enzymatic activities increased with hydrocarbon degradation rate after 60 days. Both Poaceae and Fabaceae resulted in remarkable remediation potential. Stress markers and antioxidant activity indicated that the selected plant species generally need some time to adapt to TPH stress. In conclusion, our evaluation implied both the rhizosphere effects and functional features of the plant and suggested that plants should (i) have marked tolerance to specific contaminants, (ii) be characterized by an extensive root system, and (iii) be susceptible to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) infection.	0
Title: Fusarochromene, a novel tryptophan-derived metabolite from Fusarium sacchari Abstract: Fusarochromene isolated from the plant pathogenic fungus, Fusarium sacchari is closely related to a group of mycotoxins including fusarochromanone previously isolated from various Fusaria spp. Despite their assumed polyketide biogenesis, incorporation studies with 13C-labelled acetate, glycerol and tryptophans show that fusarochromene is unexpectedly derived via oxidative cleavage of the aromatic amino acid tryptophan. A putative biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified.	1
Title: Genome Mining-Based Discovery of Fungal Macrolides Modified by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-Ethanolamine Phosphate Transferase Homologues Abstract: Through genome mining for fungal macrolide natural products, we discovered a characteristic family of putative macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters that contain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-ethanolamine phosphate transferase (GPI-EPT) homologue. Through the heterologous expression of two clusters from Aspergillus kawachii and Colletotrichum incanum, new macrolides, including those with phosphoethanolamine or phosphocholine moieties, were formed. This study is the first demonstration of the tailoring steps catalyzed by GPI-EPT homologues in natural product biosynthesis, and it uncovers a new gene resource for phospholipid-resembling fungal macrolides.	1
Title: Search for cell motility and angiogenesis inhibitors with potential anticancer activity: beauvericin and other constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Abstract: Wound-healing assay-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of the fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum EPH2RAA endophytic in Ephedra fasciculata afforded beauvericin (1), (-)-oxysporidinone (2), and two new N-methyl-2-pyridones, (-)-4,6'-anhydrooxysporidinone (3) and (-)-6-deoxyoxysporidinone (4). Beauvericin (1) inhibited migration of the metastatic prostate cancer (PC-3M) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells and showed antiangiogenic activity in HUVEC-2 cells at sublethal concentrations. Cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of F. oxysporum strain CECIS occurring in Cylindropuntia echinocarpus afforded rhodolamprometrin (5), bikaverin (6), and the new natural product 6-deoxybikaverin (7). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity in a panel of four sentinel cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung), MIA Pa Ca-2 (pancreatic), MCF-7 (breast), and SF-268 (CNS glioma), and only beauvericin (1) and bikaverin (6) were active, with 1 and 6 showing selective toxicity toward NCI-H460 and MIA Pa Ca-2, respectively. Interestingly, 6-deoxybikaverin (7) was completely devoid of activity, suggesting the requirement of the C-6 hydroxy group of bikaverin for its cytotoxic activity.	0
Title: Identification of biosynthetic genes for the β-carboline alkaloid kitasetaline and production of the fluorinated derivatives by heterologous expression Abstract: β-Carboline alkaloids exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological and biological activities and are widely distributed in nature. Genetic information on the biosynthetic mechanism of β-carboline alkaloids has not been accumulated in bacteria, because there are only a few reports on the microbial β-carboline compounds. We previously isolated kitasetaline, a mercapturic acid derivative of a β-carboline compound, from the genetically modified Kitasatospora setae strain and found a plausible biosynthetic gene cluster for kitasetaline. Here, we identified and characterized three kitasetaline (ksl) biosynthetic genes for the formation of the β-carboline core structure and a gene encoding mycothiol-S-conjugate amidase for the modification of the N-acetylcysteine moiety by using heterologous expression. The proposed model of kitasetaline biosynthesis shows unique enzymatic systems for β-carboline alkaloids. In addition, feeding fluorotryptophan to the heterologous Streptomyces hosts expressing the ksl genes led to the generation of unnatural β-carboline alkaloids exerting novel/potentiated bioactivities.	1
Title: Enzymatic Reductive Dehalogenation Controls the Biosynthesis of Marine Bacterial Pyrroles Abstract: Enzymes capable of performing dehalogenating reactions have attracted tremendous contemporary attention due to their potential application in the bioremediation of anthropogenic polyhalogenated persistent organic pollutants. Nature, in particular the marine environment, is also a prolific source of polyhalogenated organic natural products. The study of the biosynthesis of these natural products has furnished a diverse array of halogenation biocatalysts, but thus far no examples of dehalogenating enzymes have been reported from a secondary metabolic pathway. Here we show that the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the highly brominated marine bacterial product pentabromopseudilin is catalyzed by an unusual debrominase Bmp8 that utilizes a redox thiol mechanism to remove the C-2 bromine atom of 2,3,4,5-tetrabromopyrrole to facilitate oxidative coupling to 2,4-dibromophenol. To the best of our knowledge, Bmp8 is first example of a dehalogenating enzyme from the established genetic and biochemical context of a natural product biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Global genome analysis of the shikimic acid pathway reveals greater gene loss in host-associated than in free-living bacteria Abstract: Background:                       A central tenet in biochemistry for over 50 years has held that microorganisms, plants and, more recently, certain apicomplexan parasites synthesize essential aromatic compounds via elaboration of a complete shikimic acid pathway, whereas metazoans lacking this pathway require a dietary source of these compounds. The large number of sequenced bacterial and archaean genomes now available for comparative genomic analyses allows the fundamentals of this contention to be tested in prokaryotes. Using Hidden Markov Model profiles (HMM profiles) to identify all known enzymes of the pathway, we report the presence of genes encoding shikimate pathway enzymes in the hypothetical proteomes constructed from the genomes of 488 sequenced prokaryotes.                  Results:                       Amongst free-living prokaryotes most Bacteria possess, as expected, genes encoding a complete shikimic acid pathway, whereas of the culturable Archaea, only one was found to have a complete complement of recognisable enzymes in its predicted proteome. It may be that in the Archaea, the primary amino-acid sequences of enzymes of the pathway are highly divergent and so are not detected by HMM profiles. Alternatively, structurally unrelated (non-orthologous) proteins might be performing the same biochemical functions as those encoding recognized genes of the shikimate pathway. Most surprisingly, 30% of host-associated (mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic) bacteria likewise do not possess a complete shikimic acid pathway. Many of these microbes show some degree of genome reduction, suggesting that these host-associated bacteria might sequester essential aromatic compounds from a parasitised host, as a 'shared metabolic adaptation' in mutualistic symbiosis, or obtain them from other consorts having the complete biosynthetic pathway. The HMM results gave 84% agreement when compared against data in the highly curated BioCyc reference database of genomes and metabolic pathways.                  Conclusions:                       These results challenge the conventional belief that the shikimic acid pathway is universal and essential in prokaryotes. The possibilities that non-orthologous enzymes catalyse reactions in this pathway (especially in the Archaea), or that there exist specific uptake mechanisms for the acquisition of shikimate intermediates or essential pathway products, warrant further examination to better understand the precise metabolic attributes of host-beneficial and pathogenic bacteria.	0
Title: A facile approach toward multicomponent supramolecular structures: selective self-assembly via charge separation Abstract: A novel approach toward the construction of multicomponent two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) metallosupramolecules is reported. Simply by mixing carboxylate and pyridyl ligands with cis-Pt(PEt(3))(2)(OTf)(2) in a proper ratio, coordination-driven self-assembly occurs, allowing for the selective generation of discrete multicomponent structures via charge separation on the metal centers. Using this method, a variety of 2-D rectangles and 3-D prisms were prepared under mild conditions. Moreover, multicomponent self-assembly can also be achieved by supramolecule-to-supramolecule transformations. The products were characterized by (31)P and (1)H multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and pulsed-field-gradient spin echo NMR techniques together with computational simulations.	0
Title: Streamlined syntheses of (-)-dictyostatin, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin, and 6-epi-16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin Abstract: The dictyostatins are a promising class of potential anti-cancer drugs because they are powerful microtubule-stabilizing agents, but the complexity of their chemical structures is a severe impediment to their further development. On the basis of both synthetic and medicinal chemistry analyses, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6 epimer were chosen as potentially potent yet accessible dictyostatin analogues, and three new syntheses were developed. A relatively classical synthesis involving vinyllithium addition and macrocyclization gave way to a newer and more practical approach based on esterification and ring-closing metathesis reaction. Finally, aspects of these two approaches were combined to provide a third new synthesis based on esterification and Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction. This was used to prepare the target dihydro analogues and the natural product. All of the syntheses are streamlined because of their high convergency. The work provided several new analogues of dictyostatin, including a truncated macrolactone and a C10 E-alkene, which were 400- and 50-fold less active than (-)-dictyostatin, respectively. In contrast, the targeted 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin analogues retained almost complete activity in preliminary biological assays.	0
Title: Solution-Processable Carbon Nanoelectrodes for Single-Molecule Investigations Abstract: Here we present a solution-based assembly method for producing molecular transport junctions employing metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes as nanoelectrodes. The molecular junction conductance of a series of oligophenyls was successfully measured, highlighting the potential of an all-carbon based approach for the fabrication of solution-processable single-molecule junctions for molecular electronics.	0
Title: HIV-1 Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors with Reduced Susceptibility to Drug Resistant Mutant Integrases Abstract: HIV integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are among the newest anti-AIDS drugs; however, mutant forms of IN can confer resistance. We developed noncytotoxic naphthyridine-containing INSTIs that retain low nanomolar IC50 values against HIV-1 variants harboring all of the major INSTI-resistant mutations. We found by analyzing crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the IN from the prototype foamy virus (PFV) that the most successful inhibitors show striking mimicry of the bound viral DNA prior to 3'-processing and the bound host DNA prior to strand transfer. Using this concept of "bi-substrate mimicry," we developed a new broadly effective inhibitor that not only mimics aspects of both the bound target and viral DNA but also more completely fills the space they would normally occupy. Maximizing shape complementarity and recapitulating structural components encompassing both of the IN DNA substrates could serve as a guiding principle for the development of new INSTIs.	0
Title: Stress signalling to fungal stress-activated protein kinase pathways Abstract: The ability of microorganisms to survive and thrive within hostile environments depends on rapid and robust stress responses. Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways are important stress-signalling modules found in all eukaryotes, including eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi. These pathways consist of a SAPK that is activated by phosphorylation through a kinase cascade, and once activated, the SAPK phosphorylates a range of cytoplasmic and nuclear target substrates, which determine the appropriate response. However, despite their conservation in fungi, mechanisms that have evolved to relay stress signals to the SAPK module in different fungi have diverged significantly. Here, we present an overview of the diverse strategies used in the model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, to sense and transduce stress signals to their respective SAPKs.	0
Title: P450-Mediated Coupling of Indole Fragments To Forge Communesin and Unnatural Isomers Abstract: Dimeric indole alkaloids are structurally diverse natural products that have attracted significant attention from the synthetic and biosynthetic communities. Here, we describe the characterization of a P450 monooxygenase CnsC from Penicillium that catalyzes the heterodimeric coupling between two different indole moieties, tryptamine and aurantioclavine, to construct vicinal quaternary stereocenters and yield the heptacyclic communesin scaffold. We show, via biochemical characterization, substrate analogues, and computational methods that CnsC catalyzes the C3-C3' carbon-carbon bond formation and controls the regioselectivities of the pair of subsequent aminal bond formations to yield the communesin core. Use of ω-N-methyltryptamine and tryptophol in place of tryptamine led to the enzymatic synthesis of isocommunesin compounds, which have not been isolated to date.	1
Title: Modelling of photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient yield coefficients in Scenedemus almeriensis culture as a function of nitrogen and phosphorus Abstract: Photo-respirometric tecniques are applied for evaluating photosynthetic activity in phototrophic organisms. These methods allow to evaluate photosynthetic response under different conditions. In this work, the influence of nutrient availability (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate) on the photosynthesis and respiration of Scenedesmus almeriensis was studied using short photo-respirometric measurements. Both photosynthesis and respiration increasing until saturation value and consecutively diminishing, presenting inhibition by high concentrations. Regarding the influence of phosphorus concentration in microalgae cells, a similar hyperbolic trend was observed but no inhibition was observed at high concentration. Based on these experimental data, the respiration, and the photosynthesis rate of S. almeriensis were modelled using Haldane equation for nitrate and ammonium data, and Monod equation for phosphate data. In addition, experiments were performed to determine the yield coefficients for both nitrogen and phosphorus in S. almeriensis cultures. The data showed that the nitrogen and phosphorous coefficient yields are not constant, being modified as a function of nutrients concentration, presenting the luxury uptake phenomena. Finally, the proposed models were incorporated into a simulation tool to evaluate the photosynthetic activity and the nutrient yield coefficients of S. almeriensis when different culture media and wastewaters are used as a nitrogen and phosphorous source for its growth. Key points • Microalgal photosynthesis/respiration vary as a function of nutrients availability. • Photosynthesis inhibition appears at high N-NO 3 - and N-NH4+ concentrations. • Nutrient yield coefficients are influenced by luxury uptake phenomenon.	0
Title: Discovery and Heterologous Production of New Cyclic Depsibosamycins Abstract: Streptomyces are producers of valuable secondary metabolites with unique scaffolds that perform a plethora of biological functions. Nonribosomal peptides are of special interest due to their variety and complexity. They are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, large biosynthetic machineries that are encoded in the genome of many Streptomyces species. The identification of new peptides and the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters is of major interest since knowledge can be used to facilitate combinatorial biosynthesis and chemical semisynthesis of natural products. The recently discovered bosamycins are linear octapeptides with an interesting 5-OMe tyrosine moiety and various modifications at the N-terminus. In this study, the new cyclic depsibosamycins B, C, and D from Streptomyces aurantiacus LU19075 were discovered. In comparison to the linear bosamycins B, C, and D, which were also produced by the strain, the cyclic depsibosamycins showed a side-chain-to-tail lactonization of serine and glycine, leading to a ring of four amino acids. In silico identification and heterologous expression of the depsibosamycin (dbm) gene cluster indicated that the cyclic peptides, rather than the linear derivatives, are the main products of the cluster.	1
Title: Genetic dissection of sesquiterpene biosynthesis by Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: A treasure trove of terpenes: The products of two fungal sesquiterpene synthases from the rice pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi were identified by gene-knockout experiments, genetic engineering of the fungus for production optimization, isolation of the sesquiterpenes, and structure elucidation by spectroscopic methods.	1
Title: LanGT2 Catalyzes the First Glycosylation Step during landomycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The glycosyltransferase LanGT2 is involved in the biosynthesis of the hexasaccharide side chain of the angucyclic antibiotic landomycin A. Its function was elucidated by targeted gene inactivation of lanGT2. The main metabolite of the obtained mutant was identified as tetrangulol (4), the progenitor of the landomycin aglycon (7). The lack of the sugar side chain indicates that LanGT2 catalyzes the priming glycosyl transfer in the hexasaccharide biosynthesis: the attachment of a D-olivose to O-8 of the polyketide backbone. Heterologous expression of urdGT2 from S. fradiae Tü2717 in this mutant resulted in the production of a novel C-glycosylated angucycline (6).	1
Title: Characterization of self-generated variants in Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica biofilm with increased antifouling activities Abstract: Pseudoalteromonas is widespread in various marine environments, and most strains can affect invertebrate larval settlement and metamorphosis by forming biofilms. However, the impact and the molecular basis of population diversification occurring in Pseudoalteromonas biofilms are poorly understood. Here, we show that morphological diversification is prevalent in Pseudoalteromonas species during biofilm formation. Two types of genetic variants, wrinkled (frequency of 12±5%) and translucent (frequency of 5±3%), were found in Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica biofilms. The inducing activities of biofilms formed by the two variants on larval settlement and metamorphosis of the mussel Mytilus coruscus were significantly decreased, suggesting strong antifouling activities. Using whole-genome re-sequencing combined with genetic manipulation, two genes were identified to be responsible for the morphology alternations. A nonsense mutation in AT00_08765 led to a wrinkled morphology due to the overproduction of cellulose, whereas a point mutation in AT00_17125 led to a translucent morphology via a reduction in capsular polysaccharide production. Taken together, the results suggest that the microbial behavior on larval settlement and metamorphosis in marine environment could be affected by the self-generated variants generated during the formation of marine biofilms, thereby rendering potential application in biocontrol of marine biofouling.	0
Title: Genome-Directed Lead Discovery: Biosynthesis, Structure Elucidation, and Biological Evaluation of Two Families of Polyene Macrolactams against Trypanosoma brucei Abstract: Marine natural products are an important source of lead compounds against many pathogenic targets. Herein, we report the discovery of lobosamides A-C from a marine actinobacterium, Micromonospora sp., representing three new members of a small but growing family of bacterially produced polyene macrolactams. The lobosamides display growth inhibitory activity against the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (lobosamide A IC50 = 0.8 μM), the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The biosynthetic gene cluster of the lobosamides was sequenced and suggests a conserved cluster organization among the 26-membered macrolactams. While determination of the relative and absolute configurations of many members of this family is lacking, the absolute configurations of the lobosamides were deduced using a combination of chemical modification, detailed spectroscopic analysis, and bioinformatics. We implemented a "molecules-to-genes-to-molecules" approach to determine the prevalence of similar clusters in other bacteria, which led to the discovery of two additional macrolactams, mirilactams A and B from Actinosynnema mirum. These additional analogs have allowed us to identify specific structure-activity relationships that contribute to the antitrypanosomal activity of this class. This approach illustrates the power of combining chemical analysis and genomics in the discovery and characterization of natural products as new lead compounds for neglected disease targets.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of microcin H47 immunity Abstract: Microcin H47 is a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a natural Escherichia coli isolate. The genetic system encoding microcin production and immunity consists of at least seven clustered genes. Four of these are devoted to microcin biosynthesis and two genes are required for its secretion into the extracellular medium. The product of the seventh gene, mchI, determines the cell's self-immunity. This gene was shown to encode a highly hydrophobic 69-residue peptide. Analysis of the MchI amino acid sequence, as well as the characterization of MchI-PhoA hybrid proteins, indicated that the microcin immunity product is probably exported out of the cytoplasm and remains an integral membrane peptide. This localization of the immunity peptide points to the cellular membrane as the site of action of microcin H47.	1
Title: Boundary cap cells are peripheral nervous system stem cells that can be redirected into central nervous system lineages Abstract: Boundary cap cells (BC), which express the transcription factor Krox20, participate in the formation of the boundary between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. To study BC stemness, we developed a method to purify and amplify BC in vitro from Krox20(Cre/+), R26R(YFP/+) mouse embryos. We show that BC progeny are EGF/FGF2-responsive, form spheres, and express neural crest markers. Upon growth factor withdrawal, BC progeny gave rise to multiple neural crest and CNS lineages. Transplanted into the developing murine forebrain, they successfully survived, migrated, and integrated within the host environment. Surprisingly, BC progeny generated exclusively CNS cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. In vitro experiments indicated that a sequential combination of ventralizing morphogens and glial growth factors was necessary to reprogram BC into oligodendrocytes. Thus, BC progeny are endowed with differentiation plasticity beyond the peripheral nervous system. The demonstration that CNS developmental cues can reprogram neural crest-derived stem cells into CNS derivatives suggests that BC could serve as a source of cell type-specific lineages, including oligodendrocytes, for cell-based therapies to treat CNS disorders.	0
Title: Structures of the genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of spinach chloroplast ATPase indicate a dicistronic mRNA and an overlapping translation stop/start signal Abstract: A 2,4-kilobase-pair region of spinach chloroplast DNA adjacent to the gene for the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase has been analyzed by RNA hybridization, in vitro transcription/translation, and DNA sequence determination. The analysis indicates that this region carries the genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of chloroplast ATPase and that the two genes are cotranscribed into a dicistronic mRNA with 4-base-pair overlap between the stop codon of the beta-subunit gene and the start codon of the epsilon-subunit gene. The ATPase and carboxylase genes are transcribed divergently with respect to each other. The deduced amino acid sequences of the beta and epsilon subunits from spinach show 67% and 26% homology, respectively, with the published sequences of the beta and epsilon subunits of Escherichia coli ATPase.	0
Title: Linear and cyclic peptides from the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus Abstract: Three new peptides, xenortides A and B and xenematide, were isolated from a culture of the nematode-associated entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus. Their structures were elucidated using NMR, MS, and chemical derivatization methods. Xenortides A and B are the N-phenethylamide and tryptamide derivatives, respectively, of the dipeptide (NMe-L-Leu-NMe-L-Phe). The cyclodepsipeptide xenematide has the sequence (Thr-Trp-Trp-Gly), with a 2-phenylacetamide substituent at the threonine residue and one d-tryptophan. The new peptides and the two known compounds xenocoumacin II and nematophin were tested for antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, and anti-Artemia salina activities. Xenematide and xenocoumacin II showed moderate antibacterial activities. Xenocoumacin II, nematophin, and the two xenortides were active in the Artemia salina assay, and xenematide acted weakly insecticidal.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster in the fungus Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Background:                       The antifungal therapy caspofungin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, a lipohexapeptide produced by the fungus Glarea lozoyensis, and was the first member of the echinocandin class approved for human therapy. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthases (PKS) gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis from G. lozoyensis has not been elucidated to date. In this study, we report the elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the G. lozoyensis wild-type strain ATCC 20868.                  Results:                       The pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster contains a NRPS (GLNRPS4) and a PKS (GLPKS4) arranged in tandem, two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, seven other modifying enzymes, and genes for L-homotyrosine biosynthesis, a component of the peptide core. Thus, the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster is significantly more autonomous and organized than that of the recently characterized echinocandin B gene cluster. Disruption mutants of GLNRPS4 and GLPKS4 no longer produced the pneumocandins (A0 and B0), and the Δglnrps4 and Δglpks4 mutants lost antifungal activity against the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. In addition to pneumocandins, the G. lozoyensis genome encodes a rich repertoire of natural product-encoding genes including 24 PKSs, six NRPSs, five PKS-NRPS hybrids, two dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, and 14 terpene synthases.                  Conclusions:                       Characterization of the gene cluster provides a blueprint for engineering new pneumocandin derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. Whole genome estimation of the secondary metabolite-encoding genes from G. lozoyensis provides yet another example of the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products from the fungal kingdom.	1
Title: A non-canonical peptide synthetase adenylates 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid for auriculamide biosynthesis Abstract: Auriculamide is the first natural product known from the predatory bacterium Herpetosiphon aurantiacus. It is composed of three unusual building blocks, including the non-proteinogenic amino acid 3-chloro-L-tyrosine, the α-hydroxy acid L-isoleucic acid, and a methylmalonyl-CoA-derived ethane unit. A candidate genetic locus for auriculamide biosynthesis was identified and encodes four enzymes. Among them, the non-canonical 199 kDa four-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase, AulA, is extraordinary in that it features two consecutive adenylation domains. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the recombinantly produced AulA. The observed activation of 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid by the enzyme supports the hypothesis that it participates in the biosynthesis of auriculamide. An artificially truncated version of AulA that lacks the first adenylation domain activated this substrate like the full-length enzyme which shows that the first adenylation domain is dispensable. Additionally, we provide evidence that the enzyme tolerates structural variation of the substrate. α-Carbon substituents significantly affected the substrate turnover. While all tested aliphatic α-keto acids were accepted by the enzyme and minor differences in chain size and branches did not interfere with the enzymatic activity, molecules with methylene α-carbons led to low turnover. Such enzymatic plasticity is an important attribute to help in the perpetual search for novel molecules and to access a greater structural diversity by mutasynthesis.	1
Title: Structure and specificity of a permissive bacterial C-prenyltransferase Abstract: This study highlights the biochemical and structural characterization of the L-tryptophan C6 C-prenyltransferase (C-PT) PriB from Streptomyces sp. RM-5-8. PriB was found to be uniquely permissive to a diverse array of prenyl donors and acceptors including daptomycin. Two additional PTs also produced novel prenylated daptomycins with improved antibacterial activities over the parent drug.	1
Title: Intensely potent anthracycline antibiotic oxaunomycin produced by a blocked mutant of the daunorubicin-producing microorganism Abstract: A new potent anthracycline antibiotic oxaunomycin was isolated from the culture broth of a blocked mutant derived from a baumycin producer and was identified as 7-O-(alpha-L-daunosaminyl)-beta-rhodomycinone. It exhibited about 100 times more strongly cytotoxic activity against leukemic L1210 cell culture than doxorubicin.	0
Title: Phenazines are not essential for Pseudomonas chlororaphis PA23 biocontrol of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, but do play a role in biofilm formation Abstract: Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain PA23 is a biocontrol agent capable of suppressing disease caused by the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This bacterium produces the diffusible antibiotics phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, 2-hydroxyphenazine and pyrrolnitrin (PRN). Because the individual contribution of these antibiotics to PA23 biocontrol has not been defined, mutants deficient in the production of phenazine (PHZ), PRN or both antibiotics were created. Analysis of the PHZ mutant revealed enhanced antifungal activity in vitro and wild-type levels of Sclerotinia disease suppression. Conversely, the PRN- and the PRN/PHZ-deficient strains exhibited decreased antifungal activity in vitro and markedly reduced the ability to control Sclerotinia infection of canola in the greenhouse. These findings suggest that PRN is the primary antibiotic mediating biocontrol of this pathogen. Analysis of prnA-lacZ and phzA-lacZ transcriptional fusions revealed that PRN and PHZ are not subject to autoregulation; moreover, they do not cross-regulate each other. However, HPLC showed a twofold increase in PRN levels in the PHZ(-) background. Finally, PHZ, but not PRN production, is involved in biofilm development in P. chlororaphis PA23.	1
Title: Control of the conductance of engineered protein nanopores through concerted loop motions Abstract: Protein nanopores have attracted much interest for nucleic acid sequencing, chemical sensing, and protein folding at the single molecule level. The outer membrane protein OmpG from E. coli stands out because it forms a nanopore from a single polypeptide chain. This property allows the separate engineering of each of the seven extracellular loops that control access to the pore. The longest of these loops, loop 6, has been recognized as the main gating loop that closes the pore at low pH values and opens it at high pH values. A method was devised to pin each of the loops to the embedding membrane and measure the single-pore conductances of the resulting constructs. The electrophysiological and complementary NMR measurements show that the pinning of individual loops alters the structure and dynamics of neighboring and distant loops in a correlated fashion. Pinning loop 6 generates a constitutively open pore and patterns of concerted loop motions control access to the OmpG nanopore.	0

Title: Determine independent gut microbiota-diseases association by eliminating the effects of human lifestyle factors Abstract: Lifestyle and physiological variables on human disease risk have been revealed to be mediated by gut microbiota. Low concordance between case-control studies for detecting disease-associated microbe existed due to limited sample size and population-wide bias in lifestyle and physiological variables. To infer gut microbiota-disease associations accurately, we propose to build machine learning models by including both human variables and gut microbiota. When the model's performance with both gut microbiota and human variables is better than the model with just human variables, the independent gut microbiota -disease associations will be confirmed. By building models on the American Gut Project dataset, we found that gut microbiota showed distinct association strengths with different diseases. Adding gut microbiota into human variables enhanced the classification performance of IBD significantly; independent associations between occurrence information of gut microbiota and irritable bowel syndrome, C. difficile infection, and unhealthy status were found; adding gut microbiota showed no improvement on models' performance for diabetes, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, cardiovascular disease. Our results suggested that although gut microbiota was reported to be associated with many diseases, a considerable proportion of these associations may be very weak. We proposed a list of microbes as biomarkers to classify IBD and unhealthy status. Further functional investigations of these microbes will improve understanding of the molecular mechanism of human diseases.	0
Title: Yeast homologs of human MCUR1 regulate mitochondrial proline metabolism Abstract: Mitochondria house evolutionarily conserved pathways of carbon and nitrogen metabolism that drive cellular energy production. Mitochondrial bioenergetics is regulated by calcium uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a multi-protein complex whose assembly in the inner mitochondrial membrane is facilitated by the scaffold factor MCUR1. Intriguingly, many fungi that lack MCU contain MCUR1 homologs, suggesting alternate functions. Herein, we characterize Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs Put6 and Put7 of MCUR1 as regulators of mitochondrial proline metabolism. Put6 and Put7 are tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane in a large hetero-oligomeric complex, whose abundance is regulated by proline. Loss of this complex perturbs mitochondrial proline homeostasis and cellular redox balance. Yeast cells lacking either Put6 or Put7 exhibit a pronounced defect in proline utilization, which can be corrected by the heterologous expression of human MCUR1. Our work uncovers an unexpected role of MCUR1 homologs in mitochondrial proline metabolism.	0
Title: Cross-disciplinary approaches to assist with nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 Abstract: Improving the capacity of detecting positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is critical for identifying the infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) precisely and thereby curbing the pandemic. Cross-disciplinary approaches may improve the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis by compensating to some extent the limitations encountered by traditional test methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining computed tomography (CT), serum-specific antibody detection, and nanopore sequencing with nucleic acid testing for individual testing may improve the accuracy of identifying COVID-19 patients. At community or even regional/national levels, the combination of pooled screening and spatial epidemiological strategies may enable the detection of early transmission of epidemics in a cost-effective way, which is also less affected by restricted access to diagnostic tests and kit supplies. This would significantly advance our capacity of curbing epidemics as soon as possible, and better prepare us for entering a new era of high-impact and high-frequency epidemics.	0
Title: Characterization of the congeners in the lantibiotic NAI-107 complex Abstract: NAI-107, a lantibiotic produced by Microbispora sp. 107891, shows potent activity against multi-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. It is produced as a complex of related molecules, which is unusual for ribosomally synthesized peptides. Here we describe the identification, characterization, and antibacterial activity of the congeners produced by Microbispora sp. 107891 and by the related Microbispora corallina NRRL 30420. These molecules differ by the presence of two, one, or zero hydroxyl groups at Pro-14, by the presence of a chlorine at Trp-4, and/or by the presence of a sulfoxide on the thioether of the first lanthionine.	1
Title: Uncultivated Tannerella BU045 and BU063 are slim segmented filamentous rods of high prevalence but low abundance in inflammatory disease-associated dental plaques Abstract: Uncultivated clones BU045 and BU063 and Tannerella forsythia, a 'consensus periodontal pathogen', are the closest known relatives within the genus Tannerella. They have been described to inhabit different ecological niches of the human oral cavity. In this study, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence were combined to investigate the prevalence and abundance of BU045 and BU063 in comparison to T. forsythia in plaques from gingivitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) and chronic periodontitis. Phylotype-specific FISH probes identified BU045 and BU063 as elongated thin rods with a segmented structure. Two structurally similar and previously unknown, rare phylotypes (127+ and 997+) were also identified due to partial 16S rRNA sequence identity with T. forsythia. In gingivitis, NUG and periodontitis patients, BU045, BU063, 127+, 997+ and T. forsythia were detected with prevalences of 50/83/71/14 and 81%, 100/100/86/17 and 53%, and 100/100/12/0 and 100%, respectively. Supragingivally, colonization density of all five organisms was generally low, rarely exceeding 0.1% of the total biota. In periodontal pocket samples, however, cell numbers of T. forsythia, but not of the uncultivable phylotypes, were greatly elevated. Our data demonstrate that Tannerella phylotypes BU045, BU063, 127+ and 997+ consist of long slim rods with segments, which, with respect to FISH stainability, often behaved as independent units. The phylotypes are frequent but low-level colonizers of various periodontal disease-associated plaques. Their apparent inability to proliferate to high density seems to exclude any relevance for the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.	0
Title: Heterologous Production of a Novel Cyclic Peptide Compound, KK-1, in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: A novel cyclic peptide compound, KK-1, was originally isolated from the plant-pathogenic fungus Curvularia clavata. It consists of 10 amino acid residues, including five N-methylated amino acid residues, and has potent antifungal activity. Recently, the genome-sequencing analysis of C. clavata was completed, and the biosynthetic genes involved in KK-1 production were predicted by using a novel gene cluster mining tool, MIDDAS-M. These genes form an approximately 75-kb cluster, which includes nine open reading frames, containing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene. To determine whether the predicted genes were responsible for the biosynthesis of KK-1, we performed heterologous production of KK-1 in Aspergillus oryzae by introduction of the cluster genes into the genome of A. oryzae. The NRPS gene was split in two fragments and then reconstructed in the A. oryzae genome, because the gene was quite large (approximately 40 kb). The remaining seven genes in the cluster, excluding the regulatory gene kkR, were simultaneously introduced into the strain of A. oryzae in which NRPS had already been incorporated. To evaluate the heterologous production of KK-1 in A. oryzae, gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and KK-1 productivity was quantified by HPLC. KK-1 was produced in variable quantities by a number of transformed strains, along with expression of the cluster genes. The amount of KK-1 produced by the strain with the greatest expression of all genes was lower than that produced by the original producer, C. clavata. Therefore, expression of the cluster genes is necessary and sufficient for the heterologous production of KK-1 in A. oryzae, although there may be unknown factors limiting productivity in this species.	1
Title: Identification of a monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) involved in biosynthesis of actinorhodin: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme Abstract: The oxidation of phenols to quinones is an important reaction in the oxidative tailoring of many aromatic polyketides from bacterial and fungal systems. Sequence similarity between ActVA-Orf6 protein from the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster and the previously characterized TcmH protein that is involved in tetracenomycin biosynthesis suggested that ActVA-Orf6 might catalyze this transformation as a step in actinorhodin biosynthesis. To investigate the role of ActVA-Orf6 in this oxidation, we have expressed the actVA-Orf6 gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVA-Orf6 was shown to catalyze the monooxygenation of the tetracenomycin intermediate TcmF1 to TcmD3, strongly suggesting that it catalyzes oxidation of a similar intermediate in actinorhodin biosynthesis. The monooxygenase obeys simple reaction kinetics and has a Km of 4.8 +/- 0.9 microM, close to the figure reported for the homologous enzyme TcmH. The enzyme contains no prosthetic groups and requires only molecular oxygen to catalyze the oxidation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of histidine residues thought to be important in the reaction; mutants lacking His-52 displayed much-reduced activity, consistent with the proposed mechanistic hypothesis that this histidine acts as a general base during catalysis.	1
Title: Structure and function of the antibiotic resistance-mediating methyltransferase AviRb from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Abstract: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is a widespread problem in medical practice and drug design, and each case requires the elucidation of the underlying mechanism. AviRb from Streptomyces viridochromogenes methylates the 2'-O atom of U2479 of the 23S ribosomal RNA in Gram-positive bacteria and thus mediates resistance to the oligosaccharide (orthosomycin) antibiotic avilamycin. The structure of AviRb with and without bound cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) was determined, showing that it is a homodimer belonging to the SpoU family within the SPOUT class of methyltransferases. The relationships within this class were analyzed in detail and, in addition, a novel fourth SpoU sequence fingerprint is proposed. Each subunit of AviRb consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain, being related to the ribosomal proteins L30 and L7Ae, is likely to bind RNA. The C-terminal domain is related to all SPOUT methyltransferases, and is responsible for AdoMet-binding, catalysis and dimerization. The cofactor binds at the characteristic knot of the polypeptide in an unusually bent conformation. The transferred methyl group points to a broad cleft formed with the L30-type domain of the other subunit. Measurements of mutant activity revealed four important residues responsible for catalysis and allowed the modeling of a complex between AviRb and the RNA target. The model includes a specificity pocket for uracil but does not contain a base for deprotonating the 2'-O atom of U2479 on methylation.	1
Title: Dual Role of Surface Hydroxyl Groups in the Photodynamics and Performance of NiO-Based Photocathodes Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells containing photocathodes based on functionalized NiO show a promising solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Here, we present mechanistic understanding of the photoinduced charge transfer processes occurring at the photocathode/electrolyte interface. We demonstrate via advanced photophysical characterization that surface hydroxyl groups formed at the NiO/water interface not only promote photoinduced hole transfer from the dye into NiO, but also enhance the rate of charge recombination. Both processes are significantly slower when the photocathode is exposed to dry acetonitrile, while in air an intermediate behavior is observed. These data suggest that highly efficient devices can be developed by balancing the quantity of surface hydroxyl groups of NiO, and presumably of other p-type metal oxide semiconductors.	0
Title: A Simple and Versatile Amide Directing Group for C-H Functionalizations Abstract: Achieving selective C-H activation at a single and strategic site in the presence of multiple C-H bonds can provide a powerful and generally useful retrosynthetic disconnection. In this context, a directing group serves as a compass to guide the transition metal to C-H bonds by using distance and geometry as powerful recognition parameters to distinguish between proximal and distal C-H bonds. However, the installation and removal of directing groups is a practical drawback. To improve the utility of this approach, one can seek solutions in three directions: 1) Simplifying the directing group, 2) using common functional groups or protecting groups as directing groups, and 3) attaching the directing group to substrates via a transient covalent bond to render the directing group catalytic. This Review describes the rational development of an extremely simple and yet broadly applicable directing group for Pd(II) , Rh(III) , and Ru(II) catalysts, namely the N-methoxy amide (CONHOMe) moiety. Through collective efforts in the community, a wide range of C-H activation transformations using this type of simple directing group have been developed.	0
Title: Assembly and heterologous expression of the coumermycin A1 gene cluster and production of new derivatives by genetic engineering Abstract: Many secondary metabolites of clinical importance have been isolated from different Streptomyces species. As most of the natural producers remain difficult to handle genetically, heterologous expression of an entire biosynthetic gene cluster in a well characterised host allows improved possibilities for modifications of the desired compound by manipulation of the biosynthetic genes. However, the large size of a functional gene cluster often prevents its direct cloning into a single cosmid clone. Here we describe a successful strategy to assemble the entire coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster (38.6 kb) into a single cosmid clone by lambda RED recombination technology. Heterologous expression of the reconstituted gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the heterologous production of coumermycin A1. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene couO--responsible for the C-methylation at the 8-positions of the aminocoumarin moieties in coumermycin A1--and heterologous expression of the modified cluster resulted in an accumulation of a C-8-unsubstituted coumermycin A1 derivative. Subsequent expression of the halogenase gene clo-hal from the clorobiocin gene cluster in the heterologous producer strain led to the formation of two new hybrid antibiotics, containing either one or two chlorine atoms. The identities of the new compounds were verified by LC-MS, and their antibacterial activities were tested against Bacillus subtilis in an agar diffusion assay.	1
Title: Two-Step Synthesis of Heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6 .03,13 .04,11 .05,9 .010,14 ] tetradecane from Norbornadiene: Mechanism of the Cage Assembly and Post-synthetic Functionalization Abstract: A selective and scalable two-step approach to the dimerization of norbornadiene (NBD) into its thermodynamically most stable dimer, heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6 .03,13 .04,11 .05,9 .010,14 ] tetradecane, (HCTD) is reported. Calculations indicate that the reaction starts with the Rh-catalyzed stepwise homo Diels-Alder cyclisation of NBD into its exo-cis-endo dimer. Treatment of this compound with acid promotes its evolution to HCTD via a [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The assemblies of 7,12-disubstituted cages from 7-(alkyl/aryl) NBDs, as well as the selective post-synthetic C-H functionalization of the core HCTD scaffold at position C1, or positions C1 and C4 are described.	0
Title: Identification and functional characterization of NifA variants that are independent of GlnB activation in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum Abstract: The activity of NifA, the transcriptional activator of the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene, is tightly regulated in response to ammonium and oxygen. However, the mechanisms for the regulation of NifA activity are quite different among various nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Unlike the well-studied NifL-NifA regulatory systems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Azotobacter vinelandii, in Rhodospirillum rubrum NifA is activated by a direct protein-protein interaction with the uridylylated form of GlnB, which in turn causes a conformational change in NifA. We report the identification of several substitutions in the N-terminal GAF domain of R. rubrum NifA that allow NifA to be activated in the absence of GlnB. Presumably these substitutions cause conformational changes in NifA necessary for activation, without interaction with GlnB. We also found that wild-type NifA can be activated in a GlnB-independent manner under certain growth conditions, suggesting that some other effector(s) can also activate NifA. An attempt to use Tn5 mutagenesis to obtain mutants that altered the pool of these presumptive effector(s) failed, though much rarer spontaneous mutations in nifA were detected. This suggests that the necessary alteration of the pool of effector(s) for NifA activation cannot be obtained by knockout mutations.	0
Title: Polyketide synthase chemistry does not direct biosynthetic divergence between 9- and 10-membered enediynes Abstract: Enediynes are potent antitumor antibiotics that are classified as 9- or 10-membered according to the size of the enediyne core structure. However, almost nothing is known about enediyne core biosynthesis, and the determinants of 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence remain elusive. Previous work identified enediyne-specific polyketide synthases (PKSEs) that can be phylogenetically distinguished as being involved in 9- versus 10-membered enediyne biosynthesis, suggesting that biosynthetic divergence might originate from differing PKSE chemistries. Recent in vitro studies have identified several compounds produced by the PKSE and associated thioesterase (TE), but condition-dependent product profiles make it difficult to ascertain a true catalytic difference between 9- and 10-membered PKSE-TE systems. Here we report that PKSE chemistry does not direct 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence as revealed by comparing the products from three 9-membered and two 10-membered PKSE-TE systems under identical conditions using robust in vivo assays. Three independent experiments support a common catalytic function for 9- and 10-membered PKSEs by the production of a heptaene metabolite from: (i) all five cognate PKSE-TE pairs in Escherichia coli; (ii) the C-1027 and calicheamicin cognate PKSE-TEs in Streptomyces lividans K4-114; and (iii) selected native producers of both 9- and 10-membered enediynes. Furthermore, PKSEs and TEs from different 9- and 10-membered enediyne biosynthetic machineries are freely interchangeable, revealing that 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence occurs beyond the PKSE-TE level. These findings establish a starting point for determining the origins of this biosynthetic divergence.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the pyrrolidine protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin involves novel gene ensemble and cryptic biosynthetic steps Abstract: The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin features a unique benzylpyrrolidine system and exhibits diverse biological and pharmacologic activities. Its biosynthetic origin has remained obscure for more than 60 y, however. Here we report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of anisomycin in Streptomyces hygrospinosus var. beijingensis by a bioactivity-guided high-throughput screening method. Using a combination of bioinformatic analysis, reverse genetics, chemical analysis, and in vitro biochemical assays, we have identified a core four-gene ensemble responsible for the synthesis of the pyrrolidine system in anisomycin: aniQ, encoding a aminotransferase that catalyzes an initial deamination and a later reamination steps; aniP, encoding a transketolase implicated to bring together an glycolysis intermediate with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid to form the anisomycin molecular backbone; aniO, encoding a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes a cryptic glycosylation crucial for downstream enzyme processing; and aniN, encoding a bifunctional dehydrogenase that mediates multistep pyrrolidine formation. The results reveal a BGC for pyrrolidine alkaloid biosynthesis that is distinct from known bacterial alkaloid pathways, and provide the signature sequences that will facilitate the discovery of BGCs encoding novel pyrrolidine alkaloids in bacterial genomes. The biosynthetic insights from this study further set the foundation for biosynthetic engineering of pyrrolidine antibiotics.	1
Title: Towards reassigning the rare AGG codon in Escherichia coli Abstract: The rare AGG codon in Escherichia coli has been reassigned to code non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) by using the PylRS-tRNA(Pyl)(CCU) pair. When N(ε) -alloc-lysine was used as a PylRS substrate, almost quantitative occupancy of N(ε) -alloc-lysine at an AGG codon site was achieved in minimal medium. ncAAs can be potentially incorporated at the AGG codon with varying efficiencies, depending on their activities towards corresponding enzymes. As AGG is a sense codon, the approach reported here resolves the typical low ncAA incorporation issue that has been associated with ncAA mutagenesis and therefore allows bulk preparation of proteins with site-selectively incorporated ncAAs for applications such as therapeutic protein production.	0
Title: Coral Carbonic Anhydrases: Regulation by Ocean Acidification Abstract: Global change is a major threat to the oceans, as it implies temperature increase and acidification. Ocean acidification (OA) involving decreasing pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry challenges the capacity of corals to form their skeletons. Despite the large number of studies that have investigated how rates of calcification respond to ocean acidification scenarios, comparatively few studies tackle how ocean acidification impacts the physiological mechanisms that drive calcification itself. The aim of our paper was to determine how the carbonic anhydrases, which play a major role in calcification, are potentially regulated by ocean acidification. For this we measured the effect of pH on enzyme activity of two carbonic anhydrase isoforms that have been previously characterized in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. In addition we looked at gene expression of these enzymes in vivo. For both isoforms, our results show (1) a change in gene expression under OA (2) an effect of OA and temperature on carbonic anhydrase activity. We suggest that temperature increase could counterbalance the effect of OA on enzyme activity. Finally we point out that caution must, thus, be taken when interpreting transcriptomic data on carbonic anhydrases in ocean acidification and temperature stress experiments, as the effect of these stressors on the physiological function of CA will depend both on gene expression and enzyme activity.	0
Title: A chemical library approach to organic-modified peptide ligands for PDZ domain proteins: a synthetic, thermodynamic and structural investigation Abstract: PDZ domains are members of the protein interaction domain family,[1] semi-autonomous modules embedded within larger signaling proteins that impart a degree of exclusivity to the binding properties of their hosts. As mediators of mammalian protein-protein interactions that number in the hundreds, PDZ domains are party to a correspondingly large array of cellular processes, most notably those that regulate or support neuronal activities.[2] Specific, bioavailable molecular probes are needed to foster biological inquiries into their functions; towards this end, we report our recent progress in the discovery and development of PDZ domain inhibitors.	0
Title: Functional characterization of ttnI completing the tailoring steps for tautomycetin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseochromogenes Abstract: The tautomycetin (TTN) biosynthetic gene cluster has been recently cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces griseochromogenes, unveiling four genes, ttnCDFI, as candidates to encode the tailoring steps for TTN biosynthesis. It is reported that (i) TtnC plays no essential role in TTN biosynthesis, (ii) TtnI catalyzes C-5 oxidation, and (iii) combining the previous findings with TtnFD, the tailoring steps from TTN F-1 to TTN take place in the order of TtnF-catalyzed C-1"/C-2" dehydration, TtnD-catalyzed C-3" decarboxylation, and TtnI-catalyzed C-5 oxidation.	1
Title: The recombination genes addAB are not restricted to gram-positive bacteria: genetic analysis of the recombination initiation enzymes RecF and AddAB in Rhizobium etli Abstract: Single-strand gaps (SSGs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the major initiation sites for recombination. In bacteria, the SSGs are repaired by RecFOR, while the DSBs are processed by RecBCD in gram-negative bacteria and AddAB in gram-positive bacteria. Unexpectedly, instead of recBCD genes, the addAB genes were found in members of the alpha-proteobacteria group (gram negative). Taking Rhizobium etli as a model, the role of recF and addAB genes in homologous recombination and repair of damaged DNA was evaluated. Inactivation of either recF or addA provoked strong sensitivity to UV radiation and mitomycin C, while an additive effect was observed in the recF-addA mutant. The DSBs generated by nalidixic acid caused low viability only in the addA mutant. The recombination frequency of large and small plasmids was reduced in the recF mutant (24- and 36-fold, respectively), whereas a slight decrease (threefold) in the addA mutant was observed. Moreover, an additive effect (47- and 90-fold, respectively) was observed in the double mutant, but it was not as dramatic as that in a recA mutant. Interestingly, the frequency of deletion and Campbell-type recombination was slightly affected in either single or double mutants. These results suggest that another pathway exists that allows plasmid and Campbell-type recombination in the absence of recF and addA genes.	0
Title: Mucosa-associated bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract are uniformly distributed along the colon and differ from the community recovered from feces Abstract: The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbors a complex community of bacterial cells in the mucosa, lumen, and feces. Since most attention has been focused on bacteria present in feces, knowledge about the mucosa-associated bacterial communities in different parts of the colon is limited. In this study, the bacterial communities in feces and biopsy samples from the ascending, transverse, and descending colons of 10 individuals were analyzed by using a 16S rRNA approach. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria were present in the biopsy samples. To visualize the diversity of the predominant and the Lactobacillus group community, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed. DGGE analysis and similarity index comparisons demonstrated that the predominant mucosa-associated bacterial community was host specific and uniformly distributed along the colon but significantly different from the fecal community (P < 0.01). The Lactobacillus group-specific profiles were less complex than the profiles reflecting the predominant community. For 6 of the 10 individuals the community of Lactobacillus-like bacteria in the biopsy samples was similar to that in the feces. Amplicons having 99% sequence similarity to the 16S ribosomal DNA of Lactobacillus gasseri were detected in the biopsy samples of nine individuals. No significant differences were observed between healthy and diseased individuals. The observed host-specific DGGE profiles of the mucosa-associated bacterial community in the colon support the hypothesis that host-related factors are involved in the determination of the GI tract microbial community.	0
Title: Identification and Functional Analysis of the Mycophenolic Acid Gene Cluster of Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: The filamentous fungus Penicillium roqueforti is widely known as the ripening agent of blue-veined cheeses. Additionally, this fungus is able to produce several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound mycophenolic acid (MPA). Cheeses ripened with P. roqueforti are usually contaminated with MPA. On the other hand, MPA is a commercially valuable immunosuppressant. However, to date the molecular basis of the production of MPA by P. roqueforti is still unknown. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a genomic region of approximately 24.4 kbp containing a seven-gene cluster that may be involved in the MPA biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of these seven genes (named mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaDE, mpaF, mpaG and mpaH) resulted in dramatic reductions in MPA production, confirming that all of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the compound. Interestingly, the mpaF gene, originally described in P. brevicompactum as a MPA self-resistance gene, also exerts the same function in P. roqueforti, suggesting that this gene has a dual function in MPA metabolism. The knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of MPA in P. roqueforti will be important for the future control of MPA contamination in cheeses and the improvement of MPA production for commercial purposes.	1
Title: Detection and characterization of a rare two-component lantibiotic, amyloliquecidin GF610 produced by Bacillus velezensis, using a combination of culture, molecular and bioinformatic analyses Abstract: Aim:                       To detect and characterize novel lantibiotics from a collection of Bacillus spp. using a multifaceted analytical approach.                  Methods and results:                       A previously completed microassay identified 45 Bacillus isolates with anti-Listeria activity. The isolates were PCR screened using degenerate primers targeting conserved sequences in lanM-type lantibiotics. B. velezensis GF610 produced a PCR product whose sequence, along with genome mining and bioinformatics, guided the liquid chromatographic analysis of strain's cell-free extracts and the mass spectrometry of purified fractions. Results revealed a new amyloliquecidin variant (designated GF610) produced by the strain. Amyloliquecidin GF610 is a two-component lantibiotic with α and β peptides having monoisotopic masses of 3026 and 2451 Da, and molecular formulae C130 H191 N35 O39 S5 and C110 H158 N26 O30 S4 , respectively. Amyloliquecidin GF610 is active against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridioides difficile, Staphylococcus aureus and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range of 0.5-7.0 µmol l-1 .                  Conclusions:                       The proposed multifaceted analytical approach was valuable to provide a deep and proper characterization of a novel bacteriocin, amyloliquecidin GF610, with high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.                  Significance and impact:                       The discovered Amyloliquecidin GF610 is potentially useful in food, agricultural or medical applications. The analytical approach followed may facilitate future discoveries of two-component lantibiotics, which are challenging compounds to detect and characterize.	1
Title: A new arylsulfate sulfotransferase involved in liponucleoside antibiotic biosynthesis in streptomycetes Abstract: Sulfotransferases are involved in a variety of physiological processes and typically use 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulfate donor substrate. In contrast, microbial arylsulfate sulfotransferases (ASSTs) are PAPS-independent and utilize arylsulfates as sulfate donors. Yet, their genuine acceptor substrates are unknown. In this study we demonstrate that Cpz4 from Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2 is an ASST-type sulfotransferase responsible for the formation of sulfated liponucleoside antibiotics. Gene deletion mutants showed that cpz4 is required for the production of sulfated caprazamycin derivatives. Cloning, overproduction, and purification of Cpz4 resulted in a 58-kDa soluble protein. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of a sulfate group from p-nitrophenol sulfate (K(m) 48.1 microM, k(cat) 0.14 s(-1)) and methyl umbelliferone sulfate (K(m) 34.5 microM, k(cat) 0.15 s(-1)) onto phenol (K(m) 25.9 and 29.7 mM, respectively). The Cpz4 reaction proceeds by a ping pong bi-bi mechanism. Several structural analogs of intermediates of the caprazamycin biosynthetic pathway were synthesized and tested as substrates of Cpz4. Des-N-methyl-acyl-caprazol was converted with highest efficiency 100 times faster than phenol. The fatty acyl side chain and the uridyl moiety seem to be important for substrate recognition by Cpz4. Liponucleosides, partially purified from various mutant strains, were readily sulfated by Cpz4 using p-nitrophenol sulfate. No product formation could be observed with PAPS as the donor substrate. Sequence homology of Cpz4 to the previously examined ASSTs is low. However, numerous orthologs are encoded in microbial genomes and represent interesting subjects for future investigations.	1
Title: Temporal sequence of events during the initiation process in Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid replication: roles of the dnaA and dnaC gene products and ribonucleic acid polymerase Abstract: Three thermosensitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) initiation mutants of Escherichia coli exposed to the restrictive temperature for one to two generations were examined for the ability to reinitiate DNA replication after returning to the permissive temperature in the presence of rifampin, chloramphenicol, or nalidixic acid. Reinitiation in the dnaA mutant was inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas renitiation was not inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas reinitiation was not inhibited in two dnaC mutants by either rifampin or chloramphenicol. To observe the rifampin inhibition, the antibiotic must be added at least 10 min before return to the permissive temperature. The rifampin inhibition of reinitiation was not observed when a rifampin-resistant ribonucleic acid ((RNA) polymerase gene was introduced into the dnaA mutant, demonstrating that RNA polymerase synthesizes one or more RNA species required for the initation of DNA replication (origin-RNA). Reinitiation at 30 degrees C was not inhibited by streptolydigin in a stretolydigin-sensitive dnaA muntant. Incubation in the presence of nalidixic acid prevented subsequent reinitiation in the dnaC28 mutant but did not inhibit reinitiation in the dnaA5 muntant. These results demonstrate that the dnaA gene product acts before or during the synthesis of an origin-RNA, RNA polymerase synthesizes this origin RNA, and the dnaC gene product is involved in a step after this RNA synthesis event. Furthermore, these results suggest that the dnaC gene product is involved in the first deoxyribounucleotide polymerization event wheareas the dnaA gene product acts prior to this event. A model is presented describing the temporal sequence of events that occur during initiation of a round of DNA replication, based on results in this and the accompanying paper.	0
Title: Polyketide assembly lines of uncultivated sponge symbionts from structure-based gene targeting Abstract: There is increasing evidence that uncultivated bacterial symbionts are the true producers of numerous bioactive compounds isolated from marine sponges. The localization and heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes could clarify this issue and provide sustainable supplies for a wide range of pharmaceuticals. However, identification of genes in the usually highly complex symbiont communities remains a challenging task. For polyketides, one of the most important groups of sponge-derived drug candidates, we have developed a general strategy that allows one to rapidly access biosynthetic gene clusters based on chemical moieties. Using this method, we targeted polyketide synthase genes from two different sponge metagenomes. We have obtained from a sponge-bacterial association a complete pathway for the rare and potent antitumor agent psymberin from Psammocinia aff. bulbosa. The data support the symbiont hypothesis and provide insights into natural product evolution in previously inaccessible bacteria.	1
Title: Metabolic suppression identifies new antibacterial inhibitors under nutrient limitation Abstract: Characterizing new drugs and chemical probes of biological systems is hindered by difficulties in identifying the mechanism of action (MOA) of biologically active molecules. Here we present a metabolite suppression approach to explore the MOA of antibacterial compounds under nutrient restriction. We assembled an array of metabolites that can be screened for suppressors of inhibitory molecules. Further, we identified inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth under nutrient limitation and charted their interactions with our metabolite array. This strategy led to the discovery and characterization of three new antibacterial compounds, MAC168425, MAC173979 and MAC13772. We showed that MAC168425 interferes with glycine metabolism, MAC173979 is a time-dependent inhibitor of p-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis and MAC13772 inhibits biotin biosynthesis. We conclude that metabolite suppression profiling is an effective approach to focus MOA studies on compounds impairing metabolic capabilities. Such bioactives can serve as chemical probes of bacterial physiology and as leads for antibacterial drug development.	0
Title: Elucidation of substrate specificities of decorating enzymes involved in mannosylerythritol lipid production by cross-species complementation Abstract: Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are surface active molecules produced by many basidiomycetous fungi. MELs consist of a mannosylerythritol disaccharide, which is acylated with short and medium chain fatty acids at the mannosyl moiety. A gene cluster composed of five genes is required for MEL biosynthesis. Here we show that the plant pathogenic fungus Ustilago hordei secretes these glycolipids under nitrogen starvation conditions. In contrast to MELs produced by the closely related fungus Ustilago maydis those secreted by U. hordei are mostly mono-acetylated and contain a different mixture of acyl groups. Cross-species complementation between these fungi revealed that these differences result from different catalytic activities of the acetyltransferase Mat1 and the acyltransferases Mac1 and Mac2. U. maydis mat1 mutants expressing the homologous mat1 gene from U. hordei produced mostly mono-acetylated variants and lack di-acetylated MELs normally produced by U. maydis. Furthermore, we determined that the acyltransferase Mac1 acylates the mannosylerythritol moiety at position C2 while Mac2 acylates C3. The identification of decorating enzymes with different substrate specificities will allow the tailor-made production of novel subsets of MELs.	1
Title: Efficient biosynthesis of nucleoside cytokinin angustmycin A containing an unusual sugar system Abstract: Angustmycin A has anti-mycobacterial and cytokinin activities, and contains an intriguing structure in which an unusual sugar with C5'-C6' dehydration is linked to adenine via an N-glycosidic bond. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of this molecule has long remained obscure. Here, we address angustmycin A biosynthesis by the full deciphering of its pathway. We demonstrate that AgmD, C, A, E, and B function as D-allulose 6-phosphate 3-epimerase, D-allulose 6-phosphate pyrophosphokinase, adenine phosphoallulosyltransferase, phosphoribohydrolase, and phosphatase, respectively, and that these collaboratively catalyze the relay reactions to biosynthesize angustmycin C. Additionally, we provide evidence that AgmF is a noncanonical dehydratase for the final step to angustmycin A via a self-sufficient strategy for cofactor recycling. Finally, we have reconstituted the entire six-enzyme pathway in vitro and in E. coli leading to angustmycin A production. These results expand the enzymatic repertoire regarding natural product biosynthesis, and also open the way for rational and rapid discovery of other angustmycin related antibiotics.	1
Title: Sequence and transcriptional analysis of the Streptomyces glaucescens tcmAR tetracenomycin C resistance and repressor gene loci Abstract: Sequence analysis of the tcmA tetracenomycin C resistance gene from Streptomyces glaucescens GLA.O (ETH 22794) identifies one large open reading frame whose deduced product has sequence similarity to the mmr methylenomycin resistance gene from Streptomyces coelicolor, the Streptomyces rimosus tet347 (otrB) tetracycline resistance gene, and the atr1 aminotriazole resistance gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These genes are thought to encode proteins that act as metabolite export pumps powered by transmembrane electrochemical gradients. A divergently transcribed gene, tcmR, is located in the region upstream of tcmA. The deduced product of tcmR resembles the repressor proteins encoded by tetR regulatory genes from Escherichia coli and the actII-orf1 gene from S. coelicolor. Transcriptional analysis of tcmA and tcmR indicates that these genes have back-to-back and overlapping promoter regions.	1
Title: Atypical glycolysis in Clostridium thermocellum Abstract: Cofactor specificities of glycolytic enzymes in Clostridium thermocellum were studied with cellobiose-grown cells from batch cultures. Intracellular glucose was phosphorylated by glucokinase using GTP rather than ATP. Although phosphofructokinase typically uses ATP as a phosphoryl donor, we found only pyrophosphate (PPi)-linked activity. Phosphoglycerate kinase used both GDP and ADP as phosphoryl acceptors. In agreement with the absence of a pyruvate kinase sequence in the C. thermocellum genome, no activity of this enzyme could be detected. Also, the annotated pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdk) is not crucial for the generation of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), as deletion of the ppdk gene did not substantially change cellobiose fermentation. Instead pyruvate formation is likely to proceed via a malate shunt with GDP-linked PEP carboxykinase, NADH-linked malate dehydrogenase, and NADP-linked malic enzyme. High activities of these enzymes were detected in extracts of cellobiose-grown cells. Our results thus show that GTP is consumed while both GTP and ATP are produced in glycolysis of C. thermocellum. The requirement for PPi in this pathway can be satisfied only to a small extent by biosynthetic reactions, in contrast to what is generally assumed for a PPi-dependent glycolysis in anaerobic heterotrophs. Metabolic network analysis showed that most of the required PPi must be generated via ATP or GTP hydrolysis exclusive of that which happens during biosynthesis. Experimental proof for the necessity of an alternative mechanism of PPi generation was obtained by studying the glycolysis in washed-cell suspensions in which biosynthesis was absent. Under these conditions, cells still fermented cellobiose to ethanol.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products Abstract: Thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products are rare and their biosynthesis and biological significance remain unknown. Thioplatensimycin (thioPTM) and thioplatencin (thioPTN), thiocarboxylic acid congeners of the antibacterial natural products platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN), were recently discovered. Here we report the biosynthetic origin of the thiocarboxylic acid moiety in thioPTM and thioPTN. We identify a thioacid cassette encoding two proteins, PtmA3 and PtmU4, responsible for carboxylate activation by coenzyme A and sulfur transfer, respectively. ThioPTM and thioPTN bind tightly to β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (FabF) and retain strong antibacterial activities. Density functional theory calculations of binding and solvation free energies suggest thioPTM and thioPTN bind to FabF more favorably than PTM and PTN. Additionally, thioacid cassettes are prevalent in the genomes of bacteria, implicating that thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products are underappreciated. These results suggest that thiocarboxylic acid, as an alternative pharmacophore, and thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products may be considered for future drug discovery.	1
Title: Applicability of phylogenetic methods for characterizing the public health significance of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli strains Abstract: Two phylogenetic methods (multilocus sequence typing [MLST] and a multiplex PCR) were investigated to determine whether phylogenetic classification of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli serotypes correlates with their classification into groups (seropathotypes A to E) based on their relative incidence in human disease and on their association with outbreaks and serious complications. MLST was able to separate 96% of seropathotype D and E serotypes from those that cause serious disease (seropathotypes A to C), whereas the multiplex PCR lacked this level of seropathotype discrimination.	0
Title: Genetic Encoding of a Bioconjugation Handle for [2+2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions Abstract: Protein bioconjugates have many critical applications, especially in the development of therapeutics. Consequently, the design of novel methodologies to prepare protein bioconjugates is of great importance. Herein we present the development and optimization of a novel strategy to prepare bioconjugates through a genetically encoded [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. To do this, a novel unnatural amino acid (UAA) containing a dipropargyl amine functionality was synthesized and incorporated site specifically. This UAA-containing protein was reacted with an alkyne-containing fluorophore to afford a covalently linked, well-defined protein bioconjugate. This reaction is convenient with an optimized reaction time of just two hours at room temperature and yields a stable, polysubstituted benzene ring. Overall, this work contributes a new bioconjugation strategy to the growing toolbox of reactions to develop protein bioconjugates, which have a myriad of applications.	0
Title: Zwittermicin A biosynthetic cluster Abstract: The goal of this study was to identify the biosynthetic cluster for zwittermicin A, a novel, broad spectrum, aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus. The nucleotide sequence of 2.7kb of DNA flanking the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, from B. cereus UW85 revealed three open reading frames (ORFs). Of these ORFs, two had sequence similarity to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and polyketide synthases, respectively. Insertional inactivation demonstrated that orf2 is necessary for zwittermicin A production and that zmaR is necessary for high-level resistance to zwittermicin A but is not required for zwittermicin A production. Expression of ZmaR was temporally associated with zwittermicin A production. The results suggest that zmaR is part of a cluster of genes that is involved in zwittermicin A biosynthesis, representing the first biosynthetic pathway for an aminopolyol antibiotic.	1
Title: Plantazolicin A and B: structure elucidation of ribosomally synthesized thiazole/oxazole peptides from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: The structures of the ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, plantazolicin A and B, have been elucidated by high resolving ESI-MSMS, 2D (1)H-(13)C-correlated NMR spectroscopy as well as (1)H-(15)N-HMQC/(1)H-(15)N-HMBC NMR experiments. (15)N-labeling prior to the experiments facilitated the structure determination, unveiling a hitherto unusual number of thiazoles and oxazoles formed from a linear 14mer precursor peptide. This finding further extends the number of known secondary metabolites from B. amyloliquefaciens and represents a new type of secondary metabolites from the genus Bacillus.	1
Title: Dual-Color Optical Recording of Bioelectric Potentials by Polymer Electrochromism Abstract: Optical recording based on voltage-sensitive fluorescent reporters allows for spatial flexibility of measuring from desired cells, but photobleaching and phototoxicity of the fluorescent labels often limit their sensitivity and recording duration. Voltage-dependent optical absorption, rather than fluorescence, of electrochromic materials, would overcome these limitations to achieve long-term optical recording of bioelectrical signals. Electrochromic materials such as PEDOT:PSS possess the property that an applied voltage can either increase or decrease the light absorption depending on the wavelength. In this work, we harness this anticorrelated light absorption at two different wavelengths to significantly improve the signal detection. With dual-color detection, electrical activity from cells produces signals of opposite polarity, while artifacts, mechanical motions, and technical noises are uncorrelated or positively correlated. Using this technique, we are able to optically record cardiac action potentials with a high signal-to-noise ratio, 10 kHz sampling rate, >15 min recording duration, and no time-dependent degradation of the signal. Furthermore, we can reliably perform multiple recording sessions from the same culture for over 25 days.	0
Title: A phosphopantetheinylating polyketide synthase producing a linear polyene to initiate enediyne antitumor antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The enediynes, unified by their unique molecular architecture and mode of action, represent some of the most potent anticancer drugs ever discovered. The biosynthesis of the enediyne core has been predicted to be initiated by a polyketide synthase (PKS) that is distinct from all known PKSs. Characterization of the enediyne PKS involved in C-1027 (SgcE) and neocarzinostatin (NcsE) biosynthesis has now revealed that (i) the PKSs contain a central acyl carrier protein domain and C-terminal phosphopantetheinyl transferase domain; (ii) the PKSs are functional in heterologous hosts, and coexpression with an enediyne thioesterase gene produces the first isolable compound, 1,3,5,7,9,11,13-pentadecaheptaene, in enediyne core biosynthesis; and (iii) the findings for SgcE and NcsE are likely shared among all nine-membered enediynes, thereby supporting a common mechanism to initiate enediyne biosynthesis.	1
Title: Polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation in Burkholderia sp.: a molecular approach to elucidate the genes involved in the formation of two homopolymers consisting of short-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids Abstract: Burkholderia sp. accumulates polyhydrox-yalkanoates (PHAs) containing 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxy-4-pentenoic acid when grown on mineral media under limited phosphate or nitrogen, and using sucrose or gluconate as a carbon and energy source. Solvent fractionation and NMR spectroscopic characterization of these polyesters revealed the simultaneous accumulation of two homopolyesters rather than a co-polyester with random sequence distribution of the monomers [Valentin HE, Berger PA, Gruys KJ, Rodrigues MFA, Steinbuchel A, Tran M, Asrar J (1999) Macromolecules 32: 7389-7395]. To understand the genetic requirements for such unusual polyester accumulation, we probed total genomic DNA from Burkholderia sp. by Southern hybridization experiments using phaC-specific probes. These experiments indicated the presence of more than one PHA synthase gene within the genome of Burkholderia sp. However, when total genomic DNA from Burkholderia sp. was used to complement a PHA-negative mutant of Ralstonia eutropha for PHA accumulation, only one PHA synthase gene was obtained resembling the R. eutropha type of PHA synthases, based on amino acid sequence similarity. In addition to the PHA synthase gene, based on high sequence homology, genes encoding a beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase were identified in a gene cluster with the PHA synthase gene. The arrangement of the three genes is quite similar to the R. eutropha poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis operon.	1
Title: Differential regulation of breast cancer bone metastasis by PARP1 and PARP2 Abstract: PARP1 and PARP2 dual inhibitors, such as olaparib, have been recently FDA approved for the treatment of advanced breast and ovarian cancers. However, their effects on bone mass and bone metastasis are unknown. Here we show that olaparib increases breast cancer bone metastasis through PARP2, but not PARP1, specifically in the myeloid lineage, but not in the cancer cells. Olaparib treatment or PARP1/2 deletion promotes osteoclast differentiation and bone loss. Intriguingly, myeloid deletion of PARP2, but not PARP1, increases the population of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow, and impairs the expression of chemokines such as CCL3 through enhancing the transcriptional repression by β-catenin. Compromised CCL3 production in turn creates an immune-suppressive milieu by altering T cell subpopulations. Our findings warrant careful examination of current PARP inhibitors on bone metastasis and bone loss, and suggest cotreatment with CCL3, β-catenin inhibitors, anti-RANKL or bisphosphonates as potential combination therapy for PARP inhibitors.	0
Title: Cytochrome P450 for Citreohybridonol Synthesis: Oxidative Derivatization of the Andrastin Scaffold Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster similar to that for andrastin A (1) was discovered in Emericella variecolor NBRC 32302. Ctr-P450, a cytochrome P450 uniquely present in the cluster, was coexpressed with the andrastin A biosynthetic genes, leading to the production of the antifeedant agent citreohybridonol (4), along with four new andrastin derivatives. The results revealed the unusual multifunctionality of Ctr-P450 and indicated that this approach can be applied for further natural product diversification.	1
Title: Precursor proteins are transported into mitochondria in the absence of proteolytic cleavage of the additional sequences Abstract: Many nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as larger precursor polypeptides that are proteolytically processed during import into the mitochondrion. This processing appears to be catalyzed by a soluble, metal-dependent protease localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In this report we employ an in vitro system to investigate the role of processing in protein import. Intact Neurospora crassa mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled precursors in the presence of the chelator o-phenanthroline. Under these conditions, the processing of the precursors of the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase (F1 beta) and subunit 9 of the F0F1-ATPase was strongly inhibited. Protease-mapping studies indicated that import of the precursor proteins into the mitochondria continued in the absence of processing. Upon readdition of divalent metal to the treated mitochondria, the imported precursors were quantitatively converted to their mature forms. This processing of imported precursors occurred in the absence of a mitochondrial membrane potential and was extremely rapid even at 0 degrees C. This suggests that all or part of the polypeptide chain of the imported precursors had been translocated into the matrix location of the processing enzyme. Localization experiments suggested that the precursor to F1 beta is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial membrane while the precursor to subunit 9 appeared to be tightly bound to the membrane. We conclude that proteolytic processing is not necessary for the translocation of precursor proteins across mitochondrial membranes, but rather occurs subsequent to this event. On the basis of these and other results, a hypothetical pathway for the import of F1 beta and subunit 9 is proposed.	0
Title: Regiospecific chlorination of (S)-beta-tyrosyl-S-carrier protein catalyzed by SgcC3 in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is a potent antitumor antibiotic composed of an apo-protein and a reactive enediyne chromophore. The chromophore consists of four different chemical subunits including an (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety, the biosynthesis of which from l-alpha-tyrosine is catalyzed by six proteins, SgcC, SgcC1, SgcC2, SgcC3, SgcC4, and SgcC5. Biochemical characterization of SgcC3 unveiled the following: (i) SgcC3 is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent halogenase; (ii) SgcC3 acts only on the SgcC2 peptidyl carrier protein-tethered substrates; (iii) SgcC3-catalyzed halogenation requires O2 and reduced FAD and either the C-1027 pathway-specific flavin reductase SgcE6 or E. coli flavin reductase (Fre) can support the SgcC3 activity; (iv) SgcC3 also efficiently catalyzes bromination but not fluorination or iodination; (v) SgcC3 can utilize both (S)- and (R)-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 but not 3-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 as a substrate. These results establish that SgcC3 catalyzes the third enzymatic transformation during the biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety of C-1027 from l-alpha-tyrosine. SgcC3 now represents the second biochemically characterized flavin-dependent halogenase that acts on a carrier protein-tethered substrate. These findings will facilitate the engineering of new C-1027 analogs by combinatorial biosynthesis methods.	1
Title: A gene cluster for prenylated naphthoquinone and prenylated phenazine biosynthesis in Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 Abstract: Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 produces two classes of secondary metabolites of mixed isoprenoid/nonisoprenoid origin: the polyketide-isoprenoid compound furanonaphthoquinone I (FNQ I) and several prenylated phenazines, predominantly endophenazine A. We now report the cloning and sequence analysis of a 55 kb gene cluster required for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Several inactivation experiments confirmed the involvement of this gene cluster in the biosynthesis of FNQ I and endophenazine A. The six identified genes for endophenazine biosynthesis showed close similarity to phenazine biosynthetic genes from Pseudomonas. Of the 28 open reading frames identified in the adjacent FNQ I cluster, 13 showed close similarity to genes contained in the cluster for furaquinocin-a structurally similar metabolite from another Streptomyces strain. These genes included a type III polyketide synthase sequence, a momA-like monooxygenase gene, and two cloQ-like prenyltransferase genes designated fnq26 and fnq28. Inactivation experiments confirmed the involvement of fnq26 in FNQ I biosynthesis, whereas no change in secondary-metabolite formation was observed after fnq28 inactivation. The FNQ I cluster contains a contiguous group of five genes, which together encode all the enzymatic functions required for the recycling of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Two SAM-dependent methyltransferases are encoded within the cluster. Inactivation experiments showed that fnq9 is responsible for the 7-O-methylation and fnq27 for the 6-C-methylation reaction in FNQ I biosynthesis.	1
Title: Type I polyketide synthase requiring a discrete acyltransferase for polyketide biosynthesis Abstract: Type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes that are organized into modules, each of which minimally contains a beta-ketoacyl synthase, an acyltransferase (AT), and an acyl carrier protein. Here we report that the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140 consists of two PKS genes, lnmI and lnmJ, that encode six PKS modules, none of which contain the cognate AT domain. The only AT activity identified within the lnm gene cluster is a discrete AT protein encoded by lnmG. Inactivation of lnmG, lnmI, or lnmJ in vivo abolished LNM biosynthesis. Biochemical characterization of LnmG in vitro showed that it efficiently and specifically loaded malonyl CoA to all six PKS modules. These findings unveiled a previously unknown PKS architecture that is characterized by a discrete, iteratively acting AT protein that loads the extender units in trans to "AT-less" multifunctional type I PKS proteins for polyketide biosynthesis. This PKS structure provides opportunities for PKS engineering as exemplified by overexpressing lnmG to improve LNM production.	1
Title: Deoxysugar transfer during chromomycin A3 biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus: new derivatives with antitumor activity Abstract: Chromomycin A3 is an antitumor drug produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus. It consists of a tricyclic aglycone with two aliphatic side chains and two O-glycosidically linked saccharide chains, a disaccharide of 4-O-acetyl-D-oliose (sugar A) and 4-O-methyl-D-oliose (sugar B), and a trisaccharide of D-olivose (sugar C), D-olivose (sugar D), and 4-O-acetyl-L-chromose B (sugar E). The chromomycin gene cluster contains four glycosyltransferase genes (cmmGI, cmmGII, cmmGIII, and cmmGIV), which were independently inactivated through gene replacement, generating mutants C60GI, C10GII, C10GIII, and C10GIV. Mutants C10GIV and C10GIII produced the known compounds premithramycinone and premithramycin A1, respectively, indicating the involvement of CmmGIV and CmmGIII in the sequential transfer of sugars C and D and possibly also of sugar E of the trisaccharide chain, to the 12a position of the tetracyclic intermediate premithramycinone. Mutant C10GII produced two new tetracyclic compounds lacking the disaccharide chain at the 8 position, named prechromomycin A3 and prechromomycin A2. All three compounds accumulated by mutant C60GI were tricyclic and lacked sugar B of the disaccharide chain, and they were named prechromomycin A4, 4A-O-deacetyl-3A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A4, and 3A-O-acetyl-prechromomycin A4. CmmGII and CmmGI are therefore responsible for the formation of the disaccharide chain by incorporating, in a sequential manner, two D-oliosyl residues to the 8 position of the biosynthetic intermediate prechromomycin A3. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the glycosylation events in chromomycin A3 biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster of cetoniacytone A, an unusual aminocyclitol from the endosymbiotic Bacterium Actinomyces sp. Lu 9419 Abstract: A gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the antitumor agent cetoniacytone A was identified in Actinomyces sp. strain Lu 9419, an endosymbiotic bacterium isolated from the intestines of the rose chafer beetle (Cetonia aurata). The nucleotide sequence analysis of the 46 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 31 complete ORFs, including genes predicted to encode a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (CetA), a glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein (CetB), an acyltransferase (CetD), an FAD-dependent dehydrogenase (CetF2), two oxidoreductases (CetF1 and CetG), two aminotransferases (CetH and CetM), and a pyranose oxidase (CetL). CetA has previously been demonstrated to catalyze the cyclization of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to the cyclic intermediate, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone. In this report, the glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein homolog CetB was identified as a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone epimerase (EVE), a new member of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily. The 24 kDa recombinant histidine-tagged CetB was found to form a homodimer; each monomer contains two betaalphabetabetabeta scaffolds that form a metal binding site with two histidine and two glutamic acid residues. A BLAST search using the newly isolated cet biosynthetic genes revealed an analogous suite of genes in the genome of Frankia alni ACN14a, suggesting that this plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium is capable of producing a secondary metabolite related to the cetoniacytones.	1
Title: Activity of trovafloxacin (with or without ampicillin-sulbactam) against enterococci in an in vitro dynamic model of infection Abstract: Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are being increasingly identified as causal agents of infection. Trovafloxacin is a new fluoronaphthyridone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci and variable activity reported against Enterococcus spp. Twenty-one strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (one vancomycin resistant) were studied at an initial inoculum of 10(6) CFU/ml in time-kill assays with trovafloxacin (3 mg/liter), ampicillin-sulbactam (100/50 mg/liter), and the combination. Six strains of E. faecium (five vancomycin resistant) also were studied in an in vitro two-compartment dynamic model that mimics human pharmacokinetics with trovafloxacin simulated at 300 mg every 12 h (q12h), ampicillin-sulbactam at 2/1 g q6h, and the combination. Peripheral compartments were sampled q2h for 30 h for bacterial counts. Trovafloxacin MICs ranged from 0.5 to 32 mg/liter, and the nine strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium for which MICs were < or =2 mg/liter were more likely to show a reduction of 2 log units or more in viable counts in time-kill assays than were strains for which MICs were higher. Synergism with ampicillin-sulbactam was found for only one strain (trovafloxacin MIC, 16 mg/liter). Similar results were obtained in the pharmacokinetic model, with 2- to 4-log-unit reductions in viable bacteria for trovafloxacin-susceptible strains. Although no convincing evidence of synergism was found, ampicillin-sulbactam in combination minimized late bacterial regrowth of two trovafloxacin-susceptible strains. These data suggest that this high dose of trovafloxacin (with or without ampicillin-sulbactam) might be useful against strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium for which MICs were < or =2 mg/liter.	0
Title: Stereospecific Cross Couplings To Set Benzylic, All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters in High Enantiopurity Abstract: Asymmetric preparation of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is an important goal. Despite advances in formation of highly enantioenriched products with quaternary stereocenters proximal to a functional group, methods to install quaternary stereocenters isolated from functional groups are limited. Transition metal catalysis offers a potential solution, but prior cross couplings are limited to allylic substrates or deliver little to no enantiomeric enrichment. We report a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura arylation of tertiary benzylic acetates to deliver products with diaryl and triaryl quaternary stereocenters in high yields and ee's. This reaction employs an inexpensive, air-stable Ni(II) salt and commercially available phosphine ligand to transform tertiary alcohol derivatives, which are easily available in exceptional ee, into valuable products with stereoretention.	0
Title: Identification of a gene cluster encoding meilingmycin biosynthesis among multiple polyketide synthase contigs isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 Abstract: A cluster encoding genes for the biosynthesis of meilingmycin, a macrolide antibiotic structurally similar to avermectin and milbemycin alpha11, was identified among seven uncharacterized polyketide synthase gene clusters isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 by hybridization with PCR products using primers derived from the sequences of aveE, aveF and a thioesterase domain of the avermectin biosynthetic gene cluster. Introduction of a 24.1-kb deletion by targeted gene replacement resulted in a loss of meilingmycin production, confirming that the gene cluster encodes biosynthesis of this important anthelminthic antibiotic compound. A sequenced 8.6-kb fragment had aveC and aveE homologues ( meiC and meiE) linked together, as in the avermectin gene cluster, but the arrangement of aveF ( meiF) and the thioesterase homologues differed. The results should pave the way to producing novel insecticidal compounds by generating hybrids between the two pathways.	1
Title: Unveiling the post-PKS redox tailoring steps in biosynthesis of the type II polyketide antitumor antibiotic xantholipin Abstract: Xantholipin from Streptomyces flavogriseus is a curved hexacyclic aromatic polyketide antitumor antibiotic. The entire 52 kb xantholipin (xan) biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced, and bioinformatic analysis revealed open reading frames encoding type II polyketide synthases, regulators, and polyketide tailoring enzymes. Individual in-frame mutagenesis of five tailoring enzymes lead to the production of nine xantholipin analogs, revealing that the xanthone scaffold formation was catalyzed by the FAD binding monooxygenase XanO4, the δ-lactam formation by the asparagine synthetase homolog XanA, the methylenedioxy bridge generation by the P450 monooxygenase XanO2 and the hydroxylation of the carbon backbone by the FAD binding monooxygenase XanO5. These findings may also apply to other polycyclic xanthone antibiotics, and they form the basis for genetic engineering of the xantholipin and similar biosynthetic gene clusters for the generation of compounds with improved antitumor activities.	1
Title: Computational models for large-scale simulations of facilitated diffusion Abstract: The binding of site-specific transcription factors to their genomic target sites is a key step in gene regulation. While the genome is huge, transcription factors belong to the least abundant protein classes in the cell. It is therefore fascinating how short the time frame is that they require to home in on their target sites. The underlying search mechanism is called facilitated diffusion and assumes a combination of three-dimensional diffusion in the space around the DNA combined with one-dimensional random walk on it. In this review, we present the current understanding of the facilitated diffusion mechanism and identify questions that lack a clear or detailed answer. One way to investigate these questions is through stochastic simulation and, in this manuscript, we support the idea that such simulations are able to address them. Finally, we review which biological parameters need to be included in such computational models in order to obtain a detailed representation of the actual process.	0
Title: Dietary choice affects Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 colonization and disease Abstract: The likelihood that a single individual infected with the Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing, food-borne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 will develop a life-threatening sequela called the hemolytic uremic syndrome is unpredictable. We reasoned that conditions that enhance Stx binding and uptake within the gut after E. coli O157:H7 infection should result in greater disease severity. Because the receptor for Stx, globotriaosylceramide, is up-regulated in the presence of butyrate in vitro, we asked whether a high fiber diet (HFD) that reportedly enhances butyrate production by normal gut flora can influence the outcome of an E. coli O157 infection in mice. To address that question, groups of BALB/c mice were fed high (10%) or low (2%) fiber diets and infected with E. coli O157:H7 strain 86-24 (Stx2+). Mice fed an HFD exhibited a 10- to 100-fold increase in colonization, lost 15% more body weight, exhibited signs of morbidity, and had 25% greater mortality relative to the low fiber diet (LFD)-fed group. Additionally, sections of intestinal tissue from HFD-fed mice bound more Stx1 and expressed more globotriaosylceramide than did such sections from LFD-fed mice. Furthermore, the gut microbiota of HFD-fed mice compared with LFD-fed mice contained reduced levels of native Escherichia species, organisms that might protect the gut from colonization by incoming E. coli O157:H7. Taken together, these results suggest that susceptibility to infection and subsequent disease after ingestion of E. coli O157:H7 may depend, at least in part, on individual diet and/or the capacity of the commensal flora to produce butyrate.	0
Title: Evaluation of metabolism of azo dyes and their effects on Staphylococcus aureus metabolome Abstract: Dyes containing one or more azo linkages are widely applied in cosmetics, tattooing, food and drinks, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, plastics, leather, as well as paper industries. Previously we reported that bacteria living on human skin have the ability to reduce some azo dyes to aromatic amines, which raises potential safety concerns regarding human dermal exposure to azo dyes such as those in tattoo ink and cosmetic colorant formulations. To comprehensively investigate azo dye-induced toxicity by skin bacteria activation, it is very critical to understand the mechanism of metabolism of the azo dyes at the systems biology level. In this study, an LC/MS-based metabolomics approach was employed to globally investigate metabolism of azo dyes by Staphylococcus aureus as well as their effects on the metabolome of the bacterium. Growth of S. aureus in the presence of Sudan III or Orange II was not affected during the incubation period. Metabolomics results showed that Sudan III was metabolized to 4-(phenyldiazenyl) aniline (48%), 1-[(4-aminophenyl) diazenyl]-2-naphthol (4%) and eicosenoic acid Sudan III (0.9%). These findings indicated that the azo bond close to naphthalene group of Sudan III was preferentially cleaved compared with the other azo bond. The metabolite from Orange II was identified as 4-aminobenzene sulfonic acid (35%). A much higher amount of Orange II (~90×) was detected in the cell pellets from the active viable cells compared with those from boiled cells incubated with the same concentration of Orange II. This finding suggests that Orange II was primarily transported into the S. aureus cells for metabolism, instead of the theory that the azo dye metabolism occurs extracellularly. In addition, the metabolomics results showed that Sudan III affected energy pathways of the S. aureus cells, while Orange II had less noticeable effects on the cells. In summary, this study provided novel information regarding azo dye metabolism by the skin bacterium, the effects of azo dyes on the bacterial cells and the important role on the toxicity and/or inactivation of these compounds due to microbial metabolism.	0
Title: Antitumor effect of kazusamycin B on experimental tumors Abstract: Kazusamycin B, a novel antibiotic (MW 542) isolated from fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp. No. 81-484 showed a broad antitumor spectrum both in vitro and in vivo. IC50 against the growth of tumor cells was around 1 ng/ml at 72 hours-exposure in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of the antibiotic was effective in inhibiting the growth of murine tumors, S180, P388, EL-4, and B16. It was also active against doxorubicin-resistant P388, hepatic metastases of L5178Y-ML, pulmonary metastases of 3LL, and human mammary cancer MX-1 xenografted to nude mice. However, the activity of kazusamycin B toward L1210 or human lung cancer LX-1 was weaker. According to the results of comparative studies on the effect of kazusamycins B and A, an analog of B, there seemed to be no significant difference in their effectiveness. The effective dose range and toxicity were markedly dependent on tumor lines tested and the regimen used. Maximum tolerated dose in mice with subcutaneous tumors was much higher than that in mice bearing ascitic leukemia as P388. Although intermittent administration could greatly reduce the cumulative toxicity of the drug, therapeutic effect was similar with both successive and intermittent administration schedules.	0
Title: Identification of pyruvate kinase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a novel antimicrobial drug target Abstract: Novel classes of antimicrobials are needed to address the challenge of multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using the architecture of the MRSA interactome, we identified pyruvate kinase (PK) as a potential novel drug target based upon it being a highly connected, essential hub in the MRSA interactome. Structural modeling, including X-ray crystallography, revealed discrete features of PK in MRSA, which appeared suitable for the selective targeting of the bacterial enzyme. In silico library screening combined with functional enzymatic assays identified an acyl hydrazone-based compound (IS-130) as a potent MRSA PK inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 0.1 μM) with >1,000-fold selectivity over human PK isoforms. Medicinal chemistry around the IS-130 scaffold identified analogs that more potently and selectively inhibited MRSA PK enzymatic activity and S. aureus growth in vitro (MIC of 1 to 5 μg/ml). These novel anti-PK compounds were found to possess antistaphylococcal activity, including both MRSA and multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) strains. These compounds also exhibited exceptional antibacterial activities against other Gram-positive genera, including enterococci and streptococci. PK lead compounds were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors and were bactericidal. In addition, mutants with significant increases in MICs were not isolated after 25 bacterial passages in culture, indicating that resistance may be slow to emerge. These findings validate the principles of network science as a powerful approach to identify novel antibacterial drug targets. They also provide a proof of principle, based upon PK in MRSA, for a research platform aimed at discovering and optimizing selective inhibitors of novel bacterial targets where human orthologs exist, as leads for anti-infective drug development.	0
Title: Phosphate transport in Halobacterium halobium depends on cellular ATP levels Abstract: Freshly harvested Halobacterium halobium cells grown in the presence of 0.5 mM Pi took up phosphate with a low apparent Km. Import depended on intracellular ATP levels; sodium and proton (electro)chemical gradients alone were not competent to drive Pi uptake. Although most of the phosphate accumulated as Pi in the cells, efflux of Pi was difficult to achieve.	0
Title: A new Alkalitolerant Yarrowia lipolytica yeast strain is a promising model for dissecting properties and regulation of Na+ -dependent phosphate transport systems Abstract: A newly isolated osmo-, salt-, and alkalitolerant Yarrowia lipolytica yeast strain is distinguished from other yeast species by its capacity to grow vigorously at alkaline pH values (9.7), which makes it a promising model organism for studying Na+-dependent phosphate transport systems in yeasts. Phosphate uptake by Y. lipolytica cells grown at pH 9.7 was mediated by several kinetically discrete Na+-dependent systems specifically activated by Na+. One of these, a low-affinity transporter, operated at high concentrations of extracellular phosphate. The other two, high-affinity systems, maximally active in phosphate-starved cells, were repressed or derepressed depending on the prevailing extracellular phosphate concentration and pH value. The contribution of Na+/P(i)-cotransport systems to the total cellular phosphate uptake progressively increased with increasing pH, reaching its maximum at pH >/= 9.	0
Title: Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA-Gapmer Approach Abstract: Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is to replace native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a "gapmer" architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ("gap") containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA) modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA-gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: i) the formation of stable ON-RNA duplexes with base-pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 °C; and ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA-gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.	0
Title: Listeriolysin S, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Although it has long been thought that SLS and related peptides are produced by GAS and related streptococci only, there is evidence to suggest that a number of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. The distribution of the L. monocytogenes cluster is particularly noteworthy in that it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains; i.e., those responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, designated Listeriolysin S, which contributes to virulence of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. Thus, in the process of establishing the existence of an extended family of SLS-like modified virulence peptides (MVPs), the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage I L. monocytogenes may have been revealed.	1
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for cryptic phthoxazolin A in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Phthoxazolin A, an oxazole-containing polyketide, has a broad spectrum of anti-oomycete activity and herbicidal activity. We recently identified phthoxazolin A as a cryptic metabolite of Streptomyces avermitilis that produces the important anthelmintic agent avermectin. Even though genome data of S. avermitilis is publicly available, no plausible biosynthetic gene cluster for phthoxazolin A is apparent in the sequence data. Here, we identified and characterized the phthoxazolin A (ptx) biosynthetic gene cluster through genome sequencing, comparative genomic analysis, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis uncovered that the putative ptx biosynthetic genes are laid on an extra genomic region that is not found in the public database, and 8 open reading frames in the extra genomic region could be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of the oxazole ring, triene polyketide and carbamoyl moieties. Disruption of the ptxA gene encoding a discrete acyltransferase resulted in a complete loss of phthoxazolin A production, confirming that the trans-AT type I PKS system is responsible for the phthoxazolin A biosynthesis. Based on the predicted functional domains in the ptx assembly line, we propose the biosynthetic pathway of phthoxazolin A.	1
Title: An automated Genomes-to-Natural Products platform (GNP) for the discovery of modular natural products Abstract: Bacterial natural products are a diverse and valuable group of small molecules, and genome sequencing indicates that the vast majority remain undiscovered. The prediction of natural product structures from biosynthetic assembly lines can facilitate their discovery, but highly automated, accurate, and integrated systems are required to mine the broad spectrum of sequenced bacterial genomes. Here we present a genome-guided natural products discovery tool to automatically predict, combinatorialize and identify polyketides and nonribosomal peptides from biosynthetic assembly lines using LC-MS/MS data of crude extracts in a high-throughput manner. We detail the directed identification and isolation of six genetically predicted polyketides and nonribosomal peptides using our Genome-to-Natural Products platform. This highly automated, user-friendly programme provides a means of realizing the potential of genetically encoded natural products.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of taiwachelin, a lipopeptide siderophore from Cupriavidus taiwanensis Abstract: A genome mining study led to the identification of a previously unrecognised siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424. Based upon predicted structural residues, a convenient strategy for an NMR-assisted isolation of the associated metabolite was designed. The structure of the purified siderophore, taiwachelin, was fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatisation.	1
Title: Evidence for horizontal transfer of a secondary metabolite gene cluster between fungi Abstract: Background:                       Filamentous fungi synthesize many secondary metabolites and are rich in genes encoding proteins involved in their biosynthesis. Genes from the same pathway are often clustered and co-expressed in particular conditions. Such secondary metabolism gene clusters evolve rapidly through multiple rearrangements, duplications and losses. It has long been suspected that clusters can be transferred horizontally between species, but few concrete examples have been described so far.                  Results:                       In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, the avirulence gene ACE1 that codes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) belongs to a cluster of 15 genes involved in secondary metabolism. Additional related clusters were detected in the ascomycetes Chaetomium globosum, Stagonospora nodorum and Aspergillus clavatus. Gene-by-gene phylogenetic analysis showed that in C. globosum and M. grisea, the evolution of these ACE1-like clusters is characterized by successive complex duplication events including tandem duplication within the M. grisea cluster. The phylogenetic trees also present evidence that at least five of the six genes in the homologous ACE1 gene cluster in A. clavatus originated by horizontal transfer from a donor closely related to M. grisea.                  Conclusion:                       The ACE1 cluster originally identified in M. grisea is shared by only few fungal species. Its sporadic distribution within euascomycetes is mainly explained by multiple events of duplication and losses. However, because A. clavatus contains an ACE1 cluster of only six genes, we propose that horizontal transfer from a relative of M. grisea into an ancestor of A. clavatus provides a much simpler explanation of the observed data than the alternative of multiple events of duplication and losses of parts of the cluster.	1
Title: Single-cell FRET imaging of transferrin receptor trafficking dynamics by Sfp-catalyzed, site-specific protein labeling Abstract: Fluorescence imaging of living cells depends on an efficient and specific method for labeling the target cellular protein with fluorophores. Here we show that Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling is suitable for fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins that spend at least part of their membrane trafficking cycle at the cell surface. In this study, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was fused to peptide carrier protein (PCP), and the TfR1-PCP fusion protein was specifically labeled with fluorophore Alexa 488 by Sfp. The trafficking of transferrin-TfR1-PCP complex during the process of transferrin-mediated iron uptake was imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the fluorescently labeled transferrin ligand and TfR1 receptor. We thus demonstrated that Sfp-catalyzed small molecule labeling of the PCP tag represents a practical and efficient tool for molecular imaging studies in living cells.	0
Title: The Chlamydia trachomatis Extrusion Exit Mechanism Is Regulated by Host Abscission Proteins Abstract: The cellular exit strategies of intracellular pathogens have a direct impact on microbial dissemination, transmission, and engagement of immune responses of the host. Chlamydia exit their host via a budding mechanism called extrusion, which offers protective benefits to Chlamydia as they navigate their extracellular environment. Many intracellular pathogens co-opt cellular abscission machinery to facilitate cell exit, which is utilized to perform scission of two newly formed daughter cells following mitosis. Similar to viral budding exit strategies, we hypothesize that an abscission-like mechanism is required to physically sever the chlamydial extrusion from the host cell, co-opting the membrane fission activities of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) family of proteins that are necessary for cellular scission events, including abscission. To test this, C. trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells were depleted of key abscission machinery proteins charged multivesicle body protein 4b (CHMP4B), ALIX, centrosome protein 55 (CEP55), or vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4A (VPS4A), using RNA interference (RNAi). Over 50% reduction in extrusion formation was achieved by depletion of CHMP4B, VPS4A, and ALIX, but no effect on extrusion was observed with CEP55 depletion. These results demonstrate a role for abscission machinery in C. trachomatis extrusion from the host cell, with ALIX, VPS4A and CHMP4B playing key functional roles in optimal extrusion release.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mersacidin: organization of a type B lantibiotic gene cluster Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster (12.3 kb) of mersacidin, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is located on the chromosome of the producer, Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 in a region that corresponds to 348 degrees on the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis 168. It consists of 10 open reading frames and contains, in addition to the previously described mersacidin structural gene mrsA (G. Bierbaum, H. Brötz, K.-P. Koller, and H.-G. Sahl, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 127:121-126, 1995), two genes, mrsM and mrsD, coding for enzymes involved in posttranslational modification of the prepeptide; one gene, mrsT, coding for a transporter with an associated protease domain; and three genes, mrsF, mrsG, and mrsE, encoding a group B ABC transporter that could be involved in producer self-protection. Additionally, three regulatory genes are part of the gene cluster, i.e., mrsR2 and mrsK2, which encode a two-component regulatory system which seems to be necessary for the transcription of the mrsFGE operon, and mrsR1, which encodes a protein with similarity to response regulators. Transcription of mrsA sets in at early stationary phase (between 8 and 16 h of culture).	1
Title: Production of bioactive diterpenoids in the euphorbiaceae depends on evolutionarily conserved gene clusters Abstract: The Euphorbiaceae produce a diverse range of diterpenoids, many of which have pharmacological activities. These diterpenoids include ingenol mebutate, which is licensed for the treatment of a precancerous skin condition (actinic keratosis), and phorbol derivatives such as resiniferatoxin and prostratin, which are undergoing investigation for the treatment of severe pain and HIV, respectively. Despite the interest in these diterpenoids, their biosynthesis is poorly understood at present, with the only characterized step being the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate into casbene. Here, we report a physical cluster of diterpenoid biosynthetic genes from castor (Ricinus communis), including casbene synthases and cytochrome P450s from the CYP726A subfamily. CYP726A14, CYP726A17, and CYP726A18 were able to catalyze 5-oxidation of casbene, a conserved oxidation step in the biosynthesis of this family of medicinally important diterpenoids. CYP726A16 catalyzed 7,8-epoxidation of 5-keto-casbene and CYP726A15 catalyzed 5-oxidation of neocembrene. Evidence of similar gene clustering was also found in two other Euphorbiaceae, including Euphorbia peplus, the source organism of ingenol mebutate. These results demonstrate conservation of gene clusters at the higher taxonomic level of the plant family and that this phenomenon could prove useful in further elucidating diterpenoid biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Cloning and engineering of the cinnamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005 Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized oligopeptide antibiotics that contain lanthionine bridges derived by the posttranslational modification of amino acid residues. Here, we describe the cinnamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (cin) from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005, the first, to our knowledge, lantibiotic gene cluster from a high G+C bacterium to be cloned and sequenced. The cin cluster contains many genes not found in lantibiotic clusters from low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, including a Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein regulatory gene, and lacks others found in such clusters, such as a LanT-type transporter and a LanP-type protease. Transfer of the cin cluster to Streptomyces lividans resulted in heterologous production of cinnamycin. Furthermore, modification of the cinnamycin structural gene (cinA) led to production of two naturally occurring lantibiotics, duramycin and duramycin B, closely resembling cinnamycin, whereas attempts to make a more widely diverged derivative, duramycin C, failed to generate biologically active material. These results provide a basis for future attempts to construct extensive libraries of cinnamycin variants.	1
