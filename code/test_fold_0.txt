Title: Metabolic relation of cyanobacteria to aromatic compounds Abstract: Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green (micro)algae, are able to sustain many types of chemical stress because of metabolic adaptations that allow them to survive and successfully compete in a variety of ecosystems, including polluted ones. As photoautotrophic bacteria, these microorganisms synthesize aromatic amino acids, which are precursors for a large variety of substances that contain aromatic ring(s) and that are naturally formed in the cells of these organisms. Hence, the transformation of aromatic secondary metabolites by cyanobacteria is the result of the possession of a suitable "enzymatic apparatus" to carry out the biosynthesis of these compounds according to cellular requirements. Another crucial aspect that should be evaluated using varied criteria is the response of cyanobacteria to the presence of extracellular aromatic compounds. Some aspects of the relationship between aromatic compounds and cyanobacteria such as the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, the influence of aromatic compounds on these organisms and the fate of aromatic substances inside microalgal cells are presented in this paper. The search for this information has suggested that there is a lack of knowledge about the regulation of the biosynthesis of aromatic substances and about the transport of these compounds into cyanobacterial cells. These aspects are of pivotal importance with regard to the biotransformation of aromatic compounds and understanding them may be the goals of future research.	0
Title: Identification of the first diphenyl ether gene cluster for pestheic acid biosynthesis in plant endophyte Pestalotiopsis fici Abstract: The diphenyl ether pestheic acid was isolated from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, which is proposed to be the biosynthetic precursor of the unique chloropupukeananes. The pestheic acid biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster was identified in the fungus through genome scanning. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene cluster encodes a nonreducing polyketide synthase, a number of modification enzymes, and three regulators. Gene disruption and intermediate analysis demonstrated that the biosynthesis proceeded through formation of the polyketide backbone, cyclization of a polyketo acid to a benzophenone, chlorination, and formation of the diphenyl ether skeleton through oxidation and hydrolyzation. A dihydrogeodin oxidase gene, ptaE, was essential for diphenyl ether formation, and ptaM encoded a flavin-dependent halogenase catalyzing chlorination in the biosynthesis. Identification of the pta cluster laid the foundation to decipher the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway.	1
Title: Streptococcus rattus strain BHT produces both a class I two-component lantibiotic and a class II bacteriocin Abstract: Streptococcus rattus strain BHT is a species representative and strong bacteriocin producer. Here we report that S. rattus BHT produces two quite different types of bacteriocin activity, named BHT-A and BHT-B. The two bacteriocins were purified and analysed for activity and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrophotometry. BHT-A was found to be a variant of the two-component lantibiotic, Smb. BHT-B is a non-modified 5195Da peptide with some similarity to the tryptophan-rich Staphylococcus aureus bacteriocin, aureocin A53. Six S. rattus and two S. mutans strains were found to contain both the BHT-A and BHT-B genetic loci.	1

Title: Effects of acetoacetyl-CoA synthase expression on production of farnesene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: Efficient production of sesquiterpenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a high flux through the mevalonate pathway. To achieve this, the supply of acetyl-CoA plays a crucial role, partially because nine moles of acetyl-CoA are necessary to produce one mole of farnesyl diphosphate, but also to overcome the thermodynamic constraint imposed on the first reaction, in which acetoacetyl-CoA is produced from two moles of acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. Recently, a novel acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (nphT7) has been identified from Streptomyces sp. strain CL190, which catalyzes the irreversible condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA and, therefore, represents a potential target to increase the flux through the mevalonate pathway. This study investigates the effect of acetoacetyl-CoA synthase on growth as well as the production of farnesene and compares different homologs regarding their efficiency. While plasmid-based expression of nphT7 did not improve final farnesene titers, the construction of an alternative pathway, which exclusively relies on the malonyl-CoA bypass, was detrimental for growth and farnesene production. The presented results indicate that the overall functionality of the bypass was limited by the efficiency of acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (nphT7). Besides modulation of the expression level, which could be used as a means to partially restore the phenotype, nphT7 from Streptomyces glaucescens showed clearly higher efficiency compared to Streptomyces sp. strain CL190.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of xiamycin A and oxiamycin gene cluster reveals an oxidative cyclization strategy tailoring indolosesquiterpene biosynthesis Abstract: Xiamycin A (XMA) and oxiamycin (OXM) are bacterial indolosesquiterpenes featuring rare pentacyclic ring systems and are isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 02999. The putative biosynthetic gene cluster for XMA/OXM was identified by a partial genome sequencing approach. Eighteen genes were proposed to be involved in XMA/OXM biosynthesis, including five genes for terpene synthesis via a non-mevalonate pathway, eight genes encoding oxidoreductases, and five genes for regulation and resistance. Targeted disruptions of 13 genes within the xia gene cluster were carried out to probe their encoded functions in XMA/OXM biosynthesis. The disruption of xiaK, encoding an aromatic ring hydroxylase, led to a mutant producing indosespene and a minor amount of XMA. Feeding of indosespene to XMA/OXM nonproducing mutants revealed indosespene as a common precursor for XMA/OXM biosynthesis. Most notably, the flavin dependent oxygenase XiaI was biochemically characterized in vitro to convert indosespene to XMA, revealing an unusual oxidative cyclization strategy tailoring indolosesquiterpene biosynthesis.	1
Title: The bacitracin biosynthesis operon of Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716: molecular characterization of three multi-modular peptide synthetases Abstract: Background:                       The branched cyclic dodecylpeptide antibiotic bacitracin, produced by special strains of Bacillus, is synthesized nonribosomally by a large multienzyme complex composed of the three bacitracin synthetases BA1, BA2 and BA3. These enzymes activate and incorporate the constituent amino acids of bacitracin by a thiotemplate mechanism in a pathway driven by a protein template. The biochemical features of these enzymes have been studied intensively but little is known about the molecular organization of their genes.                  Results:                       The entire bacitracin synthetase operon containing the genes bacA-bacC was cloned and sequenced, identifying a modular structure typical of peptide synthetases. The bacA gene product (BA1, 598kDa) contains five modules, with an internal epimerization domain attached to the fourth; bacB encodes BA2 (297kDa), and has two modules and a carboxy-terminal epimerization domain; bacC encodes BA3, five modules (723kDa) with additional internal epimerization domains attached to the second and fourth. A carboxy-terminal putative thioesterase domain was also detected in BA3. A putative cyclization domain was found in BA1 that may be involved in thiazoline ring formation. The adenylation/thioester-binding domains of the first two BA1 modules were overproduced and the detected amino-acid specificity coincides with the first two amino acids in bacitracin. Disruption of chromosomal bacB resulted in a bacitracin-deficient mutant.                  Conclusions:                       The genes encoding the bacitracin synthetases BA1, BA2 and BA3 are organized in an operon, the structure of which reflects the modular architecture expected of peptide synthetases. In addition, a putative thiazoline ring formation domain was identified in the BA1 gene.	1
Title: Discovery and Characterization of New Hydroxamate Siderophores, Baumannoferrin A and B, produced by Acinetobacter baumannii Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii AYE does not produce acinetobactin but grows under iron limitation. Accordingly, analyses of AYE iron-restricted culture supernatants resulted in the isolation of two fractions, which contained only hydroxamates and showed siderophore activity. Structural analyses identified baumannoferrin A and baumannoferrin B, which differ only by a double bond. These siderophores are composed of citrate, 1,3-diaminopropane, 2,4-diaminobutyrate, decenoic acid, and α-ketoglutarate. Analysis of the AYE genome showed the presence of a 12-gene cluster coding for proteins similar to those involved in the production and utilization of the hydroxamate siderophores acinetoferrin and achromobactin. As A. baumannii AYE does not produce acinetobactin and harbors only one gene cluster encoding the production and utilization of a siderophore, this strain's growth under iron limitation depends on baumannoferrin, a novel hydroxamate that could play a role in its virulence.	1
Title: The impact of Paenibacillus polymyxa HY96-2 luxS on biofilm formation and control of tomato bacterial wilt Abstract: The focus of this study was to investigate the effects of luxS, a key regulatory gene of the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing (QS) system, on the biofilm formation and biocontrol efficacy against Ralstonia solanacearum by Paenibacillus polymyxa HY96-2. luxS mutants were constructed and assayed for biofilm formation of the wild-type (WT) strain and luxS mutants of P. polymyxa HY96-2 in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that luxS positively regulated the biofilm formation of HY96-2. Greenhouse experiments of tomato bacterial wilt found that from the early stage to late stage postinoculation, the biocontrol efficacy of the luxS deletion strain was the lowest with 50.70 ± 1.39% in the late stage. However, the luxS overexpression strain had the highest biocontrol efficacy with 75.66 ± 1.94% in the late stage. The complementation of luxS could restore the biocontrol efficacy of the luxS deletion strain with 69.84 ± 1.09% in the late stage, which was higher than that of the WT strain with 65.94 ± 2.73%. Therefore, we deduced that luxS could promote the biofilm formation of P. polymyxa HY96-2 and further promoted its biocontrol efficacy against R. solanacearum.	0
Title: The cyclochlorotine mycotoxin is produced by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase CctN in Talaromyces islandicus ('Penicillium islandicum') Abstract: Talaromyces islandicus ('Penicillium islandicum') is a widespread foodborne mold that produces numerous secondary metabolites, among them potent mycotoxins belonging to different chemical classes. A notable metabolite is the hepatotoxic and carcinogenic pentapeptide cyclochlorotine that contains the unusual amino acids β-phenylalanine, 2-aminobutyrate and 3,4-dichloroproline. Although the chemical structure has been known for over five decades, nothing is known about the biosynthetic pathway of cyclochlorotine. Bioinformatic analysis of the recently sequenced genome of T. islandicus identified a wealth of gene clusters potentially coding for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Here, we show by RNA interference-mediated gene silencing that a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, CctN, is responsible for the synthesis of cyclochlorotine. Moreover, we identified novel cyclochlorotine chemical variants, whose production also depended on cctN expression. Surprisingly, the halogenase required for cyclochlorotine biosynthesis is not encoded in the cct cluster. Nonetheless, our findings enabled us to propose a detailed model for cyclochlorotine biosynthesis. In addition, comparative genomics revealed that cct-like clusters are present in all of the sequenced Talaromyces strains indicating a high prevalence of cyclochlorotine production ability.	1
Title: Expression of the Clifednamide Biosynthetic Pathway in Streptomyces Generates 27,28- seco-Derivatives Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) are a group of hybrid PK-NRP natural products having a variable set of carbocyclic rings, a conserved assembly pathway, and diverse bioactivities. We report here the identification of seven new PoTeMs, clifednamides D-J (3-9), along with the known clifednamides A (1) and B (2) through rational pathway refactoring and heterologous expression. Remarkably, clifednamides D (3), G (6), and H (7) feature an unprecedented 27,28-seco skeleton. The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1-9 indicated that the hydroxy group of C-25, the methyl group of C-30, the inner five-membered ring, and the intact macrocycle are all critical for the activities. Meanwhile, the cytochrome P450 enzyme CftS023A and the hydroxylase CftS023E involved in oxidative tailoring of clifednamides were found to decorate the fused 5-6 bicyclic intermediates. Accordingly, the biosynthetic pathway for clifednamides was proposed.	1
Title: Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection Abstract: We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation-induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission "on" signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as ζ-potential and dynamic light-scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold-standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine® 2000.	0
Title: PreQ0 base, an unusual metabolite with anti-cancer activity from Streptomyces qinglanensis 172205 Abstract: PreQ0 base (7-cyano-7-deazaguanine, compound 1) is the biosynthetic precursor of queuosine-tRNA and important synthetic intermediate for bioactive compounds. It was obtained for the first time as a new natural product from a mangrove actinomycete Streptomyces qinglanensis 172205, during the course of searching for anti-cancer compounds from marine microbes. PreQ0 base showed anti-HeLa (IC50 = 62.0 μg/ml) and anti-HepG2 (IC50 = 80.6 μg/ml) activities, higher cytotoxicity than the positive control, fluorouracil. Furthermore, it exhibited weak α -glucosidase inhibitory activity, but no obvious antimicrobial and Aβ1-42 fibrillation inhibitory activities. In silico analysis of the genome of the strain 172205 revealed a putative biosynthetic gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of PreQ0 base. The gene cluster only contained three Open Reading Frames (ORFs), queC, queD and queE. The absence of the key gene queF encoding 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase catalyzing PreQ0 base to PreQ1 base suggested that the strain only has the capacity of accumulation of PreQ0 base as a metabolite, consistent with our observation in chemical identification.	1
Title: Thiol-activated gem-dithiols: a new class of controllable hydrogen sulfide donors Abstract: A class of novel thiol-activated H2S donors has been developed on the basis of the gem-dithiol template.

Title: Characterization of Two Late-Stage Enzymes Involved in Fosfomycin Biosynthesis in Pseudomonads Abstract: The broad-spectrum phosphonate antibiotic fosfomycin is currently in use for clinical treatment of infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative uropathogens. The antibiotic is biosynthesized by various streptomycetes, as well as by pseudomonads. Notably, the biosynthetic strategies used by the two genera share only two steps: the first step in which primary metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) and the terminal step in which 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-HPP) is converted to fosfomycin. Otherwise, distinct enzymatic paths are employed. Here, we biochemically confirm the last two steps in the fosfomycin biosynthetic pathway of Pseudomonas syringae PB-5123, showing that Psf3 performs the reduction of 2-oxopropylphosphonate (2-OPP) to (S)-2-HPP, followed by the Psf4-catalyzed epoxidation of (S)-2-HPP to fosfomycin. Psf4 can also accept (R)-2-HPP as a substrate but instead performs an oxidation to make 2-OPP. We show that the combined activities of Psf3 and Psf4 can be used to convert racemic 2-HPP to fosfomycin in an enantioconvergent process. X-ray structures of each enzyme with bound substrates provide insights into the stereospecificity of each conversion. These studies shed light on the reaction mechanisms of the two terminal enzymes in a distinct pathway employed by pseudomonads for the production of a potent antimicrobial agent.	1
Title: A Defined and Flexible Pocket Explains Aryl Substrate Promiscuity of the Cahuitamycin Starter Unit-Activating Enzyme CahJ Abstract: Cahuitamycins are biofilm inhibitors assembled by a convergent nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway. Previous genetic analysis indicated that a discrete enzyme, CahJ, serves as a gatekeeper for cahuitamycin structural diversification. Here, the CahJ protein was probed structurally and functionally to guide the formation of new analogues by mutasynthetic studies. This analysis enabled the in vivo production of a new cahuitamycin congener through targeted precursor incorporation.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of fragin is controlled by a novel quorum sensing signal Abstract: Members of the diazeniumdiolate class of natural compounds show potential for drug development because of their antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activities. Yet, their biosynthesis has remained elusive to date. Here, we identify a gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of the diazeniumdiolate compound fragin in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111. We provide evidence that fragin is a metallophore and that metal chelation is the molecular basis of its antifungal activity. A subset of the fragin biosynthetic genes is involved in the synthesis of a previously undescribed cell-to-cell signal molecule, valdiazen. RNA-Seq analyses reveal that valdiazen controls fragin biosynthesis and affects the expression of more than 100 genes. Homologs of the valdiazen biosynthesis genes are found in various bacteria, suggesting that valdiazen-like compounds may constitute a new class of signal molecules. We use structural information, in silico prediction of enzymatic functions and biochemical data to propose a biosynthesis route for fragin and valdiazen.	1
Title: Aryl Group Transfer from Tetraarylborato Anions to an Electrophilic Dicopper(I) Center and Mixed-Valence μ-Aryl Dicopper(I,II) Complexes Abstract: The synthesis of discrete, cationic binuclear μ-aryl dicopper complexes [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ar)DPFN]X (Ar = C6H5, 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3, and C6F5; DPFN = 2,7-bis(fluoro-di(2-pyridyl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridine; X = BAr4(-) and NTf2(-); Tf = SO2CF3) was achieved by treatment of a dicopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-NCCH3)DPFN]X2 (X = PF6(-) and NTf2(-)) with tetraarylborates. Structural characterization revealed symmetrically bridging aryl groups, and (1)H NMR spectroscopy evidenced the same structure in solution at 24 °C. Electrochemical investigation of the resulting arylcopper complexes uncovered reversible redox events that led to the synthesis and isolation of a rare mixed-valence organocopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ph)DPFN](NTf2)2 in high yield. The solid-state structure of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex exhibits inequivalent copper centers, despite a short Cu···Cu distance. Electronic and variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex suggest that the degree of spin localization is temperature-dependent, with a high degree of spin localization observed at lower temperatures. Electronic structure calculations agree with the experimental results and suggest that the spin is localized almost entirely on one metal center.	0
Title: Discovery of Venturicidin Congeners and Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-4 Abstract: Chemical screening of Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-4 with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the following chromatographic isolation led to the discovery of four 20-membered macrolides, venturicidin A (4) and three new congeners venturicidins D-F (1-3). Genome sequencing of strain S-4 revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding glycosylated type I polyketides (PKS). The BGC designated to venturicidin biosynthesis (ven) was supported by the proposed biosynthetic pathway and confirmed by inactivation of the core PKS gene of venK. Bioinformatic analyses on the conserved motifs and known stereospecificities in PKS modules are consistent with the structure and absolute configuration. This is the first report of venturicidin BGC since the discovery of the macrolide in 1961. In the biological assays, venturicidin A (4) and E (2) displayed a high selective cytotoxicity against acute monocytic leukemia MV-4-11 cells with IC50 values of 0.09 and 0.94 μM, respectively. Venturicidin A (4) also showed a weak inhibitory activity on FMS-like-tyrosine kinase.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of a natural polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound, furaquinocin A: identification and heterologous expression of the gene cluster Abstract: Furaquinocin (FQ) A, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988, is a natural polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound that exhibits a potent antitumor activity. As a first step toward understanding the biosynthetic machinery of this unique and pharmaceutically useful compound, we have cloned an FQ A biosynthetic gene cluster by taking advantage of the fact that an isoprenoid biosynthetic gene cluster generally exists in flanking regions of the mevalonate (MV) pathway gene cluster in actinomycetes. Interestingly, Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988 was the first example of a microorganism equipped with two distinct mevalonate pathway gene clusters. We were able to localize a 25-kb DNA region that harbored FQ A biosynthetic genes (fur genes) in both the upstream and downstream regions of one of the MV pathway gene clusters (MV2) by using heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK23. This was the first example of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of a polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound. We have also confirmed that four genes responsible for viguiepinol [3-hydroxypimara-9(11),15-diene] biosynthesis exist in the upstream region of the other MV pathway gene cluster (MV1), which had previously been cloned from strain KO-3988. This was the first example of prokaryotic enzymes with these biosynthetic functions. By phylogenetic analysis, these two MV pathway clusters were identified as probably being independently distributed in strain KO-3988 (orthologs), rather than one cluster being generated by the duplication of the other cluster (paralogs).	1
Title: Structural basis of 7SK RNA 5'-γ-phosphate methylation and retention by MePCE Abstract: Among RNA 5'-cap structures, γ-phosphate monomethylation is unique to a small subset of noncoding RNAs, 7SK and U6 in humans. 7SK is capped by methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE), which has a second nonenzymatic role as a core component of the 7SK ribonuclear protein (RNP), an essential regulator of RNA transcription. We report 2.0- and 2.1-Å X-ray crystal structures of the human MePCE methyltransferase domain bound to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and uncapped or capped 7SK substrates, respectively. 7SK recognition is achieved by protein contacts to a 5'-hairpin-single-stranded RNA region, thus explaining MePCE's specificity for 7SK and U6. The structures reveal SAH and product RNA in a near-transition-state geometry. Unexpectedly, binding experiments showed that MePCE has higher affinity for capped versus uncapped 7SK, and kinetic data support a model of slow product release. This work reveals the molecular mechanism of methyl transfer and 7SK retention by MePCE for subsequent assembly of 7SK RNP.	0
Title: A Versatile Transcription-Translation in One Approach for Activation of Cryptic Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Abstract: The ever-growing drug resistance problem worldwide highlights the urgency to discover and develop new drugs. Microbial natural products are a prolific source of drugs. Genome sequencing has revealed a tremendous amount of uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoded within microbial genomes, most of which are cryptic or express at very low levels under standard culture conditions. Therefore, developing effective strategies to awaken these cryptic BGCs is of great interest for natural product discovery. In this study, we designed and validated a Transcription-Translation in One (TTO) approach for activation of cryptic BGCs. This approach aims to alter the metabolite profiles of target strains by directly overexpressing exogenous rpsL (encoding ribosomal protein S12) and rpoB (encoding RNA polymerase β subunit) genes containing beneficial mutations for natural product production using a plug-and-play plasmid system. As a result, this approach bypasses the tedious screening work and overcomes the false positive problem in the traditional ribosome engineering approach. In this work, the TTO approach was successfully applied to activating cryptic BGCs in three Streptomyces strains, leading to the discovery of two aromatic polyketide antibiotics, piloquinone and homopiloquinone. We further identified a single BGC responsible for the biosynthesis of both piloquinone and homopiloquinone, which features an unusual starter unit incorporation step. This powerful strategy can be further exploited for BGC activation in strains even beyond streptomycetes, thus facilitating natural product discovery research in the future.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the pyridomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces pyridomyceticus NRRL B-2517 Abstract: Pyridomycin is a structurally unique antimycobacterial cyclodepsipeptide containing rare 3-(3-pyridyl)-l-alanine and 2-hydroxy-3-methylpent-2-enoic acid moieties. The biosynthetic gene cluster for pyridomycin has been cloned and identified from Streptomyces pyridomyceticus NRRL B-2517. Sequence analysis of a 42.5-kb DNA region revealed 26 putative open reading frames, including two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and a polyketide synthase gene. A special feature is the presence of a polyketide synthase-type ketoreductase domain embedded in an NRPS. Furthermore, we showed that PyrA functioned as an NRPS adenylation domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and transfers it to a discrete peptidyl carrier protein, PyrU, which functions as a loading module that initiates pyridomycin biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro. PyrA could also activate other aromatic acids, generating three pyridomycin analogues in vivo.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the aurachin RE biosynthesis gene cluster afford a new cytochrome P450 for quinoline N-hydroxylation Abstract: Aurachin RE is a prenylated quinoline antibiotic that was first isolated from the genus Rhodococcus. It shows potent antibacterial activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria. Here we have identified a minimal biosynthesis gene cluster for aurachin RE in Rhodococcus erythropolis JCM 6824 by using random transposon mutagenesis and heterologous production. The Rhodococcus aurachin (rau) gene cluster consists of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (rauA), prenyltransferase, polyketide synthase, and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, as well as others including genes involved in regulation and transport. Markerless gene disruption of rauA resulted in the complete loss of aurachin RE production and in the accumulation of a new aurachin derivative lacking the N-hydroxy group. When the recombinant RauA was expressed in Escherichia coli, it catalyzed N-hydroxylation of the derivative to form aurachin RE. This study establishes the biosynthetic pathway of aurachin RE and provides experimental evidence for the role of P450 RauA in catalyzing N-hydroxylation of the quinoline ring, which is indispensable for the antibacterial activity of aurachin RE.	1
Title: Directed Evolution and Structural Analysis of Alkaline Pectate Lyase from the Alkaliphilic Bacterium Bacillus sp. Strain N16-5 To Improve Its Thermostability for Efficient Ramie Degumming Abstract: Thermostable alkaline pectate lyases have potential applications in the textile industry as an alternative to chemical-based ramie degumming processes. In particular, the alkaline pectate lyase from Bacillus sp. strain N16-5 (BspPelA) has potential for enzymatic ramie degumming because of its high specific activity under extremely alkaline conditions without the requirement for additional Ca(2+). However, BspPelA displays poor thermostability and is inactive after incubation at 50°C for only 30 min. Here, directed evolution was used to improve the thermostability of BspPelA for efficient and stable degumming. After two rounds of error-prone PCR and screening of >12,000 mutants, 10 mutants with improved thermostability were obtained. Sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that single E124I, T178A, and S271G substitutions were responsible for improving thermostability. Structural and molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated that the formation of a hydrophobic cluster and new H-bond networks was the key factor contributing to the improvement in thermostability with these three substitutions. The most thermostable combined mutant, EAET, exhibited a 140-fold increase in the t50 (time at which the enzyme loses 50% of its initial activity) value at 50°C, accompanied by an 84.3% decrease in activity compared with that of wild-type BspPelA, while the most advantageous combined mutant, EA, exhibited a 24-fold increase in the t50 value at 50°C, with a 23.3% increase in activity. Ramie degumming with the EA mutant was more efficient than that with wild-type BspPelA. Collectively, our results suggest that the EA mutant, exhibiting remarkable improvements in thermostability and activity, has the potential for applications in ramie degumming in the textile industry.	0
Title: Evidence that biosynthesis of the neurotoxic alkaloids anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a in the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria PCC 6506 occurs on a modular polyketide synthase initiated by L-proline Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are potent neurotoxins produced by cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria PCC 6506. Sequencing of the genome of this strain is underway, and we have identified a 29 kb DNA fragment containing a sequence called ks2 that we previously showed to be specific to Oscillatoria cyanobacteria producing anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a. Bioinformatic analysis of this 29 kb fragment revealed a cluster of genes, which were annotated. The function assigned to the products of eight contiguous genes, from anaA to anaH, provides a clue to the biosynthesis of anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a. Proline is first loaded on an acyl carrier protein and its five-membered cycle oxidized to the pyrroline oxidation state. This activated ring is then successively loaded on three polyketide synthase modules for elongation, reduction, cyclization, and methylation. The final step is the hydrolysis of the thioester with subsequent decarboxylation. GC-MS and NMR analyses of homoanatoxin-a produced by PCC 6506 using labeled precursors confirm that proline is very likely the starter of these polyketide synthases. Using specific PCR amplifications, we have also shown that the anaC, anaE, anaF, and anaG genes are always present in the genome of cyanobacteria producing anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a and absent in nonproducing strains. Histidine-tagged AnaC was purified to homogeneity and showed to catalyze the loading of proline on purified histidine-tagged AnaD that had been previously transformed into its holo form using the Bacillus subtilis Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase. All of these data provide strong evidence that we have successfully identified the gene cluster responsible for the production of anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a in Oscillatoria PCC 6506.	1
Title: Serine proteases from two cell types target different components of a complex that governs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of pro-sigmaK during Bacillus subtilis development Abstract: Upon starvation Bacillus subtilis undergoes a developmental process involving creation of two cell types, the mother cell and forespore. A signal in the form of a serine protease, SpoIVB, is secreted from the forespore and leads to regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of pro-sigmaK, releasing active sigmaK into the mother cell. RIP of pro-sigmaK is carried out by a membrane-embedded metalloprotease, SpoIVFB, which is inactive when bound by BofA and SpoIVFA. We have investigated the mechanism by which this complex is activated. By expressing components of the signalling pathway in Escherichia coli, we reconstructed complete inhibition of pro-sigmaK RIP by BofA and SpoIVFA, and found that SpoIVB serine protease activity could partially restore RIP, apparently by targeting SpoIVFA. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that SpoIVFA synthesized early during B. subtilis sporulation is lost in a SpoIVB-dependent fashion, coincident with the onset of pro-sigmaK RIP, supporting the idea that SpoIVB targets SpoIVFA to trigger RIP of pro-sigmaK. Loss of BofA depended not only on SpoIVB, but also on CtpB, a serine protease secreted from the mother cell. CtpB appeared to cleave BofA near its C-terminus upon coexpression in E. coli, and purified CtpB degraded BofA. We propose that RIP of pro-sigmaK involves a three-step proteolytic cascade in which SpoIVB first cleaves SpoIVFA, CtpB then cleaves BofA and finally SpoIVFB cleaves pro-sigmaK.	0
Title: Characteristics of the bovicin HJ50 gene cluster in Streptococcus bovis HJ50 Abstract: Bovicin HJ50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50; its encoding gene bovA was reported in our previous publication. To identify other genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production, DNA fragments flanking bovA were cloned and sequenced. The bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal DNA and consisted of at least nine genes in the following order: bovA, -M, -T, -E, -F, ORF1, ORF2, bovK and bovR. A thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovR. A knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin HJ50 in S. bovis HJ50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin HJ50 production. Transcriptional analyses showed that bovA, bovM and bovT constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bovA promoter was located at a G residue 45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bovA, while bovE through bovR were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bovE promoter was located at a C residue 35 bp upstream of bovE. We also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin HJ50 in Lactococcus lactis MG1363, which lacks thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of Tailoring Methyltransferases Involved in K-41A Biosynthesis: Modulating Methylation to Improve K-41A Anti-infective Activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for polyether antibiotic K-41A was identified from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01680 and subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic study. Bioinformatics analyses, gene disruption, and metabolomics analyses afforded eight new derivatives and one known polyether, showcasing five region-specific methyltransferases Pak13, Pak15, Pak20, Pak31, and Pak38 and their respective modification loci. Moreover, bioassays revealed that two disaccharide-bearing polyethers, K-41B and K-41Bm, display enhanced anti-HIV and potent antibacterial activities.	1
Title: Isolation, characterization, and quantitative analysis of Microviridin J, a new Microcystis metabolite toxic to Daphnia Abstract: This paper describes the purification and characterization of microviridin J. a newly discovered metabolite of Microcystis that causes a lethal molting disruption in Daphnia spp., upon ingestion of living cyanobacterial cells. Microviridin J consists of an acetylated chain of 13 amino acids arranged in three rings and two side chains. Unlike other known isoforms of microviridin, microviridin J contains arginine that imparts a unique solution conformation characterized by proximal hydrophobic interactions between Arg and other regions of the molecule. This eventually results in the formation and stabilization of an additional ring system. Microviridin J potently inhibits porcine trypsin, bovine chymotrypsin, and daphnid trypsin-like proteases. The activity against trypsin is most likely due to Arg and its distinctive conformational interactions. Overall, the data presented for microviridin J emphasize once again the ability of cyanobacteria to produce numerous and potent environmental toxins.	1
Title: Correlational networking guides the discovery of unclustered lanthipeptide protease-encoding genes Abstract: Bacterial natural product biosynthetic genes, canonically clustered, have been increasingly found to rely on hidden enzymes encoded elsewhere in the genome for completion of biosynthesis. The study and application of lanthipeptides are frequently hindered by unclustered protease genes required for final maturation. Here, we establish a global correlation network bridging the gap between lanthipeptide precursors and hidden proteases. Applying our analysis to 161,954 bacterial genomes, we establish 5209 correlations between precursors and hidden proteases, with 91 prioritized. We use network predictions and co-expression analysis to reveal a previously missing protease for the maturation of class I lanthipeptide paenilan. We further discover widely distributed bacterial M16B metallopeptidases of previously unclear biological function as a new family of lanthipeptide proteases. We show the involvement of a pair of bifunctional M16B proteases in the production of previously unreported class III lanthipeptides with high substrate specificity. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our correlational networking approach to the discovery of hidden lanthipeptide proteases and potentially other missing enzymes for natural products biosynthesis.	1
Title: Expression and purification of the 5'-nucleotidase YitU from Bacillus species: its enzymatic properties and possible applications in biotechnology Abstract: 5'-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides plus phosphate. In the present study, to search for new genes encoding 5'-nucleotidases specific for purine nucleotides in industrially important Bacillus species, "shotgun" cloning and the direct selection of recombinant clones grown in purine nucleosides at inhibitory concentrations were performed in the Escherichia coli GS72 strain, which is sensitive to these compounds. As a result, orthologous yitU genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, whose products belong to the ubiquitous haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF), were selected and found to have a high sequence similarity of 87%. B. subtilis YitU was produced in E. coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein, purified and biochemically characterized as a soluble 5'-nucleotidase with broad substrate specificity with respect to various deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside monophosphates: dAMP, GMP, dGMP, CMP, AMP, XMP, IMP and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (AICAR-P). However, the preferred substrate for recombinant YitU was shown to be flavin mononucleotide (FMN). B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens yitU overexpression increased riboflavin (RF) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) accumulation and can be applied to breed highly performing RF- and AICAR-producing strains.	0
Title: Overproduction of wild-type and bioengineered derivatives of the lantibiotic lacticin 3147 Abstract: Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum two-peptide lantibiotic whose genetic determinants are located on two divergent operons on the lactococcal plasmid pMRC01. Here we introduce each of 14 subclones, containing different combinations of lacticin 3147 genes, into MG1363 (pMRC01) and determine that a number of them can facilitate overproduction of the lantibiotic. Based on these studies it is apparent that while the provision of additional copies of genes encoding the biosynthetic/production machinery and the regulator LtnR is a requirement for high-level overproduction, the presence of additional copies of the structural genes (i.e., ltnA1A2) is not.	1
Title: Nicking endonucleases Abstract: Nicking endonucleases are a new type of enzymes. Like restriction endonucleases, they recognize short specific DNA sequence and cleave DNA at a fixed position relatively to the recognition sequence. However, unlike restriction endonucleases, nicking endonucleases cleave only one predetermined DNA strand. Until recently, nicking endonucleases were suggested to be naturally mutated restriction endonucleases which had lost their ability to dimerize and as a result the ability to cleave the second strand. We have shown that nicking endonucleases are one of the subunits of heterodimeric restriction endonucleases. Mechanisms used by various restriction endonucleases for double-stranded cleavage, designing of artificial nicking endonucleases on the basis of restriction endonucleases, and application of nicking endonucleases in molecular biology are reviewed.	0
Title: Caboxamycin biosynthesis pathway and identification of novel benzoxazoles produced by cross-talk in Streptomyces sp. NTK 937 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. NTK937, producer of benzoxazole antibiotic caboxamycin, produces in addition a methyl ester derivative, O-methylcaboxamycin. Caboxamycin cluster, comprising one regulatory and nine structural genes, has been delimited, and each gene has been individually inactivated to demonstrate its role in the biosynthetic process. The O-methyltransferase potentially responsible for O-methylcaboxamycin synthesis would reside outside this cluster. Five of the genes, cbxR, cbxA, cbxB, cbxD and cbxE, encoding a SARP transcriptional regulator, salicylate synthase, 3-oxoacyl-ACP-synthase, ACP and amidohydrolase, respectively, have been found to be essential for caboxamycin biosynthesis. The remaining five structural genes were found to have paralogues distributed throughout the genome, capable of partaking in the process when their cluster homologue is inactivated. Two of such paralogues, cbxC' and cbxI', coding an AMP-dependent synthetase-ligase and an anthranilate synthase, respectively, have been identified. However, the other three genes might simultaneously have more than one paralogue, given that cbxF (DAHP synthase), cbxG (2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase) and cbxH (isochorismatase) have three, three and five putative paralogue genes, respectively, of similar function within the genome. As a result of genetic manipulation, a novel benzoxazole (3'-hydroxycaboxamycin) has been identified in the salicylate synthase-deficient mutant strain ΔcbxA. 3'-hydroxycaboxamycin derives from the cross-talk between the caboxamycin and enterobactin pathways.	1
Title: Prospective Study of Plasmodium vivax Malaria Recurrence after Radical Treatment with a Chloroquine-Primaquine Standard Regimen in Turbo, Colombia Abstract: Plasmodium vivax recurrences help maintain malaria transmission. They are caused by recrudescence, reinfection, or relapse, which are not easily differentiated. A longitudinal observational study took place in Turbo municipality, Colombia. Participants with uncomplicated P. vivax infection received supervised treatment concomitantly with 25 mg/kg chloroquine and 0.25 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days. Incidence of recurrence was assessed over 180 days. Samples were genotyped, and origins of recurrences were established. A total of 134 participants were enrolled between February 2012 and July 2013, and 87 were followed for 180 days, during which 29 recurrences were detected. The cumulative incidence of first recurrence was 24.1% (21/87) (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.6 to 33.7%), and 86% (18/21) of these events occurred between days 51 and 110. High genetic diversity of P. vivax strains was found, and 12.5% (16/128) of the infections were polyclonal. Among detected recurrences, 93.1% (27/29) of strains were genotyped as genetically identical to the strain from the previous infection episode, and 65.5% (19/29) of infections were classified as relapses. Our results indicate that there is a high incidence of P. vivax malaria recurrence after treatment in Turbo municipality, Colombia, and that a large majority of these episodes are likely relapses from the previous infection. We attribute this to the primaquine regimen currently used in Colombia, which may be insufficient to eliminate hypnozoites.	0
Title: CloR, a bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase involved in clorobiocin biosynthesis Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and clorobiocin contain a 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (3DMA-4HB) moiety. The biosynthesis of this moiety has now been identified by biochemical and molecular biological studies. CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12976 has recently been identified as a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-3-dimethylallyltransferase. In the present study, the enzyme CloR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase, which converts 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (3DMA-4HPP) via 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA) to 3DMA-4HB by two consecutive oxidative decarboxylation steps. In 18O2 labeling experiments we showed that two oxygen atoms are incorporated into the intermediate 3DMA-4HMA in the first reaction step, but only one further oxygen is incorporated into the final product 3DMA-4HB during the second reaction step. CloR does not show sequence similarity to known oxygenases. It apparently presents a novel member of the diverse family of the non-heme iron (II) and alpha-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases, with 3DMA-4HPP functioning both as an alpha-keto acid and as a hydroxylation substrate. The reaction catalyzed by CloR represents a new pathway for the formation of benzoic acids in nature.	1
Title: Disruption of the siderophore-binding desE receptor gene in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) results in impaired growth in spite of multiple iron-siderophore transport systems Abstract: Ferrioxamines-mediated iron acquisition by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has recently received increased attention. In addition to the biological role of desferrioxamines (dFOs) as hydroxamate siderophores, and the pharmaceutical application of dFO-B as an iron-chelator, the ferrioxamines have been shown to mediate microbial interactions. In S. coelicolor the siderophore-binding receptors DesE (Sco2780) and CdtB (Sco7399) have been postulated to specifically recognize and uptake FO-E (cyclic) and FO-B (linear) respectively. Here, disruption of the desE gene in S. coelicolor, and subsequent phenotypic analysis, is used to demonstrate a link between iron metabolism and physiological and morphological development. Streptomyces coelicolor desE mutants, isolated in both wild-type (M145) and a coelichelin biosynthesis and transport minus background (mutant W3), a second hydroxamate siderophore system only found in S. coelicolor and related species, resulted in impaired growth and lack of sporulation. This phenotype could only be partially rescued by expression in trans of either desE and cdtB genes, which contrasted with the ability of FO-E, and to a lesser extent of FO-B, to fully restore growth at µM concentrations, with a concomitant induction of a marked phenotypic response involving precocious synthesis of actinorhodin and sporulation. Moreover, growth restoration of the desE mutant by complementation with desE and cdtB showed that DesE, which is universally conserved in Streptomyces, and CdtB, only present in certain streptomycetes, have partial equivalent functional roles under laboratory conditions, implying overlapping ferrioxamine specificities. The biotechnological and ecological implications of these observations are discussed.	1
Title: Limits of life in hostile environments: no barriers to biosphere function? Abstract: Environments that are hostile to life are characterized by reduced microbial activity which results in poor soil- and plant-health, low biomass and biodiversity, and feeble ecosystem development. Whereas the functional biosphere may primarily be constrained by water activity (a(w)) the mechanism(s) by which this occurs have not been fully elucidated. Remarkably we found that, for diverse species of xerophilic fungi at a(w) values of <or= 0.72, water activity per se did not limit cellular function. We provide evidence that chaotropic activity determined their biotic window, and obtained mycelial growth at water activities as low as 0.647 (below that recorded for any microbial species) by addition of compounds that reduced the net chaotropicity. Unexpectedly we found that some fungi grew optimally under chaotropic conditions, providing evidence for a previously uncharacterized class of extremophilic microbes. Further studies to elucidate the way in which solute activities interact to determine the limits of life may lead to enhanced biotechnological processes, and increased productivity of agricultural and natural ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the polyene antifungal antibiotic nystatin in Streptomyces noursei ATCC 11455: analysis of the gene cluster and deduction of the biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Background:                       The polyene macrolide antibiotic nystatin produced by Streptomyces noursei ATCC 11455 is an important antifungal agent. The nystatin molecule contains a polyketide moiety represented by a 38-membered macrolactone ring to which the deoxysugar mycosamine is attached. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the nystatin biosynthesis is of considerable interest because this information can be used for the generation of new antifungal antibiotics.                  Results:                       A DNA region of 123,580 base pairs from the S. noursei ATCC 11455 genome was isolated, sequenced and shown by gene disruption to be involved in nystatin biosynthesis. Analysis of the DNA sequence resulted in identification of six genes encoding a modular polyketide synthase (PKS), genes for thioesterase, deoxysugar biosynthesis, modification, transport and regulatory proteins. One of the PKS-encoding genes, nysC, was found to encode the largest (11,096 amino acids long) modular PKS described to date. Analysis of the deduced gene products allowed us to propose a model for the nystatin biosynthetic pathway in S. noursei.                  Conclusions:                       A complete set of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the antifungal polyene antibiotic nystatin in S. noursei ATCC 11455 has been cloned and analyzed. This represents the first example of the complete DNA sequence analysis of a polyene antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster. Manipulation of the genes identified within the cluster may potentially lead to the generation of novel polyketides and yield improvements in the production strains.	1
Title: Arginine biosynthesis and regulation in Lactobacillus plantarum: the carA gene and the argCJBDF cluster are divergently transcribed Abstract: A cluster of citrulline biosynthetic genes has been cloned and sequenced from a fragment of Lactobacillus plantarum CCM 1904 (ATCC 8014) DNA isolated as complementing a Bacillus subtilis argF mutation. The gene order was carA-argCJBDF, with carA transcribed divergently from the arg cluster. Although other gram-positive bacteria show similar arg clusters, this arrangement for carA is thus far unprecedented. Downstream from the arg cluster, two open reading frames (ORF7 and ORF8) having unknown functions were found. Sequence analysis of the end of a 10.5-kb cloned DNA fragment showed that argF was 3.5 kb from the ldhL gene coding for L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase. A tree representation of amino acid sequence clustering relationships of 31 ornithine carbamoyltransferases (OTCases) from various organisms revealed two prokaryotic groups: one with ArgF of L. plantarum and one with ArgF of B. subtilis, which are paralogous. This divergence was not observed in vivo because an L. plantarum argF mutant (AM 1215) harboring no OTCase activity was complemented by the argF genes of L. plantarum and B. subtilis. No OTCase activity was detectable when L. plantarum was grown in the presence of saturating amounts of arginine or citrulline. Arginine may repress the citrulline biosynthetic genes in L. plantarum by using 11 identified DNA motifs which resemble the Escherichia coli ARG box consensus and which are in most cases separated by multiples of 11 bp, corresponding to a DNA helical turn. The carA and argCJBDF genes are divergently transcribed. Their putative promoters are 6 bp apart and are partially overlapped by putative ARG boxes, suggesting concerted transcription regulation.	1
Title: Competitive activity-based protein profiling identifies aza-β-lactams as a versatile chemotype for serine hydrolase inhibition Abstract: Serine hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme classes in Nature. Most serine hydrolases lack selective inhibitors, which are valuable probes for assigning functions to these enzymes. We recently discovered a set of aza-β-lactams (ABLs) that act as potent and selective inhibitors of the mammalian serine hydrolase protein-phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1). The ABLs inactivate PME-1 by covalent acylation of the enzyme's serine nucleophile, suggesting that they could offer a general scaffold for serine hydrolase inhibitor discovery. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by screening ABLs more broadly against cell and tissue proteomes by competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), leading to the discovery of lead inhibitors for several serine hydrolases, including the uncharacterized enzyme α,β-hydrolase domain-containing 10 (ABHD10). ABPP-guided medicinal chemistry yielded a compound ABL303 that potently (IC(50) ≈ 30 nM) and selectively inactivated ABHD10 in vitro and in living cells. A comparison of optimized inhibitors for PME-1 and ABHD10 indicates that modest structural changes that alter steric bulk can tailor the ABL to selectively react with distinct, distantly related serine hydrolases. Our findings, taken together, designate the ABL as a versatile reactive group for creating first-in-class serine hydrolase inhibitors.	0
Title: CRISPR-Cas9-Based Discovery of the Verrucosidin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Penicillium polonicum Abstract: Penicillium polonicum, commonly found on food matrices, is a mycotoxigenic species able to produce a neurotoxin called verrucosidin. This methylated α-pyrone polyketide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and thereby causes neurological diseases. Despite the importance of verrucosidin as a toxin, its biosynthetic genes have not been characterized yet. By similarity analysis with the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for the α-pyrones aurovertin (AurA) and citreoviridin (CtvA), 16 PKS genes for putative α-pyrones were identified in the P. polonicum genome. A single PKS gene, verA, was found to be transcribed under verrucosidin-producing growth conditions. The annotated functions of the genes neighboring verA correspond to those required for verrucosidin biosynthesis. To prove the involvement of verA in verrucosidin biosynthesis, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) technology was applied to P. polonicum. In vitro reconstituted CRISPR-Cas9 was used to induce targeted gene deletions in P. polonicum. This approach allowed identifying and characterizing the verrucosidin biosynthetic gene cluster. VerA deletion mutants were no longer able to produce verrucosidin, whereas they were displaying morphological characteristics comparable with the wild-type strain. The available CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows characterizing the biosynthetic potential of P. polonicum as a valuable source of novel compounds.	1
Title: Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was measured during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus by radioactive thymidine incorporation, autoradiography, and chemical analysis. Microcysts contained an average of 6.6 conserved units of DNA, corresponding to 3 to 4 chromosomes per cell. Correlation of the DNA content and chromosome number of microcysts indicated that the molecular weight of the nonreplicating M. xanthus chromosome is 4.9 x 10(9) daltons. DNA synthesis was initiated 3.5 to 4 hr after induction of germination. From 4 to 6 hr, the rate of synthesis was constant and the accumulation was linear. After a lag period (6 to 6.5 hr), the rate of DNA synthesis increased, reaching a second plateau at 9 hr. From 9 to 11 hr, the rate was again constant and the accumulation was linear. Cellular division during germination showed an unusual kind of synchrony. A model is presented that accounts for chromosomal replication and cell division during microcyst germination.	0
Title: Evolution of a plant gene cluster in Solanaceae and emergence of metabolic diversity Abstract: Plants produce phylogenetically and spatially restricted, as well as structurally diverse specialized metabolites via multistep metabolic pathways. Hallmarks of specialized metabolic evolution include enzymatic promiscuity and recruitment of primary metabolic enzymes and examples of genomic clustering of pathway genes. Solanaceae glandular trichomes produce defensive acylsugars, with sidechains that vary in length across the family. We describe a tomato gene cluster on chromosome 7 involved in medium chain acylsugar accumulation due to trichome specific acyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase genes. This cluster co-localizes with a tomato steroidal alkaloid gene cluster and is syntenic to a chromosome 12 region containing another acylsugar pathway gene. We reconstructed the evolutionary events leading to this gene cluster and found that its phylogenetic distribution correlates with medium chain acylsugar accumulation across the Solanaceae. This work reveals insights into the dynamics behind gene cluster evolution and cell-type specific metabolite diversity.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of 9-methylstreptimidone involves a new decarboxylative step for polyketide terminal diene formation Abstract: 9-Methylstreptimidone is a glutarimide antibiotic showing antiviral, antifungal, and antitumor activities. Genome scanning, bioinformatics analysis, and gene inactivation experiments reveal a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of 9-methylstreptimidone in Streptomyces himastatinicus. The unveiled machinery features both acyltransferase- and thioesterase-less iterative use of module 5 as well as a branching module for glutarimide generation. Impressively, inactivation of smdK leads to a new carboxylate analogue unveiling a new mechanism for polyketide terminal diene formation.	1
Title: Mechanistic dissection of the enzyme complexes involved in biosynthesis of lacticin 3147 and nisin Abstract: The thioether rings in the lantibiotics lacticin 3147 and nisin are posttranslationally introduced by dehydration of serines and threonines, followed by coupling of these dehydrated residues to cysteines. The prepeptides of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147, LtnA1 and LtnA2, are dehydrated and cyclized by two corresponding bifunctional enzymes, LtnM1 and LtnM2, and are subsequently processed and exported via one bifunctional enzyme, LtnT. In the nisin synthetase complex, the enzymes NisB, NisC, NisT, and NisP dehydrate, cyclize, export, and process prenisin, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of LtnM2 and LtnT can modify, process, and transport peptides entirely different from LtnA2 and that LtnT can process and transport unmodified LtnA2 and unrelated peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate a higher extent of NisB-mediated dehydration in the absence of thioether rings. Thioether rings apparently inhibited dehydration, which implies alternating actions of NisB and NisC. Furthermore, certain (but not all) NisC-cyclized peptides were exported with higher efficiency as a result of their conformation. Taken together, these data provide further insight into the applicability of Lactococcus lactis strains containing lantibiotic enzymes for the design and production of modified peptides.	1
Title: Variation in Fumonisin and Ochratoxin Production Associated with Differences in Biosynthetic Gene Content in Aspergillus niger and A. welwitschiae Isolates from Multiple Crop and Geographic Origins Abstract: The fungi Aspergillus niger and A. welwitschiae are morphologically indistinguishable species used for industrial fermentation and for food and beverage production. The fungi also occur widely on food crops. Concerns about their safety have arisen with the discovery that some isolates of both species produce fumonisin (FB) and ochratoxin A (OTA) mycotoxins. Here, we examined FB and OTA production as well as the presence of genes responsible for synthesis of the mycotoxins in a collection of 92 A. niger/A. welwitschiae isolates from multiple crop and geographic origins. The results indicate that (i) isolates of both species differed in ability to produce the mycotoxins; (ii) FB-nonproducing isolates of A. niger had an intact fumonisin biosynthetic gene (fum) cluster; (iii) FB-nonproducing isolates of A. welwitschiae exhibited multiple patterns of fum gene deletion; and (iv) OTA-nonproducing isolates of both species lacked the ochratoxin A biosynthetic gene (ota) cluster. Analysis of genome sequence data revealed a single pattern of ota gene deletion in the two species. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that the simplest explanation for this is that ota cluster deletion occurred in a common ancestor of A. niger and A. welwitschiae, and subsequently both the intact and deleted cluster were retained as alternate alleles during divergence of the ancestor into descendent species. Finally, comparison of results from this and previous studies indicate that a majority of A. niger isolates and a minority of A. welwitschiae isolates can produce FBs, whereas, a minority of isolates of both species produce OTA. The comparison also suggested that the relative abundance of each species and frequency of FB/OTA-producing isolates can vary with crop and/or geographic origin.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster of macrolactam antibiotic vicenistatin in Streptomyces halstedii Abstract: Vicenistatin, an antitumor antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces halstedii, is a unique 20-membered macrocyclic lactam with a novel aminosugar vicenisamine. The vicenistatin biosynthetic gene cluster (vin) spanning approximately 64 kbp was cloned and sequenced. The cluster contains putative genes for the aglycon biosynthesis including four modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), glutamate mutase, acyl CoA-ligase, and AMP-ligase. Also found in the cluster are genes of NDP-hexose 4,6-dehydratase and aminotransferase for vicenisamine biosynthesis. For the functional confirmation of the cluster, a putative glycosyltransferase gene product, VinC, was heterologously expressed, and the vicenisamine transfer reaction to the aglycon was chemically proved. A unique feature of the vicenistatin PKS is that the loading module contains only an acyl carrier protein domain, in contrast to other known PKS-loading modules containing certain activation domains. Activation of the starter acyl group by separate polypeptides is postulated as well.	1
Title: Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase for Catalyzing C-42 Hydroxylation of the Glycine-Derived Fragment in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis Abstract: A hybrid trans-AT PKS/NRPS gene cluster htm was identified with defined boundaries for hangtaimycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces spectabilis CPCC200148. Deoxyhangtaimycin, a new derivative of hangtaimycin, was identified from the htm11 gene knockout mutant. In vitro biochemical assays demonstrated that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Htm11 was responsible for the stereoselective hydroxylation of deoxyhangtaimycin to hangtaimycin. More importantly, deoxyhangtaimycin showed activity against influenza A virus at the micromolar level, highlighting its potential as an antiviral lead compound.	1
Title: CRISPR screens identify genomic ribonucleotides as a source of PARP-trapping lesions Abstract: The observation that BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells are sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has spurred the development of cancer therapies that use these inhibitors to target deficiencies in homologous recombination1. The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors depends on PARP trapping, the formation of non-covalent protein-DNA adducts composed of inhibited PARP1 bound to DNA lesions of unclear origins1-4. To address the nature of such lesions and the cellular consequences of PARP trapping, we undertook three CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats) screens to identify genes and pathways that mediate cellular resistance to olaparib, a clinically approved PARP inhibitor1. Here we present a high-confidence set of 73 genes, which when mutated cause increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. In addition to an expected enrichment for genes related to homologous recombination, we discovered that mutations in all three genes encoding ribonuclease H2 sensitized cells to PARP inhibition. We establish that the underlying cause of the PARP-inhibitor hypersensitivity of cells deficient in ribonuclease H2 is impaired ribonucleotide excision repair5. Embedded ribonucleotides, which are abundant in the genome of cells deficient in ribonucleotide excision repair, are substrates for cleavage by topoisomerase 1, resulting in PARP-trapping lesions that impede DNA replication and endanger genome integrity. We conclude that genomic ribonucleotides are a hitherto unappreciated source of PARP-trapping DNA lesions, and that the frequent deletion of RNASEH2B in metastatic prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia could provide an opportunity to exploit these findings therapeutically.	0
Title: Haloduracin α binds the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II with 2:1 stoichiometry Abstract: The two-peptide lantibiotic haloduracin is composed of two post-translationally modified polycyclic peptides that synergistically act on gram-positive bacteria. We show here that Halα inhibits the transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by PBP1b by binding in a 2:1 stoichiometry to its substrate lipid II. Halβ and the mutant Halα-E22Q were not able to inhibit this step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, but Halα with its leader peptide still attached was a potent inhibitor. Combined with previous findings, the data support a model in which a 1:2:2 lipid II:Halα:Halβ complex inhibits cell wall biosynthesis and mediates pore formation, resulting in loss of membrane potential and potassium efflux.	1
Title: Application of LDH-release assay to cellular-level evaluation of the toxic potential of harmful algal species Abstract: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-release assay was applied to estimate the toxic potential of harmful algal species at the cellular level. African green monkey kidney (Vero), yellowtail fin epithelia (MJF), and rainbow trout gill (RTgill-W1) cells were used as target cells. A live cell suspension of Karenia mikimotoi (SUO-1) induced the release of LDH from these cell lines, while the activity of another strain, FUK, was much lower. The cell-free culture supernatants and ruptured cell suspensions of both strains of K. mikimotoi were less effective on LDH-release assay. Exposure experiments against abalone and shrimp revealed that SUO-1 showed much stronger lethal effects on these organisms than FUK. Among six phytoplankton species, three species known to be harmful algal species induced the release of LDH to different extents depending on the cell line, whereas the other three species, known to be non-toxic, showed no effects on any cell lines. These results suggest that LDH-release assay is a useful micro-plate assay for estimation of the toxic potential of harmful phytoplankton.	0
Title: Regulation of the linear ubiquitination of STAT1 controls antiviral interferon signaling Abstract: Linear ubiquitination is a critical regulator of inflammatory signaling pathways. However, linearly ubiquitinated substrates and the biological significance of linear ubiquitination is incompletely understood. Here, we show that STAT1 has linear ubiquitination at Lys511 and Lys652 residues in intact cells, which inhibits STAT1 binding to the type-I interferon receptor IFNAR2, thereby restricting STAT1 activation and resulting in type-I interferon signaling homeostasis. Linear ubiquitination of STAT1 is removed rapidly by OTULIN upon type-I interferon stimulation, which facilitates activation of interferon-STAT1 signaling. Furthermore, viruses induce HOIP expression through the NF-κB pathway, which in turn increases linear ubiquitination of STAT1 and thereby inhibits interferon antiviral response. Consequently, HOIL-1L heterozygous mice have active STAT1 signaling and enhanced responses to type-I interferons. These findings demonstrate a linear ubiquitination-mediated switch between homeostasis and activation of type-I interferon signaling, and suggest potential strategies for clinical antiviral therapy.	0
Title: Architectures of whole-module and bimodular proteins from the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase Abstract: The 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a prototypical assembly line polyketide synthase produced by the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea that synthesizes the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The megasynthase is a 2-MDa trimeric complex composed of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains, each referred to as a module, which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification. Modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B. We report small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of a whole module and a bimodule from DEBS, as well as a set of domains for which high-resolution structures are available. In all cases, the solution state was probed under previously established conditions ensuring that each protein is catalytically active. SAXS data are consistent with atomic-resolution structures of DEBS fragments. Therefore, we used the available high-resolution structures of DEBS domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid-body refinement. Our data support a model in which the third module of DEBS forms a disc-shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site. The molecular envelope of DEBS3 is a thin elongated ellipsoid, and the results of rigid-body modeling suggest that modules 5 and 6 stack collinearly along the 2-fold axis of symmetry.	1
Title: Highly enantioselective synthesis of (R)-1,3-butanediol via deracemization of the corresponding racemate by a whole-cell stereoinverting cascade system Abstract: Background:                       Deracemization, the transformation of the racemate into a single stereoisomeric product in 100% theoretical yield, is an appealing but challenging option for the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure chiral compounds as important pharmaceutical intermediates. To enhance the synthesis of (R)-1,3-butanediol from the corresponding low-cost racemate with minimal substrate waste, we designed a stereoinverting cascade deracemization route and constructed the cascade reaction for the total conversion of racemic 1,3-butanediol into its (R)-enantiomer. This cascade reaction consisted of the absolutely enantioselective oxidation of (S)-1,3-butanediol by Candida parapsilosis QC-76 and the subsequent asymmetric reduction of the intermediate 4-hydroxy-2-butanone to (R)-1,3-butanediol by Pichia kudriavzevii QC-1.                  Results:                       The key reaction conditions including choice of cosubstrate, pH, temperature, and rotation speed were optimized systematically and determined as follows: adding acetone as the cosubstrate at pH 8.0, a temperature of 30 °C, and rotation speed of 250 rpm for the first oxidation process; in the next reduction process, the optimal conditions were: adding glucose as the cosubstrate at pH 8.0, a temperature of 35 °C, and rotation speed of 200 rpm. By investigating the feasibility of the step-by-step method with one-pot experiment as a natural extension for performing the oxidation-reduction cascade, the step-by-step approach exhibited high efficiency for this cascade process from racemate to (R)-1,3-butanediol. Under optimal conditions, 20 g/L of the racemate transformed into 16.67 g/L of (R)-1,3-butanediol with 99.5% enantiomeric excess by the oxidation-reduction cascade system in a 200-mL bioreactor.                  Conclusions:                       The step-by-step cascade reaction efficiently produced (R)-1,3-butanediol from the racemate by biosynthesis and shows promising application prospects.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Carbonylmethylene Structure Found in the Ketomemicin Class of Pseudotripeptides Abstract: We recently discovered novel pseudotripeptides, the ketomemicins, which possess a C-terminal pseudodipeptide connected with a carbonylmethylene instead of an amide bond, through heterologous expression of gene clusters identified in actinobacteria. The carbonylmethylene structure is a stable isostere of the amide bond and its biological significance has been shown in several natural and synthetic products. Despite the biological importance of these compounds, little is known about how the carbonylmethylene structure is biosynthesized. In this work, we fully characterized the biosynthetic machinery of the pseudodipeptide. An aldolase, dehydratase, PLP-dependent glycine-C-acetyltransferase, and dehydrogenase were involved in the formation of the pseudodipeptide, with malonyl-CoA and phenylpyruvate as starter substrates.	1
Title: Superacid-catalyzed reactions of olefinic pyrazines: an example of anti-Markovnikov addition involving superelectrophiles Abstract: [reaction: see text] Olefinic pyrazines are found to react with benzene in CF3SO3H and give anti-Markovnikov-type addition products. We propose that this is caused by two effects: destabilization of the carbocationic intermediates that would lead to Markovnikov-type products and the generation of a considerable amount of positive charge at the terminal carbon of the olefinic groups. This suggests that acid-catalyzed addition reactions can give anti-Markovnikov-type products when a multiply charged (i.e., superelectrophilic) group is adjacent to the olefinic site.	0
Title: Streptomyces clavuligerus has a second copy of the proclavaminate amidinohydrolase gene Abstract: Past genetic studies have indicated that the genes encoding early enzymes of clavulanic acid biosynthesis may be duplicated in Streptomyces clavuligerus. We observed cross-hybridizing bands upon Southern analyses of proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah)-defective mutant strains of S. clavuligerus screened with a pah-specific probe. The DNA fragment responsible for this cross hybridization was cloned and sequenced and shown to encode a second copy of the pah gene. The new pah gene (pah1) was 1,056 bp in length, and its sequence was 72% identical to that of the original pah gene (pah2). Disruption mutants with defects in pah1 showed no significant effects on production of clavulanic acid or any of the clavam metabolites with stereochemistries opposite that of clavulanic acid (5S clavams) produced by S. clavuligerus when they were grown on starch asparagine or soy medium. However, double mutants with defects in both pah1 and pah2 were defective in the production of both clavulanic acid and all of the 5S clavam metabolites.	1
Title: Bioconjugation by native chemical tagging of C-H bonds Abstract: A general C-H functionalization method for the tagging of natural products and pharmaceuticals is described. An azide-containing sulfinate reagent allows the appendage of azidoalkyl chains onto heteroaromatics, the product of which can then be attached to a monoclonal antibody by a "click" reaction. This strategy expands the breadth of bioactive small molecules that can be linked to macromolecules in a manner that is beyond the scope of existing methods in bioconjugation to permit tagging of the "seemingly untaggable".	0
Title: Molecular and genetic inflammation networks in major human diseases Abstract: It has been well-recognized that inflammation alongside tissue repair and damage maintaining tissue homeostasis determines the initiation and progression of complex diseases. Albeit with the accomplishment of having captured the most critical inflammation-involved molecules, genetic susceptibilities, epigenetic factors, and environmental factors, our schemata on the role of inflammation in complex diseases remain largely patchy, in part due to the success of reductionism in terms of research methodology per se. Omics data alongside the advances in data integration technologies have enabled reconstruction of molecular and genetic inflammation networks which shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of complex diseases or clinical conditions. Given the proven beneficial role of anti-inflammation in coronary heart disease as well as other complex diseases and immunotherapy as a revolutionary transition in oncology, it becomes timely to review our current understanding of the molecular and genetic inflammation networks underlying major human diseases. In this review, we first briefly discuss the complexity of infectious diseases and then highlight recently uncovered molecular and genetic inflammation networks in other major human diseases including obesity, type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, late onset Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and sporadic cancer. The commonality and specificity of these molecular networks are addressed in the context of genetics based on genome-wide association study (GWAS). The double-sword role of inflammation, such as how the aberrant type 1 and/or type 2 immunity leads to chronic and severe clinical conditions, remains open in terms of the inflammasome and the core inflammatome network features. Increasingly available large Omics and clinical data in tandem with systems biology approaches have offered an exciting yet challenging opportunity toward reconstruction of more comprehensive and dynamic molecular and genetic inflammation networks, which hold great promise in transiting network snapshots to video-style multi-scale interplays of disease mechanisms, in turn leading to effective clinical intervention.	0
Title: Deciphering pactamycin biosynthesis and engineered production of new pactamycin analogues Abstract: Pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol-derived natural product that has potent antibacterial and antitumor activities. Sequence analysis of an 86 kb continuous region of the chromosome from Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456 revealed a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of pactamycin. Gene inactivation of the Fe-S radical SAM oxidoreductase (ptmC) and the glycosyltransferase (ptmJ), individually abrogated pactamycin biosynthesis; this confirmed the involvement of the ptm gene cluster in pactamycin biosynthesis. The polyketide synthase gene (ptmQ) was found to support 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthesis in a heterologous host, S. lividans T7. In vivo inactivation of ptmQ in S. pactum impaired pactamycin and pactamycate production but led to production of two new pactamycin analogues, de-6-MSA-pactamycin and de-6-MSA-pactamycate. The new compounds showed equivalent cytotoxic and antibacterial activities with the corresponding parent molecules and shed more light on the structure-activity relationship of pactamycin.	1
Title: Discovery of the rhizopodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 by genome mining Abstract: The field of bacterial natural product research is currently undergoing a paradigm change concerning the discovery of natural products. Previously most efforts were based on isolation of the most abundant compound in an extract, or on tracking bioactivity. However, traditional activity-guided approaches are limited by the available test panels and frequently lead to the rediscovery of already known compounds. The constantly increasing availability of bacterial genome sequences provides the potential for the discovery of a huge number of new natural compounds by in silico identification of biosynthetic gene clusters. Examination of the information on the biosynthetic machinery can further prevent rediscovery of known compounds, and can help identify so far unknown biosynthetic pathways of known compounds. By in silico screening of the genome of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15, a trans-AT polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) gene cluster was identified that could not be correlated to any secondary metabolite known to be produced by this strain. Targeted gene inactivation and analysis of extracts from the resulting mutants by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS), in combination with the use of statistical tools resulted in the identification of a compound that was absent in the mutants extracts. By matching with our in-house database of myxobacterial secondary metabolites, this compound was identified as rhizopodin. A detailed analysis of the rhizopodin biosynthetic machinery is presented in this manuscript.	1
Title: Ecology of Thioploca spp.: nitrate and sulfur storage in relation to chemical microgradients and influence of Thioploca spp. on the sedimentary nitrogen cycle Abstract: Microsensors, including a recently developed NO3(-) biosensor, were applied to measure O(2) and NO3(-) profiles in marine sediments from the upwelling area off central Chile and to investigate the influence of Thioploca spp. on the sedimentary nitrogen metabolism. The studies were performed in undisturbed sediment cores incubated in a small laboratory flume to simulate the environmental conditions of low O(2), high NO3(-), and bottom water current. On addition of NO3(-) and NO2(-), Thioploca spp. exhibited positive chemotaxis and stretched out of the sediment into the flume water. In a core densely populated with Thioploca, the penetration depth of NO3(-) was only 0.5 mm and a sharp maximum of NO3(-) uptake was observed 0.5 mm above the sediment surface. In sediments with only few Thioploca spp., NO3(-) was detectable down to a depth of 2 mm and the maximum consumption rates were observed within the sediment. No chemotaxis toward nitrous oxide (N2O) was observed, which is consistent with the observation that Thioploca does not denitrify but reduces intracellular NO3(-) to NH(4)(+). Measurements of the intracellular NO3(-) and S(0) pools in Thioploca filaments from various depths in the sediment gave insights into possible differences in the migration behavior between the different species. Living filaments containing significant amounts of intracellular NO3(-) were found to a depth of at least 13 cm, providing final proof for the vertical shuttling of Thioploca spp. and nitrate transport into the sediment.	0
Title: Stereoretentive C( sp3)-S Cross-Coupling Abstract: We report a stereoretentive cross-coupling reaction of configurationally stable nucleophiles with disulfide and N-sulfenylsuccinimide donors promoted by Cu(I). We demonstrate the utility of this method in the synthesis of thioglycosides derived from simple alkyl and aryl thiols, thioglycosides, and in the glycodiversification of cysteine residues in peptides. These reactions operate well with carbohydrate substrates containing common protective groups and reagents with free hydroxyl and secondary amide functionalities under standardized conditions. Competition experiments in combination with computational DFT studies established that the putative anomeric intermediate is an organocopper species that is configurationally stable and resistant to epimerization due to its short lifetime. The subsequent reductive elimination from the Cu(III) intermediate is rapid and stereoretentive. Taken together, the glycosyl cross-coupling is ideally suited for late stage glycodiversification and bioconjugation under highly controlled installation of the aliphatic carbon-sulfur bonds.	0
Title: Mechanism of enzymatic fluorination in Streptomyces cattleya Abstract: Recently a fluorination enzyme was identified and isolated from Streptomyces cattleya, as the first committed step on the metabolic pathway to the fluorinated metabolites, fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine. This enzyme, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxy adenosine synthetase (FDAS), has been shown to catalyze C-F bond formation by nucleophilic attack of fluoride ion to S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) with the concomitant displacement of l-methionine to generate 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxy adenosine (5'-FDA). Although the structures of FDAS bound to both SAM and products have been solved, the molecular mechanism remained to be elucidated. We now report site-directed mutagenesis studies, structural analyses, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The data establish the key residues required for catalysis and the order of substrate binding. Fluoride ion is not readily distinguished from water by protein X-ray crystallography; however, using chloride ion (also a substrate) with a mutant of low activity has enabled the halide ion to be located in nonproductive co-complexes with SAH and SAM. The kinetic data suggest the positively charged sulfur of SAM is a key requirement in stabilizing the transition state. We propose a molecular mechanism for FDAS in which fluoride weakly associates with the enzyme exchanging two water molecules for protein ligation. The binding of SAM expels remaining water associated with fluoride ion and traps the ion in a pocket positioned to react with SAM, generating l-methionine and 5'-FDA. l-methionine then dissociates from the enzyme followed by 5'-FDA.	0
Title: Synthetic inositol phosphate analogs reveal that PPIP5K2 has a surface-mounted substrate capture site that is a target for drug discovery Abstract: Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 2 (PPIP5K2) is one of the mammalian PPIP5K isoforms responsible for synthesis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (inositol pyrophosphates; PP-InsPs), regulatory molecules that function at the interface of cell signaling and organismic homeostasis. The development of drugs that inhibit PPIP5K2 could have both experimental and therapeutic applications. Here, we describe a synthetic strategy for producing naturally occurring 5-PP-InsP4, as well as several inositol polyphosphate analogs, and we study their interactions with PPIP5K2 using biochemical and structural approaches. These experiments uncover an additional ligand-binding site on the surface of PPIP5K2, adjacent to the catalytic pocket. This site facilitates substrate capture from the bulk phase, prior to transfer into the catalytic pocket. In addition to demonstrating a "catch-and-pass" reaction mechanism in a small molecule kinase, we demonstrate that binding of our analogs to the substrate capture site inhibits PPIP5K2. This work suggests that the substrate-binding site offers new opportunities for targeted drug design.	0
Title: Self-assembling small molecules form nanofibrils that bind procaspase-3 to promote activation Abstract: Modulating enzyme function with small-molecule activators, as opposed to inhibitors, offers new opportunities for drug discovery and allosteric regulation. We previously identified a compound, called 1541, from a high-throughput screen (HTS) that stimulates activation of a proenzyme, procaspase-3, to generate mature caspase-3. Here we further investigate the mechanism of activation and report the surprising finding that 1541 self-assembles into nanofibrils exceeding 1 μm in length. These particles are an unanticipated outcome from an HTS that have properties distinct from standard globular protein aggregators. Moreover, 1541 nanofibrils function as a unique biocatalytic material that activates procaspase-3 via induced proximity. These studies demonstrate a novel approach for proenzyme activation through binding to fibrils, which may mimic how procaspases are naturally processed on protein scaffolds.	0
Title: Sesquiterpene synthase from the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster of the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea Abstract: The fungus Botrytis cinerea is the causal agent of the economically important gray mold disease that affects more than 200 ornamental and agriculturally important plant species. B. cinerea is a necrotrophic plant pathogen that secretes nonspecific phytotoxins, including the sesquiterpene botrydial and the polyketide botcinic acid. The region surrounding the previously characterized BcBOT1 gene has now been identified as the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster.Five genes including BcBOT1 and BcBOT2 were shown by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to be co-regulated through the calcineurin signaling pathway. Inactivation of the BcBOT2 gene, encoding a putative sesquiterpene cyclase, abolished botrydial biosynthesis, which could be restored by in trans complementation.Inactivation of BcBOT2 also resulted in overproduction of botcinic acid that was observed to be strain-dependent. Recombinant BcBOT2 protein converted farnesyl diphosphate to the parent sesquiterpene of the botrydial biosynthetic pathway, the tricyclic alcohol presilphiperfolan-8beta-ol.	1
Title: Genetic analysis of the alginate biosynthetic gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows evidence of an operonic structure Abstract: Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa causing pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients have an unusual mucoid phenotype because of production of the capsule-like exopolysaccharide, alginate. Transcriptional activation of algD, the first gene of a large alginate biosynthetic gene cluster, is associated with conversion to the alginate-producing (Alg+) phenotype. In this study, we examined the regulation of alginate genes immediately downstream of algD. Mutants of the Alg+ strain FRD1 were constructed by gene replacement with defined Tn501 (8.2kb) insertions in the alginate biosynthetic gene cluster, resulting in an Alg- phenotype. The Alg+ phenotype of these mutants was restored by integration of narrow-host-range plasmids containing DNA fragments from P. aeruginosa that reconstructed a continuous alginate gene cluster. A broad-host-range plasmid containing the entire alginate gene cluster except for the terminal gene, algA, was unable to complement an alG::Tn501 mutant unless algA was transcribed from a second plasmid. This indicated that any Tn501 insertion in the cluster was polar on downstream alginate genes. Northern blot hybridization experiments also showed that a transposon insertion downstream of algD adversely affected algG and algA transcription. These results provided evidence that the alginate biosynthetic gene cluster has an operonic structure and is cotranscribed from the algD promoter.	1
Title: Polynucleotide phosphorylase is involved in the control of lipopeptide fengycin production in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Bacillus subtilis is a wealth source of lipopeptide molecules such as iturins, surfactins and fengycins or plipastatins endowed with a range of biological activities. These molecules, designated secondary metabolites, are synthesized via non-ribosomal peptides synthesis (NRPS) machinery and are most often subjected to a complex regulation with involvement of several regulatory factors. To gain novel insights on mechanism regulating fengycin production, we investigated the effect of the fascinating polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), as well as the effect of lipopeptide surfactin. Compared to the wild type, the production of fengycin in the mutant strains B. subtilis BBG235 and BBG236 altered for PNPase has not only decreased to about 70 and 40%, respectively, but also hampered its antifungal activity towards the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea. On the other hand, mutant strains BBG231 (srfAA-) and BBG232 (srfAC-) displayed different levels of fengycin production. BBG231 had registered an important decrease in fengycin production, comparable to that observed for BBG235 or BBG236. This study permitted to establish that the products of pnpA gene (PNPase), and srfAA- (surfactin synthetase) are involved in fengycin production.	0
Title: A chelator-free multifunctional [64Cu]CuS nanoparticle platform for simultaneous micro-PET/CT imaging and photothermal ablation therapy Abstract: We synthesized and evaluated a novel class of chelator-free [(64)Cu]CuS nanoparticles (NPs) suitable both for PET imaging and as photothermal coupling agents for photothermal ablation. These [(64)Cu]CuS NPs are simple to make, possess excellent stability, and allow robust noninvasive micro-PET imaging. Furthermore, the CuS NPs display strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region (peak at 930 nm); passive targeting prefers the tumor site, and mediated ablation of U87 tumor cells occurs upon exposure to NIR light both in vitro and in vivo after either intratumoral or intravenous injection. The combination of small diameter (∼11 nm), strong NIR absorption, and integration of (64)Cu as a structural component makes these [(64)Cu]CuS NPs ideally suited for multifunctional molecular imaging and therapy.	0
Title: Para-position derivatives of fungal anthelmintic cyclodepsipeptides engineered with Streptomyces venezuelae antibiotic biosynthetic genes Abstract: PF1022A, a cyclooctadepsipeptide possessing strong anthelmintic properties and produced by the filamentous fungus Rosellinia sp. PF1022, consists of four alternating residues of N-methyl-L-leucine and four residues of D-lactate or D-phenyllactate. PF1022A derivatives obtained through modification of their benzene ring at the para-position with nitro or amino groups act as valuable starting materials for the synthesis of compounds with improved anthelmintic activities. Here we describe the production of such derivatives by fermentation through metabolic engineering of the PF1022A biosynthetic pathway in Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Three genes cloned from Streptomyces venezuelae, and required for the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylpyruvate from chorismate in the chloramphenicol biosynthetic pathway, were expressed in a chorismate mutase-deficient strain derived from Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analyses confirmed that this approach facilitated the production of PF1022A derivatives specifically modified at the para-position. This fermentation method is environmentally safe and can be used for the industrial scale production of PF1022A derivatives.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of leader (signal) peptidase from Escherichia coli Abstract: Many membrane proteins and secreted proteins are synthesized in precursor form with 15 to 30 additional NH2-terminal residues. These "leader peptides" (pre-pieces, signal peptides) are removed as these proteins cross or insert into cellular membranes. "Leader peptidase" activities which catalyze this cleavage have been detected in crude extracts and found to be dependent on membrane fractions. We now describe a 6,000-fold purification of a leader peptidase from the membranes of uninfected Escherichia coli. This leader peptidase was assayed by its ability to cleave the 23-residue leader peptide from procoat, the precursor to bacteriophage M13 coat protein. Immunoprecipitation and amino acid sequencing showed that this enzyme cleaved procoat to produce authentic coat protein. No factors other than the leader peptidase were found to be required for the conversion of procoat protein to coat protein.	0
Title: Helix-Dependent Spin Filtering through the DNA Duplex Abstract: Recent work suggests that electrons can travel through DNA and other chiral molecules in a spin-selective manner, but little is known about the origin of this spin selectivity. Here we describe experiments on magnetized DNA-modified electrodes to explore spin-selective electron transport through hydrated duplex DNA. Our results show that the two spins migrate through duplex DNA with a different yield and that spin selectivity requires charge transport through the DNA duplex. Significantly, shifting the same duplex DNA between right-handed B- and left-handed Z-forms leads to a diode-like switch in spin selectivity; which spin moves more efficiently through the duplex depends upon the DNA helicity. With DNA, the supramolecular organization of chiral moieties, rather than the chirality of the individual monomers, determines the selectivity in spin, and thus a conformational change can switch the spin selectivity.	0
Title: Mutation of gdpS gene induces a viable but non-culturable state in Staphylococcus epidermidis and changes in the global transcriptional profile Abstract: Background:                       In the genome of staphylococci, only the gdpS gene encodes the conserved GGDEF domain, which is the characteristic of diguanylate cyclases. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that the gdpS gene can modulate biofilm formation by positively regulating the expression of ica operon in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Moreover, this regulation seems to be independent of the c-di-GMP signaling pathway and the protein-coding function of this gene. Therefore, the biological function of the gdpS gene remains to be further investigated.                  Results:                       In the present study, it was observed that mutation of the gdpS gene induced S. epidermidis to enter into a presumed viable but nonculturable state (VBNC) after cryopreservation with glycerol. Similarly, when moved from liquid to solid culture medium, the gdpS mutant strain also exhibited a VBNC state. Compared with the wild-type strain, the gdpS mutant strain autolyzed more quickly during storage at 4℃, indicating its increased susceptibility to low temperature. Transcriptional profiling analysis showed that the gdpS mutation affected the transcription of 188 genes (92 genes were upregulated and 96 genes were downregulated). Specifically, genes responsible for glycerol metabolism were most markedly upregulated and most of the altered genes in the mutant strain are those involved in nitrogen metabolism. In addition, the most significantly downregulated genes included the betB gene, whose product catalyzes the synthesis of glycine betaine and confers tolerance to cold.                  Conclusion:                       The preliminary results suggest that the gdpS gene may participate in VBNC formation of S. epidermidis in face of adverse environmental factors, which is probably achieved by regulating expression of energy metabolism genes. Besides, the gdpS gene is critical for S. epidermidis to survive low temperature, and the underlying mechanism may be partly explained by its influence on expression of betB gene.	0
Title: Acyldepsipeptide HDAC inhibitor production induced in Burkholderia thailandensis Abstract: Natural product gene clusters are often tightly regulated, resulting in gene cluster silencing in laboratory fermentation studies. The systematic overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) associated with biosynthetic gene clusters found in the genome of Burkholderia thailandensis E264 identified a set of TFs that, when overexpressed, alter the secondary metabolome of this bacterium. The isolation and characterization of burkholdacs A and B, two new acyldepsitripeptide histone deacetylase inhibitors produced by B. thailandensis overexpressing the TF bhcM, is reported.	1
Title: Two sets of paralogous genes encode the enzymes involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Recently, a second copy of a gene encoding proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah1), an enzyme involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus, was identified and isolated. Using Southern analysis, we have now isolated second copies of the genes encoding the carboxyethylarginine synthase (ceaS) and beta-lactam synthetase (bls) enzymes. These new paralogues are given the gene designations ceaS1 and bls1 and are located immediately upstream of pah1 on the chromosome. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the region downstream of pah1 revealed a second copy of a gene encoding ornithine acetyltransferase (oat1), thus indicating the presence of a cluster of paralogue genes. ceaS1, bls1, and oat1 display 73, 60, and 63% identities, respectively, at the nucleotide level to the original ceaS2, bls2, and oat2 genes from the clavulanic acid gene cluster. Single mutants defective in ceaS1, bls1, or oat1 were prepared and characterized and were found to be affected to variable degrees in their ability to produce clavulanic acid and clavam metabolites. Double mutants defective in both copies of the genes were also prepared and tested. The ceaS1/ceaS2 and the bls1/bls2 mutant strains were completely blocked in clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis. On the other hand, oat1/oat2 double mutants still produced some clavulanic acid and clavam metabolites. This may be attributed to the presence of the argJ gene in S. clavuligerus, which encodes yet another ornithine acetyltransferase enzyme that may be able to compensate for the lack of OAT1 and -2 in the double mutants.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of a cluster of genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of acinetoferrin, a siderophore produced by Acinetobacter haemolyticus ATCC 17906T Abstract: Acinetobacter haemolyticus ATCC 17906(T) is known to produce the siderophore acinetoferrin under iron-limiting conditions. Here, we show that an operon consisting of eight consecutive genes, named acbABCD and actBCAD, participates in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetoferrin, respectively. Transcription of the operon was found to be iron-regulated by a putative Fur box located in the promoter region of the first gene, acbA. Homology searches suggest that acbABCD and actA encode enzyme proteins involved in acinetoferrin biosynthesis and an outer-membrane receptor for ferric acinetoferrin, respectively. Mutants defective in acbA and actA were unable to produce acinetoferrin or to express the ferric acinetoferrin receptor under iron-limiting conditions. These abilities were rescued by complementation of the mutants with native acbA and actA genes. Secondary structure analysis predicted that the products of actC and actD may be inner-membrane proteins with 12 membrane-spanning helices that belong to the major facilitator superfamily proteins. ActC showed homology to Sinorhizobium meliloti RhtX, which has been characterized as an inner-membrane importer for ferric rhizobactin 1021 structurally similar to acinetoferrin. Compared to the parental ATCC 17906(T) strain, the actD mutant displayed about a 35 % reduction in secretion of acinetoferrin, which was restored by complementation with actD, suggesting that ActD acts as an exporter of the siderophore. Finally, the actB product was significantly similar to hypothetical proteins in certain bacteria, in which genes encoding ActBCA homologues are arranged in the same order as in A. haemolyticus ATCC 17906(T). However, the function of ActB remains to be clarified.	1
Title: Effects of Temperature on Methanogenesis in a Thermophilic (58 degrees C) Anaerobic Digestor Abstract: The short-term effects of temperature on methanogenesis from acetate or CO(2) in a thermophilic (58 degrees C) anaerobic digestor were studied by incubating digestor sludge at different temperatures with C-labeled methane precursors (CH(3)COO or CO(2)). During a period when Methanosarcina sp. was numerous in the sludge, methanogenesis from acetate was optimal at 55 to 60 degrees C and was completely inhibited at 65 degrees C. A Methanosarcina culture isolated from the digestor grew optimally on acetate at 55 to 58 degrees C and did not grow or produce methane at 65 degrees C. An accidental shift of digestor temperature from 58 to 64 degrees C during this period caused a sharp decrease in gas production and a large increase in acetate concentration within 24 h, indicating that the aceticlastic methanogens in the digestor were the population most susceptible to this temperature increase. During a later period when Methanothrix sp. was numerous in the digestor, methanogenesis from CH(3)COO was optimal at 65 degrees C and completely inhibited at 75 degrees C. A partially purified Methanothrix enrichment culture derived from the digestor had a maximum growth temperature near 70 degrees C. Methanogenesis from CO(2) in the sludge was optimal at 65 degrees C and still proceeded at 75 degrees C. A CO(2)-reducing Methanobacterium sp. isolated from the digestor was capable of methanogenesis at 75 degrees C. During the period when Methanothix sp. was apparently dominant, sludge incubated for 24 h at 65 degrees C produced more methane than sludge incubated at 60 degrees C, and no acetate accumulated at 65 degrees C. Methanogenesis was severely inhibited in sludge incubated at 70 degrees C, but since neither acetate nor H(2) accumulated, production of these methanogenic substrates by fermentative bacteria was probably the most temperature-sensitive process. Thus, there was a correlation between digestor performance at different temperatures and responses to temperature by cultures of methanogens believed to play important roles in the digestor.	0
Title: A small-molecule inducer of PDX1 expression identified by high-throughput screening Abstract: Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), a member of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor family, is a key transcription factor important for both pancreas development and mature β cell function. The ectopic overexpression of Pdx1, Neurog3, and MafA in mice reprograms acinar cells to insulin-producing cells. We developed a quantitative PCR-based gene expression assay to screen more than 60,000 compounds for expression of each of these genes in the human PANC-1 ductal carcinoma cell line. We identified BRD7552, which upregulated PDX1 expression in both primary human islets and ductal cells, and induced epigenetic changes in the PDX1 promoter consistent with transcriptional activation. Prolonged compound treatment induced both insulin mRNA and protein and also enhanced insulin expression induced by the three-gene combination. These results provide a proof of principle for identifying small molecules that induce expression of transcription factors to control cellular reprogramming.	0
Title: Tryptophan Metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans Links Aggregation Behavior to Nutritional Status Abstract: Caenorhabditis elegans uses aggregation pheromones to communicate its nutritional status and recruit fellow members of its species to food sources. These aggregation pheromones include the IC-ascarosides, ascarosides modified with an indole-3-carbonyl (IC) group on the 4'-position of the ascarylose sugar. Nothing is known about the biosynthesis of the IC modification beyond the fact that it is derived from tryptophan. Here, we show that C. elegans produces endogenously several indole-containing metabolites, including indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; auxin), and indole-3-carboxylic acid, and that these metabolites are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway from tryptophan to the IC group. Stable isotope-labeled IPA and IAA are incorporated into the IC-ascarosides. Importantly, we show that flux through the biosynthetic pathway is affected by the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Knockdown of the PDC by RNA interference leads to an accumulation of upstream metabolites and a reduction in downstream metabolites in the pathway. Our results show that production of aggregation pheromones is linked to PDC activity and that aggregation behavior may reflect a favorable metabolic state in the worm. Lastly, we show that treatment of C. elegans with indole-containing metabolites in the pathway induces the biosynthesis of the IC-ascarosides. Because the natural environment of C. elegans is rotting plant material, indole-containing metabolites in this environment could potentially stimulate pheromone biosynthesis and aggregation behavior in the worm. Thus, there may be important links between tryptophan metabolism in C. elegans and in plants and bacteria that enable interkingdom signaling.	0
Title: Analysis of secreted proteins during conidial germination of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 Abstract: To broaden our understanding of extracellular proteins of Aspergillus oryzae at the conidial germination stage, analyses of the secreted proteins during germination were carried out. Taka-amylase A (TAA), glucoamylase (GLAA), and aspergillopepsin A (PEPA) were identified as the main products by peptide mass fingerprinting. TAA and PEPA were detected simultaneously with the formation of germ tubes. With the development of germination, the pH of the medium fell from 5.5 to 3.5. The secreted PEPA had a pro-sequence and likely shifted from 42 kDa to 41 kDa below pH 4.6, indicating that the precursor of PEPA was secreted and underwent pH-dependent processing. Furthermore, the 41 kDa protein was trapped by the addition of pepstatin A, the specific inhibitor of PEPA, suggesting that the maturation of pro-PEPA was a stepwise autoprocessing upon acidification of the medium and itself was an intermediate of the processing. It was implied that PEPA plays an important role at the early germination stage.	0
Title: Identification and structural characterization of serobactins, a suite of lipopeptide siderophores produced by the grass endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae Abstract: Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67 is a diazotrophic endophyte able to colonize the interior of many economically relevant crops such as rice, wheat, corn and sorghum. Structures of siderophores produced by bacterial endophytes have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this work was to identify and characterize the siderophores produced by this bacterium. In a screening for mutants unable to produce siderophores we found a mutant that had a transposon insertion in a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene coding for a putative siderophore biosynthetic enzyme. The chemical structure of the siderophore was predicted using computational genomic tools. The predicted structure was confirmed by chemical analysis. We found that siderophores produced by H. seropedicae Z67 are a suite of amphiphilic lipopeptides, named serobactin A, B and C, which vary by the length of the fatty acid chain. We also demonstrated the biological activity of serobactins as nutritional iron sources for H. seropedicae. These are the first structurally described siderophores produced by endophytic bacteria.	1
Title: Levinthal's paradox Abstract: Levinthal's paradox is that finding the native folded state of a protein by a random search among all possible configurations can take an enormously long time. Yet proteins can fold in seconds or less. Mathematical analysis of a simple model shows that a small and physically reasonable energy bias against locally unfavorable configurations, of the order of a few kT, can reduce Levinthal's time to a biologically significant size.	0
Title: Chemical synthesis and biological activity of analogues of the lantibiotic epilancin 15X Abstract: Lantibiotics are a large family of antibacterial peptide natural products containing multiple post-translational modifications, including the thioether structures lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Efforts to probe structure-activity relationships and engineer improved pharmacological properties have driven the development of new methods to produce non-natural analogues of these compounds. In this study, solid-supported chemical synthesis was used to produce analogues of the potent lantibiotic epilancin 15X, in order to assess the importance of several N-terminal post-translational modifications for biological activity. Surprisingly, substitution of these moieties, including the unusual N-terminal D-lactyl moiety, resulted in relatively small changes in the antimicrobial activity and pore-forming ability of the peptides.	1
Title: Mining Symbionts of a Spider-Transmitted Fungus Illuminates Uncharted Biosynthetic Pathways to Cytotoxic Benzolactones Abstract: A spider-transmitted fungus (Rhizopus microsporus) that was isolated from necrotic human tissue was found to harbor endofungal bacteria (Burkholderia sp.). Metabolic profiling of the symbionts revealed a complex of cytotoxic agents (necroximes). Their structures were characterized as oxime-substituted benzolactone enamides with a peptidic side chain. The potently cytotoxic necroximes are also formed in symbiosis with the fungal host and could have contributed to the necrosis. Genome sequencing and computational analyses revealed a novel modular PKS/NRPS assembly line equipped with several non-canonical domains. Based on gene-deletion mutants, we propose a biosynthetic model for bacterial benzolactones. We identified specific traits that serve as genetic handles to find related salicylate macrolide pathways (lobatamide, oximidine, apicularen) in various other bacterial genera. Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway enables biosynthetic engineering and genome-mining approaches.	1
Title: Characterization of genetic differences between Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium strains of diverse virulence with a focus on the glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis cluster Abstract: The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) encompasses important pathogens in both animals and humans, yet little information is available on the factors required for MAC virulence. An animal isolate, M. avium strain 724 was found to be considerably more virulent in Balb/c mice than a human isolate, M. avium strain A5. To identify the genetic basis of this difference subtractive hybridization was applied, which resulted in the isolation of six DNA fragments unique to strain 724. BLAST searches showed that three sequences belonged to a large gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of M. avium glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). To reveal the nature of variation between strains in the GPL cluster 27.5kb of a clone containing the A5 serotype-specific GPL (ssGPL) cluster was isolated, sequenced and compared to the corresponding region in other M. avium strains. The ssGPL cluster was highly conserved in the 5' region between all strains and serotypes tested; the 3' region reflects extensive divergence among serotypes including whole gene deletions and insertions of sequences containing open reading frames but lacking identity to any known genes.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence and characterization of a Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a flagellar switch protein Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis fliM gene has been determined. This gene encodes a 38-kDa protein that is homologous to the FliM flagellar switch proteins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Expression of this gene in Che+ cells of E. coli and B. subtilis interferes with normal chemotaxis. The nature of the chemotaxis defect is dependent upon the host used. In B. subtilis, overproduction of FliM generates mostly nonmotile cells. Those cells that are motile switch less frequently. Expression of B. subtilis FliM in E. coli also generates nonmotile cells. However, those cells that are motile have a tumble bias. The B. subtilis fliM gene cannot complement an E. coli fliM mutant. A frameshift mutation was constructed in the fliM gene, and the mutation was transferred onto the B. subtilis chromosome. The mutant has a Fla- phenotype. This phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that the FliM protein encodes a component of the flagellar switch in B. subtilis. Additional characterization of the fliM mutant suggests that the hag and mot loci are not expressed. These loci are regulated by the SigD form of RNA polymerase. We also did not observe any methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in an in vivo methylation experiment. The expression of these proteins is also dependent upon SigD. It is possible that a functional basal body-hook complex may be required for the expression of SigD-regulated chemotaxis and motility genes.	0
Title: Studies on condensed-heterocyclic azolium cephalosporins. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(condensed- heterocyclic azolium)methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylates Abstract: From our series of studies on cephalosporins bearing condensed-heterocyclic azolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus, we describe here the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido]ceph alosporins containing imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium, imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium, imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium, imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidinium, and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridinium methyl groups at the 3 position. Among the cephalosporins tested, 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3- (imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium-2-yl) (1), (imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium-1-yl) (2), and (pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyridinium-1-yl) (3)methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylates showed potent antibacterial activity and broad antibacterial spectrum. The antibacterial activity of these cephalosporins (1 approximately 3) was superior to that of ceftazidime (CAZ). These results imply that the delocalization of the positive charge of the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium, pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridinium and imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium groups leads to an expanded antibacterial spectrum and increased activity and that these condensed-heterocyclic compounds as well as imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine are effective moieties for improving antibacterial activity and spectrum.	0
Title: Application of an efficient gene targeting system linking secondary metabolites to their biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus terreus Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are natural products biosynthesized by NRP synthetases. A kusA-, pyrG- mutant strain of Aspergillus terreus NIH 2624 was developed that greatly facilitated the gene targeting efficiency in this organism. Application of this tool allowed us to link four major types of NRP-related secondary metabolites to their responsible genes in A. terreus. In addition, an NRP affecting melanin synthesis was also identified in this species.	1
Title: De novo generation of singlet oxygen and ammine ligands by photoactivation of a platinum anticancer complex Abstract: Worth the excitement: Highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are generated by photoactivation of the anticancer platinum(IV) complex trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3 )2 (OH)2 (MA)(Py)] (MA=methylamine, Py=pyridine). Singlet oxygen is formed from the hydroxido ligands and not from dissolved oxygen, and ammine ligands are products from the conversion of azido ligands to nitrenes. Both processes can induce oxidation of guanine.	0
Title: Structural basis for capping protein sequestration by myotrophin (V-1) Abstract: Capping protein (CP) is a ubiquitously expressed, heterodimeric 62-kDa protein that binds the barbed end of the actin filament with high affinity to block further filament elongation. Myotrophin (V-1) is a 13-kDa ankyrin repeat-containing protein that binds CP tightly, sequestering it in a totally inactive complex in vitro. Here, we elucidate the molecular interaction between CP and V-1 by NMR. Specifically, chemical shift mapping and intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments reveal that the ankyrin loops of V-1, which are essential for V-1/CP interaction, bind the basic patch near the joint of the alpha tentacle of CP shown previously to drive most of the association of CP with and affinity for the barbed end. Consistently, site-directed mutagenesis of CP shows that V-1 and the strong electrostatic binding site for CP on the barbed end compete for this basic patch on CP. These results can explain how V-1 inactivates barbed end capping by CP and why V-1 is incapable of uncapping CP-capped actin filaments, the two signature biochemical activities of V-1.	0
Title: The Immunosuppressant Brasilicardin: Determination of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in the Heterologous Host Amycolatopsis japonicum Abstract: Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 is the producer of the immunosuppressants brasilicardins A-D. Brasilicardin is a promising compound because of its unique mode of action and its higher potency and reduced toxicity compared to today's standard drugs. However, production of brasilicardin is so far hampered as Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 synthesizes brasilicardin in only low amounts and represents a human pathogen (biosafety level 2 BSL2). In order to achieve a safe and high yield production of brasilicardin A (BraA), the authors heterologously express the brasilicardin gene cluster in the nocardioform actinomycete Amycolatopsis japonicum (A. japonicum::bcaAB01), which is fast growing, genetically accessible and closely related to N. terpenica IFM 0406. In A. japonicum::bcaAB01, four brasilicardin congeners, intermediates of the BraA biosynthesis, are produced. Investigation of the genes flanking the previously defined brasilicardin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed two novel genes (bra0, bra12), which are involved in brasilicardin biosynthesis: bra12 encodes a transcriptional activator of the brasilicardin gene cluster. bra0 codes for a dioxygenase involved in methoxylation of brasilicardin. Based on this finding the authors are able to revise the proposed brasilicardin biosynthesis.	1
Title: High Plasticity of the Amicetin Biosynthetic Pathway in Streptomyces sp. SHP 22-7 Led to the Discovery of Streptcytosine P and Cytosaminomycins F and G and Facilitated the Production of 12F-Plicacetin Abstract: A chemical reinvestigation of the Indonesian strain Streptomyces sp. SHP 22-7 led to the isolation of three new pyrimidine nucleosides, along with six known analogues and zincphyrin. The structures of the new compounds (6, 7, 10) were elucidated by employing spectroscopic techniques (NMR, MS, CD, and IR) as well as enantioselective analyses of methyl branched side chain configurations. Application of the precursor-directed feeding approach led to the production and partial isolation of nine further pyrimidine analogues. The new compounds 6, 7, and 11 and three of the known compounds (2-4) were found to possess antimycobacterial and cytotoxic properties.	1
Title: Isolation and purification of a new kalimantacin/batumin-related polyketide antibiotic and elucidation of its biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Kal/bat, a polyketide, isolated to high purity (>95%) is characterized by strong and selective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus species (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.05 microg/mL), and no resistance was observed in strains already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The kal/bat biosynthesis gene cluster was determined to a 62 kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359. The kal/bat gene cluster consists of 16 open reading frames (ORF), encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS system, extended with trans-acting tailoring functions. A full model for kal/bat biosynthesis is postulated and experimentally tested by gene inactivation, structural confirmation (using NMR spectroscopy), and complementation. The structural and microbiological study of biosynthetic kal/bat analogs revealed the importance of the carbamoyl group and 17-keto group for antibacterial activity. The mechanism of self-resistance lies within the production of an inactive intermediate, which is activated in a one-step enzymatic oxidation upon export. The genetic basis and biochemical elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of this antibiotic will facilitate rational engineering for the design of novel structures with improved activities. This makes it a promising new therapeutic option to cope with multidrug-resistant clinical infections.	1
Title: An in situ directing group strategy for chiral anion phase-transfer fluorination of allylic alcohols Abstract: An enantioselective fluorination of allylic alcohols under chiral anion phase-transfer conditions is reported. The in situ generation of a directing group proved crucial for achieving effective enantiocontrol. In the presence of such a directing group, a range of acyclic substrates underwent fluorination to afford highly enantioenriched α-fluoro homoallylic alcohols. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a concerted enantiodetermining transition state involving both C-F bond formation and C-H bond cleavage.	0
Title: The properties of the positively charged loop region in PSI-G are essential for its "spontaneous" insertion into thylakoids and rapid assembly into the photosystem I complex Abstract: The PSI-G subunit of photosystem I (PSI) is an 11-kDa membrane protein that plays an important role in electron transport between plastocyanin and PSI and is involved in the stability of the PSI complex. Within the complex, the PSI-G subunit is bound to PSI-B and is in contact with Lhca1. PSI-G has two transmembrane spans connected by a positively charged stromal loop. The loop is inaccessible to proteases, indicating a tightly bound location within the PSI complex. Here, we have studied the insertion mechanism and assembly of PSI-G. We show that the protein inserts into thylakoids by a direct or "spontaneous" pathway that does not involve the activities of any known chloroplast protein-targeting machinery. Surprisingly, the positively charged stromal loop region plays a major role in this process. Mutagenesis or deletions within this region almost invariably lead to a marked lowering of insertion efficiency, strongly indicating a critical role for the loop in the organization of the transmembrane regions prior to or during membrane insertion. Finally, we have examined the assembly of newly inserted PSI-G into the PSI complex, since very little is known of the assembly pathway for this large multimeric complex. Interestingly, we find that inserted PSI-G can be found within the full PSI complex within the import assay time frame after insertion into thylakoids, strongly suggesting that PSI-G normally associates at the end of the assembly process. This is consistent with its location on the periphery of the complex.	0
Title: Spliceostatin hemiketal biosynthesis in Burkholderia spp. is catalyzed by an iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Abstract: Spliceostatins are potent spliceosome inhibitors biosynthesized by a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) system of the trans-acyl transferase (AT) type. Burkholderia sp. FERM BP-3421 produces hemiketal spliceostatins, such as FR901464, as well as analogs containing a terminal carboxylic acid. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence for hemiketal biosynthesis by oxidative decarboxylation rather than the previously hypothesized Baeyer-Villiger oxidative release postulated to be catalyzed by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) activity internal to the last module of the PKS. Inactivation of Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene fr9P led to loss of hemiketal congeners, whereas the mutant was still able to produce all major carboxylic acid-type compounds. FMO mutants, on the other hand, produced both hemiketal and carboxylic acid analogs containing an exocyclic methylene instead of an epoxide, indicating that the FMO is involved in epoxidation rather than Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Moreover, recombinant Fr9P enzyme was shown to catalyze hydroxylation to form β-hydroxy acids, which upon decarboxylation led to hemiketal FR901464. Finally, a third oxygenase activity encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Fr9R, was assigned as a 4-hydroxylase based on gene inactivation results. Identification and deletion of the gene involved in hemiketal formation allowed us to generate a strain--the dioxygenase fr9P(-) mutant--that accumulates only the carboxylic acid-type spliceostatins, which are as potent as the hemiketal analogs, when derivatized to increase cell permeability, but are chemically more stable.	1
Title: Activity screening of carrier domains within nonribosomal peptide synthetases using complex substrate mixtures and large molecule mass spectrometry Abstract: For screening a pool of potential substrates that load carrier domains found in nonribosomal peptide synthetases, large molecule mass spectrometry is shown to be a new, unbiased assay. Combining the high resolving power of Fourier transform mass spectrometry with the ability of adenylation domains to select their own substrates, the mass change that takes place upon formation of a covalent intermediate thus identifies the substrate. This assay has an advantage over traditional radiochemical assays in that many substrates, the substrate pool, can be screened simultaneously. Using proteins on the nikkomycin, clorobiocin, coumermycin A1, yersiniabactin, pyochelin, and enterobactin biosynthetic pathways as proof of principle, preferred substrates are readily identified from substrate pools. Furthermore, this assay can be used to provide insight into the timing of tailoring events of biosynthetic pathways as demonstrated using the bromination reaction found on the jamaicamide biosynthetic pathway. Finally, this assay can provide insight into the role and function of orphan gene clusters for which the encoded natural product is unknown. This is demonstrated by identifying the substrates for two NRPS modules from the pksN and pksJ genes that are found on an orphan NRPS/PKS hybrid cluster from Bacillus subtilis. This new assay format is especially timely for activity screening in an era when new types of thiotemplate assembly lines that defy classification are being discovered at an accelerating rate.	1
Title: Identification and structural characterisation of a catecholate-type siderophore produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a Abstract: Siderophores are produced by several bacteria that utilise iron in various environments. Elucidating the structure of a specific siderophore may have valuable applications in drug development. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a Gram-negative bacterium that inhabits a wide range of environments and can cause pneumonia, produces siderophores. However, the structure was unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate it. We purified siderophores from cultures of S. maltophilia K279a using preparative reversed-phase HPLC. The structure was analysed through LC-MS and 1H and 13C NMR. The results demonstrated that S. maltophilia K279a produces 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine (DHBS), a monomer unit of enterobactin. We suggested the uptake of Iron(III) by the DHBS complex. DHBS production by S. maltophilia K279a could be attributed to an incomplete enterobactin pathway. Drugs targeting DHBS synthesis could prevent S. maltophilia infection.	1
Title: Antibiotic resistance mechanisms inform discovery: identification and characterization of a novel amycolatopsis strain producing ristocetin Abstract: Discovering new antibiotics is a major scientific challenge, made increasingly urgent by the continued development of resistance in bacterial pathogens. A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance will be vital for the future discovery or design of new, more effective antibiotics. We have exploited our intimate knowledge of the molecular mechanism of glycopeptide antibiotic resistance in the harmless bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor to develop a new two-step cell wall bioactivity screen, which efficiently identified a new actinomycete strain containing a previously uncharacterized glycopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster. The screen first identifies natural product extracts capable of triggering a generalized cell wall stress response and then specifically selects for glycopeptide antibacterials by assaying for the induction of glycopeptide resistance genes. In this study, we established a diverse natural product extract library from actinomycete strains isolated from locations with widely varying climates and ecologies, and we screened them using the novel two-step bioassay system. The bioassay ultimately identified a single strain harboring the previously unidentified biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide ristocetin, providing a proof of principle for the effectiveness of the screen. This is the first report of the ristocetin biosynthetic gene cluster, which is predicted to include some interesting and previously uncharacterized enzymes. By focusing on screening libraries of microbial extracts, this strategy provides the certainty that identified producer strains are competent for growth and biosynthesis of the detected glycopeptide under laboratory conditions.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of phenylnannolone A, a multidrug resistance reversal agent from the halotolerant myxobacterium Nannocystis pusilla B150 Abstract: The myxobacterial strain Nannocystis pusilla B150 synthesizes the structurally new polyketides phenylnannolone A–C. Apart from some common volatiles and siderophores, these are the first natural products from the genus Nannocystis. Phenylnannolone A shows inhibitory activity towards the ABCB1 gene product P-glycoprotein and reverses daunorubicin resistance in cancer cells. To decipher the biochemical reactions leading to the formation of phenylnannolone A, the putative biosynthetic genes were identified (phn1, phn2). Phn2 is a polyketide synthase (PKS) with an NRPS-like loading module, and its domain order is consistent with the phenylnannolone A structure. The functionality and substrate selectivity of the loading module were determined by means of a γ-18O4-ATP pyrophosphate exchange and a phosphopantetheine ejection assay. A specific activation of cinnamic acid by the AMP-ligase was detected. Phn1 is a putative butyryl-CoA carboxylase (BCC), providing ethylmalonyl-CoA for the formation of the ethyl-substituted part of phenylnannolone A. Phn1 is the first BCC found in biosynthetic genes for an ethyl-substituted natural compound. Biosynthesis of phenylnannolone A, putatively encoded by phn1 and phn2, thus utilizes the first biosynthetic machinery in which both a BCC and a PKS are involved.	1
Title: Development of Marine-Derived Compounds for Cancer Therapy Abstract: Cancer has always been a threat to human health with its high morbidity and mortality rates. Traditional therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, plays a key role in cancer treatment. However, it is not able to prevent tumor recurrence, drug resistance and treatment side effects, which makes it a very attractive challenge to search for new effective and specific anticancer drugs. Nature is a valuable source of multiple pharmaceuticals, and most of the anticancer drugs are natural products or derived from them. Marine-derived compounds, such as nucleotides, proteins, peptides and amides, have also shed light on cancer therapy, and they are receiving a fast-growing interest due to their bioactive properties. Their mechanisms contain anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-metastasis activities; cell cycle arrest; and induction of apoptosis. This review provides an overview on the development of marine-derived compounds with anticancer properties, both their applications and mechanisms, and discovered technologies.	0
Title: Rapid Capture and Release of Nucleic Acids through a Reversible Photo-Cycloaddition Reaction in a Psoralen-Functionalized Hydrogel Abstract: Reversible immobilization of DNA and RNA is of great interest to researchers who seek to manipulate DNA or RNA in applications such as microarrays, DNA hydrogels, and gene therapeutics. However, there is no existing system that can rapidly capture and release intact nucleic acids. To meet this unmet need, we developed a functional hydrogel for rapid DNA/RNA capture and release based on the reversible photo-cycloaddition of psoralen and pyrimidines. The functional hydrogel can be easily fabricated through copolymerization of acrylamide with the synthesized allylated psoralen. The psoralen-functionalized hydrogel exhibits effective capture and release of nucleic acids spanning a wide range of lengths in a rapid fashion; over 90 % of the capture process is completed within 1 min, and circa 100 % of the release process is completed within 2 min. We observe no deleterious effects on the hybridization to the captured targets.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the beta-lactamase gene from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 and its similarity to staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the constitutively produced beta-lactamase (Bla) gene from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was shown to be identical to the published sequences of three of four staphylococcal type A beta-lactamase genes; more differences were seen with the genes for staphylococcal type C and D enzymes. One hundred forty nucleotides upstream of the beta-lactamase start codon were determined for an inducible staphylococcal beta-lactamase and were identical to those of the constitutively expressed enterococcal gene, indicating that the changes resulting in constitutive expression are not due to changes in the promoter or operator region. Moreover, complementation studies indicated that production of the enterococcal enzyme could be repressed. The genes for the enterococcal Bla and an inducible staphylococcal Bla were each cloned into a shuttle vector and transformed into enterococcal and staphylococcal recipients. The major difference between the backgrounds of the two hosts was that more enzyme was produced by the staphylococcal host, regardless of the source of the gene. The location of the enzyme was found to be host dependent, since each cloned gene generated extracellular (free) enzyme in the staphylococcus and cell-bound enzyme in the enterococcus. On the basis of the identities of the enterococcal Bla and several staphylococcal Bla sequences, these data suggest the recent spread of beta-lactamase to enterococci and also suggest the loss of a functional repressor.	0
Title: Synthesis of (+/-)-bistellettadine A Abstract: Esterification of the trienoic acid with o-xylylene dibromide gave the bis ester that underwent a templated Diels-Alder reaction to afford the macrodiolide stereospecifically in a single step.

Title: Scytodecamide from the Cultured Scytonema sp. UIC 10036 Expands the Chemical and Genetic Diversity of Cyanobactins Abstract: Cyanobactins are a large family of cyanobacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) often associated with biological activities, such as cytotoxicity, antiviral, and antimalarial activities. They are traditionally described as cyclic molecules containing heterocyclized amino acids. However, this definition has been recently challenged by the discovery of short, linear cyanobactins containing three to five amino acids as well as cyanobactins containing no heterocyclized residues. Herein we report the discovery of scytodecamide (1) from the freshwater cyanobacterium Scytonema sp. UIC 10036. Structural elucidation based on mass spectrometry, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and Marfey's method revealed 1 to be a linear decapeptide with an N-terminal N-methylation and a C-terminal amidation. The genome of Scytonema sp. UIC 10036 was sequenced, and bioinformatic analysis revealed a cyanobactin-like biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the structure of 1. The discovery of 1 as a novel linear peptide containing an N-terminal N-methylation and a C-terminal amidation expands the chemical and genetic diversity of the cyanobactin family of compounds.	1
Title: The loading domain of the erythromycin polyketide synthase is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: 6-Deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a large multifunctional enzyme that catalyses the biosynthesis of the erythromycin polyketide aglycone. DEBS is organized into six modules, each containing the enzymic domains required for a single condensation of carboxylic acid residues which make up the growing polyketide chain. Module 1 is preceded by loading acyltransferase (AT-L) and acyl carrier protein (ACP-L) domains, hypothesized to initiate polyketide chain growth with a propionate-derived moiety. Using recombinant DNA technology several mutant strains of Saccharopolyspora erythraea were constructed that lack the initial AT-L domain or that lack both the AT-L and ACP-L domains. These strains were still able to produce erythromycin, although at much lower levels than that produced by the wild-type strain. In addition, the AT-L domain expressed as a monofunctional enzyme was able to complement the deletion of this domain from the PKS, resulting in increased levels of erythromycin production. These findings indicate that neither the initial AT-L nor the ACP-L domains are required to initiate erythromycin biosynthesis; however, without these domains the efficiency of erythromycin biosynthesis is decreased significantly. It is proposed that in these mutants the first step in erythromycin biosynthesis is the charging of KS1 with propionate directly from propionyl-CoA.	1
Title: Molecular analysis of the kirromycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed beta-alanine as precursor of the pyridone moiety Abstract: Kirromycin is a complex linear polyketide that acts as a protein biosynthesis inhibitor by binding to the bacterial elongation factor Tu. The kirromycin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from the producer, Streptomyces collinus Tü 365, and confirmed by targeted disruption of essential biosynthesis genes. Kirromycin is synthesized by a large hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) encoded by the genes kirAI-kirAVI. This complex involves some very unusual features, including the absence of internal acyltransferase (AT) domains in KirAI-KirAV, multiple split-ups of PKS modules on separate genes, and swapping in the domain organization. Interestingly, one PKS enzyme, KirAVI, contains internal AT domains. Based on in silico analysis, a route to pyridone formation involving PKS and NRPS steps was postulated. This hypothesis was experimentally proven by feeding studies with [U-13C3(15)N]beta-alanine and NMR and MS analyses of the isolated pure kirromycin.	1
Title: Isolation of the exoelectrogenic bacterium Ochrobactrum anthropi YZ-1 by using a U-tube microbial fuel cell Abstract: Exoelectrogenic bacteria have potential for many different biotechnology applications due to their ability to transfer electrons outside the cell to insoluble electron acceptors, such as metal oxides or the anodes of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Very few exoelectrogens have been directly isolated from MFCs, and all of these organisms have been obtained by techniques that potentially restrict the diversity of exoelectrogenic bacteria. A special U-tube-shaped MFC was therefore developed to enrich exoelectrogenic bacteria with isolation based on dilution-to-extinction methods. Using this device, we obtained a pure culture identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi YZ-1 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological and biochemical characterization. Strain YZ-1 was unable to respire using hydrous Fe(III) oxide but produced 89 mW/m(2) using acetate as the electron donor in the U-tube MFC. Strain YZ-1 produced current using a wide range of substrates, including acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, glucose, sucrose, cellobiose, glycerol, and ethanol. Like another exoelectrogenic bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), O. anthropi is an opportunistic pathogen, suggesting that electrogenesis should be explored as a characteristic that confers advantages to these types of pathogenic bacteria. Further applications of this new U-tube MFC system should provide a method for obtaining additional exoelectrogenic microorganisms that do not necessarily require metal oxides for cell respiration.	0
Title: Occidiofungin is an important component responsible for the antifungal activity of Burkholderia pyrrocinia strain Lyc2 Abstract: Aims:                       To identify the taxonomy of tobacco rhizosphere-isolated strain Lyc2 and investigate the mechanisms of the antifungal activities, focusing on antimicrobials gene clusters identification and function analysis.                  Methods and results:                       Multilocus sequence typing and 16S rRNA analyses indicated that strain Lyc2 belongs to Burkholderia pyrrocinia. Bioassay results indicated strain Lyc2 showed significant antifungal activities against a broad range of plant and animal fungal pathogens and control efficacy on seedling damping off disease of cotton. A 55·2-kb gene cluster which was homologous to ocf gene clusters in Burkholderia contaminans MS14 was confirmed to be responsible for antifungal activities by random mutagenesis; HPLC was used to verify the production of antifungal compounds. Multiple antibiotic and secondary metabolized biosynthesis gene clusters predicated by antiSMASH revealed the broad spectrum of antimicrobials activities of the strain.                  Conclusions:                       Our results revealed the mechanisms of antifungal activities of strain Lyc2 and expand our knowledge about production of occidiofungin in the bacteria Burkholderia.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Understanding the mechanisms of antifungal activities of strain Lyc2 has contributed to discovery of new antibiotics and expand our knowledge of production of occidiofungin in the bacteria Burkholderia.	1
Title: Production of a Dibrominated Aromatic Secondary Metabolite by a Planctomycete Implies Complex Interaction with a Macroalgal Host Abstract: The roles of the majority of bacterial secondary metabolites, especially those from uncommon sources, are still elusive even though many of these compounds show striking biological activities. To further investigate the secondary metabolite repertoire of underexploited bacterial families, we chose to analyze a novel representative of the yet untapped bacterial phylum Planctomycetes for the production of secondary metabolites under laboratory culture conditions. Development of a planctomycetal high density cultivation technique in combination with high resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed Planctomycetales strain 10988 to produce the plant toxin 3,5-dibromo-p-anisic acid. This molecule represents the first secondary metabolite reported from any planctomycete. Genome mining revealed the biosynthetic origin of this doubly brominated secondary metabolite, and a biosynthesis model for the compound was devised. Comparison of the biosynthetic route to biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for formation of polybrominated small aromatic compounds reveals evidence of an evolutionary link, while the compound's herbicidal activity points toward a complex interaction of planctomycetes with their macroalgal host.	1
Title: Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products Abstract: Azaphilones are a family of polyketide-based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome-mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.	0
Title: Identification of the biosynthesis gene cluster for the novel lantibiotic paenilan from Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 and characterization of its product Abstract: Aims:                       To analyse the function of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 and to characterize its product, paenilan.                  Methods and results:                       Comparative analysis of the lantibiotic gene cluster of E681 revealed that the cluster, consisting of 11 open reading frames, is involved in the biosynthesis of a class I lantibiotic. The pnlA gene encoding the prepeptide PnlA was identified and P. polymyxa strain EPT14 producing only paenilan was constructed by knockout of the other five antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters of E681. Paenilan was purified from EPT14 culture by solvent partitioning, ODS silica gel chromatography and reversed-phase preparative HPLC. The molecular mass (2510·10 Da) and structure of paenilan analysed by Nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS showed that paenilan is a novel class I lantibiotic. Paenilan exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus and Paenibacillus durus. The paenilan gene is well-conserved in different Paenibacillus sp. isolated from globally distant places.                  Conclusions:                       The lantibiotic gene cluster of P. polymyxa E681 was analysed and its product, a novel and useful lantibiotic named paenilan that inhibits the growth of some Gram-positive bacteria, was characterized.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Paenibacillus species are a good source of new lantibiotics, and the conservation of the paenilan gene among Paenibacillus sp. implies paenilan has an important function(s) for their survival.	1
Title: Alpha-lactosylceramide as a novel "sugar-capped" CD1d ligand for natural killer T cells: biased cytokine profile and therapeutic activities Abstract: The invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) cells have emerged as an important regulator of immunity to infection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. They can be activated by glycolipids that bind to CD1d. The most effective iNKT ligand reported to date is alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), which stimulates iNKT cells to secrete both Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines. Indiscriminate induction of both types of cytokines could limit the therapeutic potential of iNKT ligands, as Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines play different roles under physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, a ligand with a biased cytokine-release profile would be highly desirable. Here, we report the synthesis and biological activity of alpha-lactosylceramide (alpha-LacCer). Our data demonstrate that alpha-LacCer can stimulate iNKT cells to proliferate and release cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, while alpha-LacCer is approximately 1000-times less efficient than alpha-GalCer in inducing Th-1 cytokines, it is as potent as alpha-GalCer in the induction of Th-2 cytokines; therefore, alpha-LacCer is a novel compound that induces a biased cytokine release. Processing by beta-glycosidase was critical for alpha-LacCer activity. Moreover, in vivo experiments suggest that alpha-LacCer is at least as potent as alpha-GalCer in the treatment of tumors and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	0
Title: Synthesis and structure-activity studies of new 4''-O-acyltylosin derivatives of therapeutic interest Abstract: Eleven 4''-O-acyltylosin derivatives were synthesized and subjected to a two-step screening system consisting of antimicrobial activity and esterase stability assays. The new derivatives were all active against macrolide-resistant Staphylococci and mycoplasmas, but only 4''-O-(4-methoxy)phenylacetyltylosin and 4''-O-(4-acetyl)phenylacetyltylosin showed better resistance to mouse liver esterase than 4''-O-phenylacetyltylosin (reference compound C).	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the tunicamycin antibiotics proceeds via unique exo-glycal intermediates Abstract: The tunicamycins are archetypal nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis and eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Understanding the biosynthesis of their unusual carbon framework may lead to variants with improved selectivity. Here, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of key sugar-manipulating enzymes from this pathway. TunA is found to exhibit unusual regioselectivity in the reduction of a key α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product of this reaction is shown to be the preferred substrate for TunF--an epimerase that converts the glucose derivative to a galactose. In Streptomyces strains in which another gene (tunB) is deleted, the biosynthesis is shown to stall at this exo-glycal product. These investigations confirm the combined TunA/F activity and delineate the ordering of events in the metabolic pathway. This is the first time these surprising exo-glycal intermediates have been seen in biology. They suggest that construction of the aminodialdose core of tunicamycin exploits their enol ether motif in a mode of C-C bond formation not previously observed in nature, to create an 11-carbon chain.	1
Title: Exopolysaccharides promote Myxococcus xanthus social motility by inhibiting cellular reversals Abstract: The biofilm-forming bacterium Myxococcus xanthus moves on surfaces as structured swarms utilizing type IV pili-dependent social (S) motility. In contrast to isolated cells that reverse their moving direction frequently, individual cells within swarms rarely reverse. The regulatory mechanisms that inhibit cellular reversal and promote the formation of swarms are not well understood. Here we show that exopolysaccharides (EPS), the major extracellular components of M. xanthus swarms, inhibit cellular reversal in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, individual wild-type cells reverse less frequently in swarms due to high local EPS concentrations. In contrast, cells defective in EPS production hyper-reverse their moving direction and show severe defects in S-motility. Surprisingly, S-motility and wild-type reversal frequency are restored in double mutants that are defective in both EPS production and the Frz chemosensory system, indicating that EPS regulates cellular reversal in parallel to the Frz pathway. Here we clarify that besides functioning as the structural scaffold in biofilms, EPS is a self-produced signal that coordinates the group motion of the social bacterium M. xanthus.	0
Title: Identification and engineering of 32 membered antifungal macrolactone notonesomycins Abstract: Notonesomycin A is a 32-membered bioactive glycosylated macrolactone known to be produced by Streptomyces aminophilus subsp. notonesogenes 647-AV1 and S. aminophilus DSM 40186. In a high throughput antifungal screening campaign, we identified an alternative notonesomycin A producing strain, Streptomyces sp. A793, and its biosynthetic gene cluster. From this strain, we further characterized a new more potent antifungal non-sulfated analogue, named notonesomycin B. Through CRISPR-Cas9 engineering of the biosynthetic gene cluster, we were able to increase the production yield of notonesomycin B by up to 18-fold as well as generate a strain that exclusively produces this analogue.	1
Title: Characterization of two polyketide methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus Abstract: A DNA chromosomal region of Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12596, the producer organism of the antitumor polyketide drug mithramycin, was cloned. Sequence analysis of this DNA region, located between four mithramycin glycosyltransferase genes, showed the presence of two genes (mtmMI and mtmMII) whose deduced products resembled S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. By independent insertional inactivation of both genes nonproducing mutants were generated that accumulated different mithramycin biosynthetic intermediates. The M3DeltaMI mutant (mtmMI-minus mutant) accumulated 4-demethylpremithramycinone (4-DPMC) which lacks the methyl groups at carbons 4 and 9. The M3DeltaM2 (mtmMII-minus mutant) accumulated 9-demethylpremithramycin A3 (9-DPMA3), premithramycin A1 (PMA1), and 7-demethylmithramycin, all of them containing the O-methyl group at C-4 and C-1', respectively, but lacking the methyl group at the aromatic position. Both genes were expressed in Streptomyces lividans TK21 under the control of the erythromycin resistance promoter (ermEp) of Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Cell-free extracts of these clones were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (90% saturation) and assayed for methylation activity using different mithramycin intermediates as substrates. Extracts of strains MJM1 (expressing the mtmMI gene) and MJM2 (expressing the mtmMII gene) catalyzed efficient transfer of tritium from [(3)H]S-adenosylmethionine into 4-DPMC and 9-DPMA3, respectively, being unable to methylate other intermediates at a detectable level. These results demonstrate that the mtmMI and mtmMII genes code for two S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases responsible for the 4-O-methylation and 9-C-methylation steps of the biosynthetic precursors 4-DPMC and 9-DPMA3, respectively, of the antitumor drug mithramycin. A pathway is proposed for the last steps in the biosynthesis of mithramycin involving these methylation events.	1
Title: Colorimetric Carbonyl Sulfide (COS)/Hydrogen Sulfide (H2 S) Donation from γ-Ketothiocarbamate Donor Motifs Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a biologically active molecule that exhibits protective effects in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although several H2 S-related biological effects have been discovered by using H2 S donors, knowing how much H2 S has been released from donors under different conditions remains challenging. Now, a series of γ-ketothiocarbamate (γ-KetoTCM) compounds that provide the first examples of colorimetric H2 S donors and enable direct quantification of H2 S release, were reported. These compounds are activated through a pH-dependent deprotonation/β-elimination sequence to release carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is quickly converted into H2 S by carbonic anhydrase. The p-nitroaniline released upon donor activation provides an optical readout that correlates directly to COS/H2 S release, thus enabling colorimetric measurement of H2 S donation.	0
Title: Gut fungal dysbiosis correlates with reduced efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridium difficile infection Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Bacterial colonization in recipients after FMT has been studied, but little is known about the role of the gut fungal community, or mycobiota. Here, we show evidence of gut fungal dysbiosis in CDI, and that donor-derived fungal colonization in recipients is associated with FMT response. CDI is accompanied by over-representation of Candida albicans and decreased fungal diversity, richness, and evenness. Cure after FMT is associated with increased colonization of donor-derived fungal taxa in recipients. Recipients of successful FMT ("responders") display, after FMT, a high relative abundance of Saccharomyces and Aspergillus, whereas "nonresponders" and individuals treated with antibiotics display a dominant presence of Candida. High abundance of C. albicans in donor stool also correlates with reduced FMT efficacy. Furthermore, C. albicans reduces FMT efficacy in a mouse model of CDI, while antifungal treatment reestablishes its efficacy, supporting a potential causal relationship between gut fungal dysbiosis and FMT outcome.	0
Title: Expansion within the CYP71D subfamily drives the heterocyclization of tanshinones synthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza Abstract: Tanshinones are the bioactive nor-diterpenoid constituents of the Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza). These groups of chemicals have the characteristic furan D-ring, which differentiates them from the phenolic abietane-type diterpenoids frequently found in the Lamiaceae family. However, how the 14,16-epoxy is formed has not been elucidated. Here, we report an improved genome assembly of Danshen using a highly homozygous genotype. We identify a cytochrome P450 (CYP71D) tandem gene array through gene expansion analysis. We show that CYP71D373 and CYP71D375 catalyze hydroxylation at carbon-16 (C16) and 14,16-ether (hetero)cyclization to form the D-ring, whereas CYP71D411 catalyzes upstream hydroxylation at C20. In addition, we discover a large biosynthetic gene cluster associated with tanshinone production. Collinearity analysis indicates a more specific origin of tanshinones in Salvia genus. It illustrates the evolutionary origin of abietane-type diterpenoids and those with a furan D-ring in Lamiaceae.	1
Title: Rectification of two Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin allele sequences and lack of biological effect of changing the carboxy-terminal tyrosine to histidine Abstract: Resequencing estA3, an allele of the methanol-soluble heat-stable enterotoxin of Escherichia coli showed that the proline triplet 19 is in fact an alanine codon; thus, estA alleles 3 and 4 were shown to be identical. Resequencing has also shown that the carboxy terminus of another allele, estA2, is not the previously inferred histidine triplet but the same tyrosine codon reported for all other estA alleles. The improperly inferred histidine codon was used in constructions to fuse estA2 to the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin gene, and the fused gene products as well as three amino acid insertional mutants containing histidine-72 were not efficiently secreted. We show that the defective secretion is not due to histidine as a carboxy-terminal residue, since site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type tyrosine-72 to histidine did not influence the localization of the activity of the methanol-soluble heat-stable enterotoxin.	1
Title: The proton channel is the minimal structure of ATP synthase necessary and sufficient for microcin h47 antibiotic action Abstract: It had been previously determined that the presence of F(o)F(1) ATP synthase was required for microcin H47 antibiotic action. In this work, microcin-resistant atp mutants were genetically analyzed. Their mutations, originated by Tn5 insertion, in all cases were found to affect determinants for the F(o) portion of ATP synthase. To discern if microcin action required the presence of the entire complex or if the F(o) proton channel would suffice, recombinant plasmids carrying different segments of the atp operon were constructed and introduced into an atp deletion strain. The phenotypic analysis of the strains thus obtained clearly indicated that the presence of the F(o) proton channel was absolutely required for microcin H47 action, while the F(1) catalytic portion was found to be dispensable. Furthermore, when any of the three components of the proton channel was missing, total resistance to the antibiotic ensued. Complementation analysis between atp::Tn5 chromosomal mutations and recombinant atp plasmid constructions further supported the idea that the proton channel would be the minimal structure of the ATP synthase complex needed for microcin H47 antibiotic action.	1
Title: In-vivo biodistribution and safety of 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC in canine non-Hodgkin lymphoma Abstract: Theranostic agents are critical for improving the diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). The peptidomimetic LLP2A is a novel peptide receptor radiotherapy candidate for treating NHL that expresses the activated α4β1 integrin. Tumor-bearing dogs are an excellent model of human NHL with similar clinical characteristics, behavior, and compressed clinical course. Canine in vivo imaging studies will provide valuable biodistribution and affinity information that reflects a diverse clinical population of lymphoma. This may also help to determine potential dose-limiting radiotoxicity to organs in human clinical trials. To validate this construct in a naturally occurring model of NHL, we performed in-vivo molecular targeted imaging and biodistribution in 3 normal dogs and 5 NHL bearing dogs. (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG and (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC were successfully synthesized and had very good labeling efficiency and radiochemical purity. (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC and (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG had biodistribution in keeping with their molecular size, with (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG remaining longer in the circulation, having higher tissue uptake, and having more activity in the liver compared to (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC. (99m)Tc-LLP2A-HYNIC was mainly eliminated through the kidneys with some residual activity. Radioactivity was reduced to near-background levels at 6 hours after injection. In NHL dogs, tumor showed moderately increased activity over background, with tumor activity in B-cell lymphoma dogs decreasing after chemotherapy. This compound is promising in the development of targeted drug-delivery radiopharmaceuticals and may contribute to translational work in people affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for kutznerides Abstract: Kutznerides, actinomycete-derived cyclic depsipetides, consist of six nonproteinogenic residues, including a highly oxygenated tricyclic hexahydropyrroloindole, a chlorinated piperazic acid, 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-glycine, a beta-branched-hydroxy acid, and 3-hydroxy glutamic acid, for which biosynthetic logic has not been elucidated. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster for the kutzneride family, identified by degenerate primer PCR for halogenating enzymes postulated to be involved in biosyntheses of these unusual monomers. The 56-kb gene cluster encodes a series of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules distributed over three proteins and a variety of tailoring enzymes, including both mononuclear nonheme iron and two flavin-dependent halogenases, and an array of oxygen transfer catalysts. The sequence and organization of NRPS genes support incorporation of the unusual monomer units into the densely functionalized scaffold of kutznerides. Our work provides insight into the formation of this intriguing class of compounds and provides a foundation for elucidating the timing and mechanisms of their biosynthesis.	1
Title: Hydrogen 21-centimeter emission from a galaxy at cosmological distance Abstract: We have detected the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission line at a cosmologically significant distance [redshift (z) = 0.18] in the rich galaxy cluster Abell 2218 with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. The HI emission originates in a spiral galaxy 2.0 h65(-1) megaparsecs from the cluster core. No other significant detections have been made in the cluster, suggesting that the mechanisms that remove neutral gas from cluster galaxies are efficient. We infer that fewer than three gas-rich galaxies were accreted by Abell 2218 over the past 10(9) years. This low accretion rate is qualitatively consistent with low-density cosmological models in which clusters are largely assembled at z > 1.	0
Title: Gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective carboalkoxylation of alkynes Abstract: A highly enantioselective carboalkoxylation of alkynes catalyzed by cationic (DTBM-MeO-Biphep)gold(I) complexes is reported. Various optically active β-alkoxyindanone derivatives were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Furthermore, this methodology was extended to the enantioselective synthesis of 3-methoxycyclopentenones. The reaction is proposed to proceed through an enantioselective cyclization of intermediates containing vinylgold(I) and prochiral oxocarbenium moieties.	0
Title: Functional characterization of cell-wall-associated protein WapA in Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Streptococcus mutans is known as a primary pathogen responsible for dental caries. One of the virulence factors of S. mutans in cariogenicity is its ability to attach to the tooth surface and form a biofilm. Several surface proteins have been shown to be involved in this process. A 29 kDa surface protein named wall-associated protein A (WapA, antigen A or antigen III), was previously used as a vaccine in animal studies for immunization against dental caries. However, the function of WapA in S. mutans is still not clear. This study characterized the function of WapA in cell surface structure and biofilm formation. Compared to the wild-type, the wapA mutant had much-reduced cell chain length, diminished cell-cell aggregation, altered cell surface ultrastructure, and unstructured biofilm architecture. Furthermore, in vivo force spectroscopy revealed that the cell surface of the wapA mutant was less sticky than that of the wild-type cells. More interestingly, these phenotypic differences diminished as sucrose concentration in the medium was increased to 0.5 %. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that sucrose strongly repressed wapA gene expression in both planktonic and biofilm cells. These results suggest that the WapA protein plays an important structural role on the cell surface, which ultimately affects sucrose-independent cell-cell aggregation and biofilm architecture.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster from penicillum chrysogenum Abstract: A cosmid clone containing the putative penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium chrysogenum was used to transform the related filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus niger, which do not produce beta-lactam antibiotics. Both of the transformed hosts contained intact P. chrysogenum DNA derived from the cosmid clone and produced authentic penicillin V. Assays of penicillin biosynthetic enzyme activity additionally demonstrated that they possessed delta-(L-alpha-amino-adipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS), isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) and acyl coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase (ACT) activity. The data suggests that genes encoding all the enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of penicillin from amino acid precursors are closely linked in P. chrysogenum and constitute a gene cluster.	1
Title: Multi-omics Study of Planobispora rosea, Producer of the Thiopeptide Antibiotic GE2270A Abstract: Planobispora rosea is the natural producer of the potent thiopeptide antibiotic GE2270A. Here, we present the results of a metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis of P. rosea during production of GE2270A. The data generated provides useful insights into the biology of this genetically intractable bacterium. We characterize the details of the shutdown of protein biosynthesis and the respiratory chain associated with the end of the exponential growth phase. We also provide the first description of the phosphate regulon in P. rosea. Based on the transcriptomics data, we show that both phosphate and iron are limiting P. rosea growth in our experimental conditions. Additionally, we identified and validated a new biosynthetic gene cluster associated with the production of the siderophores benarthin and dibenarthin in P. rosea. Together, the metabolomics and transcriptomics data are used to inform and refine the very first genome-scale metabolic model for P. rosea, which will be a valuable framework for the interpretation of future studies of the biology of this interesting but poorly characterized species. IMPORTANCE Planobispora rosea is a genetically intractable bacterium used for the production of GE2270A on an industrial scale. GE2270A is a potent thiopeptide antibiotic currently used as a precursor for the synthesis of two compounds under clinical studies for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection and acne. Here, we present the very first systematic multi-omics investigation of this important bacterium, which provides a much-needed detailed picture of the dynamics of metabolism of P. rosea while producing GE2270A.	1
Title: A gene cluster for biosynthesis of kanamycin from Streptomyces kanamyceticus: comparison with gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Gene clusters for the biosynthesis of kanamycin (Km) and gentamicin (Gm) were isolated from the genomic libraries of Streptomyces kanamyceticus and Micromonospora echinospora, respectively. The sequencing of the 47 kb-region of S. kanamyceticus genomic DNA revealed 40 putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding Km biosynthetic proteins, regulatory proteins, and resistance and transport proteins. Similarly, the sequencing of 32.6 kb genomic DNA of M. echinospora revealed a Gm biosynthetic gene cluster flanked by resistant genes. Biosynthetic pathways for the formation of Km were proposed by the comparative study of biosynthetic genes. Out of 12 putative Km biosynthetic genes, kanA was expressed in Escherichia coli and determined its function as a 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase. Furthermore, the acetylations of aminoglycoside-aminocyclitols (AmAcs) by Km acetyltransferase (KanM) were also demonstrated. The acetylated derivatives completely lost their antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis. The comparative genetic studies of Gm, Km, tobramycin (Tm), and butirosin (Bn) reveal their similar biosynthetic routes and provide a framework for the further biosynthetic studies.	1
Title: The large linear plasmid pSLA2-L of Streptomyces rochei has an unusually condensed gene organization for secondary metabolism Abstract: The complete nucleotide sequence of the large linear plasmid pSLA2-L in Streptomyces rochei strain 7434AN4 has been determined. pSLA2-L was found to be 210 614 bp long with a GC content of 72.8% and carries 143 open reading frames. It is especially noteworthy that three-quarters of the pSLA2-L DNA is occupied by secondary metabolism-related genes, namely two type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters for lankacidin and lankamycin, a mithramycin synthase-like type II PKS gene cluster, a carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster and many regulatory genes. In particular, the lankacidin PKS is unique, because it may be a mixture of modular- and iterative-type PKSs and carries a fusion protein of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and PKS. It is also interesting that all the homologues of the afsA, arpA, adpA and strR genes in the A-factor regulatory cascade in Streptomyces griseus were found on pSLA2-L, and disruption of the afsA homologue caused non-production of both lankacidin and lankamycin. These results, together with the finding of three possible replication origins at 50-63 kb from the right end, suggest that the present form of pSLA2-L might have been generated by a series of insertions of the biosynthetic gene clusters into the left side of the original plasmid.	1
Title: The complete gene cluster of the antitumor agent gilvocarcin V and its implication for the biosynthesis of the gilvocarcins Abstract: Gilvocarcin V, an antitumor agent produced by the bacterium Streptomyces griseoflavus Gö 3592, is the most studied representative of the distinct family of benzo[d]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-one aryl C-glycoside antibiotics, which show excellent antitumor activity and a remarkably low toxicity. Its biosynthesis contains many intriguing steps, including an oxidative rearrangement, the C-glycosylation, and the generation of a vinyl side chain. These steps all contribute to structural elements of the drug, which are essential for its biological activity, but only poorly understood. Herein we report the cloning and characterization of the gilvocarcin (gil) gene cluster from S. griseoflavus Gö 3592, and its heterologous expression in a foreign host (S. lividans). This is the first reported gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of a benzo[d]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-one aryl C-glycoside antibiotic, which not only provides insights regarding the biosynthesis of gilvocarcin V but also lays the foundation for the detailed studies of its intriguing biosynthetic steps and possibly for the generation of gilvocarcin analogues with improved biological activities through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: The zinc cluster transcription factor Tac1p regulates PDR16 expression in Candida albicans Abstract: The Candida albicans PDR16 gene, encoding a putative phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, is co-induced with the multidrug transporter genes CDR1 and CDR2 in azole-resistant (A(R)) clinical isolates and upon fluphenazine exposure of azole-susceptible (A(S)) cells, suggesting that it is regulated by Tac1p, the transcriptional activator of CDR genes. Deleting TAC1 in an A(R) isolate (5674) overexpressing PDR16, CDR1 and CDR2 decreased the expression of the three genes and fluconazole resistance to levels similar to those detected in the matched A(S) isolate (5457), demonstrating that Tac1p is responsible for PDR16 upregulation in that strain. Deleting TAC1 in the A(S) strain SC5314 abolished CDR2 induction by fluphenazine and decreased that of PDR16 and CDR1, uncovering the participation of an additional factor in the regulation of PDR16 and CDR1 expression. Sequencing of the TAC1 alleles identified one homozygous mutation in strain 5674, an Asn to Asp substitution at position 972 in the C-terminus of Tac1p. Introduction of the Asp(972) allele in a tac1Delta/Delta mutant caused high levels of fluconazole resistance and TAC1, PDR16, CDR1 and CDR2 constitutive induction. These results demonstrate that: (i) Tac1p controls PDR16 expression; (ii) Asn(972) to Asp(972) is a gain-of-function mutation; and (iii) Tac1p is positively autoregulated, directly or indirectly.	0
Title: Aspartic acid 349 in the fourth epidermal growth factor-like structure of human thrombomodulin plays a role in its Ca(2+)-mediated binding to protein C Abstract: The last three consecutive epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures of human thrombomodulin constitute the functional domain for protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity. Using site-directed deletion mutagenesis, we found that amino acid Asp349 of TME456, a recombinantly produced protein consisting of EGF-like structures 4, 5, and 6, is essential for retaining full protein C-activating cofactor activity. To investigate the role of Asp349 in the protein C-activating cofactor activity of human thrombomodulin, we have constructed two mutants of TMD123, a recombinantly produced protein consisting of domains D1, D2, and D3 of thrombomodulin, using site-directed point mutagenesis of the thrombomodulin coding sequence. In mutant TMD123A, the Asp349 codon was replaced with an Ala codon and in mutant TMD123E, the Asp349 codon was replaced with a Glu codon. The partially purified mutant proteins were assayed for their protein C-activating cofactor activity at various Ca2+ concentrations. TMD123 and TMD123E protein showed similar high levels of cofactor activity and similar patterns of Ca2+ dependence, while TMD123A had lower cofactor activity and did not show any Ca2+ dependence. We concluded that Asp349 in the fourth EGF-like structure of human thrombomodulin plays a role in its Ca(2+)-mediated binding to protein C.	0
Title: Microcarriers Based on Glycosaminoglycan-Like Marine Exopolysaccharide for TGF-β1 Long-Term Protection Abstract: Articular cartilage is an avascular, non-innervated connective tissue with limited ability to regenerate. Articular degenerative processes arising from trauma, inflammation or due to aging are thus irreversible and may induce the loss of the joint function. To repair cartilaginous defects, tissue engineering approaches are under intense development. Association of cells and signalling proteins, such as growth factors, with biocompatible hydrogel matrix may lead to the regeneration of the healthy tissue. One current strategy to enhance both growth factor bioactivity and bioavailability is based on the delivery of these signalling proteins in microcarriers. In this context, the aim of the present study was to develop microcarriers by encapsulating Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) into microparticles based on marine exopolysaccharide (EPS), namely GY785 EPS, for further applications in cartilage engineering. Using a capillary microfluidic approach, two microcarriers were prepared. The growth factor was either encapsulated directly within the microparticles based on slightly sulphated derivative or complexed firstly with the highly sulphated derivative before being incorporated within the microparticles. TGF-β1 release, studied under in vitro model conditions, revealed that the majority of the growth factor was retained inside the microparticles. Bioactivity of released TGF-β1 was particularly enhanced in the presence of highly sulphated derivative. It comes out from this study that GY785 EPS based microcarriers may constitute TGF-β1 reservoirs spatially retaining the growth factor for a variety of tissue engineering applications and in particular cartilage regeneration, where the growth factor needs to remain in the target location long enough to induce robust regenerative responses.	0
Title: Phospholipid turnover during the division cycle of Escherichia coli Abstract: The turnover of phospholipids in Escherichia coli B/r was analyzed in synchronously growing populations. The turnover of presynthesized phosphatidyl-glycerol and cardiolipin continued at a constant exponential rate throughout the division cycle.	0
Title: Emulsifier of Arthrobacter RAG-1: chemical and physical properties Abstract: The extracellular emulsifier of Arthrobacter RAG-1 was deproteinized by hot phenol treatment and purified by fractional precipitation with (NH(4))(2)SO(4). The active fraction, precipitating between 30 and 35% saturation [EF-RAG(UET) WA], appeared to be homogeneous by immunodiffusion and sedimentation analysis. EF-RAG(UET) WA had an intrinsic viscosity of 750 cm(3)/g, a sedimentation constant of 6.06S, a diffusion constant of 5.25 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), and a partial molar volume of 0.712 cm(3) g(-1). From these data a weight average molecular weight of 9.76 x 10(5) and a viscosity average molecular weight of 9.88 x 10(5) were calculated. EF-RAG(UET)WA contained 46.7% C, 7.01% H, and 6.06% N. Titration of the nonreducing polymer gave a single inflection point (pK' = 3.05), corresponding to 1.5 mumol of carboxyl groups per mg. Direct estimation of O-ester and hexose content of the highly acidic polymer yielded 0.65 and 0.29 mumol/mg, respectively. Mild alkaline hydrolysis released fatty acids with an average molecular weight of about 231. Strong acid hydrolysis of EF-RAG(UET)WA yielded d-glucose (minor), d-galactosamine (major), and an unidentified amino uronic acid (major).	0
Title: Hydrogen-Bond Symmetrization Breakdown and Dehydrogenation Mechanism of FeO2H at High Pressure Abstract: The cycling of hydrogen plays an important role in the geochemical evolution of our planet. Under high-pressure conditions, asymmetric hydroxyl bonds tend to form a symmetric O-H-O configuration in which H is positioned at the center of two O atoms. The symmetrization of O-H bonds improves their thermal stability and as such, water-bearing minerals can be present deeper in the Earth's lower mantle. However, how exactly H is recycled from the deep mantle remains unclear. Here, we employ first-principles free-energy landscape sampling methods together with high pressure-high temperature experiments to reveal the dehydrogenation mechanism of a water-bearing mineral, FeO2H, at deep mantle conditions. Experimentally, we show that ∼50% H is released from symmetrically hydrogen-bonded ε-FeO2H upon transforming to a pyrite-type phase (Py-phase). By resolving the lowest-energy transition pathway from ε-FeO2H to the Py-phase, we demonstrate that half of the O-H bonds in the mineral rupture during the structural transition, leading toward the breakdown of symmetrized hydrogen bonds and eventual dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the stability of symmetric hydrogen bonds during structural transitions and provides a dehydrogenation mechanism for hydrous minerals existing in the deep mantle.	0
Title: Photobactin: a catechol siderophore produced by Photorhabdus luminescens, an entomopathogen mutually associated with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora NC1 nematodes Abstract: The nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora transmits a monoculture of Photorhabdus luminescens bacteria to insect hosts, where it requires the bacteria for efficient insect pathogenicity and as a substrate for growth and reproduction. Siderophore production was implicated as being involved in the symbiosis because an ngrA mutant inadequate for supporting nematode growth and reproduction was also deficient in producing siderophore activity and ngrA is homologous to a siderophore biosynthetic gene, entD. The role of the siderophore in the symbiosis with the nematode was determined by isolating and characterizing a mini-Tn5-induced mutant, NS414, producing no detectable siderophore activity. This mutant, being defective for growth in iron-depleted medium, was normal in supporting nematode growth and reproduction, in transmission by the dauer juvenile nematode, and in insect pathogenicity. The mini-Tn5 transposon was inserted into phbH; whose protein product is a putative peptidyl carrier protein homologous to the nonribosomal peptide synthetase VibF of Vibrio cholerae. Other putative siderophore biosynthetic and transport genes flanking phbH were characterized. The catecholate siderophore was purified, its structure was determined to be 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-oxazole-4-carboxylic acid [4-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoylamino)-butyl]-amide, and it was given the generic name photobactin. Antibiotic activity was detected with purified photobactin, indicating that the siderophore may contribute to antibiosis of the insect cadaver. These results eliminate the lack of siderophore activity as the cause for the inadequacy of the ngrA mutant in supporting nematode growth and reproduction.	1
Title: Modulation of the ligand-field anisotropy in a series of ferric low-spin cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 and Nitrosomonas europaea cytochrome c-552: a nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance study Abstract: Cytochromes of the c type with histidine-methionine (His-Met) heme axial ligation play important roles in electron-transfer reactions and in enzymes. In this work, two series of cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa c-551) and from the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea (Ne c-552) were engineered and overexpressed. In these proteins, point mutations were induced in a key residue (Asn64) near the Met axial ligand; these mutations have a considerable impact both on heme ligand-field strength and on the Met orientation and dynamics (fluxionality), as judged by low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Ne c-552 has a ferric low-spin (S = 1/2) EPR signal characterized by large g anisotropy with g(max) resonance at 3.34; a similar large g(max) value EPR signal is found in the mitochondrial complex III cytochrome c1. In Ne c-552, deletion of Asn64 (NeN64Delta) changes the heme ligand field from more axial to rhombic (small g anisotropy and g(max) at 3.13) and furthermore hinders the Met fluxionality present in the wild-type protein. In Pa c-551 (g(max) at 3.20), replacement of Asn64 with valine (PaN64V) induces a decrease in the axial strain (g(max) at 3.05) and changes the Met configuration. Another set of mutants prepared by insertion (ins) and/or deletion (Delta) of a valine residue adjacent to Asn64, resulting in modifications in the length of the axial Met-donating loop (NeV65Delta, NeG50N/V65Delta, PaN50G/V65ins), did not result in appreciable alterations of the originally weak (Ne c-552) or very weak (Pa c-551) axial field but had an impact on Met orientation, fluxionality, and relaxation dynamics. Comparison of the electronic fingerprints in the overexpressed proteins and their mutants reveals a linear relationship between axial strain and average paramagnetic heme methyl shifts, irrespective of Met orientation or dynamics. Thus, for these His-Met axially coordinated Fe(III), the large g(max) value EPR signal does not represent a special case as is observed for bis-His axially coordinated Fe(III) with the two His planes perpendicular to each other.	0
Title: Allele-Specific Inhibition of Histone Demethylases Abstract: Histone demethylases play a critical role in mammalian gene expression by removing methyl groups from lysine residues in degree- and site-specific manner. To specifically interrogate members and isoforms of this class of enzymes, we have developed demethylase variants with an expanded active site. The mutant enzymes are capable of performing lysine demethylation with wild-type proficiency, but are sensitive to inhibition by cofactor-competitive molecules embellished with a complementary steric "bump". The selected inhibitors show more than 20-fold selectivity over the wild-type demethylase, thus overcoming issues typical to pharmacological and genetic approaches. The mutant-inhibitor pairs are shown to act on a physiologically relevant full-length substrate. By engineering a conserved amino acid to achieve member-specific perturbation, this study provides a general approach for studying histone demethylases in diverse cellular processes.	0
Title: Strobilurin biosynthesis in Basidiomycete fungi Abstract: Strobilurins from fungi are the inspiration for the creation of the β-methoxyacrylate class of agricultural fungicides. However, molecular details of the biosynthesis of strobilurins have remained cryptic. Here we report the sequence of genomes of two fungi that produce strobilurins and show that each contains a biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes a highly reducing polyketide synthase with very unusual C-terminal hydrolase and methyltransferase domains. Expression of stpks1 in Aspergillus oryzae leads to the production of prestrobilurin A when the fermentation is supplemented with a benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) analogue. This enables the discovery of a previously unobserved route to benzoyl CoA. Reconstruction of the gene cluster in A. oryzae leads to the formation of prestrobilurin A, and addition of the gene str9 encoding an FAD-dependent oxygenase leads to the key oxidative rearrangement responsible for the creation of the β-methoxyacrylate toxophore. Finally, two methyltransferases are required to complete the synthesis.	1
Title: Degradation of the polyamine alkaloid aphelandrine by endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona Abstract: Members of the genus Aphelandra (Acanthaceae) produce rare macrocyclic polyamine alkaloids which consist of spermine acylated with two units of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoic acid. Endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and shoots of Aphelandra tetragona and tested for their ability to metabolize the main alkaloid aphelandrine, which accumulates exclusively in the roots of the plants. Several endophytes were able to metabolize aphelandrine but only root endophytes belonging to the Nectriaceae were good metabolizers. In addition, the endophytes were grown on an agar medium containing putrescine, spermidine, or spermine as the sole nitrogen source. All fungi were able to grow on putrescine, but only the good aphelandrine metabolizers grew well on spermidine or spermine. Acremonium sp. 15, one of the most active metabolizers, grew also on a medium containing aphelandrine as sole nitrogen source. A number of strains thought to be conspecific with Acremonium sp. 15 were also tested for their ability to metabolize aphelandrine. The ability of the endophytes to metabolize aphelandrine suggests an ecological adaptation of the symbionts to their host. The possibility of using the aphelandrine metabolism as a taxonomic character is briefly discussed.	0
Title: Role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 and Escherichia coli K12 Abstract: In this study, we investigated the role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 and Escherichia coli K12. A mini-Tn5 transposon mutant of E. cloacae SLD1a-1, designated as 4E6, was isolated that had lost the ability to reduce Se(VI) to Se(0). Genetic analysis of mutant strain 4E6 showed that the transposon was inserted within a menD gene among a menFDHBCE gene cluster that encodes for proteins required for menaquinone biosynthesis. A group of E. coli K12 strains with single mutations in the menF, menD, menC and menE genes were tested for loss of selenate reduction activity. The results showed that E. coli K12 carrying a deletion of either the menD, menC or menE gene was unable to reduce selenate. Complementation using wild-type sequences of the E. cloacae SLD1a-1 menFDHBCE sequence successfully restored the selenate reduction activity in mutant strain 4E6, and E. coli K12 menD and menE mutants. Selenate reduction activity in 4E6 was also restored by chemical complementation using the menaquinone precursor compound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nathphoic acid. The results of this work suggest that menaquinones are an important source of electrons for the selenate reductase, and are required for selenate reduction activity in E. cloacae SLD1a-1 and E. coli K12.	1
Title: Discovery, Biosynthesis, and Heterologous Production of Streptoseomycin, an Anti-Microaerophilic Bacteria Macrodilactone Abstract: Streptoseomycin (1), which is a rare macrodilactone with potent activities against microaerophilic bacteria, featuring a pentacyclic 5/14/10/6/6 ring system together with an ether bridge, was characterized by a combination of spectroscopic method and X-ray analysis from a marine Streptomyces seoulensis. Sequencing and characterization of a ∼76-kb biosynthetic gene cluster led to the proposition of the biosynthetic pathway of 1. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster using a BAC vector in Streptomyces chartreusis 1018 led to the successful production of 1.	1
Title: Butyrolactone synthesis via polar radical crossover cycloaddition reactions: diastereoselective syntheses of methylenolactocin and protolichesterinic acid Abstract: A direct catalytic synthesis of γ-butyrolactones from simple alkene and unsaturated acid starting materials is reported. The catalytic system consists of the Fukuzumi acridinium photooxidant and substoichiometric quantities of a redox-active cocatalyst. Oxidizable alkenes such as styrenes and trisubstituted aliphatic alkenes are cyclized with unsaturated acids via polar radical crossover cycloaddition (PRCC) reactions. This method has been applied to the diastereoselective total synthesis of methylenolactocin and protolichesterinic acid.	0
Title: Characterization of the gene cluster CYP264B1-geoA from Sorangium cellulosum So ce56: biosynthesis of (+)-eremophilene and its hydroxylation Abstract: Terpenoids can be found in almost all forms of life; however, the biosynthesis of bacterial terpenoids has not been intensively studied. This study reports the identification and functional characterization of the gene cluster CYP264B1-geoA from Sorangium cellulosum So ce56. Expression of the enzymes and synthesis of their products for NMR analysis and X-ray diffraction were carried out by employing an Escherichia coli whole-cell conversion system that provides the geoA substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate through simultaneous overexpression of the mevalonate pathway genes. The geoA product was identified as a novel sesquiterpene, and assigned NMR signals unambiguously proved that geoA is an (+)-eremophilene synthase. The very tight binding of (+)-eremophilene (∼0.40 μM), which is also available in S. cellulosum So ce56, and its oxidation by CYP264B1 suggest that the CYP264B1-geoA gene cluster is required for the biosynthesis of (+)-eremophilene derivatives.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of antibiotic prodiginines in the marine bacterium Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 Abstract: Aims:                       Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 produces red pigments, showing antibacterial and algicidal activities. The main red-coloured metabolite of the pigments was identified as antibiotic prodigiosin. With the expectation that the red pigments are a mixture of a series of close relatives, the aim of the present study is to detect new antibiotic prodigiosin analogues and to analyse the biosynthetic pattern for prodiginines in KCTC 2396.                  Methods and results:                       Except prodigiosin, the other constituents in the red pigments were confirmed as well-known dipyrrolyldipyrromethene prodigiosin, norprodigiosin, and undecylprodiginine. Additionally, four new prodigiosin analogues, each of which was distinguished from prodigiosin (C(5)), according to differences in alkyl chain length (C(3)-C(7)), were detected in small quantities by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry spectroscopy. Owing to the presence of a cytotoxic methoxy group, it is expected that all the new prodigiosin analogues are bioactive.                  Conclusions:                       Four characterized prodiginines, including prodigiosin and four new prodigiosin analogues are produced in different ratio in KCTC 2396. All of the prodiginines possess a common linear tripyrrolyl structure and a cytotoxic methoxy group.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       This study shows for the first time that KCTC 2396 is able to produce antibiotic prodigiosin, undecylprodiginine and new prodigiosin analogues in a mixture of pigments. It is also shown that KCTC 2396 possesses a novel system for the simultaneous production of multiple prodiginines in a single micro-organism.	1
Title: Biologics through chemistry: total synthesis of a proposed dual-acting vaccine targeting ovarian cancer by orchestration of oligosaccharide and polypeptide domains Abstract: Carbohydrate and peptide-based antitumor vaccine constructs featuring clusters of both tumor associated carbohydrate antigens and mucin-like peptide epitopes have been designed, synthesized, and studied. The mucin-based epitopes are included to act, potentially, as T-cell epitopes in order to provoke a strong immune response. Hopefully the vaccine will simulate cell surface architecture, thereby provoking levels of immunity against cancer cell types displaying such characteristics. With this central idea in mind, we designed a new vaccine type against ovarian cancer. Following advances in glycohistology, our design is based on clusters of Gb(3) antigen and also incorporates a MUC5AC peptide epitope. The vaccine is among the most complex targeted constructs to be assembled by chemical synthesis to date. The strategy for the synthesis employed a Gb(3)-MUC5AC thioester cassette as a key building block. Syntheses of both nonconjugate and KLH-conjugated vaccines constructs have been accomplished.	0
Title: Genome analysis of phage JS98 defines a fourth major subgroup of T4-like phages in Escherichia coli Abstract: Numerous T4-like Escherichia coli phages were isolated from human stool and environmental wastewater samples in Bangladesh and Switzerland. The sequences of the major head gene (g23) revealed that these coliphages could be placed into four subgroups, represented by the phages T4, RB69, RB49, and JS98. Thus, JS98 defines a new major subgroup of E. coli T4-like phages. We conducted an analysis of the 169-kb JS98 genome sequence. Overall, 198 of the 266 JS98 open reading frames (ORFs) shared amino acid sequence identity with the reference T4 phage, 41 shared identity with other T4-like phages, and 27 ORFs lacked any database matches. Genes on the plus strand encoded virion proteins, which showed moderate to high sequence identity with T4 proteins. The right genome half of JS98 showed a higher degree of sequence conservation with T4 and RB69, even for the nonstructural genes, than did the left genome half, containing exclusively nonstructural genes. Most of the JS98-specific genes were found in the left genome half. Two came as a hypervariability cluster, but most represented isolated genes, suggesting that they were acquired separately in multiple acquisition events. No evidence for DNA exchange between JS98 phage and the E. coli host genome or coliphages other than T4 was observed. No undesired genes which could compromise its medical use were detected in the JS98 genome sequence.	0
Title: The marine bivalve molluscs pathogen Vibrio neptunius produces the siderophore amphibactin, which is widespread in molluscs microbiota Abstract: Amphiphilic siderophores, including amphibactins, are the most abundant siderophores in oceans. Genes putatively encoding the amphibactin system were proposed in some bacteria and homologues of these genes are particularly abundant in multiple bacterial lineages inhabitant of low-iron seawater. However, since no defective mutant strains in any of these genes were studied to date, their role in amphibactin synthesis or uptake was not demonstrated. In this work, an in silico analysis of the genome of the mollusc pathogen Vibrio neptunius leads us to identify a gene cluster (denoted absABDEF) that is predicted to encode an amphibactin-like siderophore and several mutant strains unable to synthesize or use siderophores were constructed. The results showed that genes absABDEF are required for amphibactin synthesis. A comparative chemical analysis of V. neptunius wild type and biosynthesis mutants allowed us to identify a mixture of nine amphibactin forms produced by this bacterium. In addition, the gene abtA is predicted to encode the ferri-amphibactin outer membrane transporter. The prevalence of the amphibactin system in bivalve hemolymph microbiota was also studied. We found that the amphibactin system is widespread in hemolymph microbiota including both commensal and pathogenic bacterial species. Thus, its contribution to bacterial fitness must be more related to environmental persistence than to pathogenicity.	1
Title: A carrier-assisted ChIP-seq method for estrogen receptor-chromatin interactions from breast cancer core needle biopsy samples Abstract: Background:                       The Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) is the key transcriptional regulator in luminal breast cancer and is therefore the main target for adjuvant treatment of this subtype. Luminal gene signatures are dictated by the transcriptional capacities of ERα, which are a direct consequence of the receptors binding preference at specific sites on the chromatin. The identification of ERα binding signatures on a genome-wide level has greatly enhanced our understanding of Estrogen Receptor biology in cell lines and tumours, but the technique has its limitations with respect to its applicability in limited amounts of tumour tissue.                  Results:                       Here, we present a refinement of the ChIP-seq procedures to enable transcription factor mapping on limited amounts of tissue culture cells as well as from a limited amount of tumor tissue derived from core needle biopsies. Our approach uses a carrier that can be removed prior to DNA amplification and sequencing.                  Conclusion:                       We illustrate the applicability of this refined technology by mapping the ERα genome-wide chromatin binding landscape in core needle biopsy material from primary breast tumours. With this, our refined technology permits for a high-resolution transcription factor mapping even from clinical samples.	0
Title: Formation in Rhizobium and Agrobacterium spp. of a 235-kilodalton protein intermediate in beta-D(1-2) glucan synthesis Abstract: beta-D(1-2) Glucan was synthesized by Agrobacterium and Rhizobium spp. in vitro with enzymes from the internal membranes upon the addition of UDF glucose and Mg2+ or Mn2+. An intermediate containing protein and beta-D(1-2) glucan was formed during the reaction. It could be precipitated with trichloroacetic acid or separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. After detection with Coomassie blue or a radioactive substrate, the intermediate appeared as a 235-kilodalton protein. The radioactivity could be chased with a nonradioactive substrate. All strains that formed beta-D(1-2) glucan in vitro formed the 235-kilodalton protein, whereas avirulent, beta-D(1-2) glucan-negative mutants did not synthesize it. Transposon insertions in the chvB locus of strains ME2 and ME116 did not alter the virulence of the strains. These strains were able to form beta-D(1-2) glucan in vitro and synthesize the 235-kilodalton protein.	0
Title: Discovery of the Cyclic Lipopeptide Gacamide A by Genome Mining and Repair of the Defective GacA Regulator in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 Abstract: Genome mining of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 showed that the strain possesses a silent NRPS-based biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a new lipopeptide; its activation required the repair of the global regulator system. In this paper, we describe the genomics-driven discovery and characterization of the associated secondary metabolite gacamide A, a lipodepsipeptide that forms a new family of Pseudomonas lipopeptides. The compound has a moderate, narrow-spectrum antibiotic activity and facilitates bacterial surface motility.	1
Title: Complete putative metal finger and leucine zipper structures of CRE-BP1 are required for the E1A-induced trans-activation Abstract: The adenovirus E1A protein stimulates transcription of various genes. Recent experiments using a fusion protein have shown that E1A can function through a specific CRE (cyclic AMP response element)-binding protein, CRE-BP1 (also designated ATF-2), which stimulates the transcription from a CRE-containing promoter by homodimer formation or heterodimer formation with c-Jun. In this paper, the functional domains required for mediation of the E1A-induced trans-activation were analyzed using deletion and point mutants of CRE-BP1. The mutation in the putative metal finger structure or leucine zipper structure completely abolished the ability of CRE-BP1 to mediate the E1A-induced trans-activation. Furthermore, overexpression of CRE-BP1 or c-Jun interfered with the E1A-induced trans-activation. These results suggest that the complete putative metal finger structure in the N-terminal region of CRE-BP1 plays an important role for the E1A-induced trans-activation, and the heterodimer of CRE-BP1 with the unidentified protein participates in the interaction with E1A.	0
Title: Mutational analysis of a phenazine biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces anulatus 9663 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for endophenazines, i.e., prenylated phenazines from Streptomyces anulatus 9663, was heterologously expressed in several engineered host strains derived from Streptomyces coelicolor M145. The highest production levels were obtained in strain M512. Mutations in the rpoB and rpsL genes of the host, which result in increased production of other secondary metabolites, had no beneficial effect on the production of phenazines. The heterologous expression strains produced, besides the known phenazine compounds, a new prenylated phenazine, termed endophenazine E. The structure of endophenazine E was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. It represented a conjugate of endophenazine A (9-dimethylallylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid) and L-glutamine (L-Gln), with the carboxyl group of endophenazine A forming an amide bond to the α-amino group of L-Gln. Gene inactivation experiments in the gene cluster proved that ppzM codes for a phenazine N-methyltransferase. The gene ppzV apparently represents a new type of TetR-family regulator, specifically controlling the prenylation in endophenazine biosynthesis. The gene ppzY codes for a LysR-type regulator and most likely controls the biosynthesis of the phenazine core. A further putative transcriptional regulator is located in the vicinity of the cluster, but was found not to be required for phenazine or endophenazine formation. This is the first investigation of the regulatory genes of phenazine biosynthesis in Streptomyces.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of ilamycins featuring unusual building blocks and engineered production of enhanced anti-tuberculosis agents Abstract: Tuberculosis remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, novel anti-tuberculosis agents are urgently needed due to severe drug resistance and the co-epidemic of tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus. Here, we show the isolation of six anti-mycobacterial ilamycin congeners (1-6) bearing rare L-3-nitro-tyrosine and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic acid structural units from the deep sea-derived Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16. The biosynthesis of the rare L-3-nitrotyrosine and L-2-amino-4-hexenoic acid units as well as three pre-tailoring and two post-tailoring steps are probed in the ilamycin biosynthetic machinery through a series of gene inactivation, precursor chemical complementation, isotope-labeled precursor feeding experiments, as well as structural elucidation of three intermediates (6-8) from the respective mutants. Most impressively, ilamycins E1/E2, which are produced in high titers by a genetically engineered mutant strain, show very potent anti-tuberculosis activity with an minimum inhibitory concentration value ≈9.8 nM to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv constituting extremely potent and exciting anti-tuberculosis drug leads.Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, novel anti-TB agents are urgently needed due to severe drug resistance and the co-epidemic of TB/HIV. Here, the authors show that anti-mycobacterial ilamycin congeners bearing unusual structural units possess extremely potent anti-tuberculosis activities.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of co-transcribed genes from Streptomyces tendae Tü901 involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidyl moiety and assembly of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin Abstract: Six genes (nikP1, nikP2, nikS, nikT, nikU, and nikV) from Streptomyces tendae Tu901 were identified by analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the nikkomycin gene cluster. These genes, together with the previously described nikQ and nikR, span 9.39 kb and are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA in a growth-phase-dependent manner. The nikP1 gene encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthase consisting of an adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, and an N-terminal 70-residue segment of unknown function. The amino acid sequence encoded by the nikP2 gene displays similarity to the sequences of thioesterases, and the nikS product belongs to a superfamily of proteins characterized by a specific ATP-binding fold. The N-terminal 70 amino acids of the predicted nikT gene product show significant sequence similarity to acyl carrier proteins, and the C-terminal 330 amino acids to aminotransferases. The sequences of the deduced proteins NikU and NikV exhibit similarity to components S and E, respectively, of glutamate mutase from Clostridium. Disruption of the nikP1, nikS, nikT, or nikV gene by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette abolished formation of nikkomycins I, J, X, and Z, all of which contain hydroxypyridylhomothreonine as the peptidyl moiety. The nikP1 mutants, and the nikS and nikT mutants accumulated the nucleoside moieties nikkomycin Cz, and nikkomycins Cx and Cz, respectively. The nikV mutants formed nikkomycins Ox and Oz, which contain 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-(3'-hydroxy-6'-pyridyl) butanoic acid as the peptidyl moiety. The nikP2 mutants synthesized nikkomycins I, J, X, and Z, but amounts of nikkomycins I and X, which contain formylimidazolone as the base, were lower. Feeding formylimidazolone to nikP2 mutants restored the ability to form nikkomycins I and X. Our results indicate that nikU and nikV are required for the synthesis of hydroxypyridylhomothreonine, the genes nikP1, nikP2 and nikS are required for the assembly of nikkomycins, and nikT is required for both pathways. The putative activities of each of their products are discussed.	1
Title: Directed evolution of potent neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 using CDR-swapping mutagenesis Abstract: There is widespread interest in facile methods for generating potent neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and other affinity proteins against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses to address current and future pandemics. While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties. We expect that our methods will improve in vitro nanobody discovery and accelerate the generation of potent neutralizing nanobodies against diverse coronaviruses.	0
Title: Movement of the retinylidene Schiff base counterion in rhodopsin by one helix turn reverses the pH dependence of the metarhodopsin I to metarhodopsin II transition Abstract: The environment of the retinylidene Schiff base in bovine rhodopsin has been studied by movement of its carboxylic acid counterion from position 113 to position 117 by site-specific mutagenesis. Replacement of the counterion at position 113 by a neutral amino acid residue has been shown to produce a lowering of the Schiff base acidity constant (pKa) from > 8.5 to about 6. The aim of the present work was to change the position of the counterion without causing a significant effect on the Schiff base pKa. A triple replacement mutant (Glu113-->Ala/Ala117-->Glu/Glu122-->Gln) was designed to move the position of the counterion by one helix turn in the third putative transmembrane helix (helix C). The mutant bound 11-cis-retinal to form a chromophore with a visible absorbance maximum (lambda max) of 490 nm which was independent of pH in the range of about 5-8.5. Upon illumination under conditions in which rhodopsin was converted to the active metarhodopsin II (MII) photoproduct, the mutant was converted to a metarhodopsin I (MI)-like species (lambda max = 475 nm). Furthermore, the effect of pH on the photobleaching behavior of the mutant was the reverse of that reported for rhodopsin. In the mutant, acidic pH favored the formation of the MI-like photoproduct, and basic pH favored the formation of an MII-like photoproduct (lambda max = 380 nm). The MII-like photoproduct of the mutant pigment was able to activate the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, transducin. We conclude that the Schiff base counterion in rhodopsin can be repositioned to form a pigment with an apparently unperturbed Schiff base pKa. Furthermore, a specific amino acid residue that acts as a Schiff base proton acceptor is not strictly required for photoconversion of rhodopsin to its active MII form.	0
Title: Acyl Histidines: New N-Acyl Amides from Legionella pneumophila Abstract: Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a Gram-negative gammaproteobacterial pathogen that infects and intracellularly replicates in human macrophages and a variety of protozoa. L. pneumophila encodes an orphan biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that contains isocyanide-associated biosynthetic genes and is upregulated during infection. Because isocyanide-functionalized metabolites are known to harbor invertebrate innate immunosuppressive activities in bacterial pathogen-insect interactions, we used pathway-targeted molecular networking and tetrazine-based chemoseletive ligation chemistry to characterize the metabolites from the orphan pathway in L. pneumophila. We also assessed their intracellular growth contributions in an amoeba and in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Unexpectedly, two distinct groups of aromatic amino acid-derived metabolites were identified from the pathway, including a known tyrosine-derived isocyanide and a family of new N-acyl-l-histidine metabolites.	0
Title: Visualizing the stoichiometry of industrial-style Co-Mo-S catalysts with single-atom sensitivity Abstract: The functional properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) may be promoted by the inclusion of other elements. Here, we studied the local stoichiometry of single cobalt promoter atoms in an industrial-style MoS2-based hydrotreating catalyst. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy show that the Co atoms occupy sites at the (-100) S edge terminations of the graphite-supported MoS2 nanocrystals in the catalyst. Specifically, each Co atom has four neighboring S atoms that are arranged in a reconstructed geometry, which reflects an equilibrium state. The structure agrees with complementary studies of catalysts that were prepared under vastly different conditions and on other supports. In contrast, a small amount of residual Fe in the graphite is found to compete for the S edge sites, so that promotion by Co is strongly sensitive to the purity of the raw materials. The present single-atom-sensitive analytical method therefore offers a guide for advancing preparative methods for promoted TMD nanomaterials.	0
Title: A combined experimental and theoretical study of the thermal cycloaddition of aryl azides with activated alkenes Abstract: Reactions were performed from aryl azides on the one hand, and activated alkenes coming from β-dicarbonyl compounds or malonodinitrile on the other hand, either with recourse to conventional heating or to microwave activation, to afford 1-aryl-1H-1,2,3-triazoles. The mechanism and the regioselectivity of the reactions involving β-dicarbonyl compounds have been theoretically studied using DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* level: they are domino processes comprising a tautomeric equilibrium of the β-dicarbonyl compounds with their enol forms, a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the enol forms with the aryl azides (high activation energy), and a dehydration process (lower activation energy). The effect of non-conventional activation methods on the degradation of 1,2,3-triazolines was next studied experimentally. Finally, some of the 1,2,3-triazoles such synthesized were evaluated for their bactericidal and cytotoxic activities.	0
Title: Binding of antibiotics to bovine and ovine serum Abstract: The degree of binding of 37 antibiotics to bovine and ovine serum, after treatment at therapeutic doses, was determined by equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration methods. In general, binding values obtained by the two methods were comparable. The extent of binding varied from 0% for cephaloridine and kanamycin to >95% for novobiocin and fusidic acid. Of the 37 drugs studied, one-fourth were less than 25% bound, one-fourth were more than 75% bound, and the percentage binding of about half of the antibiotics ranged from 25 to 75%. Animal to animal variations in the extent of binding of a particular antibiotic were very small. The capacity of bovine or ovine serum to bind antibiotics was, with a few exceptions, similar to the reported capacity of human serum. At drug concentration ranges usually achieved during therapy, variations in drug levels in serum did not influence the degree of binding except with cephalexin, lincomycin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol. With these antibiotics, the extent of binding increased two- to sevenfold with the decrease in drug concentration in serum.	0
Title: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Title: Telomerase: structure, functions, and activity regulation Abstract: Telomerase is the enzyme responsible for maintenance of the length of telomeres by addition of guanine-rich repetitive sequences. Telomerase activity is exhibited in gametes and stem and tumor cells. In human somatic cells proliferation potential is strictly limited and senescence follows approximately 50-70 cell divisions. In most tumor cells, on the contrary, replication potential is unlimited. The key role in this process of the system of the telomere length maintenance with involvement of telomerase is still poorly studied. No doubt, DNA polymerase is not capable to completely copy DNA at the very ends of chromosomes; therefore, approximately 50 nucleotides are lost during each cell cycle, which results in gradual telomere length shortening. Critically short telomeres cause senescence, following crisis, and cell death. However, in tumor cells the system of telomere length maintenance is activated. Besides catalytic telomere elongation, independent telomerase functions can be also involved in cell cycle regulation. Inhibition of the telomerase catalytic function and resulting cessation of telomere length maintenance will help in restriction of tumor cell replication potential. On the other hand, formation of temporarily active enzyme via its intracellular activation or due to stimulation of expression of telomerase components will result in telomerase activation and telomere elongation that can be used for correction of degenerative changes. Data on telomerase structure and function are summarized in this review, and they are compared for evolutionarily remote organisms. Problems of telomerase activity measurement and modulation by enzyme inhibitors or activators are considered as well.	0
Title: Identification of a DNA element in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 (thi3) promoter involved in thiamine-regulated gene expression Abstract: To define DNA elements involved in thiamine-regulated transcription of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene nmt1 (thi3), we analyzed several nmt1 promoter constructs. We detected a DNA element which is required for promoter activation in the absence of thiamine. It is located 54 to 62 bp upstream of the TATA box and matches the consensus sequence of the binding site for the mammalian transcription factor C/EBP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein). We show that the element specifically binds proteins.	0
Title: 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens Abstract: The microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. Earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a survey of cecal bacteria was done by retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. The ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in TTGE gels. A total of 1,656 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in the GenBank. The comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. Overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (Clostridium leptum, Sporomusa sp., Clostridium coccoides, and enterics). Sequences of members of the Bacteroides group, the Bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of Pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. Sequences related to those from the Escherichia sp. subgroup and from Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited in the GenBank. Sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. TTGE and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.	0
Title: Nonlinear shear viscosity and long time tails Abstract: A theoretical connection between nonlinear shear viscosity and the long time tail of the equilibrium stress-stress correlation function is pointed out. The connection is a consequence of the Goddard-Miller rheological equation of state which takes into account the angular rotation of a fluid in steady uniform shear.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of oxygenated brasilane terpene glycosides involves a promiscuous N-acetylglucosamine transferase Abstract: Investigation of the metabolome of the ascomycete Annulohypoxylon truncatum led to the identification of novel oxygenated brasilane glycosides and the revision of the stereochemistry of the brasilane A octahydro-1H-indene core scaffold to trans. The bra biosynthetic gene cluster containing five genes (braA-braE) was identified and verified by heterologous expression experiments in Aspergillus oryzae demonstrating that BraC is a multifunctional P450 monooxygenase. In vitro studies of BraB revealed it to be a very rare fungal UDP-GlcNAc dependent N-acetylglucosamine transferase. UDP-glucose is also accepted as a donor, and a broad acceptor substrate tolerance for various primary and secondary alcohols was observed.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of the avirulence gene ACE1 from the fungal rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: The ACE1 and RAP1 genes from the avirulence signalling gene cluster of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae were expressed in Aspergillus oryzae and M. oryzae itself. Expression of ACE1 alone produced a polyenyl pyrone (magnaporthepyrone), which is regioselectively epoxidised and hydrolysed to give different diols, 6 and 7, in the two host organisms. Analysis of the three introns present in ACE1 determined that A. oryzae does not process intron 2 correctly, while M. oryzae processes all introns correctly in both appressoria and mycelia. Co-expression of ACE1 and RAP1 in A. oryzae produced an amide 8 which is similar to the PKS-NRPS derived backbone of the cytochalasans. Biological testing on rice leaves showed that neither the diols 6 and 7, nor amide 8 was responsible for the observed ACE1 mediated avirulence, however, gene cluster analysis suggests that the true avirulence signalling compound may be a tyrosine-derived cytochalasan compound.	1
Title: Purification of two Bacillus subtilis proteins which cross-react with antibodies directed against eukaryotic protein kinase C, the His HPr kinase and trigger factor Abstract: As in eukaryotes, phosphorylation of Ser residues in proteins appears to be common phenomenon in bacteria. Surprisingly, however, very few Ser/Thr protein kinases have been identified and in this study antibodies directed against mammalian protein kinase C (PKC) have been used in attempts to isolate conserved Ser/Thr protein kinases. Using the mAb M7 against rat brain PKC, a single 70 kDa band was identified in total cell extracts of Bacillus subtilis by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE, whilst using polyclonal antibody alpha-PKC1p against Saccharomyces cerevisiae PKC a single 67 kDa band was identified by the same procedure. The two proteins were purified independently on the basis of antibody recognition employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as a final step, which allowed subsequent microsequencing. The 70 kDa band was thus identified as the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent His HPr kinase, Enzyme 1 of the phosphotransferase system. This identity was confirmed using a mutant deleted for ptsl, encoding Enzyme 1. The 67 kDa protein was identified as a previously unknown B. subtilis 'trigger factor', homologous to an Escherichia coli protein-folding enzyme, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase implicated in cell division.	0
Title: Effect of isotopically sensitive branching on product distribution for pentalenene synthase: support for a mechanism predicted by quantum chemistry Abstract: Mechanistic proposals for the carbocation cascade reaction leading to the tricyclic sesquiterpene pentalenene are assessed in light of the results of isotopically sensitive branching experiments with the H309A mutant of pentalenene synthase. These experimental results support a mechanism for pentalenene formation involving a 7-protoilludyl cation whose intermediacy was first predicted using quantum-chemical calculations.	0
Title: A solute-binding protein for iron transport in Streptococcus iniae Abstract: Background:                       Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) is a major pathogen that causes considerable morbidity and mortality in cultured fish worldwide. The pathogen's ability to adapt to the host affects the extent of infection, hence understanding the mechanisms by which S. iniae overcomes physiological stresses during infection will help to identify potential virulence determinants of streptococcal infection. Grow S. iniae under iron-restricted conditions is one approach for identifying host-specific protein expression. Iron plays an important role in many biological processes but it has low solubility under physiological condition. Many microorganisms have been shown to be able to circumvent this nutritional limitation by forming direct contacts with iron-containing proteins through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The ABC transporter superfamilies constitute many different systems that are widespread among living organisms with different functions, such as ligands translocation, mRNA translation, and DNA repair.                  Results:                       An ABC transporter system, named as mtsABC (metal transport system) was cloned from S. iniae HD-1, and was found to be involved in heme utilization. mtsABC is cotranscribed by three downstream genes, i.e., mtsA, mtsB, and mtsC. In this study, we cloned the first gene of the mtsABC transporter system (mtsA), and purified the corresponding recombinant protein MtsA. The analysis indicated that MtsA is a putative lipoprotein which binds to heme that can serve as an iron source for the microorganism, and is expressed in vivo during Kunming mice infection by S. iniae HD-1.                  Conclusions:                       This is believed to be the first report on the cloning the ABC transporter lipoprotein from S. iniae genomic DNA. Together, our data suggested that MtsA is associated with heme, and is expressed in vivo during Kunming mice infection by S. iniae HD-1 which indicated that it can be a potential candidate for S. iniae subunit vaccine.	0
Title: Colonization and internalization of Salmonella enterica in tomato plants Abstract: The consumption of fresh tomatoes has been linked to numerous food-borne outbreaks involving various serovars of Salmonella enterica. Recent advances in our understanding of plant-microbe interactions have shown that human enteric pathogenic bacteria, including S. enterica, are adapted to survive in the plant environment. In this study, tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom) grown in sandy loam soil from Virginia's eastern shore (VES) were inoculated with S. enterica serovars to evaluate plausible internalization routes and to determine if there is any niche fitness for certain serovars. Both infested soil and contaminated blossoms can lead to low internal levels of fruit contamination with Salmonella. Salmonella serovars demonstrated a great ability to survive in environments under tomato cultivation, not only in soil but also on different parts of the tomato plant. Of the five serovars investigated, Salmonella enterica serovars Newport and Javiana were dominant in sandy loam soil, while Salmonella enterica serovars Montevideo and Newport were more prevalent on leaves and blossoms. It was also observed that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium had a poor rate of survival in all the plant parts examined here, suggesting that postharvest contamination routes are more likely in S. Typhimurium contamination of tomato fruit. Conversely, S. Newport was the most prevalent serovar recovered in both the tomato rhizosphere and phyllosphere. Plants that were recently transplanted (within 3 days) had an increase in observable internalized bacteria, suggesting that plants were more susceptible to internalization right after transplant. These findings suggest that the particular Salmonella serovar and the growth stage of the plant were important factors for internalization through the root system.	0
Title: A metabolic gene cluster in Lotus japonicus discloses novel enzyme functions and products in triterpene biosynthesis Abstract: Genes for triterpene biosynthetic pathways exist as metabolic gene clusters in oat and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We characterized the presence of an analogous gene cluster in the model legume Lotus japonicus. In the genomic regions flanking the oxidosqualene cyclase AMY2 gene, genes for two different classes of cytochrome P450 and a gene predicted to encode a reductase were identified. Functional characterization of the cluster genes was pursued by heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The gene expression pattern was studied under different developmental and environmental conditions. The physiological role of the gene cluster in nodulation and plant development was studied in knockdown experiments. A novel triterpene structure, dihydrolupeol, was produced by AMY2. A new plant cytochrome P450, CYP71D353, which catalyses the formation of 20-hydroxybetulinic acid in a sequential three-step oxidation of 20-hydroxylupeol was characterized. The genes within the cluster are highly co-expressed during root and nodule development, in hormone-treated plants and under various environmental stresses. A transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that appears to be involved in the regulation of the cluster genes was also revealed. A tightly co-regulated cluster of functionally related genes is involved in legume triterpene biosynthesis, with a possible role in plant development.	1
Title: Coordinating bioorthogonal reactions with two tumor-microenvironment-responsive nanovehicles for spatiotemporally controlled prodrug activation Abstract: Precise activation of prodrugs in tumor tissues is critical to ensuring specific antitumor efficacy, meanwhile reducing the serious adverse effects. Here, a spatiotemporally controlled prodrug activation strategy was provided by integrating the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction with two tumor-microenvironment-responsive nanovehicles. The prodrug (Dox-TCO) and [4-(6-methyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-yl)phenyl]methanamine (Tz) were separately camouflaged into low pH and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) sensitive micellar nanoparticles. After systemic administration, only in the tumor tissues could both the nanovehicles dissociate via responding to two special tumor microenvironments, with Dox-TCO and Tz released and then immediately triggering the prodrug activation through the IEDDA reaction. The hierarchically regulated and locally confined Dox liberation led to dramatically decreased side-effects that were much lower than those of the clinical Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposomal Injection (Doxil), while the antitumor therapeutic effect was potent.	0
Title: The gut microbiota in young and middle-aged rats showed different responses to chicken protein in their diet Abstract: Background:                       Meat protein in the diet has been shown to be beneficial for the growth of Lactobacillus in the caecum of growing rats; however, it is unknown whether gut microbiota in middle-aged animals have the same responses to meat protein diets. This study compared the composition of the gut microbiota between young and middle-aged rats after being fed 17.7% chicken protein diet for 14 days.                  Methods:                       Feces were collected on day 0 and day 14 from young rats (4 weeks old) and middle-aged rats (64 weeks old) fed with 17.7% chicken protein diets. The composition of the gut bacteria was analyzed by sequencing the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.                  Results:                       The results showed that the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly different between young and middle-aged rats on both day 0 and day 14. The percentage of Firmicutes decreased for middle-aged rats (72.1% versus 58.1% for day 0 and day 14, respectively) but increased for young rats (41.5 versus 57.7% for day 0 and day 14, respectively). The percentage of Bacteroidetes increased to 31.2% (20.5% on day 0) for middle-aged rats and decreased to 29.6% (41.3% on day 0) for young rats. The relative abundance of the beneficial genus Lactobacillus increased in response to the intake of chicken protein in the young group, while it had the opposite effect in the middle-aged group.                  Conclusion:                       The results of our study demonstrated that 17.7% chicken protein diet promoted the beneficial genus Lactobacillus in young rats, but the opposite effect were found in the middle-aged group. To evaluate the linkage between diet and host health, age effect should be considered in the future studies.	0
Title: Functional and structural impact of target uridine substitutions on the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particle pseudouridine synthase Abstract: Box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein protein particles catalyze the majority of pseudouridylation in functional RNA. Different from stand alone pseudouridine synthases, the RNP pseudouridine synthase comprises multiple protein subunits and an RNA subunit. Previous studies showed that each subunit, regardless its location, is sensitive to the step of subunit placement at the catalytic center and potentially to the reaction status of the substrate. Here we describe the impact of chemical substitutions of target uridine on enzyme activity and structure. We found that 3-methyluridine in place of uridine inhibited its isomerization while 2'-deoxyuridine or 4-thiouridine did not. Significantly, crystal structures of an archaeal box H/ACA RNP bound with the nonreactive and the two postreactive substrate analogues showed only subtle structural changes throughout the assembly except for a conserved tyrosine and a substrate anchoring loop of Cbf5. Our results suggest a potential role of these elements and the subunit that contacts them in substrate binding and product release.	0
Title: Genome sequences of two novel phages infecting marine roseobacters Abstract: Two bacteriophages, DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1, which infect marine roseobacters Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 and Sulfitobacter sp. EE-36, respectively, were isolated from Baltimore Inner Harbor water. These two roseophages resemble bacteriophage N4, a large, short-tailed phage infecting Escherichia coli K12, in terms of their morphology and genomic structure. The full genome sequences of DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1 reveal that their genome sizes are 74.6 and 73.3 kb, respectively, and they both contain a highly conserved N4-like DNA replication and transcription system. Both roseophages contain a large virion-encapsidated RNA polymerase gene (> 10 kb), which was first discovered in N4. DSS3Phi2 and EE36Phi1 also possess several genes (i.e. ribonucleotide reductase and thioredoxin) that are most similar to the genes in roseobacters. Overall, the two roseophages are highly closely related, and share 80-94% nucleotide sequence identity over 85% of their ORFs. This is the first report of N4-like phages infecting marine bacteria and the second report of N4-like phage since the discovery of phage N4 40 years ago. The finding of these two N4-like roseophages will allow us to further explore the specific phage-host interaction and evolution for this unique group of bacteriophages.	0
Title: Single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: dynamic change of gene expression during microsporogenesis Abstract: A sensitive and reliable single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed that requires little sample material and only a short sampling time and ensures template preservation. We propose that the assay provides a useful tool to study not only cell-cycle related events in developing pollen but also the molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility and mutants impaired in pollen development.	0
Title: Fungal polyketide synthase product chain-length control by partnering thiohydrolase Abstract: Fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases (HRPKSs) are an enigmatic group of multidomain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of structurally diverse compounds. This variety stems from their intrinsic programming rules, which permutate the use of tailoring domains and determine the overall number of iterative cycles. From genome sequencing and mining of the producing strain Eupenicillium brefeldianum ATCC 58665, we identified an HRPKS involved in the biosynthesis of an important protein transport-inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA), followed by reconstitution of its activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Bref-PKS demonstrated an NADPH-dependent reductive tailoring specificity that led to the synthesis of four different octaketide products with varying degrees of reduction. Furthermore, contrary to what is expected from the structure of BFA, Bref-PKS is found to be a nonaketide synthase in the absence of an associated thiohydrolase Bref-TH. Such chain-length control by the partner thiohydrolase was found to be present in other HRPKS systems and highlights the importance of including tailoring enzyme activities in predicting fungal HRPKS functions and their products.	1
Title: Biosynthetic code for divergolide assembly in a bacterial mangrove endophyte Abstract: Divergolides are structurally diverse ansamycins produced by a bacterial endophyte (Streptomyces sp.) of the mangrove tree Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. By genomic analyses a gene locus coding for the divergolide pathway was detected. The div gene cluster encodes genes for the biosynthesis of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoate and the rare extender units ethylmalonyl-CoA and isobutylmalonyl-CoA, polyketide assembly by a modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS), and enzymes involved in tailoring reactions, such as a Baeyer-Villiger oxygenase. A detailed PKS domain analysis confirmed the stereochemical integrity of the divergolides and provided valuable new insights into the formation of the diverse aromatic chromophores. The bioinformatic analyses and the isolation and full structural elucidation of four new divergolide congeners led to a revised biosynthetic model that illustrates the formation of four different types of ansamycin chromophores from a single polyketide precursor.	1
Title: Variations in protein-flavin hydrogen bonding in a light, oxygen, voltage domain produce non-Arrhenius kinetics of adduct decay Abstract: Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains utilize a conserved blue light-dependent mechanism to control a diverse array of effector domains in biological and engineered proteins. Variations in the kinetics and efficiency of LOV photochemistry fine-tune various aspects of the photic response. Characterization of the kinetics of a key aspect of this photochemical mechanism in EL222, a blue light responsive DNA binding protein from Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, reveals unique non-Arrhenius behavior in the rate of dark-state cleavage of the photochemically generated adduct. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis studies establish that this effect stems from a Gln to Ala mutation unique to EL222 and homologous proteins from marine bacteria. Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses reveal that hydrogen bonding interactions between the FMN N1, O2, and ribityl hydroxyls and the surrounding protein regulate photocycle kinetics and stabilize the LOV active site from temperature-induced alteration in local structure. Substitution of residues interacting with the N1-O2 locus modulates adduct stability, structural flexibility, and sequestration of the active site from bulk solvent without perturbation of light-activated DNA binding. Together, these variants link non-Arrhenius behavior to specific alteration of an H-bonding network, while affording tunability of photocycle kinetics.	0
Title: The sodium/galactose symporter crystal structure is a dynamic, not so occluded state Abstract: The recent elucidation of the sodium/galactose symporter structure from the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacterium, vSGLT, has revealed a similarity in the core architecture with transporters from different gene families, including the leucine transporter (LeuT). Even though several transporters sharing this core have been structurally determined over the past few years, vSGLT is the only one crystallized in the substrate-bound inward-facing conformation so far. In this study, we report the first insight into the dynamics and coordination of the galactose (Gal) and proposed Na+ ion in vSGLT using a series of molecular dynamics simulations with a total time of about 0.1 micros. Our study reveals new residues, not observed in the crystal structure, which closely interact with the Na(+) ion or the substrate for extended times, and shows that in the crystallized conformation, a Na+ ion placed at the site equivalent to Na2 in LeuT can escape into the intracellular (IC) space in the absence of external forces. We have identified the highly conserved Asp189 as a likely binding residue on the pathway of Na(+) into the IC cavity. The release of Gal, on the other hand, requires the rotation of the side chain of the inner hydrophobic gate, Tyr263, without a significant change in vSGLT backbone conformation. Our simulations further show that the crystal structure represents but one accessible binding pose of Gal and Na+ among an ensemble of microstates, and that the Gal undergoes versatile alternate interactions at the binding pocket.	0
Title: The missing linker: a dimerization motif located within polyketide synthase modules Abstract: The dimerization of multimodular polyketide synthases is essential for their function. Motifs that supplement the contacts made by dimeric polyketide synthase enzymes have previously been characterized outside the boundaries of modules, at the N- and C-terminal ends of polyketide synthase subunits. Here we describe a heretofore uncharacterized dimerization motif located within modules. The dimeric state of this dimerization element was elucidated through the 2.6 Å resolution crystal structure of a fragment containing a dimerization element and a ketoreductase. The solution structure of a standalone dimerization element was revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be consistent with that of the crystal structure, and its dimerization constant was measured through analytical ultracentrifugation to be ∼20 μM. The dimer buries ∼990 Å(2) at its interface, and its C-terminal helices rigidly connect to ketoreductase domains to constrain their locations within a module. These structural restraints permitted the construction of a common type of polyketide synthase module.	0
Title: Isolation of a new antibacterial peptide actinokineosin from Actinokineospora spheciospongiae based on genome mining Abstract: Based on genome mining, a new antibacterial peptide named actinokineosin was isolated from a rare actinomycete Actinokineospora spheciospongiae. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminus of actinokineosin was established by TOF-MS/MS experiments. The amino acid sequence in the macrolactam ring was determined by TOF-MS/MS analyses after cleavage with BNPS-skatole and successive trypsin treatment. As a result of an antibacterial assay using a paper disk, actinokineosin showed antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus at a dosage of 50 μg per disk. From the genome sequence data of A. spheciospongiae, the biosynthetic gene cluster of actinokineosin was found and was indicated to consist of 10 genes. Among the genes, the gene aknA encoded the precursor of actinokineosin and the genes including aknC, aknB1 and aknB2 were proposed as modification enzymes to give mature actinokineosin.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Genome mining is a powerful tool to find new bioactive compounds from the genome database. In this report, we succeeded in isolation and structure determination of a new antibacterial peptide named actinokineosin based on genome mining.	1
Title: Identification of mureidomycin analogues and functional analysis of an N-acetyltransferase in napsamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Antibiotic abundance: Several new uridyl peptide antibiotics were identified from a heterologous producer strain containing the mureidomycin/napsamycin biosynthetic gene cluster by using HRMS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Analysis of the new compounds and the corresponding gene cluster revealed NpsB, an N-acetyltransferase, to be responsible for acetylation of the uridyl peptide antibiotic.	1
Title: RhI -Catalyzed PIII -Directed C-H Bond Alkylation: Design of Multifunctional Phosphines for Carboxylation of Aryl Bromides with Carbon Dioxide Abstract: We report the C-H alkylation of biarylphosphines at the ortho' position(s) with alkenes by using rhodium(I) catalysis, which provides straightforward access to a large library of multifunctionalized phosphines. Some of these modified ligands outperformed commercially available phosphines in the Pd-catalyzed carboxylation of aryl bromides with carbon dioxide in the presence of a photoredox catalyst.	0
Title: Investigation of the catalytic mechanism of the hotdog-fold enzyme superfamily Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase Abstract: The 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4-HB-CoA) thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 catalyzes the final step of the 4-chlorobenzoate degradation pathway, which is the hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA to coenzyme A (CoA) and 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB). In previous work, X-ray structural analysis of the substrate-bound thioesterase provided evidence of the role of an active site Asp17 in nucleophilic catalysis [Thoden, J. B., Holden, H. M., Zhuang, Z., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (2002) X-ray crystallographic analyses of inhibitor and substrate complexes of wild-type and mutant 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 27468-27476]. In the study presented here, kinetic techniques were used to test the catalytic mechanism that was suggested by the X-ray structural data. The time course for the multiple-turnover reaction of 50 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 10 μM thioesterase supported a two-step pathway in which the second step is rate-limiting. Steady-state product inhibition studies revealed that binding of CoA (K(is) = 250 ± 70 μM; K(ii) = 900 ± 300 μM) and 4-HB (K(is) = 1.2 ± 0.2 mM) is weak, suggesting that product release is not rate-limiting. A substantial D(2)O solvent kinetic isotope effect (3.8) on the steady-state k(cat) value (18 s(-1)) provided evidence that a chemical step involving proton transfer is the rate-limiting step. Taken together, the kinetic results support a two-chemical pathway. The microscopic rate constants governing the formation and consumption of the putative aspartyl 17-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)anhydride intermediate were determined by simulation-based fitting of a kinetic model to time courses for the substrate binding reaction (5.0 μM 4-HB-CoA and 0.54 μM thioesterase), single-turnover reaction (5 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 50 μM thioesterase), steady-state reaction (5.2 μM 4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 0.003 μM thioesterase), and transient-state multiple-turnover reaction (50 μM [(14)C]-4-HB-CoA catalyzed by 10 μM thioesterase). Together with the results obtained from solvent (18)O labeling experiments, the findings are interpreted as evidence of the formation of an aspartyl 17-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)anhydride intermediate that undergoes rate-limiting hydrolytic cleavage at the hydroxybenzoyl carbonyl carbon atom.	0
Title: Elucidation of the primary structure of the lantibiotic epilancin K7 from Staphylococcus epidermidis K7. Cloning and characterisation of the epilancin-K7-encoding gene and NMR analysis of mature epilancin K7 Abstract: Lantibiotics are bacteriocins that contain unusual amino acids such as lanthionines and alpha, beta-didehydro residues generated by posttranslational modification of a ribosomally synthesized precursor protein. The structural gene encoding the novel lantibiotic epilancin K7 from Staphylococcus epidermidis K7 was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene, which was named elkA, codes for a 55-residue preprotein, consisting of an N-terminal 24-residue leader peptide, and a C-terminal 31-residue propeptide which is posttranslationally modified and processed to yield mature epilancin K7. In common with the type-A lantibiotics nisin A and nisin Z, subtilin, epidermin, gallidermin and Pep5, pre-epilancin K7 has a so-called class-Al leader peptide. Downstream and upstream of the elkA gene, the starts of two open-reading-frames, named elkP and elkT, were identified. The elkP and elkT genes presumably encode a leader peptidase and a translocator protein, respectively, which may be involved in the processing and export of epilancin K7. The amino acid sequence of the unmodified pro-epilancin K7, deduced from the elkA gene sequence, is in full agreement with the amino acid sequence of mature epilancin K7, determined previously by means of NMR spectroscopy [van de Kamp, M., Horstink, L. M., van den Hooven, M. W., Konings, R. N. M., Hilbers, C. W., Sahl, H.-G., Metzger, J. W. & van de Ven, F. J. M. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 227, 757-771]. The first residue of mature epilancin K7 appears to be modified in a way that has not been described for any other lantibiotic so far. NMR experiments show that the elkA-encoded serine residue at position +1 of pro-epilancin K7 is modified to a 2-hydroxypropionyl residue in the mature protein.	1
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. III. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-(substituted-alkylthio)-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2- (carboxymethoxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: The synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(carboxymethoxyimino)ace tamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted-alkylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephem nucleus are described. Of these, the cephalosporins with a cyanomethylthio group (1d) and fluoroethylthio group (1p) at the C-3 position showed a potent in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as good oral absorption in rats. When administered orally to mice infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1d had stronger protective effect than 1p. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Producing Novel Fibrinolytic Isoindolinone Derivatives in Marine Fungus Stachybotrys longispora FG216 by the Rational Supply of Amino Compounds According to Its Biosynthesis Pathway Abstract: Many fungi in the Stachybotrys genus can produce various isoindolinone derivatives. These compounds are formed by a spontaneous reaction between a phthalic aldehyde precursor and an ammonium ion or amino compounds. In this study, we suggested the isoindolinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Stachybotrys by genome mining based on three reported core genes. Remarkably, there is an additional nitrate reductase (NR) gene copy in the proposed cluster. NR is the rate-limiting enzyme of nitrate reduction. Accordingly, this cluster was speculated to play a role in the balance of ammonium ion concentration in Stachybotrys. Ammonium ions can be replaced by different amino compounds to create structural diversity in the biosynthetic process of isoindolinone. We tested a rational supply of amino compounds ((±)-3-amino-2-piperidinone, glycine, and l-threonine) in the culture of an isoindolinone high-producing marine fungus, Stachybotrys longispora FG216. As a result, we obtained four new kinds of isoindolinone derivatives (FGFC4-GFC7) by this method. Furthermore, high yields of FGFC4-FGFC7 confirmed the outstanding production capacity of FG216. Among the four new isoindolinone derivatives, FGFC6 and FGFC7 showed promising fibrinolytic activities. The knowledge of biosynthesis pathways may be an important attribute for the discovery of novel bioactive marine natural products.	1
Title: A new member of the 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one-containing aminomutase family from the enediyne kedarcidin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: 4-Methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO)-containing aminomutases catalyze the conversion of L-α-amino acids to β-amino acids with either an (R) or an (S) configuration. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are the only two natural substrates identified to date. The enediyne chromophore of the chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic kedarcidin (KED) harbors an (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine moiety reminiscent of the (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-β-tyrosine moiety of the C-1027 enediyne chromophore, the biosynthesis of which uncovered the first known MIO-containing aminomutase, SgcC4. Comparative analysis of the KED and C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters inspired the proposal for (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine biosynthesis starting from 2-aza-L-tyrosine, featuring KedY4 as a putative MIO-containing aminomutase. Here we report the biochemical characterization of KedY4, confirming its proposed role in KED biosynthesis. KedY4 is an MIO-containing aminomutase that stereospecifically catalyzes the conversion of 2-aza-L-tyrosine to (R)-2-aza-β-tyrosine, exhibiting no detectable activity toward 2-aza-L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as an alternative substrate. In contrast, SgcC4, which stereospecifically catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to (S)-β-tyrosine in C-1027 biosynthesis, exhibits minimal activity with 2-aza-L-tyrosine as an alternative substrate but generating (S)-2-aza-β-tyrosine, a product with the opposite stereochemistry of KedY4. This report of KedY4 broadens the scope of known substrates for the MIO-containing aminomutase family, and comparative studies of KedY4 and SgcC4 provide an outstanding opportunity to examine how MIO-containing aminomutases control substrate specificity and product enantioselectivity.	1
Title: Difficidin and oxydifficidin: novel broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotics produced by Bacillus subtilis. III. Mode of action of difficidin Abstract: The mode of action of difficidin (DIF) was investigated. Upon addition of DIF to log phase cultures of Escherichia coli, growth ceased immediately and small round cells accumulated after 30 minutes incubation. No cell lysis was observed. DIF was rapidly bactericidal to both growing and stationary phase cultures, and inhibited protein synthesis more rapidly than RNA, DNA, or cell-wall synthesis in growing cells. Protein synthesis was also inhibited in a cell-free system. The frequency of natural mutation to resistance in E. coli was less than 1 in 10(10) cells.	0
Title: Glioperazine B, as a new antimicrobial agent against Staphylococcus aureus, and glioperazine C: two new dioxopiperazines from Bionectra byssicola Abstract: In the course of our screening for new antibacterials from microbial metabolites, two new dioxopiperazine metabolites, glioperazines B (1) and C (2), together with the known compound, glioperazine (3), were isolated from the mycelia of a liquid fermentation culture of the fungus, Bionectra byssicola F120. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were assigned on the basis of MS and NMR data. Compound 1 is an unusual dioxopiperazine metabolite containing an OMe group at the alpha-carbon of the amino acid residue. Compound 1 showed weak antibacterial activity against various strains of S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), while 2 and 3 did not show such activity.	0
Title: Heterotrophic bacteria from an extremely phosphate-poor lake have conditionally reduced phosphorus demand and utilize diverse sources of phosphorus Abstract: Heterotrophic Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were isolated from Lake Matano, Indonesia, a stratified, ferruginous (iron-rich), ultra-oligotrophic lake with phosphate concentrations below 50 nM. Here, we describe the growth of eight strains of heterotrophic bacteria on a variety of soluble and insoluble sources of phosphorus. When transferred to medium without added phosphorus (P), the isolates grow slowly, their RNA content falls to as low as 1% of cellular dry weight, and 86-100% of the membrane lipids are replaced with amino- or glycolipids. Similar changes in lipid composition have been observed in marine photoautotrophs and soil heterotrophs, and similar flexibility in phosphorus sources has been demonstrated in marine and soil-dwelling heterotrophs. Our results demonstrate that heterotrophs isolated from this unusual environment alter their macromolecular composition, which allows the organisms to grow efficiently even in their extremely phosphorus-limited environment.	0
Title: DNA sequencing and homologous expression of a small peptide conferring immunity to gassericin A, a circular bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 Abstract: Gassericin A, produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, is a hydrophobic circular bacteriocin. The DNA region surrounding the gassericin A structural gene, gaaA, was sequenced, and seven open reading frames (ORFs) of 3.5 kbp (gaaBCADITE) were found with possible functions in gassericin A production, secretion, and immunity. The deduced products of the five consecutive ORFs gaaADITE have homology to those of genes involved in butyrivibriocin AR10 production, although the genetic arrangements are different in the two circular bacteriocin genes. GaaI is a small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 53 amino acids containing a putative transmembrane segment. Heterologous expression and homologous expression of GaaI in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and L. gasseri JCM1131(T), respectively, were studied. GaaI-expressing strains exhibited at least sevenfold-higher resistance to gassericin A than corresponding control strains, indicating that gaaI encodes an immunity peptide for gassericin A. Comparison of GaaI to peptides with similar characteristics found in the circular bacteriocin gene loci is discussed.	1
Title: Culture medium optimization of a new bacterial extracellular polysaccharide with excellent moisture retention activity Abstract: A new kind of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) from Pseudomonas fluorescens PGM37 was obtained and culture media was optimized using the statistical methods single factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) design. As a result, the optimum cultivation conditions initial pH value, medium volume, inoculum size, temperature, and rotation speed were 7.5, 100 mL/250 mL, 5%, 28 °C, and 180 rpm, respectively. The optimized media: sucrose 36.23 g L(-1), yeast extract 3.32 g L(-1), sodium chloride 1.13 g L(-1), and calcium chloride 0.20 g L(-1). The maximum predicted yield of EPS was 10.1163 g L(-1) under these conditions. The validation data was 10.012 g L(-1), which could strongly confirm the correlation between the experimental and theoretical values. Gas Chromatography analysis revealed that the polymer was made up of mannose and glucose in the ratio of 1:1. Infrared spectroscopy showed that the polysaccharide had β-D-pyranoid configuration and contained no other substituent. Graded by different multiples of alcohol after specific degradation by enzyme and then detected by LC-ESI-MS, the EPS structure was β-D-Glcp-(1, 4)-β-D-Manp-(1, 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1, 4)-β-D-Manp. The moisture retention ability of the EPS was found to be superior to glycerol and only a little inferior to hyaluronic acid (HA), which presented potential application value in cosmetics and clinical medicine fields.	0
Title: DasR positively controls monensin production at two-level regulation in Streptomyces cinnamonensis Abstract: The polyether ionophore antibiotic monensin is produced by Streptomyces cinnamonensis and is used as a coccidiostat for chickens and growth-promoting agent for cattle. Monensin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned and partially characterized. The GntR-family transcription factor DasR regulates antibiotic production and morphological development in Streptomyces coelicolor and Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In this study, we identified and characterized the two-level regulatory cascade of DasR to monensin production in S. cinnamonensis. Forward and reverse genetics by overexpression and antisense RNA silence of dasR revealed that DasR positively controls monensin production under nutrient-rich condition. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that DasR protein specifically binds to the promoter regions of both pathway-specific regulatory gene monRII and biosynthetic genes monAIX, monE and monT. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that DasR upregulates the transcriptional levels of these genes during monensin fermentation. Subsequently, co-overexpressed dasR with pathway-specific regulatory genes monRI, monRII or monH greatly improved monensin production.	1
Title: Bacteriophage Tail-Tube Assembly Studied by Proton-Detected 4D Solid-State NMR Abstract: Obtaining unambiguous resonance assignments remains a major bottleneck in solid-state NMR studies of protein structure and dynamics. Particularly for supramolecular assemblies with large subunits (>150 residues), the analysis of crowded spectral data presents a challenge, even if three-dimensional (3D) spectra are used. Here, we present a proton-detected 4D solid-state NMR assignment procedure that is tailored for large assemblies. The key to recording 4D spectra with three indirect carbon or nitrogen dimensions with their inherently large chemical shift dispersion lies in the use of sparse non-uniform sampling (as low as 2 %). As a proof of principle, we acquired 4D (H)COCANH, (H)CACONH, and (H)CBCANH spectra of the 20 kDa bacteriophage tail-tube protein gp17.1 in a total time of two and a half weeks. These spectra were sufficient to obtain complete resonance assignments in a straightforward manner without use of previous solution NMR data.	0
Title: A microfluidic approach for screening submicroliter volumes against multiple reagents by using preformed arrays of nanoliter plugs in a three-phase liquid/liquid/gas flow Abstract: Plugging a gap in screening:                       Arrays of nanoliter-sized plugs of different compositions can be preformed in a three-phase liquid/liquid/gas flow. The arrays can be transported into a microfluidic channel to test against a target (see schematic representation), as demonstrated in protein crystallization and an enzymatic assay.	0
Title: Deciphering biosynthesis of the RNA polymerase inhibitor streptolydigin and generation of glycosylated derivatives Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the dienoyltetramic acid streptolydigin was identified and characterized from the producer organism Streptomyces lydicus NRRL2433. Sequence analysis of an 80.8 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 38 ORFs, 29 of which are probably involved in streptolydigin biosynthesis and would code for all activities required for its biosynthesis. Six insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to prove its involvement in streptolydigin biosynthesis, to define the boundaries of the cluster, to functionally characterize some genes, and to generate novel derivatives. A model for streptolydigin biosynthesis is proposed that includes a probable domain skipping in the streptolydigin PKS and the participation of a free-standing adenylation domain protein. Some bioactive derivatives of streptolydigin with altered glycosylation pattern have been produced by combinatorial biosynthesis showing a certain degree of flexibility of the L-rhodinosyl transferase SlgG for the recognition of 2,3,6-trideoxyhexoses and 2,6-dideoxyhexoses, both in D- and L-configuration.	1
Title: Diazaquinomycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters from Marine and Freshwater Actinomycetes Abstract: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of global concern. Members of the diazaquinomycin (DAQ) class of natural products have shown potent and selective activity against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, poor solubility has prevented further development of this compound class. Understanding DAQ biosynthesis may provide a viable route for the generation of derivatives with improved properties. We have sequenced the genomes of two actinomycete bacteria that produce distinct DAQ derivatives. While software tools for automated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) prediction failed to detect DAQ BGCs, comparative genomics using MAUVE alignment led to the identification of putative BGCs in the marine Streptomyces sp. F001 and in the freshwater Micromonospora sp. B006. Deletion of the identified daq BGC in strain B006 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing abolished DAQ production, providing experimental evidence for BGC assignment. A complete model for DAQ biosynthesis is proposed based on the genes identified. Insufficient knowledge of natural product biosynthesis is one of the major challenges of productive genome mining approaches. The results reported here fill a gap in knowledge regarding the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of DAQ antibiotics. Moreover, identification of the daq BGC shall enable future generations of improved derivatives using biosynthetic methods.	1
Title: Polyketides produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae induce Candida albicans growth Abstract: Metarhizium anisopliae is an important entomopathogenic species and model for arthropod-fungus interaction studies. This fungus harbors a diverse arsenal of unexplored secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, which are suggested to perform diverse roles during host interaction and soil subsistence as a saprophytic species. Here we explored an unusual carnitine acyltransferase domain-containing highly reducing polyketide synthase found in the genome of M. anisopliae. Employing heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans, two new polyketides were obtained, named BAA and BAB, as well as one known polyketide [(2Z,4E,6E)-octa-2,4,6-trienedioic acid]. Intra-hemocoel injection of the most abundant compound (BAA) in the model-arthropod Galleria mellonella larvae did not induce mortality or noticeable alterations, suggesting that this compound may not harbor insecticidal activity. Also, the potential role of such molecules in polymicrobial interactions was evaluated. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration assays using distinct fungal species revealed that BAA and BAB did not alter Cryptococcus neoformans growth, while BAA exhibited weak antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, these compounds increased Candida albicans growth compared to control conditions. Furthermore, BAA can mitigate the fungicidal effects of fluconazole over C. albicans. Although the exact role of these compounds on the M. anisopliae life cycle is elusive, the described results add up to the complexity of secondary metabolites produced by Metarhizium spp. Moreover, up to our knowledge, these are the first polyketides isolated from filamentous fungi that can boost the growth of another fungal species.	1
Title: Molecular cloning of the gene cluster for lariatin biosynthesis of Rhodococcus jostii K01-B0171 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for lariatins A and B, anti-mycobacterial peptide antibiotics with a unique "lasso" structure, was cloned from Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus jostii K01-B0171. Random transposition mutagenesis using IS1415 derivative was carried out to identify a chromosomal locus involved in lariatin biosynthesis and six independent lariatin non-producing variants were obtained. Arbitrary PCR revealed that one insertion was located near the region involved in lariatin biosynthesis. Using the lariatin gene as a probe, a genomic library of R. jostii K01-B0171 was screened by colony hybridization, and two clones were obtained. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed that the gene cluster for lariatin biosynthesis spanning about 4.5 kb consisted of five open reading frames (larA to larE). We proposed that the linear precursor LarA is processed by LarB, LarC, and LarD, and the mature lariatin is exported by LarE.	1
Title: Genomics of iron acquisition in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora: insights in the biosynthetic pathway of the siderophore desferrioxamine E Abstract: Genomics has clarified the biosynthetic pathway for desferrioxamine E critical for iron acquisition in the enterobacterial fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Evidence for each of the individual steps and the role of desferrioxamine E biosynthesis in pathogen virulence and cell protection from host defenses is presented. Using comparative genomics, it can be concluded that desferrioxamine biosynthesis is ancestral within the genera Erwinia and Pantoea.	1
Title: An effective strategy for exploring unknown metabolic pathways by genome mining Abstract: Plants allocate an estimated 15-25% of their proteome to specialized metabolic pathways that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a genome mining strategy for exploring such unknown pathways and demonstrate this approach for triterpenoids by functionally characterizing three cytochrome P450s from Arabidopsis thaliana . Building on proven methods for characterizing oxidosqualene cyclases, we heterologously expressed in yeast known cyclases with candidate P450s chosen from gene clustering and microarray coexpression patterns. The yeast cultures produced mg/L amounts of plant metabolites in vivo without the complex phytochemical background of plant extracts. Despite this simplification, the product multiplicity and novelty overwhelmed analytical efforts by MS methods. HSQC analysis overcame this problem. Side-by-side HSQC comparisons of crude P450 extracts against a control resolved even minor P450 products among ~100 other yeast metabolites spanning a dynamic range of >10,000:1. HSQC and GC-MS then jointly guided purification and structure determination by classical NMR methods. Including our present results for P450 oxidation of thalianol, arabidiol, and marneral, the metabolic fate for most of the major triterpene synthase products in Arabidopsis is now at least partially known.	1
Title: Coding and decoding libraries of sequence-defined functional copolymers synthesized via photoligation Abstract: Designing artificial macromolecules with absolute sequence order represents a considerable challenge. Here we report an advanced light-induced avenue to monodisperse sequence-defined functional linear macromolecules up to decamers via a unique photochemical approach. The versatility of the synthetic strategy-combining sequential and modular concepts-enables the synthesis of perfect macromolecules varying in chemical constitution and topology. Specific functions are placed at arbitrary positions along the chain via the successive addition of monomer units and blocks, leading to a library of functional homopolymers, alternating copolymers and block copolymers. The in-depth characterization of each sequence-defined chain confirms the precision nature of the macromolecules. Decoding of the functional information contained in the molecular structure is achieved via tandem mass spectrometry without recourse to their synthetic history, showing that the sequence information can be read. We submit that the presented photochemical strategy is a viable and advanced concept for coding individual monomer units along a macromolecular chain.	0
Title: Identification of a Novel Epoxyqueuosine Reductase Family by Comparative Genomics Abstract: The reduction of epoxyqueuosine (oQ) is the last step in the synthesis of the tRNA modification queuosine (Q). While the epoxyqueuosine reductase (EC 1.17.99.6) enzymatic activity was first described 30 years ago, the encoding gene queG was only identified in Escherichia coli in 2011. Interestingly, queG is absent from a large number of sequenced genomes that harbor Q synthesis or salvage genes, suggesting the existence of an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase in these organisms. By analyzing phylogenetic distributions, physical gene clustering, and fusions, members of the Domain of Unknown Function 208 (DUF208) family were predicted to encode for an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase. This prediction was validated with genetic methods. The Q modification is present in Lactobacillus salivarius, an organism missing queG but harboring the duf208 gene. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is one of the few organisms that harbor both QueG and DUF208, and deletion of both corresponding genes was required to observe the absence of Q and the accumulation of oQ in tRNA. Finally, the conversion oQ to Q was restored in an E. coli queG mutant by complementation with plasmids harboring duf208 genes from different bacteria. Members of the DUF208 family are not homologous to QueG enzymes, and thus, duf208 is a non-orthologous replacement of queG. We propose to name DUF208 encoding genes as queH. While QueH contains conserved cysteines that could be involved in the coordination of a Fe/S center in a similar fashion to what has been identified in QueG, no cobalamin was identified associated with recombinant QueH protein.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of a natural product biosynthetic gene cluster from eDNA Abstract: [reaction: see text] To study the natural products produced by uncultured microorganisms, an environmental DNA (eDNA) cosmid library was constructed and screened for the heterologous production of small molecules. A blue clone, CSL51, found in the eDNA library produces deoxyviolacein and the broad spectrum antibiotic violacein. The full sequence of the 6.7 kb eDNA violacein gene cluster and the characterization of violacein and deoxyviolacein from an eDNA clone are reported here.	1
Title: Endocarditis caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam during treatment despite initial susceptibility Abstract: Three episodes of bacteremia occurred in the course of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. The second isolate developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and the third isolate to piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TZ) following sequential therapy with each agent. The first isolate was resistant to PIP-TZ only at high inocula, the second isolate acquired increased transcription of the acrA gene, and the third isolate became resistant to PIP-TZ due to loss of beta-lactamase inhibition by TZ. We question if and how PIP-TZ susceptibility should be reported for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, biochemical characterization of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase (GerKI) from Streptomyces sp. KCTC 0041BP Abstract: dTDP-6-deoxy-d-allose, an unusual deoxysugar, has been identified as an intermediate in the mycinose biosynthetic pathway of several macrolide antibiotics. In order to characterize the biosynthesis of this deoxysugar, we have cloned and heterologously overexpressed gerK1 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. This gene encodes for a protein with the putative function of a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase, which appears to be involved in the dihydrochalcomycin (GERI-155) biosynthesis evidenced by Streptomyces sp KCTC 0041BP. Our results revealed that GerK1 exhibited a specific reductive effect on the 4-keto carbon of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-allose, with the hydroxyl group in an axial configuration at the C3 position only. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose to dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, according to the results of an in vitro coupled enzyme assay, in the presence of GerF (dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose 3-epimerase). The product was isolated, and its stereochemistry was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.	1
Title: Structural basis for stabilization of the tau pre-mRNA splicing regulatory element by novantrone (mitoxantrone) Abstract: Some familial neurodegenerative diseases are associated with mutations that destabilize a putative stem-loop structure within an intronic region of the tau pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) and alter the production of tau protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Because stabilization of the stem loop reverses the splicing pattern associated with neurodegeneration, small molecules that stabilize this stem loop would provide new ways to dissect the mechanism of neurodegeneration and treat tauopathies. The anticancer drug mitoxantrone was recently identified in a high throughput screen to stabilize the tau pre-mRNA stem loop. Here we report the solution structure of the tau mRNA-mitoxantrone complex, validated by the structure-activity relationship of existing mitoxantrone analogs. The structure describes the molecular basis for their interaction with RNA and provides a rational basis to optimize the activity of this new class of RNA-binding molecules.	0
Title: Screening of putative oxygenase genes in the Fusarium graminearum genome sequence database for their role in trichothecene biosynthesis Abstract: In the biosynthesis of type B trichothecenes, four oxygenation steps remain to have genes functionally assigned to them. On the basis of the complete genome sequence of Fusarium graminearum, expression patterns of all oxygenase genes were investigated in Fusarium asiaticum (F. graminearum lineage 6). As a result, we identified five cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) genes that are specifically expressed under trichothecene-producing conditions and are unique to the toxin-producing strains. The entire coding regions of four of these genes were identified in F. asiaticum. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, none of the oxygenases were able to transform trichodiene-11-one to expected products. However, one of the oxygenases catalyzed the 2beta-hydroxylation rather than the expected 2alpha-hydroxylation. Targeted disruption of the five CYP genes did not alter the trichothecene profiles of F. asiaticum. The results are discussed in relation to the presence of as-yet-unidentified oxygenation genes that are necessary for the biosynthesis of trichothecenes.	1
Title: Vitamin B12 partners the CarH repressor to downregulate a photoinducible promoter in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: A light-inducible promoter, P(B), drives expression of the carB operon in Myxococcus xanthus. Repressed by CarA in the dark, P(B) is activated when CarS, produced in the light, sequesters CarA to prevent operator-CarA binding. The MerR-type, N-terminal domain of CarA, which mediates interactions with both operator and CarS, is linked to a C-terminal oligomerization module with a predicted cobalamin-binding motif. Here, we show that although CarA does bind vitamin B12, mutating the motif involved has no effect on its ability to repress P(B). Intriguingly, P(B) could be repressed in the dark even with no CarA, so long as B12 and an intact CarA operator were present. We have discovered that this effect of B12 depends on the gene immediately downstream of carA. Its product, CarH, also consists of a MerR-type, N-terminal domain that specifically recognizes the CarA operator and CarS, linked to a predicted B12-binding C-terminal oligomerization module. The B12-mediated repression of P(B) in the dark is relieved by deleting carH, by mutating the DNA- or B12-binding residues of CarH, or by illumination. Our findings unveil parallel regulatory circuits that control a light-inducible promoter using a transcriptional factor repertoire that includes a paralogous gene pair and vitamin B12.	1
Title: New Limonoids from Melia toosendan Abstract: The root bark of Melia toosendan afforded four new limonoids with a C-19/C-29 bridged acetal structure, together with two known limonoids, 12α-hydroxyamoorastatone and its 12-acetate. The new compounds were elucidated as 1-O-acetyltrichilin H and 29-O-substituted amoorastatone derivatives, named neoazedarachins A, B and D, by spectroscopic and chemical means. Their antifeedant activity was also studied.	0
Title: Teaching an old pET new tricks: tuning of inclusion body formation and properties by a mixed feed system in E. coli Abstract: Against the outdated belief that inclusion bodies (IBs) in Escherichia coli are only inactive aggregates of misfolded protein, and thus should be avoided during recombinant protein production, numerous biopharmaceutically important proteins are currently produced as IBs. To obtain correctly folded, soluble product, IBs have to be processed, namely, harvested, solubilized, and refolded. Several years ago, it was discovered that, depending on cultivation conditions and protein properties, IBs contain partially correctly folded protein structures, which makes IB processing more efficient. Here, we present a method of tailored induction of recombinant protein production in E. coli by a mixed feed system using glucose and lactose and its impact on IB formation. Our method allows tuning of IB amount, IB size, size distribution, and purity, which does not only facilitate IB processing, but is also crucial for potential direct applications of IBs as nanomaterials and biomaterials in regenerative medicine.	0
Title: PtmC Catalyzes the Final Step of Thioplatensimycin, Thioplatencin, and Thioplatensilin Biosynthesis and Expands the Scope of Arylamine N-Acetyltransferases Abstract: The members of the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) family of enzymes are important for their many roles in xenobiotic detoxification in bacteria and humans. However, very little is known about their roles outside of detoxification or their specificities for acyl donors larger than acetyl-CoA. Herein, we report the detailed study of PtmC, an unusual NAT homologue encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster for thioplatensimycin, thioplatencin, and a newly reported scaffold, thioplatensilin, thioacid-containing diterpenoids and highly potent inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases. As the final enzyme of the pathway, PtmC is responsible for the selection of a thioacid arylamine over its cognate carboxylic acid and coupling to at least three large, 17-carbon ketolide-CoA substrates. Therefore, this study uses a combined approach of enzymology and molecular modeling to reveal how PtmC has evolved from the canonical NAT scaffold into a key part of a natural combinatorial biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, genome mining has revealed the presence of other related NATs located within natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, findings from this study are expected to expand our knowledge of how enzymes evolve for expanded substrate diversity and enable additional predictions about the activities of NATs involved in natural product biosynthesis and xenobiotic detoxification.	0
Title: Identification of a Saccharopolyspora erythraea gene required for the final hydroxylation step in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: In analyzing the region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea chromosome responsible for the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, we identified a gene, designated eryK, located about 50 kb downstream of the erythromycin resistance gene, ermE. eryK encodes a 44-kDa protein which, on the basis of comparative analysis, belongs to the P450 monooxygenase family. An S. erythraea strain disrupted in eryK no longer produced erythromycin A but accumulated the B and D forms of the antibiotic, indicating that eryK is responsible for the C-12 hydroxylation of the macrolactone ring, one of the last steps in erythromycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Holomycin, an Antibiotic Secondary Metabolite, Is Required for Biofilm Formation by the Native Producer Photobacterium galatheae S2753 Abstract: While the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms are widely studied, it remains less well understood how antibiotics affect the physiology of the native producing organisms. Here, using a marine bacterium, Photobacterium galatheae S2753, that produces the antibiotic holomycin, we generated a holomycin-deficient strain by in-frame deletion of hlmE, the core gene responsible for holomycin production. Mass spectrometry analysis of cell extracts confirmed that the ΔhlmE strain did not produce holomycin and that the mutant was devoid of antibacterial activity. Biofilm formation of the ΔhlmE strain was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type S2753 and was restored in an hlmE complementary mutant. Consistent with this, exogenous holomycin, but not its dimethylated and less antibacterial derivative, S,S'-dimethyl holomycin, restored the biofilm formation of the ΔhlmE strain. Furthermore, zinc starvation was found to be essential for both holomycin production and biofilm formation of S2753, although the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Collectively, these data suggest that holomycin promotes biofilm formation of S2753 via its ene-disulfide group. Lastly, the addition of holomycin at subinhibitory concentrations also enhanced the biofilms of four other Vibrionaceae strains. P. galatheae likely gains an ecological advantage from producing holomycin as both an antibiotic and a biofilm stimulator, which facilitates nutrition acquisition and protects P. galatheae from environmental stresses. Studying the function of antibiotic compounds in the native producer will shed light on their roles in nature and could point to novel bioprospecting strategies.IMPORTANCE Despite the societal impact of antibiotics, their ecological functions remain elusive and have mostly been studied by exposing nonproducing bacteria to subinhibitory concentrations. Here, we studied the effects of the antibiotic holomycin on its native producer, Photobacterium galatheae S2753, a Vibrionaceae bacterium. Holomycin provides a distinct advantage to S2753 both as an antibiotic and by enhancing biofilm formation in the producer. Vibrionaceae species successfully thrive in global marine ecosystems, where they play critical ecological roles as free-living, symbiotic, or pathogenic bacteria. Genome mining has demonstrated that many have the potential to produce several bioactive compounds, including P. galatheae To unravel the contribution of the microbial metabolites to the development of marine microbial ecosystems, better insight into the function of these compounds in the producing organisms is needed. Our finding provides a model to pursue this and highlights the ecological importance of antibiotics to the fitness of the producing organisms.	1
Title: A 7.6kb DNA region from Streptomyces kasugaensis M338-M1 includes some genes responsible for kasugamycin biosynthesis Abstract: A 7.6kb PstI-KpnI DNA fragment including a sequence highly similar to kasugamycin acetyltransferase gene (kac) was isolated from Streptomyces kasugaensis M338-M1 and sequenced. Nine open reading frames (ORFs), designated as ORF A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I, were recognized in this region, although ORF A was incomplete. ORF G runs in the opposite direction to the others. The amino acid sequence deduced from ORF H showed 98% similarity to that of the kasugamycin acetyltransferase from S. kasugaensis MB273-C4, another kasugamycin (KSM) producer. Transformation of E. coli JM109 with ORF H made the strain highly resistant to KSM. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF A, C and D products were similar, respectively, to glucosyltransferase I from E. coli (26%), beta-alanine: pyruvate transaminase from Pseudomonas putida (32%) and dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (StrE) from Streptomyces griseus (37%). The strE-like ORF (ORF D) seems to be the gene responsible for formation of the 6-deoxy structure of the kasugamine moiety. ORF A and ORF C are also likely to have roles in KSM biosynthesis. Taken together, our analyses strongly suggest that this DNA region includes at least a part of the gene cluster of KSM biosynthesis.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing, heterologous expression, and mechanistic analysis of A-74528 biosynthesis Abstract: A-74528 is a recently discovered natural product of Streptomyces sp. SANK 61196 that inhibits 2',5'-oligoadenylate phosphodiesterase (2'-PDE), a key regulatory enzyme of the interferon pathway. Inhibition of 2'-PDE by A-74528 reduces viral replication, and therefore shows promise as a new type of antiviral drug. The complete A-74528 gene cluster, comprising 29 open reading frames, was cloned and sequenced, and shown to possess a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) at its core. Its identity was confirmed by analysis of a mutant generated by targeted disruption of a PKS gene, and by functional expression in a heterologous Streptomyces host. Remarkably, it showed exceptional end-to-end sequence identity to the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of fredericamycin A, a structurally unrelated antitumor antibiotic with a distinct mode of action. Whereas the fredericamycin producing strain, Streptomyces griseus, produced undetectable quantities of A-74528, the A-74528 gene cluster was capable of producing both antibiotics. The biosynthetic roles of three genes, including one that represents the only qualitative difference between the two gene clusters, were investigated by targeted gene disruption. The implications for the evolution of antibiotics with different biological activities from the same gene cluster are discussed.	1
Title: NovG, a DNA-binding protein acting as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin contains two putative regulatory genes, i.e. novE and novG. The predicted gene product of novG shows a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and shares sequence similarity with StrR, a well-studied pathway-specific transcriptional activator of streptomycin biosynthesis. Here functional proof is provided, by genetic and biochemical approaches, for the role of NovG as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis. The entire novobiocin cluster of the producer organism Streptomyces spheroides was expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512, and additional strains were produced which lacked the novG gene within the heterologously expressed cluster. These Delta novG strains produced only 2% of the novobiocin formed by the S. coelicolor M512 strains carrying the intact novobiocin cluster. The production could be restored by introducing an intact copy of novG into the mutant. The presence of novG on a multicopy plasmid in the strain containing the intact cluster led to almost threefold overproduction of the antibiotic, suggesting that novobiocin biosynthesis is limited by the availability of NovG protein. Furthermore, purified N-terminal His(6)-tagged NovG showed specific DNA-binding activity for the novG-novH and the cloG-cloY intergenic regions of the novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthetic gene clusters, respectively. By comparing the DNA sequences of the fragments binding NovG, conserved inverted repeats were identified in both fragments, similar to those identified as the binding sites for StrR. The consensus sequence for the StrR and the putative NovG binding sites was GTTCRACTG(N)(11)CRGTYGAAC. Therefore, NovG and StrR apparently belong to the same family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins.	1
Title: Production of biologically active human myelocytokines in plants Abstract: An effective system for expression of human granulocyte and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factors (hG-CSF and hGM-CSF) in Nicotiana benthamiana plants was developed using viral vector based on tobacco mosaic virus infecting cruciferous plants. The genes of target proteins were cloned into the viral vector driven by actin promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression vectors were delivered into plant cells by agroinjection. Maximal synthesis rate was detected 5 days after injection and was up to 500 and 300 mg per kg of fresh leaves for hG-CSF and hGM-CSF, respectively. The yield of purified hG-CSF and hGM-CSF was 100 and 50 mg/kg of fresh leaves, respectively. Recombinant plant-made hG-CSF and hGM-CSF stimulated proliferation of murine bone marrow and human erythroleucosis TF-1 cells, respectively, at the same rate as the commercial drugs.	0
Title: Comparison of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis gene clusters in Claviceps species indicates loss of late pathway steps in evolution of C. fusiformis Abstract: The grass parasites Claviceps purpurea and Claviceps fusiformis produce ergot alkaloids (EA) in planta and in submerged culture. Whereas EA synthesis (EAS) in C. purpurea proceeds via clavine intermediates to lysergic acid and the complex ergopeptines, C. fusiformis produces only agroclavine and elymoclavine. In C. purpurea the EAS gene (EAS) cluster includes dmaW (encoding the first pathway step), cloA (elymoclavine oxidation to lysergic acid), and the lpsA/lpsB genes (ergopeptine formation). We analyzed the corresponding C. fusiformis EAS cluster to investigate the evolutionary basis for chemotypic differences between the Claviceps species. Other than three peptide synthetase genes (lpsC and the tandem paralogues lpsA1 and lpsA2), homologues of all C. purpurea EAS genes were identified in C. fusiformis, including homologues of lpsB and cloA, which in C. purpurea encode enzymes for steps after clavine synthesis. Rearrangement of the cluster was evident around lpsB, which is truncated in C. fusiformis. This and several frameshift mutations render CflpsB a pseudogene (CflpsB(Psi)). No obvious inactivating mutation was identified in CfcloA. All C. fusiformis EAS genes, including CflpsB(Psi) and CfcloA, were expressed in culture. Cross-complementation analyses demonstrated that CfcloA and CflpsB(Psi) were expressed in C. purpurea but did not encode functional enzymes. In contrast, CpcloA catalyzed lysergic acid biosynthesis in C. fusiformis, indicating that C. fusiformis terminates its EAS pathway at elymoclavine because the cloA gene product is inactive. We propose that the C. fusiformis EAS cluster evolved from a more complete cluster by loss of some lps genes and by rearrangements and mutations inactivating lpsB and cloA.	1
Title: Positive GABA(A) receptor modulators from Acorus calamus and structural analysis of (+)-dioxosarcoguaiacol by 1D and 2D NMR and molecular modeling Abstract: In a two-microelectrode voltage clamp with Xenopus laevis oocytes, a petroleum ether extract of Acorus calamus rhizomes enhanced the GABA-induced chloride current through GABA(A) receptors of the α₁β₂γ(2S) subtype by 277% ± 9.7% (100 μg/mL). β-Asarone (1), (+)-dioxosarcoguaiacol (2), (+)-shyobunone (3), and (+)-preisocalamenediol (4) were subsequently identified as main active principles through HPLC-based activity profiling and targeted isolation. The compounds induced maximum potentiation of the chloride current ranging from 588% ± 126% (EC₅₀: 65.3 ± 21.6 μM) (2) to 1200% ± 163% (EC(50): 171.5 ± 34.6 μM) (1), whereas (-)-isoshyobunone (5) and (-)-acorenone (6) exhibited weak GABA(A) modulating properties (5: 164% ± 42.9%; EC₅₀: 109.4 ± 46.6 μM and 6: 241% ± 23.1%; EC₅₀: 34.0 ± 6.7 μM). The relative configuration of 2 was established as 4R*8S*10R* by NOESY experiments and conformational analysis.	0
Title: Why Algae Release Volatile Organic Compounds-The Emission and Roles Abstract: A wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from algae in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental factors such as light, temperature, nutrition conditions and abiotic stresses affect their emission. These VOCs can enhance the resistance to abiotic stresses, transfer information between algae, play allelopathic roles, and protect against predators. For homogeneous algae, the VOCs released from algal cells under stress conditions transfer stress information to other cells, and induce the acceptors to make a preparation for the upcoming stresses. For heterogeneous algae and aquatic macrophytes, the VOCs show allelopathic effects on the heterogeneous neighbors, which benefit to the emitter growth and competing for nutrients. In cyanobacterial VOCs, some compounds such as limonene, eucalyptol, β-cyclocitral, α-ionone, β-ionone and geranylacetone have been detected as the allelopathic agents. In addition, VOCs can protect the emitters from predation by predators. It can be speculated that the emission of VOCs is critical for algae coping with the complicated and changeable aquatic ecosystems.	0
Title: Biosynthesis-assisted structural elucidation of the bartolosides, chlorinated aromatic glycolipids from cyanobacteria Abstract: The isolation of the bartolosides, unprecedented cyanobacterial glycolipids featuring aliphatic chains with chlorine substituents and C-glycosyl moieties, is reported. Their chlorinated dialkylresorcinol (DAR) core presented a major structural-elucidation challenge. To overcome this, we discovered the bartoloside (brt) biosynthetic gene cluster and linked it to the natural products through in vitro characterization of the DAR-forming ketosynthase and aromatase. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed a novel potential halogenase. Knowledge of the bartoloside biosynthesis constrained the DAR core structure by defining key pathway intermediates, ultimately allowing us to determine the full structures of the bartolosides. This work illustrates the power of genomics to enable the use of biosynthetic information for structure elucidation.	1
Title: Infectivity of a glucan synthesis-defective mutant of Streptococcus gordonii (Challis) in a rat endocarditis model Abstract: Streptococcus gordonii, a member of the human indigenous oral microflora, colonizes smooth tooth surfaces and contributes to dental plaque formation. Although it is not recognized as being a cariogenic pathogen, it may cause endocarditis following invasion of the bloodstream. Using allelic exchange mutagenesis, we have constructed a mutant of S. gordonii (Challis) which is defective in its single functional glucosyltransferase gene and, hence, is unable to synthesize glucan exopolymers from sucrose. When examined in a rat endocarditis model, the sucrose-grown mutant did not differ significantly from S. gordonii wild-type, suggesting that glucan polymers did not contribute to infectivity. This result was in striking contrast to that previously observed with a polymer-defective S. mutans mutant.	0
Title: Fine-tuning the regulation of Cas9 expression levels for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 mediated recombination in Streptomyces Abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 has proven as a very powerful gene editing tool for Actinomyces, allowing scarless and precise genome editing in selected strains of these biotechnologically relevant microorganisms. However, its general application in actinomycetes has been limited due to its inefficacy when applying the system in an untested strain. Here, we provide evidence of how Cas9 levels are toxic for the model actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and Streptomyces lividans TK24, which show delayed or absence of growth. We overcame this toxicity by lowering Cas9 levels and have generated a set of plasmids in which Cas9 expression is either controlled by theophylline-inducible or constitutive promoters. We validated the targeting of these CRISPR-Cas9 system using the glycerol uptake operon and the actinorhodin biosynthesis gene cluster. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting Cas9 expression levels specifically in strains to gain optimum and efficient gene editing in Actinomyces.	0
Title: Profilin's Affinity for Formin Regulates the Availability of Filament Ends for Actin Monomer Binding Abstract: Nucleation-promoting proteins tightly regulate actin polymerization in cells. Whereas many of these proteins bind actin monomers directly, formins use the actin-binding protein profilin to dynamically load actin monomers onto their flexible Formin Homology 1 (FH1) domains. Following binding, FH1 domains deliver profilin-actin complexes to filament ends. To investigate profilin's role as an adaptor protein in formin-mediated elongation, we engineered a chimeric formin that binds actin monomers directly via covalent attachment of profilin to its binding site in the formin. This formin mediates slow filament elongation owing to a high probability of profilin binding at filament ends. Varying the position at which profilin is tethered to the formin alters the elongation rate by modulating profilin occupancy at the filament end. By regulating the availability of the barbed end, we propose that profilin binding establishes a secondary point of control over the rate of filament elongation mediated by formins. Profilin's differential affinities for actin monomers, barbed ends and polyproline are thus tuned to adaptively bridge actin and formins and optimize the rate of actin polymerization.	0
Title: Substrate specificity of the adenylation enzyme SgcC1 involved in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is an enediyne antitumor antibiotic composed of a chromophore with four distinct chemical moieties, including an (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety that is derived from l-alpha-tyrosine. SgcC4, a novel aminomutase requiring no added co-factor that catalyzes the formation of the first intermediate (S)-beta-tyrosine and subsequently SgcC1 homologous to adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, was identified as specific for the SgcC4 product and did not recognize any alpha-amino acids. To definitively establish the substrate for SgcC1, a full kinetic characterization of the enzyme was performed using amino acid-dependent ATP-[(32)P]PP(i) exchange assay to monitor amino acid activation and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectroscopy to follow the loading of the activated beta-amino acid substrate to the peptidyl carrier protein SgcC2. The data establish (S)-beta-tyrosine as the preferred substrate, although SgcC1 shows promiscuous activity toward aromatic beta-amino acids such as beta-phenylalanine, 3-chloro-beta-tyrosine, and 3-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine, but all were <50-fold efficient. A putative active site mutant P571A adjacent to the invariant aspartic acid residue of all alpha-amino acid-specific adenylation domains known to date was prepared as a preliminary attempt to probe the substrate specificity of SgcC1; however the mutation resulted in a loss of activity with all substrates except (S)-beta-tyrosine, which was 142-fold less efficient relative to the wild-type enzyme. In total, SgcC1 is now confirmed to catalyze the second step in the biosynthesis of the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety of C-1027, presenting downstream enzymes with an (S)-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 thioester substrate, and represents the first beta-amino acid-specific adenylation enzyme characterized biochemically.	1
Title: Identification and catalytic characterization of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of echosides from Streptomyces sp. LZ35 Abstract: Echosides, isolated from Streptomyces sp. LZ35, represent a class of para-terphenyl natural products that display DNA topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activities. By analyzing the genome draft of strain LZ35, the ech gene cluster was identified to be responsible for the biosynthesis of echosides, which was further confirmed by gene disruption and HPLC analysis. Meanwhile, the biosynthetic pathway for echosides was proposed. Furthermore, the echA-gene, encoding a tri-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like enzyme, was identified as a polyporic acid synthetase and biochemically characterized in vitro. This is the first study to our knowledge on the biochemical characterization of an Actinobacteria quinone synthetase, which accepts phenylpyruvic acid as a native substrate. Therefore, our results may help investigate the function of other NRPS-like enzymes in Actinobacteria.	1
Title: Enzymatic Reconstitution and Biosynthetic Investigation of the Lasso Peptide Fusilassin Abstract: Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural product which possess a unique lariat knot conformation. The low entropy "threaded" conformation endows lasso peptides with considerable resistance to heat and proteolytic degradation, which are attractive properties for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. Despite their discovery nearly 30 years ago, the molecular mechanism underlying lasso peptide biosynthesis remains poorly characterized due to the low stability of the purified biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we report the biosynthetic reconstitution of a lasso peptide derived from Thermobifida fusca, termed fusilassin. Beyond robust catalytic activity, the fusilassin enzymes demonstrate extraordinary substrate tolerance during heterologous expression in E. coli and upon purification in cell-free biosynthetic reconstitution reactions. We provide evidence that the fusilassin biosynthetic enzymes are not capable of forming branched-cyclic products but can produce entirely unrelated lasso peptides. Finally, we leveraged our bioinformatic survey of all lasso peptides identified in GenBank to perform coevolutionary analysis of two requisite biosynthetic proteins. This effort correctly identified residues governing an important protein-protein interaction, illustrating how genomic insight can accelerate the characterization of natural product biosynthetic pathways. The fusilassin enzymes described within represent a model system for both designing future lasso peptides of biomedical importance and also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern lasso peptide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Precursor peptide-targeted mining of more than one hundred thousand genomes expands the lanthipeptide natural product family Abstract: Background:                       Lanthipeptides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide group of natural products and have a variety of biological activities ranging from antibiotics to antinociceptives. These peptides are cyclized through thioether crosslinks and can bear other secondary post-translational modifications. While lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters can be identified by the presence of genes encoding characteristic enzymes involved in the post-translational modification process, locating the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters is challenging due to their short length and high sequence variability, which limits the high-throughput exploration of lanthipeptide biosynthesis. To address this challenge, we enhanced the predictive capabilities of Rapid ORF Description & Evaluation Online (RODEO) to identify members of all four known classes of lanthipeptides.                  Results:                       Using RODEO, we mined over 100,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes in the RefSeq database. We identified nearly 8500 lanthipeptide precursor peptides. These precursor peptides were identified in a broad range of bacterial phyla as well as the Euryarchaeota phylum of archaea. Bacteroidetes were found to encode a large number of these biosynthetic gene clusters, despite making up a relatively small portion of the genomes in this dataset. A number of these precursor peptides are similar to those of previously characterized lanthipeptides, but even more were not, including potential antibiotics. One such new antimicrobial lanthipeptide was purified and characterized. Additionally, examination of the biosynthetic gene clusters revealed that enzymes installing secondary post-translational modifications are more widespread than initially thought.                  Conclusion:                       Lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters are more widely distributed and the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters are more diverse than previously appreciated, demonstrating that the lanthipeptide sequence-function space remains largely underexplored.	1
Title: Homodimerization of the p51 subunit of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase Abstract: The dimerization of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), required to obtain the active form of the enzyme, is influenced by mutations, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleotide substrates, Mg ions, temperature, and specifically designed dimerization inhibitors. In this study, we have utilized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the [methyl-(13)C]methionine-labeled enzyme and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate how several of these factors influence the dimerization behavior of the p51 subunit. The (1)H-(13)C HSQC spectrum of p51 obtained at micromolar concentrations indicates that a significant fraction of the p51 adopts a "p66-like" conformation. SAXS data obtained for p51 samples were used to determine the fractions of monomer and dimer in the sample and to evaluate the conformation of the fingers/thumb subdomain. All of the p51 monomer observed was found to adopt the compact, "p51C" conformation observed for the p51 subunit in the RT heterodimer. The NMR and SAXS data indicate that the p51 homodimer adopts a structure that is similar to the p66/p51 heterodimer, with one p51C subunit and a second p51 subunit in an extended, "p51E" conformation that resembles the p66 subunit of the heterodimer. The fractional dimer concentration and the fingers/thumb orientation are found to depend strongly on the experimental conditions and exhibit a qualitative dependence on nevirapine and ionic strength (KCl) that is similar to the behavior reported for the heterodimer and the p66 homodimer. The L289K mutation interferes with p51 homodimer formation as it does with formation of the heterodimer, despite its location far from the dimer interface. This effect is readily interpreted in terms of a conformational selection model, in which p51(L289K) has a much greater preference for the compact, p51C conformation. A reduced level of dimer formation then results from the reduced ratio of the p51E(L289K) to p51C(L289K) monomers.	0
Title: Genetic analysis of pigment biosynthesis in Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2 using a new, highly efficient transposon mutagenesis system that is functional in a wide variety of bacteria Abstract: A highly efficient method of transposon mutagenesis was developed for genetic analysis of Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2. The method makes use of a transposon delivery vector that encodes a hyperactive Tn 5 transposase that is 1,000-fold more active than the wild-type transposase. In this construct, the transposase is expressed from the promoter of the tetA gene of plasmid RP4, which is functional in a wide variety of organisms. The transposon itself contains a kanamycin resistance gene as a selectable marker and the origin of replication from plasmid R6K to facilitate subsequent cloning of the resulting insertion site. To test the effectiveness of this method, mutants unable to produce the characteristic yellow pigment (zeaxanthin dirhamnoside) of X. autotrophicus Py2 were isolated and analyzed. Transposon insertions were obtained at high frequency: approximately 1 x 10(-3) per recipient cell. Among these, pigment mutants were observed at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). Such mutants were found to have transposon insertions in genes homologous to known carotenoid biosynthetic genes previously characterized in other pigmented bacteria. Mutants were also isolated in Pseudomonas stutzeri and in an Alcaligenes faecalis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in diverse Proteobacteria. Preliminary results from other laboratories have confirmed the effectiveness of this method in additional phylogenetically diverse species.	1
Title: Gene clusters for insecticidal loline alkaloids in the grass-endophytic fungus Neotyphodium uncinatum Abstract: Loline alkaloids are produced by mutualistic fungi symbiotic with grasses, and they protect the host plants from insects. Here we identify in the fungal symbiont, Neotyphodium uncinatum, two homologous gene clusters (LOL-1 and LOL-2) associated with loline-alkaloid production. Nine genes were identified in a 25-kb region of LOL-1 and designated (in order) lolF-1, lolC-1, lolD-1, lolO-1, lolA-1, lolU-1, lolP-1, lolT-1, and lolE-1. LOL-2 contained the homologs lolC-2 through lolE-2 in the same order and orientation. Also identified was lolF-2, but its possible linkage with either cluster was undetermined. Most lol genes were regulated in N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum, and all were expressed concomitantly with loline-alkaloid biosynthesis. A lolC-2 RNA-interference (RNAi) construct was introduced into N. uncinatum, and in two independent transformants, RNAi significantly decreased lolC expression (P < 0.01) and loline-alkaloid accumulation in culture (P < 0.001) compared to vector-only controls, indicating involvement of lolC in biosynthesis of lolines. The predicted LolU protein has a DNA-binding site signature, and the relationships of other lol-gene products indicate that the pathway has evolved from various different primary and secondary biosynthesis pathways.	1
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster of the glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin: characterization of two glycosyltransferases and the key acyltransferase Abstract: The gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of the clinically important glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin has been cloned from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Forty-nine putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified within an 89 kbp genetic locus and assigned roles in teicoplanin biosynthesis, export, resistance, and regulation. Two ORFs, designated orfs 1 and 10*, showed significant homology to known glycosyltransferases. When heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, these glycosyltransferases were shown to catalyze the transfer of UDP-(N-acetyl)-glucosamine onto, respectively, 3-chloro-beta-hydroxytyrosine-6 (3-Cl-6betaHty) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine-4 (4Hpg) of the teicoplanin heptapeptide aglycone. The product of another ORF, orf11*, was demonstrated in vitro to transfer n-acetyl-, n-butyryl-, and n-octanoyl-groups from acyl-CoA donors either to a free UDP-aminosugar or to an aminosugar moiety in the teicoplanin pseudoaglycone, thus identifying Orf11* as the key acyltransferase in teicoplanin maturation. These findings should accelerate the combinatorial engineering of new and improved glycopeptide drugs.	1
Title: Production of α-galactosylceramide by a prominent member of the human gut microbiota Abstract: While the human gut microbiota are suspected to produce diffusible small molecules that modulate host signaling pathways, few of these molecules have been identified. Species of Bacteroides and their relatives, which often comprise >50% of the gut community, are unusual among bacteria in that their membrane is rich in sphingolipids, a class of signaling molecules that play a key role in inducing apoptosis and modulating the host immune response. Although known for more than three decades, the full repertoire of Bacteroides sphingolipids has not been defined. Here, we use a combination of genetics and chemistry to identify the sphingolipids produced by Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343. We constructed a deletion mutant of BF2461, a putative serine palmitoyltransferase whose yeast homolog catalyzes the committed step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. We show that the Δ2461 mutant is sphingolipid deficient, enabling us to purify and solve the structures of three alkaline-stable lipids present in the wild-type strain but absent from the mutant. The first compound was the known sphingolipid ceramide phosphorylethanolamine, and the second was its corresponding dihydroceramide base. Unexpectedly, the third compound was the glycosphingolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer(Bf)), which is structurally related to a sponge-derived sphingolipid (α-GalCer, KRN7000) that is the prototypical agonist of CD1d-restricted natural killer T (iNKT) cells. We demonstrate that α-GalCer(Bf) has similar immunological properties to KRN7000: it binds to CD1d and activates both mouse and human iNKT cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study reveals BF2461 as the first known member of the Bacteroides sphingolipid pathway, and it indicates that the committed steps of the Bacteroides and eukaryotic sphingolipid pathways are identical. Moreover, our data suggest that some Bacteroides sphingolipids might influence host immune homeostasis.	1
Title: The Redox-Bohr group associated with iron-sulfur cluster N2 of complex I Abstract: Proton pumping respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a major component of the oxidative phosphorylation system in mitochondria and many bacteria. In mammalian cells it provides 40% of the proton motive force needed to make ATP. Defects in this giant and most complicated membrane-bound enzyme cause numerous human disorders. Yet the mechanism of complex I is still elusive. A group exhibiting redox-linked protonation that is associated with iron-sulfur cluster N2 of complex I has been proposed to act as a central component of the proton pumping machinery. Here we show that a histidine in the 49-kDa subunit that resides near iron-sulfur cluster N2 confers this redox-Bohr effect. Mutating this residue to methionine in complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica resulted in a marked shift of the redox midpoint potential of iron-sulfur cluster N2 to the negative and abolished the redox-Bohr effect. However, the mutation did not significantly affect the catalytic activity of complex I and protons were pumped with an unchanged stoichiometry of 4 H(+)/2e(-). This finding has significant implications on the discussion about possible proton pumping mechanism for complex I.	0
Title: Enzyme-Catalyzed Inverse-Electron Demand Diels-Alder Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Antifungal Ilicicolin H Abstract: The pericyclases are a growing superfamily of enzymes that catalyze pericyclic reactions. We report a pericyclase IccD catalyzing an inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction with a rate acceleration of 3 × 105-fold in the biosynthesis of fungal natural product ilicicolin H. We demonstrate IccD is highly periselective toward the IEDDA cycloaddition over a competing normal electron demand Diels-Alder (NEDDA) reaction from an ambimodal transition state. A predicted flavoenzyme IccE was identified to epimerize the IEDDA product 8- epi-ilicicolin H to ilicicolin H, a step that is critical for the observed antifungal activity of ilicicolin H. Our results reveal the ilicicolin H biosynthetic pathway and add to the collection of pericyclic reactions that are catalyzed by pericyclases.	1
Title: Crystal structure of group II intron domain 1 reveals a template for RNA assembly Abstract: Although the importance of large noncoding RNAs is increasingly appreciated, our understanding of their structures and architectural dynamics remains limited. In particular, we know little about RNA folding intermediates and how they facilitate the productive assembly of RNA tertiary structures. Here, we report the crystal structure of an obligate intermediate that is required during the earliest stages of group II intron folding. Composed of domain 1 from the Oceanobacillus iheyensis group II intron (266 nucleotides), this intermediate retains native-like features but adopts a compact conformation in which the active site cleft is closed. Transition between this closed and the open (native) conformation is achieved through discrete rotations of hinge motifs in two regions of the molecule. The open state is then stabilized by sequential docking of downstream intron domains, suggesting a 'first come, first folded' strategy that may represent a generalizable pathway for assembly of large RNA and ribonucleoprotein structures.	0
Title: Identification and Mobilization of a Cryptic Antibiotic Biosynthesis Gene Locus from a Human-Pathogenic Nocardia Isolate Abstract: The genus Nocardia contains >50 human pathogenic species that cause a range of illnesses from skin and soft tissue infections to lung and brain infections. However, despite their membership in the most prominent family of secondary metabolite producers (the Actinomycetes), the ability of Nocardia species, especially those that cause human infections, to produce secondary metabolites has not been as well studied. Using genome mining, we have investigated cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters from Nocardia species and identified a conserved locus within human pathogenic strains of Nocardia brasiliensis and Nocardia vulneris. Direct capture and heterologous expression in a Streptomyces host activated the biosynthetic locus, revealing it to be the source of the brasiliquinones, benz[a]anthraquinone antibiotics whose biosynthetic pathway has remained hidden for over two decades, until now. Our findings highlight these hitherto neglected human pathogenic Nocardia as a source of diverse and important natural products.	1
Title: Encapsulating streptomycin within a small 40-mer RNA Abstract: We describe a 2.9 A X-ray structure of a complex between the aminocyclitol antibiotic streptomycin and an in vitro selected RNA aptamer, solved using the anomalous diffraction properties of Ba cations. The RNA aptamer, which contains two asymmetric internal loops, adopts a distinct cation-stabilized fold involving a series of S-shaped backbone turns anchored by canonical and noncanonical pairs and triples. The streptomycin streptose ring is encapsulated by stacked arrays of bases from both loops at the elbow of the L-shaped RNA architecture. Specificity is defined by direct hydrogen bonds between all streptose functional groups and base edges that line the inner walls of the cylindrical binding pocket. By contrast, the majority of intermolecular interactions involve contacts to backbone phosphates in the published structure of streptomycin bound to the 16S rRNA.	0
Title: Polyketide and nonribosomal peptide retro-biosynthesis and global gene cluster matching Abstract: Polyketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are profoundly important natural products, forming the foundations of many therapeutic regimes. Decades of research have revealed over 11,000 PK and NRP structures, and genome sequencing is uncovering new PK and NRP gene clusters at an unprecedented rate. However, only ∼10% of PK and NRPs are currently associated with gene clusters, and it is unclear how many of these orphan gene clusters encode previously isolated molecules. Therefore, to efficiently guide the discovery of new molecules, we must first systematically de-orphan emergent gene clusters from genomes. Here we provide to our knowledge the first comprehensive retro-biosynthetic program, generalized retro-biosynthetic assembly prediction engine (GRAPE), for PK and NRP families and introduce a computational pipeline, global alignment for natural products cheminformatics (GARLIC), to uncover how observed biosynthetic gene clusters relate to known molecules, leading to the identification of gene clusters that encode new molecules.	1
Title: 3D Cage COFs: A Dynamic Three-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with High-Connectivity Organic Cage Nodes Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rare because there is a limited choice of organic building blocks that offer multiple reactive sites in a polyhedral geometry. Here, we synthesized an organic cage molecule (Cage-6-NH2) that was used as a triangular prism node to yield the first cage-based 3D COF, 3D-CageCOF-1. This COF adopts an unreported 2-fold interpenetrated acs topology and exhibits reversible dynamic behavior, switching between a small-pore (sp) structure and a large-pore (lp) structure. It also shows high CO2 uptake and captures water at low humidity (<40%). This demonstrates the potential for expanding the structural complexity of 3D COFs by using organic cages as the building units.	0
Title: Identification and analysis of the chivosazol biosynthetic gene cluster from the myxobacterial model strain Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 Abstract: Myxobacteria belonging to the genus Sorangium are known to produce a variety of biologically active secondary metabolites. Chivosazol is a macrocyclic antibiotic active against yeast, filamentous fungi and especially against mammalian cells. The compound specifically destroys the actin skeleton of eucaryotic cells and does not show activity against bacteria. Chivosazol contains an oxazole ring and a glycosidically bound 6-deoxyglucose (except for chivosazol F). In this paper we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster that directs chivosazol biosynthesis in the model strain Sorangium cellulosum So ce56. This biosynthetic gene cluster spans 92 kbp on the chromosome and contains four polyketide synthase genes and one hybrid polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene. An additional gene encoding a protein with similarity to different methyltransferases and presumably involved in post-polyketide modification was identified downstream of the core biosynthetic gene cluster. The chivosazol biosynthetic gene locus belongs to the recently identified and rapidly growing class of trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases, which do not contain acyltransferase domains integrated into the multimodular megasynthetases.	1
Title: Synthesis of (+/-)-vibralactone Abstract: Reductive alkylation of methyl 2-methoxybenzoate with prenyl bromide and hydrolysis afforded methyl 6-oxo-1-prenyl-2-cyclohexenecarboxylate. Reduction of the ketone, hydrolysis, iodolactonization, ozonolysis, and intramolecular aldol reaction provided a spiro lactone cyclopentenal. Retro-iodolactonization with activated Zn, formation of the beta-lactone, and reduction of the aldehyde completed an efficient first synthesis of (+/-)-vibralactone. No protecting groups were used except for the novel use of an iodolactone to protect both the prenyl double bond and carboxylic acid.	0
Title: Understanding thioamitide biosynthesis using pathway engineering and untargeted metabolomics Abstract: Thiostreptamide S4 is a thioamitide, a family of promising antitumour ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The thioamitides are one of the most structurally complex RiPP families, yet very few thioamitide biosynthetic steps have been elucidated, even though the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of multiple thioamitides have been identified. We hypothesised that engineering the thiostreptamide S4 BGC in a heterologous host could provide insights into its biosynthesis when coupled with untargeted metabolomics and targeted mutations of the precursor peptide. Modified BGCs were constructed, and in-depth metabolomics enabled a detailed understanding of the biosynthetic pathway to thiostreptamide S4, including the identification of a protein critical for amino acid dehydration that has homology to HopA1, an effector protein used by a plant pathogen to aid infection. We use this biosynthetic understanding to bioinformatically identify diverse RiPP-like BGCs, paving the way for future RiPP discovery and engineering.	1
Title: Involvement of a chromomycin ABC transporter system in secretion of a deacetylated precursor during chromomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Chromomycin A(3) is an antitumour antibiotic that acts by inhibiting transcription and replication of DNA. The producer micro-organism Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus is highly resistant to chromomycin A(3) and to the structurally related compound mithramycin upon induction with chromomycin A(3). The biosynthetic gene cluster of chromomycin contains three genes involved in self-resistance to chromomycin in S. griseus: cmrA and cmrB encode a type I ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and cmrX encodes a UvrA-like protein of ABC excision nuclease systems. These genes are linked in the chromosome, together with a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor (cmmRII). Involvement of these genes in chromomycin resistance was determined through gene inactivation, and heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus. Inactivation of cmrX produced a chromomycin-sensitive low-producer strain, while inactivation of cmmRII generated a high-chromomycin-producer strain, which was resistant to chromomycin, and also to mithramycin. Expression of either cmrA and cmrB, or cmrX, in S. albus generated strains with low chromomycin resistance; it was therefore necessary to co-express the three genes to achieve high levels of resistance. However, the CmrAB ABC transporter conferred a high level of resistance to the biosynthesis intermediate 4A,4E-O-dideacetyl-chromomycin A(3). A model is proposed for the biosynthesis of, and self-resistance to, chromomycin A(3) in S. griseus subsp. griseus.	1
Title: Selective inactivation of a human neuronal silencing phosphatase by a small molecule inhibitor Abstract: The unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II dynamically regulates the process of transcription by recruiting different factors to nascent mRNA through its multiple phosphorylation patterns. A newly discovered class of phosphatases, the human small C-terminal domain phosphatases (Scp's), specifically dephosphorylates phosphorylated Ser(5) (phospho.Ser5) of the tandem heptad repeats of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Scp's also function as transcription regulators that epigenetically silence the expression of specific neuronal genes, whose inactivation leads to neuronal stem cell differentiation. Small molecule inhibitors of Scp's will be valuable for elucidating their mechanism in nervous system development and can possibly offer new strategies to treat diseases related to neurodegeneration. Despite the difficulty in developing selective inhibitors of protein phosphatases, we have recognized a characteristic hydrophobic binding pocket adjacent to the active site in Scp's that may facilitate selective inhibition. In the present study, we successfully identified the first selective lead compound, rabeprazole, for the Scp/TFIIF-interacting CTD phosphatase (Fcp) family. The high-resolution crystal structure of rabeprazole-bound Scp1 showed that the compound indeed binds to the hydrophobic binding pocket. We further confirmed that rabeprazole only targets Scp's but not its close family members Fcp1 and Dullard or bacteriophage λ Ser/Thr phosphatase. Such specificity may prove important for In Vivo studies since accidental inhibition of Fcp1 or Dullard would result in cell malfunctions and even cell death.	0
Title: Salivaricin G32, a Homolog of the Prototype Streptococcus pyogenes Nisin-Like Lantibiotic SA-FF22, Produced by the Commensal Species Streptococcus salivarius Abstract: Salivaricin G32, a 2667 Da novel member of the SA-FF22 cluster of lantibiotics, has been purified and characterized from Streptococcus salivarius strain G32. The inhibitory peptide differs from the Streptococcus pyogenes-produced SA-FF22 in the absence of lysine in position 2. The salivaricin G32 locus was widely distributed in BLIS-producing S. salivarius, with 6 (23%) of 26 strains PCR-positive for the structural gene, slnA. As for most other lantibiotics produced by S. salivarius, the salivaricin G32 locus can be megaplasmid encoded. Another member of the SA-FF22 family was detected in two Streptococcus dysgalactiae of bovine origin, an observation supportive of widespread distribution of this lantibiotic within the genus Streptococcus. Since the inhibitory spectrum of salivaricin G32 includes Streptococcus pyogenes, its production by S. salivarius, either as a member of the normal oral microflora or as a commercial probiotic, could serve to enhance protection of the human host against S. pyogenes infection.	1
Title: Expression analysis of the colibactin gene cluster coding for a novel polyketide in Escherichia coli Abstract: The recently described hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin, found in various Escherichia coli strains, invokes a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells upon cocultivation with these bacteria. However, not much is known so far about the transcriptional organization of the colibactin genes (clb) or the regulation of their transcription. Here, the operon structure of the colibactin gene cluster of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 was investigated by means of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and seven transcripts were found of which four are transcribed polycistronically. The polycistrons comprise the genes clbC to clbG, clbI to clbN, clbO to clbP, and clbR to clbA and span 6.3, 23.3, 3.9, and 0.9 kb, respectively. Furthermore, transcript levels for different cultivation conditions were determined by RT-PCR of the whole cluster as well as by luciferase reporter gene assays of the genes clbA, clbB, clbQ, and clbR. RT-PCR revealed an overall increased transcription in shaking cultures as well as of the genes clbA to clbH in general. Luciferase reporter gene fusions indicated an influence of the carbon source on clb gene expression.	1
Title: sarA-mediated repression of protease production plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 isolates Abstract: Mutation of staphylococcal accessory regulator (sarA) results in increased production of extracellular proteases in Staphylococcus aureus, which has been correlated with decreased biofilm formation and decreased accumulation of extracellular toxins. We used murine models of implant-associated biofilm infection and S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) to compare virulence of USA300 strain LAC, its isogenic sarA mutant, and derivatives of each of these strains with mutations in all 10 of the genes encoding recognized extracellular proteases. The sarA mutant was attenuated in both models, and this was reversed by eliminating production of extracellular proteases. To examine the mechanistic basis, we identified proteins impacted by sarA in a protease-dependent manner. We identified 253 proteins where accumulation was reduced in the sarA mutant compared with the parent strain, and was restored in the sarA/protease mutant. Additionally, in SAB, the LAC protease mutant exhibited a hypervirulent phenotype by comparison with the isogenic parent strain, demonstrating that sarA also positively regulates production of virulence factors, some of which are subject to protease-mediated degradation. We propose a model in which attenuation of sarA mutants is defined by their inability to produce critical factors and simultaneously repress production of extracellular proteases that would otherwise limit accumulation of virulence factors.	0
Title: Reduction of noise-stress-induced physiological damage by radices of Astragali and Rhodiolae: glycogen, lactic acid and cholesterol contents in liver of the rat Abstract: Noise is one of the factors that induces critical stress in animals. The contents of glycogen, lactic acid and cholesterol in the liver of noise-stressed rats were analyzed in order to investigate the alleviation of noise-stress-induced physiological damages by traditional medicine using Astragali and Rhodiolae radices. More than 95 dB noise ranging from 2 to 4 kHz reduced the contents of these compounds in the liver of rats not injected with the extract of Astragali or Rhodiolae, but did not change the contents in the liver of rats injected with the Astragali or Rhodiolae extract. These results show that noise induced stress in the rats via a decrease in contents of these compounds in the liver and that Astragali or Rhodiolae maintained the contents of these compounds in the liver of the noise-stressed rats. The results indicate that Astragali or Rhodiolae improved the ability for rats to resist noise stress.	0
Title: Nafcillin and oxacillin: comparative antistaphylococcal activity in mice Abstract: The therapeutic properties of nafcillin, oxacillin and erythromycin were determined in mice infected with a strain (Evans) of Staphylococcus aureus shown to be tolerant to the bactericidal action of penicillinase-resistant derivatives of penicillin. The therapeutic activity of these agents was also correlated with the extent of colonization of kidneys by resistant clones of S. aureus Evans. The CD50 values or potency ratios proved that nafcillin was highly active against this organism, whereas oxacillin and erythromycin were capable of protecting the animals to a lesser degree. Of the agents studied, only nafcillin was capable of preventing or interfering with the colonization of the kidneys by S. aureus Evans. Although the exact interpretation and application of these data in the management of clinical problems remains to be determined, the observations suggest important differences between nafcillin and oxacillin in vivo and that it is difficult to predict the antibacterial efficacy of these drugs solely from MIC and MBC data.	0
Title: Recurrent circuits within medial entorhinal cortex superficial layers support grid cell firing Abstract: Specialized cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), such as speed cells, head direction (HD) cells, and grid cells, are thought to support spatial navigation. To determine whether these computations are dependent on local circuits, we record neuronal activity in mEC layers II and III and optogenetically perturb locally projecting layer II pyramidal cells. We find that sharply tuned HD cells are only weakly responsive while speed, broadly tuned HD cells, and grid cells show pronounced transient excitatory and inhibitory responses. During the brief period of feedback inhibition, there is a reduction in specifically grid accuracy, which is corrected as firing rates return to baseline. These results suggest that sharp HD cells are embedded in a separate mEC sub-network from broad HD cells, speed cells, and grid cells. Furthermore, grid tuning is not only dependent on local processing but also rapidly updated by HD, speed, or other afferent inputs to mEC.	0
Title: Uncovering the biosynthetic potential of rare metagenomic DNA using co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences Abstract: Sequencing of DNA extracted from environmental samples can provide key insights into the biosynthetic potential of uncultured bacteria. However, the high complexity of soil metagenomes, which can contain thousands of bacterial species per gram of soil, imposes significant challenges to explore secondary metabolites potentially produced by rare members of the soil microbiome. Here, we develop a targeted sequencing workflow termed CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) that detects physically clustered biosynthetic domains, a hallmark of bacterial secondary metabolism. Following targeted amplification of conserved biosynthetic domains in a highly partitioned metagenomic library, CONKAT-seq evaluates amplicon co-occurrence patterns across library subpools to identify chromosomally clustered domains. We show that a single soil sample can contain more than a thousand uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which originate from low frequency genomes which are practically inaccessible through untargeted sequencing. CONKAT-seq allows scalable exploration of largely untapped biosynthetic diversity across multiple soils, and can guide the discovery of novel secondary metabolites from rare members of the soil microbiome.	1
Title: Linker Flexibility Facilitates Module Exchange in Fungal Hybrid PKS-NRPS Engineering Abstract: Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) each give rise to a vast array of complex bioactive molecules with further complexity added by the existence of natural PKS-NRPS fusions. Rational genetic engineering for the production of natural product derivatives is desirable for the purpose of incorporating new functionalities into pre-existing molecules, or for optimization of known bioactivities. We sought to expand the range of natural product diversity by combining modules of PKS-NRPS hybrids from different hosts, hereby producing novel synthetic natural products. We succeeded in the construction of a functional cross-species chimeric PKS-NRPS expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. Module swapping of the two PKS-NRPS natural hybrids CcsA from Aspergillus clavatus involved in the biosynthesis of cytochalasin E and related Syn2 from rice plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae lead to production of novel hybrid products, demonstrating that the rational re-design of these fungal natural product enzymes is feasible. We also report the structure of four novel pseudo pre-cytochalasin intermediates, niduclavin and niduporthin along with the chimeric compounds niduchimaeralin A and B, all indicating that PKS-NRPS activity alone is insufficient for proper assembly of the cytochalasin core structure. Future success in the field of biocombinatorial synthesis of hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides relies on the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of inter-modular polyketide chain transfer. Therefore, we expressed several PKS-NRPS linker-modified variants. Intriguingly, the linker anatomy is less complex than expected, as these variants displayed great tolerance with regards to content and length, showing a hitherto unreported flexibility in PKS-NRPS hybrids, with great potential for synthetic biology-driven biocombinatorial chemistry.	1
Title: Folding of the polyketide chain is not dictated by minimal polyketide synthase in the biosynthesis of mithramycin and anthracycline Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin, nogalamycin and aclacinomycins are aromatic polyketide antibiotics that exhibit antitumour activity. The precursors of these antibiotics are formed via a polyketide biosynthetic pathway in which acetate (for mithramycinone and nogalamycinone) or propionate (for aklavinone) is used as a starter unit and nine acetates are used as extender units. The assembly of building blocks is catalyzed by the minimal polyketide synthase (PKS). Further steps include regiospecific reductions (if any) and cyclization. In the biosynthesis of mithramycin, however, ketoreduction is omitted and the regiospecificity of the first cyclization differs from that of anthracycline antibiotics (e.g. nogalamycin and aclacinomycins). These significant differences provide a convenient means to analyze the determinants for the regiospecificity of the first cyclization step.                  Results:                       In order to analyze a possible role of the minimal PKS in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization in polyketide biosynthesis, we expressed the mtm locus, which includes mithramycin minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces galilaeus, which normally makes aclacinomycins, and the sno locus, which includes nogalamycin minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces argillaceus, which normally makes mithramycin. The host strains are defective in the minimal PKS, but they express other antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Expression of the sno minimal PKS in the S. argillaceus polyketide-deficient strain generated mithramycin production. Auramycins, instead of aclacinomycins, accumulated in the recombinant S. galilaeus strains, suggesting that the mithramycin minimal PKS is responsible for the choice of starter unit. We also describe structural analysis of the compounds accumulated by a ketoreductase-deficient S. galilaeus mutant; spectroscopic studies on the major polyketide compound that accumulated revealed a first ring closure which is not typical of anthracyclines, suggesting an important role for the ketoreductase in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization.                  Conclusions:                       These experiments clearly support the involvement of ketoreductase and a cyclase in the regiospecific cyclization of the biosynthetic pathway for aromatic polyketides.	1
Title: Physical mapping of the linear plasmid pSLA2-L and localization of the eryAI and actI homologs Abstract: The 200-kb linear plasmid pSLA2-L was suggested to be involved in the production of lankamycin and lankacidin in Streptomyces rochei 7434AN4. In this study, we have constructed a physical map for 23 PstI fragments of pSLA2-L, the sum of which was 206 kb. Detailed restriction maps for both ends of pSLA2-L revealed the presence of terminal inverted repeats, the size of which was found to be 2.1 kb by cloning and sequencing of the end-points. Hybridization experiments using two polyketide biosynthetic genes, eryAI and actI, located their homologous regions on PstI fragments A and I, respectively.	1
Title: Converting a binding protein into a biosensing conformational switch using protein fragment exchange Abstract: Biosensors can be used in applications ranging from identifying disease biomarkers to detecting spatial and temporal distributions of specific molecules in living cells. A major challenge facing biosensor development is how to functionally couple a biological recognition domain to an output module so that the binding event can be transduced to a visible and quantifiable signal [e.g., Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)]. Most designs achieve coupling by means of a binding protein that changes conformation upon interacting with its target. This approach is limited by the fact that few proteins possess such natural allosteric mechanisms, and for those that do, the conformational change is frequently not extensive enough to produce a large change in distance between FRET donor and acceptor groups. Here, we introduce protein fragment exchange (FREX) to address both problems. FREX employs two components: a folded binding protein and a fragment duplicated from it, the latter of which can be chosen from many possible fragments. The system is rationally tuned so that addition of ligand induces a conformational change in which the fragment exchanges positions with the corresponding segment of the binding protein. Placing fluorescent donor and acceptor groups on the binding protein and fragment reduces the background level of FRET of the unbound sensor, resulting in a ratiometric FRET response that is expected to be strong and reproducible from protein to protein. FREX is demonstrated using fibronectin III, a monobody binding scaffold that has been tailored to recognize multiple targets. Sensors labeled with Alexa FRET pairs exhibit ratiometric FRET changes of up to 8.6-fold and perform equally well in buffer and serum. A genetically encoded variant of this sensor is shown to be functional in cell lysates and in mammalian cell cultures.	0
Title: New aminocoumarins from the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928: identification, structure elucidation, and heterologous production Abstract: Genome mining led to the discovery of a novel aminocoumarin gene cluster in the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of genes putatively involved in export/resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin moiety and its halogenation, as well as several genes with so far unknown function. Two new aminocoumarins, cacibiocin A and B, were identified in the culture broth of C. acidiphila. Heterologous expression of the putative gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 confirmed that this cluster is responsible for cacibiocin biosynthesis. Furthermore, total production levels of cacibiocins could be increased by heterologous expression and screening of different culture media from an initial yield of 4.9 mg L(-1) in C. acidiphila to 60 mg L(-1) in S. coelicolor M1152. By HR-MS and NMR analysis, cacibiocin A was found to contain a 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety linked by an amide bond to a pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The latter structural motif has not been identified previously in any natural compound. Additionally, cacibiocin B contains two chlorine atoms at positions 6' and 8' of the aminocoumarin moiety.	1
Title: Characterization of Enzymes Catalyzing Transformations of Cysteine S-Conjugated Intermediates in the Lincosamide Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Lincosamides such as lincomycin A, celesticetin, and Bu-2545, constitute an important group of antibiotics. These natural products are characterized by a thiooctose linked to a l-proline residue, but they differ with regards to modifications of the thioacetal moiety, the pyrrolidine ring, and the octose core. Here we report that the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme CcbF (celesticetin biosynthetic pathway) is a decarboxylating deaminase that converts a cysteine S-conjugated intermediate into an aldehyde. In contrast, the homologous enzyme LmbF (lincomycin biosynthetic pathway) catalyzes C-S bond cleavage of the same intermediate to afford a thioglycoside. We show that Ccb4 and LmbG (downstream methyltransferases) convert the aldehyde and thiol intermediates into a variety of methylated lincosamide compounds including Bu-2545. The substrates used in these studies are the β-anomers of the natural substrates. The findings not only provide insight into how the biosynthetic pathway of lincosamide antibiotics can bifurcate to generate different lincosamides, but also reveal the promiscuity of the enzymes involved.	0
Title: Functional investigation of the chromosomal ccdAB and hipAB operon in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 Abstract: Toxin-antitoxin systems (TASs) have attracted much attention due to their important physiological functions. These small genetic factors have been widely studied mostly in commensal Escherichia coli strains, whereas the role of TASs in the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is still elusive. Here, the physiological role of chromosomally encoded type II TASs in EcN was examined. We showed that gene pair ECOLIN_00240-ECOLIN_00245 and ECOLIN_08365-ECOLIN_08370 were two functional TASs encoding CcdAB and HipAB, respectively. The homologs of CcdAB and HipAB were more conserved in E. coli species belonging to pathogenic groups, suggesting their important roles in EcN. CRISPRi-mediated repression of ccdAB and hipAB significantly reduced the biofilm formation of EcN in the stationary phase. Moreover, ccdAB and hipAB were shown to be responsible for the persister formation in EcN. Biofilm and persister formation of EcN controlled by the ccdAB and hipAB were associated with the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis, SOS response, and stringent response. Besides, CRISPRi was proposed to be an efficient tool in annotating multiple TASs simultaneously. Collectively, our results advance knowledge and understanding of the role of TASs in EcN, which will enhance the utility of EcN in probiotic therapy.Key points• Two TASs in EcN were identified as hipAB and ccdAB.• Knockdown of HipAB and CcdAB resulted in decreased biofilm formation of EcN.• Transcriptional silencing of hipAB and ccdAB affected the persister formation of EcN.• An attractive link between TASs and stress response was unraveled in EcN.• CRISPRi afforded a fast and in situ annotation of multiple TASs simultaneously.	0
Title: A non-canonical NRPS is involved in the synthesis of fungisporin and related hydrophobic cyclic tetrapeptides in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum harbors an astonishing variety of nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes, which encode proteins known to produce complex bioactive metabolites from simple building blocks. Here we report a novel non-canonical tetra-modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) with microheterogenicity of all involved adenylation domains towards their respective substrates. By deleting the putative gene in combination with comparative metabolite profiling various unique cyclic and derived linear tetrapeptides were identified which were associated with this NRPS, including fungisporin. In combination with substrate predictions for each module, we propose a mechanism for a 'trans-acting' adenylation domain.	1
Title: Effect of Temperature-Shift and Temperature-Constant Cultivation on the Monacolin K Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Expression in Monascus sp Abstract: In this study, the effects of temperature-shift (from 30 to 25 °C) and temperature-constant (at 30 °C) cultivation on the mass of Monascus fuliginosus CG-6 mycelia and concentration of the produced monacolin K (MK) were monitored. The expression levels of the MK biosynthetic genes of M. fuliginosus CG-6 at constant and variable culture temperatures were analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The total protein was collected and determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results showed that the maximum mycelial mass in temperature-shift cultivation was only 0.477 g of dry cell mass per dish, which was lower than that in temperature-constant cultivation (0.581 g of dry cell mass per dish); however, the maximum concentration of MK in temperature-shift cultivation (34.5 µg/mL) was 16 times higher than that in temperature-constant cultivation at 30 °C (2.11 µg/mL). Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of the MK biosynthetic gene cluster at culture temperature of 25 °C was higher than that at 30 °C, which was similar to the trend of the MK concentration, except for individual MK B and MK C genes. Analysis of differential protein expression revealed that 2016 proteins were detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The expression level of efflux pump protein coded by the MK I gene exhibited the same upregulated trend as the expression of MK I in temperature-shift cultivation. Temperature-shift cultivation enhanced the expression of proteins in the secondary metabolite production pathway, but suppressed the expression of proteins involved in the mycelial growth.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Cyclochlorotine: Identification of the Genes Involved in Oxidative Transformations and Intramolecular O, N-Transacylation Abstract: Mycotoxin cyclochlorotine (1) and structurally related astins are cyclic pentapeptides containing unique nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as β-phenylalanine, l-allo-threonine, and 3,4-dichloroproline. Herein, we report the biosynthetic pathway for 1, which involves intriguing tailoring processes mediated by DUF3328 proteins, including stereo- and regiospecific chlorination and hydroxylation and intramolecular O,N-transacylation. Our findings demonstrate that DUF3328 proteins, which are known to be involved in oxidative cyclization of fungal ribosomal peptides, have much higher functional diversity than previously expected.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of genes responsible for biosynthesis of kojic acid, an industrially important compound from Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Kojic acid is produced in large amounts by Aspergillus oryzae as a secondary metabolite and is widely used in the cosmetic industry. Glucose can be converted to kojic acid, perhaps by only a few steps, but no genes for the conversion have thus far been revealed. Using a DNA microarray, gene expression profiles under three pairs of conditions significantly affecting kojic acid production were compared. All genes were ranked using an index parameter reflecting both high amounts of transcription and a high induction ratio under producing conditions. After disruption of nine candidate genes selected from the top of the list, two genes of unknown function were found to be responsible for kojic acid biosynthesis, one having an oxidoreductase motif and the other a transporter motif. These two genes are closely associated in the genome, showing typical characteristics of genes involved in secondary metabolism.	1
Title: Genetic localization and in vivo characterization of a Monascus azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Monascus spp. produce several well-known polyketides such as monacolin K, citrinin, and azaphilone pigments. In this study, the azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster was identified through T-DNA random mutagenesis in Monascus purpureus. The albino mutant W13 bears a T-DNA insertion upstream of a transcriptional regulator gene (mppR1). The transcription of mppR1 and the nearby polyketide synthase gene (MpPKS5) was significantly repressed in the W13 mutant. Targeted inactivation of MpPKS5 also gave rise to an albino mutant, confirming that mppR1 and MpPKS5 belong to an azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster. This M. purpureus sequence was used to identify the whole biosynthetic gene cluster in the Monascus pilosus genome. MpPKS5 contains SAT/KS/AT/PT/ACP/MT/R domains, and this domain organization is preserved in other azaphilone polyketide synthases. This biosynthetic gene cluster also encodes fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is predicted to assist the synthesis of 3-oxooactanoyl-CoA and 3-oxodecanoyl-CoA. These 3-oxoacyl compounds are proposed to be incorporated into the azaphilone backbone to complete the pigment biosynthesis. A monooxygenase gene (an azaH and tropB homolog) that is located far downstream of the FAS gene is proposed to be involved in pyrone ring formation. A homology search on other fungal genome sequences suggests that this azaphilone pigment gene cluster also exists in the Penicillium marneffei and Talaromyces stipitatus genomes.	1
Title: Identification of deoxynivalenol- and nivalenol-producing chemotypes of Gibberella zeae by using PCR Abstract: Gibberella zeae, a major cause of cereal scab, may be divided into two chemotypes based on production of the trichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). We cloned and sequenced the gene cluster for trichothecene biosynthesis from each chemotype. G. zeae H-11 is a DON producer isolated from corn, and G. zeae 88-1 is a NIV producer from barley. We sequenced a 23-kb gene cluster from H-11 and a 26-kb cluster from 88-1, along with the unlinked Tri101 genes. Each gene cluster contained 10 Tri gene homologues in the same order and transcriptional directions as those of Fusarium sporotrichioides. Between H-11 and 88-1 all of the Tri homologues except Tri7 were conserved, with identities ranging from 88 to 98% and 82 to 99% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The Tri7 sequences were only 80% identical at the nucleotide level. We aligned the Tri7 genes and found that the Tri7 open reading frame of H-11 carried several mutations and an insertion containing 10 copies of an 11-bp tandem repeat. The Tri7 gene from 88-1 carried neither the repeat nor the mutations. We assayed 100 G. zeae isolates of both chemotypes by PCR amplification with a primer pair derived from the Tri7 gene and could differentiate the chemotypes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PCR-based method developed in this study should provide a simple and reliable diagnostic tool for differentiating the two chemotypes of G. zeae.	1
Title: Bioorthogonal dissection of the replicase assembly of hepatitis C virus Abstract: Positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), flaviviruses, and coronaviruses are medically important. Assembly of replicase on host membranes is a conserved replication strategy and an attractive antiviral target. The mechanisms of replicase assembly are largely unknown, due to the technical difficulties in purifying the replicase and carrying out structural studies. Here, with an HCV replicase assembly surrogate system, we employed a bioorthogonal system to introduce the photolabile unnatural amino into each residue in the cytosolic regions of NS4B and the amphipathic helix (AH) of NS5A. Photocrosslinking enabled visualization of NS4B oligomerization and NS5A dimerization at pinpointed interacting residues and identifying contacting sites among the replicase components. Characterization of the interacting sites revealed hub elements in replicase assembly by docking replicase components to prompt protein-protein interactions. The results provide information about the molecular architecture of the replicase, advancing understanding of the mechanism of replicase assembly.	0
Title: Highly efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols to ketones and aldehydes with diaziridinone Abstract: A novel and efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols has been achieved with di-tert-butyldiaziridinone as the oxidant under mild conditions. A wide variety of primary and secondary alcohols with various functional groups can be oxidized to aldehydes and ketones in high yields. The reaction proceeds under neutral conditions making it compatible with acid- or base-sensitive substrates, and it is amenable to gram scale.	0
Title: Heterologous expression and manipulation of three tetracycline biosynthetic pathways Abstract: A very accommodating host: Three tetracycline biosynthetic pathways were overexpressed and manipulated in the heterologous host Streptomyces lividans K4-114. Through the inactivation of various genes and characterization of the resulting biosynthetic intermediates, new tetracycline-modifying enzymes were identified (see scheme).	1
Title: A new antimitotic substance, FR182877. III. Structure determination Abstract: During the course of screening for novel cell cycle inhibitors, FR182877 was isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp. No.9885. During the NMR measurements, FR182877 decomposed so much that the structure elucidation of FR182877 itself was difficult. Then, combinations of chemical correlations and spectroscopic methods clarified that FR182877 possesses an unprecedented multi-ring system including the strained double bond, which was unexpectedly epoxidized by molecular oxygen. FR182877 showed broad antitumor activities in vitro and promoted assemblies of tublins in vitro as well as taxol. It is noteworthy that epoxidation of the distorted double bond resulted in significant decrease in antitumor activities.	0
Title: Near-real-time analysis of the phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli to 1-butanol exposure using Raman Spectroscopy Abstract: Raman spectroscopy was used to study the time course of phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli (DH5α) to 1-butanol exposure (1.2% [vol/vol]). Raman spectroscopy is of interest for bacterial phenotyping because it can be performed (i) in near real time, (ii) with minimal sample preparation (label-free), and (iii) with minimal spectral interference from water. Traditional off-line analytical methodologies were applied to both 1-butanol-treated and control cells to draw correlations with Raman data. Here, distinct sets of Raman bands are presented that characterize phenotypic traits of E. coli with maximized correlation to off-line measurements. In addition, the observed time course phenotypic responses of E. coli to 1.2% (vol/vol) 1-butanol exposure included the following: (i) decreased saturated fatty acids levels, (ii) retention of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cyclopropane fatty acids, (iii) increased membrane fluidity following the initial response of increased rigidity, and (iv) no changes in total protein content or protein-derived amino acid composition. For most phenotypic traits, correlation coefficients between Raman spectroscopy and traditional off-line analytical approaches exceeded 0.75, and major trends were captured. The results suggest that near-real-time Raman spectroscopy is suitable for approximating metabolic and physiological phenotyping of bacterial cells subjected to toxic environmental conditions.	0
Title: The capsule biosynthetic locus of Pasteurella multocida A:1 Abstract: Pasteurella multocida is the aetiological agent of fowl cholera, bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia and atrophic rhinitis in pigs. Many strains of P. multocida express a capsule on their surface. However, nothing is known about the capsule biosynthetic locus in P. multocida although the capsule has been implicated as a virulence factor. The entire capsule locus of P. multocida A:1 was cloned and sequenced. The locus is divided into three regions. Region 1 comprises four ORFs which are involved in the transport of the capsule polysaccharide to the surface. Region 2 comprises five ORFs whose postulated protein products are involved in the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide capsule. Region 3 comprises two ORFs whose postulated products show similarity to proteins that are involved in the phospholipid substitution of the polysaccharide capsule.	1
Title: Efficient disruption of a polyketide synthase gene ( pks1) required for melanin synthesis through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Glarea lozoyensis produces pneumocandin B(0), a potent inhibitor of fungal glucan synthesis. This industrially important filamentous fungus is slow-growing, is very darkly pigmented, and has not been easy to manipulate genetically. Using a PCR strategy to survey the G. lozoyensis genome for polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, we have identified pks1, a gene that consists of five exons interrupted by four introns of 56, 400, 50 and 341 bp. It encodes a 2124-amino acid protein with five catalytic modules: ketosynthase, acyltransferase, two acyl carrier sites, and thioesterase/Claisen cyclase. The transcriptional initiation and termination sites were found 43 bp upstream of the translational start codon and 295 bp downstream of the translational stop codon, respectively. Cluster analysis of 37 fungal ketosynthase modules grouped the Pks1p with PKSs involved in the biosynthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. Disruption of pks1 yielded knockout mutants that displayed an albino phenotype, suggesting that pks1 encodes a tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase. Gene replacement was achieved by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which proved to be simple and efficient. Loss of pigmentation occurred in more than half the transformants, and examination of six non-pigmented transformants showed that the functional genomic copy of the pks1 gene had been replaced by the disruption cassette in each case. A putative 1215-bp ORF (dsg) devoid of introns was present downstream from pks1. BLAST analysis of the 405-amino acid sequence of its predicted product showed a high degree of similarity with Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) binuclear cluster DNA-binding proteins, a class of fungal transcription factors involved in the regulation of polyketide production and other pathways.	1
Title: Discovery of Pyranoviolin A and Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Aspergillus violaceofuscus Abstract: A new polyketide-non-ribosomal peptide hybrid molecule, pyranoviolin A (1), was discovered from the genome-sequenced fungus Aspergillus violaceofuscus CBS 115571 and was characterized to be the first pyranonigrin analog harboring the C-3 methoxy group. Examination of the genome sequence of the fungus identified a putative biosynthetic gene cluster of 1, which was designated as the pyv cluster. The gene deletion experiment of the polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid gene in the cluster confirmed the involvement of the pyv cluster in the pyranoviolin A biosynthesis. Finally, a plausible biosynthetic route leading to 1 has been proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis. Our study indicates that metabolite analysis of genome-sequenced microorganisms whose metabolites have been largely unexplored facilitates the discovery of new secondary metabolites along with their biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. VI. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral efficacy in mice of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)-acetamido]-3- (substituted alkylthio)cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted alkylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephem nucleus were prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats. Of these, the cephalosporin with a cyanomethylthio group (1a) showed the greatest activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Its pivaloyloxymethyl ester (6a), a representative prodrug, exhibited good in vivo efficacy in mice by oral administration. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Magnetic Ligand Fishing as a Targeting Tool for HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR: α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Ligands and Alkylresorcinol Glycosides from Eugenia catharinae Abstract: A bioanalytical platform combining magnetic ligand fishing for α-glucosidase inhibition profiling and HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for structural identification of α-glucosidase inhibitory ligands, both directly from crude plant extracts, is presented. Magnetic beads with N-terminus-coupled α-glucosidase were synthesized and characterized for their inherent catalytic activity. Ligand fishing with the immobilized enzyme was optimized using an artificial test mixture consisting of caffeine, ferulic acid, and luteolin before proof-of-concept with the crude extract of Eugenia catharinae. The combination of ligand fishing and HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR identified myricetin 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol as α-glucosidase inhibitory ligands in E. catharinae. Furthermore, HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR analysis led to identification of six new alkylresorcinol glycosides, i.e., 5-(2-oxopentyl)resorcinol 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5-propylresorcinol 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5-pentylresorcinol 4-O-[α-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5-pentylresorcinol 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, 4-hydroxy-3-O-methyl-5-pentylresorcinol 1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and 3-O-methyl-5-pentylresorcinol 1-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside.	0
Title: Shared PKS Module in Biosynthesis of Synergistic Laxaphycins Abstract: Cyanobacteria produce a wide range of lipopeptides that exhibit potent membrane-disrupting activities. Laxaphycins consist of two families of structurally distinct macrocyclic lipopeptides that act in a synergistic manner to produce antifungal and antiproliferative activities. Laxaphycins are produced by range of cyanobacteria but their biosynthetic origins remain unclear. Here, we identified the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of the laxaphycins produced by Scytonema hofmannii PCC 7110. We show that these laxaphycins, called scytocyclamides, are produced by this cyanobacterium and are encoded in a single biosynthetic gene cluster with shared polyketide synthase enzymes initiating two distinct non-ribosomal peptide synthetase pathways. The unusual mechanism of shared enzymes synthesizing two distinct types of products may aid future research in identifying and expressing natural product biosynthetic pathways and in expanding the known biosynthetic logic of this important family of natural products.	1
Title: Cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in an acidophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The cytoplasmic buffering capacity of Thiobacillus acidophilus (along with membrane properties) is responsible for the cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in metabolically compromised cells. When a large influx of H+ occurs, the cytoplasmic buffering capacity prevents drastic changes in pH; in addition, this influx, by increasing the positive membrane potential, eventually leads to a cessation of further H+ influx.	0
Title: Identification of a napsamycin biosynthesis gene cluster by genome mining Abstract: Napsamycins are potent inhibitors of bacterial translocase I, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and are classified as uridylpeptide antibiotics. They comprise an N-methyl diaminobutyric acid, an ureido group, a methionine and two non-proteinogenic aromatic amino acid residues in a peptide backbone that is linked to a 5'-amino-3'-deoxyuridine by an unusual enamide bond. The napsamycin gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. DSM5940 by using PCR probes from a putative uridylpeptide biosynthetic cluster found in S. roseosporus NRRL15998 by genome mining. Annotation revealed 29 hypothetical genes encoding for resistance, regulation and biosynthesis of the napsamycins. Analysis of the gene cluster indicated that the peptide core structure is assembled by a nonlinear non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like mechanism that involves several discrete single or didomain proteins. Some genes could be assigned, for example, to the synthesis of the N-methyl diaminobutyric acid, to the generation of m-tyrosine and to the reduction of the uracil moiety. The heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1154 resulted in the production of napsamycins and mureidomycins as demonstrated by LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis. The napsamycin gene cluster provides a molecular basis for the detailed study of the biosynthesis of this class of structurally unusual compounds.	1
Title: The genome analysis of Candidatus Burkholderia crenata reveals that secondary metabolism may be a key function of the Ardisia crenata leaf nodule symbiosis Abstract: A majority of Ardisia species harbour Burkholderia sp. bacteria within specialized leaf nodules. The bacteria are transmitted hereditarily and have not yet been cultured outside of their host. Because the plants cannot develop beyond the seedling stage without their symbionts, the symbiosis is considered obligatory. We sequenced for the first time the genome of Candidatus Burkholderia crenata (Ca. B. crenata), the leaf nodule symbiont of Ardisia crenata. The genome of Ca. B. crenata is the smallest Burkholderia genome to date. It contains a large amount of insertion sequences and pseudogenes and displays features consistent with reductive genome evolution. The genome does not encode functions commonly associated with plant symbioses such as nitrogen fixation and plant hormone metabolism. However, we identified unique genes with a predicted role in secondary metabolism in the genome of Ca. B. crenata. Specifically, we provide evidence that the bacterial symbionts are responsible for the synthesis of compound FR900359, a cyclic depsipeptide with biomedical properties previously isolated from leaves of A. crenata.	1
Title: Peniphenone and Penilactone Formation in Penicillium crustosum via 1,4-Michael Additions of ortho-Quinone Methide from Hydroxyclavatol to γ-Butyrolactones from Crustosic Acid Abstract: Penilactones A and B consist of a γ-butyrolactone and two clavatol moieties. We identified two separate gene clusters for the biosynthesis of these key building blocks in Penicillium crustosum. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and biochemical investigations proved that a nonreducing PKS ClaF is responsible for the formation of clavatol and the PKS-NRPS hybrid TraA is involved in the formation of crustosic acid, which undergoes decarboxylation and isomerization to the predominant terrestric acid. Both acids are proposed to be converted to γ-butyrolactones with involvement of a cytochrome P450 ClaJ. Oxidation of clavatol to hydroxyclavatol by a nonheme FeII/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase ClaD and its spontaneous dehydration to an ortho-quinone methide initiate the two nonenzymatic 1,4-Michael addition steps. Spontaneous addition of the methide to the γ-butyrolactones led to peniphenone D and penilactone D, which undergo again stereospecific attacking by methide to give penilactones A/B.	1
Title: Facile photocyclization chemistry of 5-phenylthio-2'-deoxyuridine in duplex DNA Abstract: We report here the synthesis of 5-phenylthio-2'-deoxyuridine (d(PhS)U), its incorporation into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), and its photocyclization chemistry. Irradiation of dinucleoside monophosphate d((PhS)UG) and d(PhS)U-bearing duplex ODNs with 254 nm light results in the facile formation of a cyclic product where the C6 of uracil is covalently bonded to the C2 of the phenyl ring. The chemistry reported here may serve as the basis for the efficient preparation of a new class of duplex DNA with an extended pi system. [reaction: see text]	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Okaramines That Target Insect Glutamate-Gated Chloride Channels Abstract: Prenylated indole alkaloid okaramines selectively target insect glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls). Because of their highly complex structures, including azocine and azetidine rings, total synthesis of okaramine A or B has not been achieved, preventing evaluation of the biological activities of okaramines. Biosynthetic approaches provide alternatives to accessing structurally diverse derivatives and enabling the elucidation of structure-activity relationships. To explore the biosynthetic potential of okaramines, gene knockout experiments of an okaramine-producer fungus were performed. The deletion mutants of the oxygenase genes okaB, okaD, okaE, and okaG provided analogues that were unlikely to be accumulated in the normal biosynthetic process of the wild-type strain. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships of okaramines collected from the fungal cultures revealed that 1,4-dihydroazocine and N-aliphatic group attached to the indole were crucial for GluCl-activating activity. This provided insights into further derivatization of the complex structure of okaramines in order to facilitate the development of new insecticides.	1
Title: Regulation of intron function: efficient splicing in vivo of a bacterial group II intron requires a functional promoter within the intron Abstract: Conjugative transfer of the Lactococcus lactis plasmid pRS01 requires splicing of a group II intron, Ll.ltrB, for accurate translation of the mRNA for the exon gene ltrB. The protein product of ltrB is a conjugative relaxase, essential for pRS01 transfer. Using a molecular technique for the identification of transcription initiation sites in bacteria, a functional promoter within Ll.ltrB was identified upstream from the gene for the intron-encoded protein (IEP) LtrA. LtrA is required for efficient splicing of Ll.ltrB in vivo. Mutation of the ltrA promoter dramatically reduced the steady-state level of ltrA mRNA, LtrA, intron splicing and conjugation in L. lactis. These effects could be relieved by expression in trans of the ltrA gene cloned under the control of an inducible promoter. These results suggest that the ltrA mRNAs are translated inefficiently. We hypothesize that this bacterial intron, in contrast to previously studied group II introns in eukaryotes, requires a promoter within the intron to regulate ltrA expression and to produce an adequate level of the protein in the cell for efficient splicing.	0
Title: Structure of the nucleotide radical formed during reaction of CDP/TTP with the E441Q-alpha2beta2 of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase Abstract: The Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleotides and requires a diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor for catalysis. RNR is composed of a 1:1 complex of two homodimeric subunits: alpha and beta. Incubation of the E441Q-alpha mutant RNR with substrate CDP and allosteric effector TTP results in loss of the tyrosyl radical and formation of two new radicals on the 200 ms to min time scale. The first radical was previously established by stopped flow UV/vis spectroscopy and pulsed high field EPR spectroscopy to be a disulfide radical anion. The second radical was proposed to be a 4'-radical of a 3'-keto-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate. To identify the structure of the nucleotide radical [1'-(2)H], [2'-(2)H], [4'-(2)H], [5'-(2)H], [U-(13)C, (15)N], [U-(15)N], and [5,6 -(2)H] CDP and [beta-(2)H] cysteine-alpha were synthesized and incubated with E441Q-alpha2beta2 and TTP. The nucleotide radical was examined by 9 GHz and 140 GHz pulsed EPR spectroscopy and 35 GHz ENDOR spectroscopy. Substitution of (2)H at C4' and C1' altered the observed hyperfine interactions of the nucleotide radical and established that the observed structure was not that predicted. DFT calculations (B3LYP/IGLO-III/B3LYP/TZVP) were carried out in an effort to recapitulate the spectroscopic observations and lead to a new structure consistent with all of the experimental data. The results indicate, unexpectedly, that the radical is a semidione nucleotide radical of cytidine 5'-diphosphate. The relationship of this radical to the disulfide radical anion is discussed.	0
Title: Fungal Epithiodiketopiperazines Carrying α,β-Polysulfide Bridges from Penicillium steckii YE, and Their Chemical Interconversion Abstract: Some fungal epithiodiketopiperazine alkaloids display α,β-polysulfide bridges alongside diverse structural variations. However, the logic of their chemical diversity has rarely been explored. Here, we report the identification of three new (2, 3, 8) and five known (1, 4-7) epithiodiketopiperazines of this subtype from a marine-derived Penicillium sp. The structure elucidation was supported by multiple spectroscopic analyses. Importantly, we observed multiple nonenzymatic interconversions of these analogues in aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Furthermore, the same biosynthetic origin of these compounds was supported by one mined gene cluster. The dominant analogue (1) demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells and HIF-depleted colorectal cells and mild antiaging activities, linking the bioactivity to oxidative stress. These results provide crucial insight into the formation of fungal epithiodiketopiperazines through chemical interconversions.	1
Title: Organization of a cluster of erythromycin genes in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: We used a series of gene disruptions and gene replacements to mutagenically characterize 30 kilobases of DNA in the erythromycin resistance gene (ermE) region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea chromosome. Five previously undiscovered loci involved in the biosynthesis of erythromycin were found, eryBI, eryBII, eryCI, eryCII, and eryH; and three known loci, eryAI, eryG, and ermE, were further characterized. The new Ery phenotype, EryH, was marked by (i) the accumulation of the intermediate 6-deoxyerythronolide B (DEB), suggesting a defect in the operation of the C-6 hydroxylase system, and (ii) a block in the synthesis or addition reactions for the first sugar group. Analyses of ermE mutants indicated that ermE is the only gene required for resistance to erythromycin, and that it is not required for production of the intermediate erythronolide B (EB) or for conversion of the intermediate 3-alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B (MEB) to erythromycin. Mutations in the eryB and eryC loci were similar to previously reported chemically induced eryB and eryC mutations blocking synthesis or attachment of the two erythromycin sugar groups. Insertion mutations in eryAI, the macrolactone synthetase, defined the largest (at least 9-kilobase) transcription unit of the cluster. These mutants help to define the physical organization of the erythromycin gene cluster, and the eryH mutants provide a source for the production of the intermediate DEB.	1
Title: Migrastatin and dorrigocins are shunt metabolites of iso-migrastatin Abstract: Fermentation of Streptomyces platensis NRRL18993 typically accumulated migrastation (1), dorrigocin A (2) and B (3), and 13-epi-dorrigocin A (5). Supplement of XAD-16 resin to the fermentation, in contrast, resulted in exclusive production of iso-migrastatin (4). In vitro studies showed that 1, 2, 3, and 5 are stable in aqueous solution but 4 undergoes rapid conversion into 1, 2, 3, and 5 under the same condition. These results revealed that 4 is the only bona fide natural product biosynthesized by S. platensis, and 1, 2, 3, and 5 are shunt metabolites of 4. This study also established the stereochemistry of 2-5 with the exception of C-11 for 3 and 4. A mechanism for H2O-mediated regio- and stereospecific rearrangement of 4 to 1, 2, 3, and 5 is proposed and supported by incorporation of 18O from H218O.	1
Title: Reconstitution of the FK228 biosynthetic pathway reveals cross talk between modular polyketide synthases and fatty acid synthase Abstract: Functional cross talk between fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism has been discovered in several cases in microorganisms; none of them, however, involves a modular biosynthetic enzyme. Previously, we reported a hybrid modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway for the biosynthesis of FK228 anticancer depsipeptide in Chromobacterium violaceum strain 968. This pathway contains two PKS modules on the DepBC enzymes that lack a functional acyltransferase (AT) domain, and no apparent AT-encoding gene exists within the gene cluster or its vicinity. We report here that, through reconstitution of the FK228 biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli cells, two essential genes, fabD1 and fabD2, both encoding a putative malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) acyltransferase component of the fatty acid synthase complex, are positively identified to be involved in FK228 biosynthesis. Either gene product appears sufficient to complement the AT-less PKS modules on DepBC for polyketide chain elongation. Concurrently, a gene (sfp) encoding a putative Sfp-type phosphopantetheinyltransferase was identified to be necessary for FK228 biosynthesis as well. Most interestingly, engineered E. coli strains carrying variable genetic components produced significant levels of FK228 under both aerobic and anaerobic cultivation conditions. Discovery of the trans complementation of modular PKSs by housekeeping ATs reveals natural product biosynthesis diversity. Moreover, demonstration of anaerobic production of FK228 by an engineered facultative bacterial strain validates our effort toward the engineering of novel tumor-targeting bioagents.	1
Title: Characterization of an autoinhibitory domain in human mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-activated protein kinase 2, a Ser/Thr kinase, is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase. Sequence analysis of a clone isolated from the human HL-60 cell line revealed a 370-amino acid protein with a proline-rich N terminus, a highly conserved catalytic domain, and a C-terminal region containing a MAP kinase phosphorylation site. To better understand how the kinase is regulated, mutation analysis was used to map the functional domain(s). The wild type recombinant kinase had a low basal activity as detected by phosphorylation of a substrate peptide derived from the N terminus of glycogen synthase. Deletion of the proline-rich N terminus showed little effect on the basal activity. Deletion of the C terminus resulted in a marked increase in catalytic activity either with or without the pretreatment of the kinase by MAP kinase. Further analysis indicated that amino acid residues 339-353 in the C-terminal region were acting as an autoinhibitory domain. A synthetic peptide (RVLKEDKERWEDVK-amide) derived from this autoinhibitory domain inhibited the kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest a regulatory model for the kinase.	0
Title: Small-molecule suppressors of Candida albicans biofilm formation synergistically enhance the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against clinical Candida isolates Abstract: A new class of fungal biofilm inhibitors represented by shearinines D (3) and E (4) were obtained from a Penicillium sp. isolate. The inhibitory activities of 3 and 4 were characterized using a new imaging flow-cytometer technique, which enabled the rapid phenotypic analysis of Candida albicans cell types (budding yeast cells, germ tube cells, pseudohyphae, and hyphae) in biofilm populations. The results were confirmed by experimental data obtained from three-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy and 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assays. These data indicate that 3 and 4 inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation by blocking the outgrowth of hyphae at a relatively late stage of biofilm development (IC50 = 8.5 and 7.6 μM, respectively). However, 3 and 4 demonstrated comparatively weak activity at disrupting existing biofilms. Compounds 3 and 4 also exhibited synergistic activities with amphotericin B against C. albicans and other clinical Candida isolates by enhancing the potency of amphotericin B up to 8-fold against cells in both developing and established biofilms. These data suggest that the Candida biofilm disruption and amphotericin B potentiating effects of 3 and 4 could be mediated through multiple biological targets. The shearinines are good tools for testing the potential advantages of using adjunctive therapies in combination with antifungals.	0
Title: Integration of Chemical, Genetic, and Bioinformatic Approaches Delineates Fungal Polyketide-Peptide Hybrid Biosynthesis Abstract: To identify natural products and their associated biosynthetic genes from underutilized, difficult-to-manipulate microbes, chemical screening and bioinformatic analysis were employed to identify secondary metabolites and a potentially associated biosynthetic gene cluster. Subsequently, a heterologous expression system was used to confirm the identity of the gene cluster and the proposed biosynthetic mechanism. This approach successfully identified the curvupallide and spirostaphylotrichin biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungus Curvularia pallescens and the short-chain pyranonigrin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus niger.	1
Title: Baikalomycins A-C, New Aquayamycin-Type Angucyclines Isolated from Lake Baikal Derived Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A Abstract: Natural products produced by bacteria found in unusual and poorly studied ecosystems, such as Lake Baikal, represent a promising source of new valuable drug leads. Here we report the isolation of a new Streptomyces sp. strain IB201691-2A from the Lake Baikal endemic mollusk Benedictia baicalensis. In the course of an activity guided screening three new angucyclines, named baikalomycins A-C, were isolated and characterized, highlighting the potential of poorly investigated ecological niches. Besides that, the strain was found to accumulate large quantities of rabelomycin and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin, known shunt products in angucyclines biosynthesis. Baikalomycins A-C demonstrated varying degrees of anticancer activity. Rabelomycin and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin further demonstrated antiproliferative activities. The structure elucidation showed that baikalomycin A is a modified aquayamycin with β-d-amicetose and two additional hydroxyl groups at unusual positions (6a and 12a) of aglycone. Baikalomycins B and C have alternating second sugars attached, α-l-amicetose and α-l-aculose, respectively. The gene cluster for baikalomycins biosynthesis was identified by genome mining, cloned using a transformation-associated recombination technique and successfully expressed in S. albus J1074. It contains a typical set of genes responsible for an angucycline core assembly, all necessary genes for the deoxy sugars biosynthesis, and three genes coding for the glycosyltransferase enzymes. Heterologous expression and deletion experiments allowed to assign the function of glycosyltransferases involved in the decoration of baikalomycins aglycone.	1
Title: Selective Usage of Isozymes for Stress Response Abstract: Isozymes are enzymes with similar sequences that catalyze the same reaction in a given species. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most isozymes have major isoforms with high expression levels and minor isoforms with little expression under normal growth conditions. In a proteomic study aimed at identifying yeast protein regulated by rapamycin, we found an interesting phenomenon, that, for several metabolic enzymes, the major isozymes are downregulated while the minor isozymes are upregulated. Through enzymological and biochemical studies, we demonstrate that a rapamycin-upregulated enolase isozyme (ENO1) favors gluconeogenesis and a rapamycin-upregulated alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme (ALD4) promotes the reduction of NAD+ to NADH (instead of NADP+ to NADPH). Gene deletion study in yeast showed that the ENO1 and ALD4 are important for yeast survival under less-favorable growth conditions. Therefore, our study highlights the different metabolic needs of cells under different conditions and how nature chooses different isozymes to fit the metabolic needs.	0
Title: Biological activity of cadeguomycin. Inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, immunostimulation, and potentiation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine Abstract: Cadeguomycin retarded growth of sc solid IMC carcinoma in CDF1 mice, and pulmonary metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BL/6 mice. The antibiotic enhanced phagocytic activity of murine peritoneal macrophages and IL-1 production by P388D1 cells. Delayed type hypersensitivity was stimulated and interferon was induced by the drug. The results suggest that cadeguomycin inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in association with modification of the immune system. The cytotoxicity of arabinosylcytosine to K562 and YAC-1 cells was markedly enhanced by cadeguomycin in culture. The combined administration of arabinosylcytosine and cadeguomycin displayed potentiation in the inhibition of growth of ip-implanted P388 leukemia and metastasis of sc-implanted P388 leukemia to the regional lymph nodes. Cadeguomycin showed low toxicity for mice.	0
Title: High-speed atomic force microscopy highlights new molecular mechanism of daptomycin action Abstract: The increase in speed of the high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) compared to that of the conventional AFM made possible the first-ever visualisation at the molecular-level of the activity of an antimicrobial peptide on a membrane. We investigated the medically prescribed but poorly understood lipopeptide Daptomycin under infection-like conditions (37 °C, bacterial lipid composition and antibiotic concentrations). We confirmed so far hypothetical models: Dap oligomerization and the existence of half pores. Moreover, we detected unknown molecular mechanisms: new mechanisms to form toroidal pores or to resist Dap action, and to unprecedently quantify the energy profile of interacting oligomers. Finally, the biological and medical relevance of the findings was ensured by a multi-scale multi-nativeness-from the molecule to the cell-correlation of molecular-level information from living bacteria (Bacillus subtilis strains) to liquid-suspended vesicles and supported-membranes using electron and optical microscopies and the lipid tension probe FliptR, where we found that the cells with a healthier state of their cell wall show smaller membrane deformations.	0
Title: Characterization and analysis of the regulatory network involved in control of lipomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 Abstract: Analysis of the alpha-lipomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 led to the identification of five putative regulatory genes, which are congregated into a subcluster. Analysis of the lipReg1-4 and lipX1 showed that they encode components of two-component signal transduction systems (LipReg1 and LipReg2), multiple antibiotics resistance-type regulator (LipReg3), large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family-type regulator (LipReg4), and small ribonuclease (LipRegX1), respectively. A combination of targeted gene disruptions, complementation experiments, lipomycin production studies, and gene expression analysis via RT-PCR suggests that all regulatory lip genes are involved in alpha-lipomycin production. On the basis of the obtained data, we propose that LipReg2 controls the activity of LipReg1, which in its turn govern the expression of the alpha-lipomycin pathway-specific regulatory gene lipReg4. The ribonuclease gene lipX1 and the transporter regulator lipReg3 appear to work independently of genes lipReg1, lipReg2, and lipReg4.	1
Title: The genomic dynamics and evolutionary mechanism of the Pi2/9 locus in rice Abstract: The Pi2/9 locus contains at least four resistance specificities to Magnaporthe grisea and belongs to a gene complex comprised of multiple genes that encode highly homologous nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) proteins. To investigate the genetic events involved in the evolution of the Pi2/9 locus, we analyzed the Pi2/9 locus at the inter- and intralocus levels in five rice cultivars. The NBS-LRR genes in the five cultivars belong to the same phylogenetic clade among rice NBS-LRR genes, and all have a phase-2 intron at the N-terminus. However, the paralogs within each haplotype show a significant sequence divergence and their N-terminal intron and 5' regulatory regions are very different. On the contrary, the orthologs from different haplotypes are highly similar, indicating an obvious orthologous relationship has been maintained during the evolution of the Pi2/9 locus. These results suggest that sequence diversification in the 5' regulatory regions and N-terminal introns of the paralogs may have led to suppression of meiotic recombination between the paralogs within each haplotype, facilitating the maintenance of the orthologous relationship among rice cultivars. Our observations provide valuable insight into the genomic dynamics and evolutionary mechanism of an NBS-LRR resistance-gene complex in rice.	0
Title: Potential role of IFN-α in COVID-19 patients and its underlying treatment options Abstract: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide. Given that this contagious viral outbreak is still unfolding, it is urgent to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore effective treatments to protect patients from developing a severe illness related to COVID-19. Recently, IFN-α has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy to treat COVID-19 disease, mainly because the innate immune system rapidly produces IFN-α as the first line of defense to combat viral infections. However, IFN-α can also play a role in immunoregulatory effects, causing pathogenic damage and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. There are 13 human IFN-α subtypes that bind to the same receptor and induce different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, regulating various antiviral and immunoregulatory effects. The varying degrees of inflammatory regulations may raise concerns about the possible side effects to enlarge the inflammatory responses, exacerbating the severity of infection. Thus, the analysis of various IFN-α subtype induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary in exploring the mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of IFN-α in the pathogenesis of respiratory virus diseases and IFN-α based clinical intervention used in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other respiratory virus diseases. Besides, new ideas in selecting suitable IFN-α subtypes or combinations as drug candidates for viral infection treatment will also be discussed.Key Points• IFN-α plays an important role in anti-viral and immunoregulatory effects in COVID-19 patients caused by SARS-CoV-2.• The uncontrolled inflammation and disease severity correlated to the diversity of IFN-α subtype induction.• Selecting suitable IFN-α subtypes or combinations as drug candidates will be beneficial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.	0
Title: An Atypical Arginine Dihydrolase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Cyclic Hexapeptide Longicatenamides Abstract: The incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids (NPAAs) enriches the structural diversity of nonribosomal peptides. Recently, four NPAA-containing cyclic hexapeptides, longicatenamides A-D, were isolated using a combined-culture strategy. Based on in silico analysis, we discovered their putative biosynthetic gene cluster (lon) and proposed a possible biosynthetic mechanism. Surprisingly, the lon22 gene encodes an atypical arginine dihydrolase, which can also catalyze the hydrolysis of citrulline to ornithine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Lon22-like proteins form a novel clade that is separated from other guanidine-modifying enzymes. After rational design, the catalytic efficiencies of a Lon22 Y80F mutant for arginine and citrulline substrates were 2.31- and 4.70-fold that of the wild-type (WT), respectively. In addition, characterization of the Lon20-A4 adenylation domain suggested that it can incorporate both ornithine and lysine into the final products.	1
Title: Mechanism and regulation of the Two-component FMN-dependent monooxygenase ActVA-ActVB from Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The ActVA-ActVB system from Streptomyces coelicolor is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase involved in the antibiotic actinorhodin biosynthesis. ActVB is a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that provides a reduced FMN to ActVA, the monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin, the precursor of actinorhodin. In this work, using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we investigated the mechanism of hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin catalyzed by ActVA and that of the reduced FMN transfer from ActVB to ActVA. Our results show that the hydroxylation mechanism proceeds with the participation of two different reaction intermediates in ActVA active site. First, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroperoxide species is formed after binding of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase and reaction with O(2). This intermediate hydroxylates the substrate and is transformed to a second reaction intermediate, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroxy species. In addition, we demonstrate that reduced FMN can be transferred efficiently from the reductase to the monooxygenase without involving any protein.protein complexes. The rate of transfer of reduced FMN from ActVB to ActVA was found to be controlled by the release of NAD(+) from ActVB and was strongly affected by NAD(+) concentration, with an IC(50) of 40 microm. This control of reduced FMN transfer by NAD(+) was associated with the formation of a strong charge.transfer complex between NAD(+) and reduced FMN in the active site of ActVB. These results suggest that, in Streptomyces coelicolor, the reductase component ActVB can act as a regulatory component of the monooxygenase activity by controlling the transfer of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase.	1
Title: Nostophycin biosynthesis is directed by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase in the toxic cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain 152 Abstract: Cyanobacteria are a rich source of natural products with interesting pharmaceutical properties. Here, we report the identification, sequencing, annotation, and biochemical analysis of the nostophycin (npn) biosynthetic gene cluster. The npn gene cluster spans 45.1 kb and consists of three open reading frames encoding a polyketide synthase, a mixed polyketide nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The genetic architecture and catalytic domain organization of the proteins are colinear in arrangement, with the putative order of the biosynthetic assembly of the cyclic heptapeptide. NpnB contains an embedded monooxygenase domain linking nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) catalytic domains and predicted here to hydroxylate the nostophycin during assembly. Expression of the adenylation domains and subsequent substrate specificity assays support the involvement of this cluster in nostophycin biosynthesis. Biochemical analyses suggest that the loading substrate of NpnA is likely to be a phenylpropanoic acid necessitating deletion of a carbon atom to explain the biosynthesis of nostophycin. Biosyntheses of nostophycin and microcystin resemble each other, but the phylogenetic analyses suggest that they are distantly related to one another.	1
Title: The structural view of bacterial translocation-specific chaperone SecB: implications for function Abstract: SecB is a molecular chaperone that functions in bacterial post-translational protein translocation pathway. It maintains newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in a translocation-competent state and guides them to the translocon via its high-affinity binding to the ligand as well as to the membrane-embedded ATPase SecA. Recent advances in elucidating the structures of SecB have enabled the examination of protein function in the structural context. Structures of SecB from both Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli support the early two-subsite polypeptide-binding model. In addition, the detailed molecular interaction between SecB and SecA was revealed by a structure of SecB in complex with the C-terminal zinc-containing domain of SecA. These observations explain the dual role of SecB plays in the translocation pathway, as a molecular chaperone and a specific targeting factor. A model of SecB-SecA complex suggests that the binding of SecA to SecB changes the conformation of the polypeptide binding sites in the chaperone, enabling transfer of precursor polypeptides from SecB to SecA. Recent studies also show the presence of a second zinc-independent SecB binding site in SecA and the new interaction might contribute to the function of SecB.	0
Title: C-glycosylation of anhydrotetracycline scaffold with SsfS6 from the SF2575 biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Glycosylation with deoxysugar is a common strategy used by nature to introduce structural diversity and biological activities among natural products. In this study, we biochemically confirmed the activities of SsfS6, a C-glycosyltransferase in the SF2575 biosynthetic pathway, as a regioselective D-olivose transferase that acts on the C-9 position of an anhydrotetracycline aglycon. To perform the glycosyl transfer reaction using Escherichia coli as a whole-cell biocatalyst, we reconstituted the biosynthesis of TDP-D-olivose using a heterologous pathway. Under in vivo conditions, SsfS6 transferred multiple endogenous sugar substrates, in addition to D-olivose, to the anhydrotetracycline substrate, demonstrating broad substrate tolerance and potential as a tetracycline-diversifying enzyme.	1
Title: ALDH2 mediates 5-nitrofuran activity in multiple species Abstract: Understanding how drugs work in vivo is critical for drug design and for maximizing the potential of currently available drugs. 5-nitrofurans are a class of prodrugs widely used to treat bacterial and trypanosome infections, but despite relative specificity, 5-nitrofurans often cause serious toxic side effects in people. Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment.	0
Title: Characterisation and heterologous biosynthesis of burnettiene A, a new polyene-decalin polyketide from Aspergillus burnettii Abstract: Chemical exploration of the recently described Australian fungus, Aspergillus burnettii, uncovered a new metabolite, burnettiene A. Here, we characterise the structure of burnettiene A as a polyene-decalin polyketide. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of A. burnettii identified a putative biosynthetic gene cluster for burnettiene A (bue), consisting of eight genes and sharing similarity to the fusarielin gene cluster. Introduction of the reassembled bue gene cluster into Aspergillus nidulans for heterologous expression resulted in the production of burnettiene A under native promoters. Omission of bueE encoding a cytochrome P450 led to the production of preburnettiene A, confirming that BueE is responsible for catalysing the regiospecific multi-oxidation of terminal methyl groups to carboxylic acids. Similarly, bueF was shown to encode an ester-forming methyltransferase, with its omission resulting in the production of the tricarboxylic acid, preburnettiene B. Introduction of an additional copy of the transcription factor bueR under the regulation of the gpdA promoter significantly improved the heterologous production of the burnettienes. Burnettiene A displayed strong in vitro cytotoxicity against mouse myeloma NS-1 cells (MIC 0.8 μg mL-1).	1
Title: Development of a Propionibacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector for metabolic engineering of Propionibacterium jensenii, an efficient producer of propionic acid Abstract: Propionic acid (PA) is an important chemical building block and is widely applied for organic synthesis, food, feedstuff, and pharmaceuticals. To date, the strains that can efficiently produce PA have included Propionibacterium thoenii, P. freudenreichii, and P. acidipropionici. In this report, we show that P. jensenii ATCC 4868 is also able to produce PA in much higher yields than the previously reported strains. To further improve the production capacity, a P. jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector was developed for the metabolic engineering of P. jensenii. Specifically, a 6.9-kb endogenous plasmid, pZGX01, was isolated from P. acidipropionici ATCC 4875 and sequenced. Since the sequencing analysis indicated that pZGX01 could encode 11 proteins, the transcriptional levels of the corresponding genes were also investigated. Then, a P. jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector was constructed using the pZGX01 plasmid, the E. coli pUC18 plasmid, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. Interestingly, not only could the developed shuttle vector be transformed into P. jensenii ATCC 4868 and 4870, but it also could be transformed into freudenreichii ATCC 6207 subspecies of P. freudenreichii. Finally, the glycerol dehydrogenase gene (gldA) from Klebsiella pneumoniae was expressed in P. jensenii ATCC 4868 with the constructed shuttle vector. In a 3-liter batch culture, the PA production by the engineered P. jensenii ATCC 4868 strain reached 28.23 ± 1.0 g/liter, which was 26.07% higher than that produced by the wild-type strain (22.06 ± 1.2 g/liter). This result indicated that the constructed vector can be used a useful tool for metabolic engineering of P. jensenii.	0
Title: Cytotoxic sesquiterpene lactones from Vernonia pachyclada from the Madagascar rainforest Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of the cytotoxic leaf extract of Vernonia pachyclada Baker led to the isolation of three new sesquiterpene lactones, designated glaucolides K-M (1-3). The structures of the new compounds were determined using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and the structure and stereochemistry of 1 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 3 showed moderate activity in the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line, with an IC50 of 3.3 microM.	0
Title: Morphological profiling of small molecules Abstract: Profiling approaches such as gene expression or proteome profiling generate small-molecule bioactivity profiles that describe a perturbed cellular state in a rather unbiased manner and have become indispensable tools in the evaluation of bioactive small molecules. Automated imaging and image analysis can record morphological alterations that are induced by small molecules through the detection of hundreds of morphological features in high-throughput experiments. Thus, morphological profiling has gained growing attention in academia and the pharmaceutical industry as it enables detection of bioactivity in compound collections in a broader biological context in the early stages of compound development and the drug-discovery process. Profiling may be used successfully to predict mode of action or targets of unexplored compounds and to uncover unanticipated activity for already characterized small molecules. Here, we review the reported approaches to morphological profiling and the kind of bioactivity that can be detected so far and, thus, predicted.	0
Title: Mechanistic Insight into the Catalytic Promiscuity of Amine Dehydrogenases: Asymmetric Synthesis of Secondary and Primary Amines Abstract: Biocatalytic asymmetric amination of ketones, by using amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) or transaminases, is an efficient method for the synthesis of α-chiral primary amines. A major challenge is to extend amination to the synthesis of secondary and tertiary amines. Herein, for the first time, it is shown that AmDHs are capable of accepting other amine donors, thus giving access to enantioenriched secondary amines with conversions up to 43 %. Surprisingly, in several cases, the promiscuous formation of enantiopure primary amines, along with the expected secondary amines, was observed. By conducting practical laboratory experiments and computational experiments, it is proposed that the promiscuous formation of primary amines along with secondary amines is due to an unprecedented nicotinamide (NAD)-dependent formal transamination catalysed by AmDHs. In nature, this type of mechanism is commonly performed by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate aminotransferase and not by dehydrogenases. Finally, a catalytic pathway that rationalises the promiscuous NAD-dependent formal transamination activity and explains the formation of the observed mixture of products is proposed. This work increases the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of NAD-dependent aminating enzymes, such as AmDHs, and will aid further research into the rational engineering of oxidoreductases for the synthesis of α-chiral secondary and tertiary amines.	0
Title: Involvement of Rhodocyclus-related organisms in phosphorus removal in full-scale wastewater treatment plants Abstract: The participation of organisms related to Rhodocyclus in full-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) was investigated. By using fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques, the communities of Rhodocyclus-related organisms in two full-scale wastewater treatment plants were estimated to represent between 13 and 18% of the total bacterial population. However, the fractions of these communities that participated in polyphosphate accumulation depended on the type of treatment process evaluated. In a University of Cape Town EBPR process, the percentage of Rhodocyclus-related cells that contained polyphosphate was about 20% of the total bacterial population, but these cells represented as much as 73% of the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). In an aerated-anoxic EBPR process, Rhodocyclus-related PAOs were less numerous, accounting for 6% of the total bacterial population and 26% of the total PAO population. In addition, 16S ribosomal DNA sequences 99.9% similar to the sequences of Rhodocyclus-related organisms enriched in acetate-fed bench-scale EBPR reactors were recovered from both full-scale plants. These results confirmed the involvement of Rhodocyclus-related organisms in EBPR and demonstrated their importance in full-scale processes. In addition, the results revealed a significant correlation between the type of EBPR process and the PAO community.	0
Title: Diversity in genomic organisation, developmental regulation and distribution of the murine PR72/B" subunits of protein phosphatase 2A Abstract: Background:                       Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase displaying vital functions in growth and development through its role in various signalling pathways. PP2A holoenzymes comprise a core dimer composed of a catalytic C and a structural A subunit, which can associate with a variable B-type subunit. The importance of the B-type subunits for PP2A regulation cannot be overestimated as they determine holoenzyme localisation, activity and substrate specificity. Three B-type subunit families have been identified: PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/B", of which the latter is currently the least characterised.                  Results:                       We deduced the sequences and genomic organisation of the different murine PR72/B" isoforms: three genes encode nine isoforms, five of which are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine PP2A subunits. Thereby, one novel subunit was identified. Using Northern blotting, we examined the tissue-specific and developmental expression of these subunits. All subunits are highly expressed in heart, suggesting an important cardiac function. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a striated expression pattern of PR72 and PR130 in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in bladder smooth muscle. The subcellular localisation and cell cycle regulatory ability of several PR72/B" isoforms were determined, demonstrating differences as well as similarities.                  Conclusion:                       In contrast to PR55/B and PR61/B', the PR72/B" family seems evolutionary more divergent, as only two of the murine genes have a human orthologue. We have integrated these results in a more consistent nomenclature of both human and murine PR72/B" genes and their transcripts/proteins. Our results provide a platform for the future generation of PR72/B" knockout mice.	0
Title: Redesigning enzymes based on adaptive evolution for optimal function in synthetic metabolic pathways Abstract: Nature has balanced most metabolic pathways such that no one enzyme in the pathway controls the flux through that pathway. However, unnatural or nonnative, constructed metabolic pathways may have limited product flux due to unfavorable in vivo properties of one or more enzymes in the pathway. One such example is the mevalonate-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that we previously reconstructed in Escherichia coli. We have used a probable mechanism of adaptive evolution to engineer the in vivo properties of two enzymes (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [tHMGR] and many terpene synthases) in this pathway and thereby eliminate or minimize the bottleneck created by these inefficient or nonfunctional enzymes. Here, we demonstrate how we significantly improved the productivity (by approximately 1000 fold) of this reconstructed biosynthetic pathway using this strategy. We anticipate that this strategy will find broad applicability in the functional construction (or reconstruction) of biological pathways in heterologous hosts.	0
Title: Site-specific protein cross-linking with genetically incorporated 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine Abstract: Come together right now with L-DOPA: Chemical cross-linking is widely used to study protein-protein interactions. However, many cross-linking agents suffer from low reactivity or selectivity. An efficient and selective reaction of site-specific protein cross-linking was achieved using genetically incorporated 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine.	0
Title: Rare but active taxa contribute to community dynamics of benthic biofilms in glacier-fed streams Abstract: Glaciers harbour diverse microorganisms, which upon ice melt can be released downstream. In glacier-fed streams microorganisms can attach to stones or sediments to form benthic biofilms. We used 454-pyrosequencing to explore the bulk (16S rDNA) and putatively active (16S rRNA) microbial communities of stone and sediment biofilms across 26 glacier-fed streams. We found differences in community composition between bulk and active communities among streams and a stronger congruence between biofilm types. Relative abundances of rRNA and rDNA were positively correlated across different taxa and taxonomic levels, but at lower taxonomic levels, the higher abundance in either the active or the bulk communities became more apparent. Here, environmental variables played a minor role in structuring active communities. However, we found a large number of rare taxa with higher relative abundances in rRNA compared with rDNA. This suggests that rare taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics in glacier-fed streams. Our findings propose that high community turnover, where taxa repeatedly enter and leave the 'seed bank', contributes to the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems with continuous environmental perturbations, such as glacier-fed streams.	0
Title: Systems-level analysis of the metabolic responses of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to phosphorus stress Abstract: Phosphorus is an important macronutrient. To understand the molecular and cellular responses to phosphorus stress better, transcriptome profiling in combination with biochemical investigations was conducted in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Out of 10 402 predicted genes, 2491 and 405 genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated respectively. Unsurprisingly, genes associated with phosphate uptake were upregulated, such as the phosphate transporters and alkaline phosphatases. Genes encoding stress-shock proteins were accordingly upregulated, including genes associated with stress-responsive proteins, signal transduction and secondary metabolism. Additionally, genes related to protein translation, carbon fixation, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle were also upregulated. Genes associated with gene transcription were downregulated, thereby resulting in the upregulation of translation to compensate for the limited supply of messenger RNA. The downregulation of genes related to β-oxidation could contribute to the accumulation of fatty acids. Accordingly, triacylglycerols, which are important for energy storage, were determined to increase by 1.65-fold. Intracellular membranes, other than chloroplast membranes, tended to be dispersed; this finding was in accordance with the increased transcription of a total of 11 genes encoding putative phospholipases. Taken together, this work revealed the coordination of multiple metabolic pathways and certain key genes in the adaptation of P. tricornutum to phosphorus stress.	0
Title: Activation of a p44 pseudogene in Anaplasma phagocytophila by bacterial RNA splicing: a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of a multigene family encoding immunodominant major outer membrane proteins Abstract: Immunodominant 44 kDa major outer membrane proteins of Anaplasma phagocytophila (human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent) are encoded by the p44 multigene family. One of the paralogues, p44-18 is predominantly expressed by A. phagocytophila in mammalian hosts, but is downregulated in the arthropod vector. The expression of p44-18 was upregulated in A. phagocytophila cultivated in HL-60 cells at 37 degrees C compared with 24 degrees C. However, the molecular mechanism of such gene expression was unclear, as p44-18 has a pseudogene-like structure, i.e. it lacks an AUG start codon and is out of frame with an upstream overlapping paralogue, p44-1. In the present study, we found that an amplicon detected by reverse transciption-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [808 basepair (bp)] for the p44-1/p44-18 gene locus was smaller than that detected by PCR with the genomic DNA (1652 bp) in the A. phagocytophila-infected HL-60 cells cultured at 37 degrees C. A circularized RNA molecule corresponding to the 844 bp region missing from the locus in the RT-PCR product was detected by inverse RT-PCR, indicating that this is an intron (designated p44-1 intervening sequence, p44-1 IVS). The splicing event of p44-1 IVS was also observed when the p44-1 IVS-carrying plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli, suggesting that the splicing is sequence-dependent. Structural analysis and in vitro splicing experiments of p44-1 IVS suggested that this is likely to represent a new class of introns in eubacteria. The primer extension analysis showed the presence of a putative sigma(32)-type promoter in region upstream from p44-1. Collectively, the novel RNA splicing and the temperature-dependent transcription may account for the dominant p44-18 expression in mammals.	0
Title: An APC/C inhibitor stabilizes cyclin B1 by prematurely terminating ubiquitination Abstract: The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase that is required for exit from mitosis. We previously showed that tosyl arginine methyl ester (TAME) inhibits APC-dependent proteolysis by competing with the C-terminal isoleucine-arginine tail of the APC activator cell division cycle 20 (Cdc20) for APC binding. Here we show that in the absence of APC substrates, TAME ejects Cdc20 from the APC by promoting Cdc20 autoubiquitination in its N-terminal region. Cyclin B1 antagonizes TAME's effect by promoting binding of free Cdc20 to the APC and by suppressing Cdc20 autoubiquitination. Nevertheless, TAME stabilizes cyclin B1 in Xenopus extracts by two mechanisms. First, it reduces the k(cat) of the APC-Cdc20-cyclin B1 complex without affecting the K(m), slowing the initial ubiquitination of unmodified cyclin B1. Second, as cyclin B1 becomes ubiquitinated, it loses its ability to promote Cdc20 binding to the APC in the presence of TAME. As a result, cyclin B1 ubiquitination terminates before reaching the threshold necessary for proteolysis.	0
Title: Modeling of novel diagnostic strategies for active tuberculosis - a systematic review: current practices and recommendations Abstract: Introduction:                       The field of diagnostics for active tuberculosis (TB) is rapidly developing. TB diagnostic modeling can help to inform policy makers and support complicated decisions on diagnostic strategy, with important budgetary implications. Demand for TB diagnostic modeling is likely to increase, and an evaluation of current practice is important. We aimed to systematically review all studies employing mathematical modeling to evaluate cost-effectiveness or epidemiological impact of novel diagnostic strategies for active TB.                  Methods:                       Pubmed, personal libraries and reference lists were searched to identify eligible papers. We extracted data on a wide variety of model structure, parameter choices, sensitivity analyses and study conclusions, which were discussed during a meeting of content experts.                  Results & discussion:                       From 5619 records a total of 36 papers were included in the analysis. Sixteen papers included population impact/transmission modeling, 5 were health systems models, and 24 included estimates of cost-effectiveness. Transmission and health systems models included specific structure to explore the importance of the diagnostic pathway (n = 4), key determinants of diagnostic delay (n = 5), operational context (n = 5), and the pre-diagnostic infectious period (n = 1). The majority of models implemented sensitivity analysis, although only 18 studies described multi-way sensitivity analysis of more than 2 parameters simultaneously. Among the models used to make cost-effectiveness estimates, most frequent diagnostic assays studied included Xpert MTB/RIF (n = 7), and alternative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (n = 4). Most (n = 16) of the cost-effectiveness models compared new assays to an existing baseline and generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).                  Conclusion:                       Although models have addressed a small number of important issues, many decisions regarding implementation of TB diagnostics are being made without the full benefits of insight from mathematical models. Further models are needed that address a wider array of diagnostic and epidemiological settings, that explore the inherent uncertainty of models and that include additional epidemiological data on transmission implications of false-negative diagnosis and the pre-diagnostic period.	0
Title: Insights into a divergent phenazine biosynthetic pathway governed by a plasmid-born esmeraldin gene cluster Abstract: Phenazine-type metabolites arise from either phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) or phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC). Although the biosynthesis of PCA has been studied extensively, PDC assembly remains unclear. Esmeraldins and saphenamycin, the PDC originated products, are antimicrobial and antitumor metabolites isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 2706. Herein, the esmeraldin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified on a dispensable giant plasmid. Twenty-four putative esm genes were characterized by bioinformatics, mutagenesis, genetic complementation, and functional protein expressions. Unlike enzymes involved in PCA biosynthesis, EsmA1 and EsmA2 together decisively promoted the PDC yield. The resulting PDC underwent a series of conversions to give 6-acetylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid, saphenic acid, and saphenamycin through a unique one-carbon extension by EsmB1-B5, a keto reduction by EsmC, and an esterification by EsmD1-D3, the atypical polyketide sythases, respectively. Two transcriptional regulators, EsmT1 and EsmT2, are required for esmeraldin production.	1
Title: Linkage of genes essential for synthesis of a polysaccharide capsule in Sphingomonas strain S88 Abstract: Several structurally related capsular polysaccharides that are secreted by members of the genus Sphingomonas are being developed as aqueous rheological control agents for diverse industrial and food applications. They include gellan (S-60), welan (S-130), rhamsan (S-194), S-657, S-88, S-198, S-7, and NW-11. We refer to these polysaccharides as sphingans, after the genus name. This paper characterizes the first gene cluster isolated from a Sphingomonas species (S88) that is required for capsule synthesis. Overlapping DNA segments which spanned about 50 kbp of S88 DNA restored the synthesis of sphingan S-88 in capsule-negative mutants. The mutations were mapped into functional complementation groups, and the contiguous nucleotide sequence for the 29-kbp cluster was determined. The genetic complementation map and the DNA sequences were interpreted as an extended multicistronic locus containing genes essential for the assembly and secretion of polysaccharide S-88. Many of the deduced amino acid sequences were similar to gene products from other polysaccharide-secreting bacteria such as Rhizobium meliloti (succinoglycan), Xanthomonas campestris (xanthan gum), and Salmonella enterica (O antigen). The S88 locus contained a four-gene operon for the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, an essential precursor for the sphingans. Unexpectedly, there were also two genes for secretion of a lytic or toxin-like protein nested within the polysaccharide cluster. The conservation and linkage of genes that code for a defensive capsule and genes for secretion of an offensive lysin or toxin suggest a heretofore unknown pathogenic life history for Sphingomonas strain S88.	1
Title: Various mutations compensate for a deleterious lacZα insert in the replication enhancer of M13 bacteriophage Abstract: M13 and other members of the Ff class of filamentous bacteriophages have been extensively employed in myriad applications. The Ph.D. series of phage-displayed peptide libraries were constructed from the M13-based vector M13KE. As a direct descendent of M13mp19, M13KE contains the lacZα insert in the intergenic region between genes IV and II, where it interrupts the replication enhancer of the (+) strand origin. Phage carrying this 816-nucleotide insert are viable, but propagate in E. coli at a reduced rate compared to wild-type M13 phage, presumably due to a replication defect caused by the insert. We have previously reported thirteen compensatory mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of gene II, which encodes the replication initiator protein gIIp. Here we report several additional mutations in M13KE that restore a wild-type propagation rate. Several clones from constrained-loop variable peptide libraries were found to have ejected the majority of lacZα gene in order to reconstruct the replication enhancer, albeit with a small scar. In addition, new point mutations in the gene II 5'-untranslated region or the gene IV coding sequence have been spontaneously observed or synthetically engineered. Through phage propagation assays, we demonstrate that all these genetic modifications compensate for the replication defect in M13KE and restore the wild-type propagation rate. We discuss the mechanisms by which the insertion and ejection of the lacZα gene, as well as the mutations in the regulatory region of gene II, influence the efficiency of replication initiation at the (+) strand origin. We also examine the presence and relevance of fast-propagating mutants in phage-displayed peptide libraries.	0
Title: Genome Mining and Biosynthesis of Primary Amine-Acylated Desferrioxamines in a Marine Gliding Bacterium Abstract: Genome mining of Fulvivirga sp. W222 revealed a desferrioxamine-like biosynthetic gene cluster containing an unknown gene fulF that is conserved in many Bacteroidetes species. A series of primary amine-acylated desferrioxamine G1 analogues, fulvivirgamides, were identified, and fulvivirgamides A2, B2, B3, and B4 (1-4) were purified and characterized. The function of FulF, which is a novel acyltransferase for the acylation of the primary amine of Desferrioxamine G1, was verified by heterologous expression and feeding experiments.	1
Title: Transcriptional organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli K30 group 1 capsule biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster Abstract: Escherichia coli group 1 capsules are important virulence determinants, yet little is known about the transcriptional organization or regulation of their biosynthetic (cps) operons. Transcription of the prototype serotype K30 cluster is modulated by the JUMPStart-RfaH antitermination mechanism, with the cps promoter being localized to a region immediately upstream of the JUMPStart sequence. A putative stem-loop structure located within the K30 cps cluster separates conserved genes with products that are required for surface expression of capsule from serotype-specific genes encoding enzymes for polymer repeat-unit synthesis and polymerization. This putative stem-loop structure significantly reduces transcription in a termination-probe vector and may contribute to differential expression of the cps genes. Previous work indicated that increased amounts of group 1 capsular polysaccharide synthesis resulted from the overexpression of the Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) proteins. However, neither overexpression of the transcriptional activator RcsB nor an rcsB::aadA chromosomal insertion altered the level of transcription measured by cps::lacZ fusions. In the group 1 strains examined, an RcsAB box was found immediately upstream of galF, a gene involved in the production of sugar nucleotide precursors. Overexpression of RcsB was found to result in a threefold increase in transcription of a galF::lacZ chromosomal fusion. Moreover, overexpression of GalF gave rise to a two- to threefold increase in cell-free as well as cell-associated capsule, without affecting cps::lacZ activity. These results indicate that transcription of the E. coli group 1 capsule cluster itself is not regulated by the Rcs system and may, in fact, be constitutive. However, the Rcs system can potentially influence levels of capsular polysaccharide production by increasing galF transcription and influencing the available pool of biosynthetic precursors.	1
Title: Identification of substituent groups and related genes involved in salecan biosynthesis in Agrobacterium sp. ZX09 Abstract: Salecan, a soluble β-1,3-D-glucan produced by a salt-tolerant strain Agrobacterium sp. ZX09, has been the subject of considerable interest in recent years because of its multiple bioactivities and unusual rheological properties in solution. In this study, both succinyl and pyruvyl substituent groups on salecan were identified by an enzymatic hydrolysis following nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), HPLC, and MS analysis. The putative succinyltransferase gene (sleA) and pyruvyltransferase gene (sleV) were determined and cloned. Disruption of the sleA gene resulted in the absence of succinyl substituent groups on salecan. This defect could be complemented by expressing the sleA cloned in a plasmid. Thus, the sleA and sleV genes located in a 19.6-kb gene cluster may be involved in salecan biosynthesis. Despite the lack of succinyl substituents, the molecular mass of salecan generated by the sleA mutant did not substantially differ from that generated by the wild-type strain. Loss of succinyl substituents on salecan changed its rheological characteristics, especially a decrease in intrinsic viscosity.	1
Title: Functional genomics-guided discovery of a light-activated phytotoxin in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum via pathway activation Abstract: Parastagonospora nodorum is an important pathogen of wheat. The contribution of secondary metabolites to this pathosystem is poorly understood. A biosynthetic gene cluster (SNOG_08608-08616) has been shown to be upregulated during the late stage of P. nodorum wheat leaf infection. The gene cluster shares several homologues with the Cercospora nicotianae CTB gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of cercosporin. Activation of the gene cluster by overexpression (OE) of the transcription factor gene (SNOG_08609) in P. nodorum resulted in the production of elsinochrome C, a perelyenequinone phytotoxin structurally similar to cercosporin. Heterologous expression of the polyketide synthase gene elcA from the gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of the polyketide precursor nortoralactone common to the cercosporin pathway. Elsinochrome C could be detected on wheat leaves infected with P. nodorum, but not in the elcA disruption mutant. The compound was shown to exhibit necrotic activity on wheat leaves in a light-dependent manner. Wheat seedling infection assays showed that ΔelcA exhibited reduced virulence compared with wild type, while infection by an OE strain overproducing elsinochrome C resulted in larger lesions on leaves. These data provided evidence that elsinochrome C contributes to the virulence of P. nodorum against wheat.	1
Title: Discovery of wall teichoic acid inhibitors as potential anti-MRSA β-lactam combination agents Abstract: Innovative strategies are needed to combat drug resistance associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we investigate the potential of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis inhibitors as combination agents to restore β-lactam efficacy against MRSA. Performing a whole-cell pathway-based screen, we identified a series of WTA inhibitors (WTAIs) targeting the WTA transporter protein, TarG. Whole-genome sequencing of WTAI-resistant isolates across two methicillin-resistant Staphylococci spp. revealed TarG as their common target, as well as a broad assortment of drug-resistant bypass mutants mapping to earlier steps of WTA biosynthesis. Extensive in vitro microbiological analysis and animal infection studies provide strong genetic and pharmacological evidence of the potential effectiveness of WTAIs as anti-MRSA β-lactam combination agents. This work also highlights the emerging role of whole-genome sequencing in antibiotic mode-of-action and resistance studies.	0
Title: Regulatory mutations affecting the gluconate system in Escherichia coli Abstract: A spontaneously arising regulatory mutant of the gluconate system in Escherichia coli was isolated. This mutant became constitutive, probably in one step, for gluconate high-affinity transport, gluconokinase, and gluconate-6-P dehydrase. The mutation involved (gntR18) is cotransducible with asd. Pseudorevertants, derived from a mutant (M2) that shows a long lag for growth on gluconate mineral medium, were also isolated and characterized. They give constitutive levels of gluconokinase and gluconate-6-P dehydrase but lack high-affinity transport function. Genetic experiments performed with one of these pseudorevertants (M4) indicate that it carries a secondary mutation in the gntR gene. The M4 phenotype is thus the result of the interaction of expression of a constitutive mutation (gntR4) with the mutation of strain M2 (gntM2).	0
Title: Asperphenamate biosynthesis reveals a novel two-module NRPS system to synthesize amino acid esters in fungi Abstract: Amino acid esters are a group of structurally diverse natural products with distinct activities. Some are synthesized through an inter-molecular esterification step catalysed by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In bacteria, the formation of the intra-molecular ester bond is usually catalysed by a thioesterase domain of NRPS. However, the mechanism by which fungal NRPSs perform this process remains unclear. Herein, by targeted gene disruption in Penicillium brevicompactum and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans, we show that two NRPSs, ApmA and ApmB, are sufficient for the synthesis of an amino acid ester, asperphenamate. Using the heterologous expression system, we identified that ApmA, with a reductase domain, rarely generates dipeptidyl alcohol. In contrast, ApmB was determined to not only catalyse inter-molecular ester bond formation but also accept the linear dipeptidyl precursor into the NRPS chain. The mechanism described here provides an approach for the synthesis of new small molecules with NRPS as the catalyst. Our study reveals for the first time a two-module NRPS system for the formation of amino acid esters in nature.	1
Title: Water and the Cation-π Interaction Abstract: The cation-π interaction and the hydrophobic effect are important intermolecular forces in chemistry and play major roles in controlling recognition in biological systems. We compared their relative contributions to the binding of molecular "dumbbell" guests in synthetic container hosts in water. The guests offered direct, intramolecular competition between trimethylammonium groups, -N+(CH3)3, and tert-butyl groups, -C(CH3)3, for the internal surfaces (aromatic panels) of the containers. In contrast with previous studies, the container molecules consistently preferred binding to the uncharged tert-butyl groups, regardless of the presence of anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic groups on the container peripheries. This preference is determined by solvation of the polar trimethylammonium group in water, which outcompetes the attraction between the positive charge and the π-surfaces in the container. The synthetic container complexes provide a direct measure of the relative strengths of cation-π interactions and desolvation in water. Interactions with the uncharged tert-butyl group are more than 12 kJ mol-1 more favorable than the cation-π interactions with the trimethylammonium group in these cavitand complexes.	0
Title: Translation of human Δ133p53 mRNA and its targeting by antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the 5'-terminal region of this mRNA Abstract: The p53 protein is expressed as at least twelve protein isoforms. Within intron 4 of the human TP53 gene, a P2 transcription initiation site is located and this transcript encodes two p53 isoforms: Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. Here, the secondary structure of the 5'-terminal region of P2-initiated mRNA was characterized by means of the SHAPE and Pb2+-induced cleavage methods and for the first time, a secondary structure model of this region was proposed. Surprisingly, only Δ133p53 isoform was synthetized in vitro from the P2-initiated p53 mRNA while translation from both initiation codons occurred after the transfection of vector-encoded model mRNA to HCT116 cells. Interestingly, translation performed in the presence of the cap analogue suggested that the cap-independent process contributes to the translation of P2-initiated p53 mRNA. Subsequently, several antisense oligonucleotides targeting the 5'-terminal region of P2-initiated p53 mRNA were designed. The selected oligomers were applied in in vitro translation assays as well as in cell lines and their impact on the Δ133p53 synthesis and on cell viability was investigated. The results show that these oligomers are attractive tools in the modulation of the translation of P2-initiated p53 mRNA through attacking the 5' terminus of the transcript. Since cell proliferation is also reduced by antisense oligomers that lower the level of Δ133p53, this demonstrates an involvement of this isoform in tumorigenesis.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster for the cladoniamides, bis-indoles with a rearranged scaffold Abstract: The cladoniamides are bis-indole alkaloids isolated from Streptomyces uncialis, a lichen-associated actinomycete strain. The cladoniamides have an unusual, indenotryptoline structure rarely observed among bis-indole alkaloids. I report here the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the cladoniamide biosynthetic gene cluster and compare it to the recently published gene cluster for BE-54017, a closely related indenotryptoline natural product. The cladoniamide gene cluster differs from the BE-54017 gene cluster in gene organization and in the absence of one N-methyltransferase gene but otherwise contains close homologs to all genes in the BE-54017 cluster. Both gene clusters encode enzymes needed for the construction of an indolocarbazole core, as well as flavin-dependent enzymes putatively involved in generating the indenotryptoline scaffold from an indolocarbazole. These two bis-indolic gene clusters exemplify the diversity of biosynthetic routes that begin from the oxidative dimerization of two molecules of L-tryptophan, highlight enzymes for further study, and provide new opportunities for combinatorial engineering.	1
Title: Identification of genetic defects in the atoxigenic biocontrol strain Aspergillus flavus K49 reveals the presence of a competitive recombinant group in field populations Abstract: Contamination of corn, cotton, peanuts and tree nuts by aflatoxins is a severe economic burden for growers. A current biocontrol strategy is to use non-aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus strains to competitively exclude field toxigenic Aspergillus species. A. flavus K49 does not produce aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and is currently being tested in corn-growing fields in Mississippi. We found that its lack of production of aflatoxins and CPA resulted from single nucleotide mutations in the polyketide synthase gene and hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthase gene, respectively. Furthermore, based on single nucleotide polymorphisms of the aflatoxin biosynthesis omtA gene and the CPA biosynthesis dmaT gene, we conclude that K49, AF36 and previously characterized TX9-8 form a biocontrol group. These isolates appear to be derived from recombinants of typical large and small sclerotial morphotype strains. This finding provides an easy way to select future biocontrol strains from the reservoir of non-aflatoxigenic populations in agricultural fields.	1
Title: Evolution of siderophore pathways in human pathogenic bacteria Abstract: Ornibactin and malleobactin are hydroxamate siderophores employed by human pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. Similarities in their structures and corresponding biosynthesis gene clusters strongly suggest an evolutionary relationship. Through gene coexpression and targeted gene manipulations, the malleobactin pathway was successfully morphed into an ornibactin assembly line. Such an evolutionary-guided approach has been unprecedented for nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Furthermore, the timing of amino acid acylation before peptide assembly, the absolute configuration of the ornibactin side chain, and the function of the acyl transferase were elucidated. Beyond providing a proof of principle for the rational design of siderophore pathways, a compelling model for the evolution of virulence traits is presented.	1
Title: Modulation and Visualization of EF-G Power Stroke During Ribosomal Translocation Abstract: During ribosome translocation, the elongation factor EF-G undergoes large conformational change while maintaining its contact with the moving tRNA. We previously measured a power stroke accompanying EF-G catalysis, which was consistent with structural studies. However, the role of power stroke in translocation fidelity remains unclear. Here, we report quantitative measurements of the power strokes of structurally modified EF-Gs by using two different techniques and reveal the correlation between power stroke and translocation efficiency and fidelity. We discovered that the reduced power stroke only lowered the percentage of translocation but did not introduce translocation error. The established force -structure-function correlation for EF-G indicates that power stroke drives ribosomal translocation, but the mRNA reading frame is probably maintained by ribosome itself. Furthermore, the microscope detection method reported here can be simply implemented for other biochemical applications.	0
Title: Gold-catalyzed intermolecular Markovnikov hydroamination of allenes with secondary amines Abstract: A cationic (CAAC)gold(I) complex promotes the addition of all types of nontertiary amines to a variety of allenes, affording allylic amines in good to excellent yields; the amino fragment always adds to the less substituted terminus of the CCC skeleton.	0
Title: Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells Abstract: We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.	0
Title: The anti-staphylococcal lipolanthines are ribosomally synthesized lipopeptides Abstract: The potent antibacterial lanthipeptide microvionin, isolated from a culture of Microbacterium arborescens, exhibits a new triamino-dicarboxylic acid moiety, termed avionin, and an unprecedented N-terminal guanidino fatty acid. We identified the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster and reconstituted central steps of avionin biosynthesis in vitro. Genome mining and isolation of nocavionin from Nocardia terpenica revealed a widespread distribution of this lanthipeptide class, termed lipolanthines, which may be useful as future antimicrobial drugs.	1
Title: Structure Revision and the Biosynthetic Pathway of Tripartilactam Abstract: Tripartilactam (1) is a natural macrocyclic lactam originally reported to have a unique [18,8,4]-tricyclic framework. However, the validity of this structure has been contested since niizalactam C (2), bearing a [18,6,6]-tricyclic skeleton, was proposed as an alternative structure in 2015. In the present study, a comprehensive reinvestigation of NMR spectroscopic data and a 13C-13C COSY NMR experiment identified direct 13C-13C coupling, thus leading to the unequivocal revision of the structure of tripartilactam as niizalactam C (2). In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis of the tripartilactam-producing bacterial strain and subsequent bioinformatics and mutagenesis analyses identified its biosynthetic pathway, which probably utilizes one of the type I polyketide synthase (PKS) modules iteratively during its biosynthesis and exhibits spontaneous [4+2] cycloaddition from the precursor compound, sceliphrolactam, in the post-PKS process.	1
Title: Resistance-gene-directed discovery of a natural-product herbicide with a new mode of action Abstract: Bioactive natural products have evolved to inhibit specific cellular targets and have served as lead molecules for health and agricultural applications for the past century1-3. The post-genomics era has brought a renaissance in the discovery of natural products using synthetic-biology tools4-6. However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging4. Here we present the discovery and validation of a potent herbicide that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the co-clustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural-product biosynthesis gene cluster7-9, which provides insight into the potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxy-acid dehydratase in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants; the last step in this pathway is often targeted for herbicide development10. We show that the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid, which was discovered using the method described above, is a sub-micromolar inhibitor of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase that is effective as a herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene astD was validated to be insensitive to aspterric acid and was deployed as a transgene in the establishment of plants that are resistant to aspterric acid. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements the urgent ongoing efforts to overcome weed resistance11. Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene-directed approach in the discovery of bioactive natural products.	1
Title: Pyridone Luciferins and Mutant Luciferases for Bioluminescence Imaging Abstract: New applications for bioluminescence imaging require an expanded set of luciferase enzymes and luciferin substrates. Here, we report two novel luciferins for use in vitro and in cells. These molecules comprise regioisomeric pyridone cores that can be accessed from a common synthetic route. The analogues exhibited unique emission spectra with firefly luciferase, although photon intensities remained weak. Enhanced light outputs were achieved by using mutant luciferase enzymes. One of the luciferin-luciferase pairs produced light on par with native probes in live cells. The pyridone analogues and complementary luciferases add to a growing set of designer probes for bioluminescence imaging.	0
Title: Hybrid architecture for encoded measurement-based quantum computation Abstract: We present a hybrid scheme for quantum computation that combines the modular structure of elementary building blocks used in the circuit model with the advantages of a measurement-based approach to quantum computation. We show how to construct optimal resource states of minimal size to implement elementary building blocks for encoded quantum computation in a measurement-based way, including states for error correction and encoded gates. The performance of the scheme is determined by the quality of the resource states, where within the considered error model a threshold of the order of 10% local noise per particle for fault-tolerant quantum computation and quantum communication.	0
Title: CARMIL leading edge localization depends on a non-canonical PH domain and dimerization Abstract: CARMIL is an approximately 1,370-amino-acid cytoskeletal scaffold that has crucial roles in cell motility and tissue development through interactions with cytoskeletal effectors and regulation of capping protein at the leading edge. However, the mechanism of CARMIL leading edge localization is unknown. Here we show that CARMIL interacts directly with the plasma membrane through its amino-terminal region. The crystal structure of CARMIL1-668 reveals that this region harbours a non-canonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain connected to a 16-leucine-rich repeat domain. Lipid binding is mediated by the PH domain, but is further enhanced by a central helical domain. Small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the helical domain mediates antiparallel dimerization, properly positioning the PH domains for simultaneous membrane interaction. In cells, deletion of the PH domain impairs leading edge localization. The results support a direct membrane-binding mechanism for CARMIL localization at the leading edge, where it regulates cytoskeletal effectors and motility.	0
Title: In vivo biosynthesis of terpene nucleosides provides unique chemical markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Abstract: Although small molecules shed from pathogens are widely used to diagnose infection, such tests have not been widely implemented for tuberculosis. Here we show that the recently identified compound, 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), accumulates to comprise >1% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid. In vitro and in vivo, two isomers of TbAd were detected that might serve as infection markers. Using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we established the structure of the previously unknown molecule, N(6)-tuberculosinyladenosine (N(6)-TbAd). Its biosynthesis involves enzymatic production of 1-TbAd by Rv3378c followed by conversion to N(6)-TbAd via the Dimroth rearrangement. Intact biosynthetic genes are observed only within M. tuberculosis complex bacteria, and TbAd was not detected among other medically important pathogens, environmental bacteria, and vaccine strains. With no substantially similar known molecules in nature, the discovery and in vivo detection of two abundant terpene nucleosides support their development as specific diagnostic markers of tuberculosis.	0
Title: Characterization of a novel plasmid-borne thiopeptide gene cluster in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 115 Abstract: Thiopeptides are small (12- to 17-amino-acid), heavily modified peptides of bacterial origin. This antibiotic family, with more than 100 known members, is characterized by the presence of sulfur-containing heterocyclic rings and dehydrated residues within a macrocyclic peptide structure. Thiopeptides, including micrococcin P1, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and even protozoa. Micrococcin P1 is known to target the ribosome; however, like those of other thiopeptides, its biosynthesis and mechanisms of self-immunity are poorly characterized. We have discovered an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harboring the genes for thiopeptide production and self-protection on a 24-kb plasmid. Here we report the characterization of this plasmid, identify the antimicrobial peptide that it encodes, and provide evidence of a target replacement-mediated mechanism of self-immunity.	1
Title: Construction of a cellulase hyper-expression system in Trichoderma reesei by promoter and enzyme engineering Abstract: Background:                       Trichoderma reesei is the preferred organism for producing industrial cellulases. However, a more efficient heterologous expression system for enzymes from different organism is needed to further improve its cellulase mixture. The strong cbh1 promoter of T. reesei is frequently used in heterologous expression, however, the carbon catabolite repressor CREI may reduce its strength by binding to the cbh1 promoter at several binding sites. Another crucial point to enhance the production of heterologous enzymes is the stability of recombinant mRNA and the prevention of protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, especially for the bacteria originated enzymes.In this study, the CREI binding sites within the cbh1 promoter were replaced with the binding sites of transcription activator ACEII and the HAP2/3/5 complex to improve the promoter efficiency. To further improve heterologous expression efficiency of bacterial genes within T. reesei, a flexible polyglycine linker and a rigid α-helix linker were tested in the construction of fusion genes between cbh1 from T. reesei and e1, encoding an endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus.                  Results:                       The modified promoter resulted in an increased expression level of the green fluorescent protein reporter by 5.5-fold in inducing culture medium and 7.4-fold in repressing culture medium. The fusion genes of cbh1 and e1 were successfully expressed in T. reesei under the control of promoter pcbh1m2. The higher enzyme activities and thermostability of the fusion protein with rigid linker indicated that the rigid linker might be more suitable for the heterologous expression system in T. reesei. Compared to the parent strain RC30-8, the FPase and CMCase activities of the secreted enzyme mixture from the corresponding transformant R1 with the rigid linker increased by 39% and 30% at 60°C, respectively, and the reduced sugar concentration in the hydrolysate of pretreated corn stover (PCS) was dramatically increased by 40% at 55°C and 169% at 60°C when its enzyme mixture was used in the hydrolysis.                  Conclusions:                       This study shows that optimizations of the promoter and linker for hybrid genes can dramatically improve the efficiency of heterologous expression of cellulase genes in T. reesei.	0
Title: Microviridin 1777: A Toxic Chymotrypsin Inhibitor Discovered by a Metabologenomic Approach Abstract: The toxicity of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa EAWAG 127a was evaluated against the sensitive grazer Thamnocephalus platyurus, and the extract possessed strong activity. To investigate the compounds responsible for cytotoxicity, a series of peptides from this cyanobacterium were studied using a combined genomic and molecular networking approach. The results led to the isolation, structure elucidation, and biological evaluation of microviridin 1777, which represents the most potent chymotrypsin inhibitor characterized from this family of peptides to date. Furthermore, the biosynthetic gene clusters of microviridin, anabaenopeptin, aeruginosin, and piricyclamide were located in the producing organism, and six additional natural products were identified by tandem mass spectrometry analyses. These results highlight the potential of modern techniques for the identification of natural products, demonstrate the ecological role of protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria, and raise ramifications concerning the presence of novel, yet uncharacterized, toxin families in cyanobacteria beyond microcystin.	1
Title: An Escherichia coli-based bioengineering strategy to study streptolysin S biosynthesis Abstract: Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a leading human pathogen that produces a powerful cytolytic bacteriocin known as streptolysin S (SLS). We have developed a bioengineering strategy to successfully reconstitute SLS activity using heterologous expression in laboratory strains of Escherichia coli. Our E. coli-based heterologous expression system will allow more detailed studies into the biosynthesis of other bacteriocin compounds and the production of these natural products in much greater yield.	1
Title: Discovery of novel Vibrio cholerae VSP-II genomic islands using comparative genomic analysis Abstract: This report describes Vibrio seventh pandemic island II (VSP-II) and three novel variants revealed by comparative genomics of 23 Vibrio cholerae strains and their presence among a large and diverse collection of V. cholerae isolates. Three VSP-II variants were reported previously and our results demonstrate the presence of three novel VSP-II in clinical and environmental V. cholerae marked by major deletions and genetic rearrangements. A new VSP-II cluster was found in the seventh pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain CIRS101, which is dominant (95%) among the recent (2004-2007) seven pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor isolates from two endemic sites, but was not found in older strains from the same region. Two other variants were found in V. cholerae TMA21 and RC385, two environmental strains from coastal Brazil and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively, the latter being prevalent among environmental V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 and Vibrio mimicus. The results of this study indicate that the VSP-II island has undergone significant rearrangement through a complex evolutionary pathway in V. cholerae. Interestingly, one of the new VSP-II revealed the presence of 'old' and 'new' V. cholerae O1 El Tor pandemic clones circulating in some of the areas where cholera is endemic.	0
Title: Cell division in Escherichia coli: analysis of double mutants for filamentation and abnormal septation of deoxyribonucleic acid-less cells Abstract: The link between chromosome termination, initiation of cell division, and choice of division sites was studied in Escherichia coli by preparing double mutants. Hybrid mutants containing div52-ts, a cell division initiation mutation, and min, mutations which affect the choice of division sites resulting in the septation of minicells, were characterized. The mutants produced minicells and normal cells coordinately under all conditions studied, although the fraction of minicells is half that of the parental minicell strain. The mutant gradually stopped dividing at both the median and minicell septation sites when transferred from 30 to 41 C in rich medium. A synchronous cell division of filaments was induced 15 min after addition of chloramphenicol to the medium, even at 41 C. Divisions were observed at both normal and minicell sites. These results indicate that div52-ts and min functions share a common step in a cell division pathway. A double mutant containing div52-ts and div27-ts, a dnaB mutant which divides in the absence of DNA synthesis, was characterized. The mutant continues to divide after a shift to the high temperature, although at a reduced rate. The behavior of this hybrid mutant suggests a hypothesis that the chromosome termination signal and div52-ts division initiation signal act on a single membrane site which is altered in div27-ts strains.	0
Title: A fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 and the genetic basis for B versus C fumonisin production Abstract: Most species of Fusarium that produce fumonisin mycotoxins produce predominantly B fumonisins (FBs). However, Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 produces predominantly C fumonisins (FCs). In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster in strain O-1890 was determined. The order and orientation of FUM genes were the same as in the previously described clusters in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum. Coding regions of F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides FUM genes were 88-92% identical, but regions flanking the clusters did not share significant identity. The FUM cluster gene FUM8 encodes an alpha-oxoamine synthase, and fum8 mutants of F. verticillioides do not produce fumonisins. Complementation of a fum8 mutant with the F. verticillioidesFUM8 restored FB production. Complementation with F. oxysporumFUM8 also restored production, but the fumonisins produced were predominantly FCs. These data indicate that different orthologues of FUM8 determine whether Fusarium produces predominantly FBs or FCs.	1
Title: Cloning and molecular characterization of the gene encoding the Aureobasidin A biosynthesis complex in Aureobasidium pullulans BP-1938 Abstract: The gene (aba1) encoding the NRPS complex responsible for the synthesis of the cyclic peptide antibiotic Aureobasidin A (AbA) in Aureobasidium pullulans BP-1938, was cloned using a combination of PCR and library screening approaches. The aba1 gene was found to consist of a single, intronless open reading frame (ORF) of 34,980 bp, encoding an 11,659 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 1,286,254 Da. Putative promoter and translation start elements were identified upstream from the putative ATG in the aba1 gene, and a consensus poly(A) addition signal (AATAAA) was identified 191 bp downstream of the translation termination codon (TGA). As predicted by the structure AbA, the aba1 gene encodes an enzyme composed of nine biosynthetic modules, eight of which contain adenylation domains with recognizable amino acid specificity-conferring code elements, and four of which contain embedded methylation domains. The biosynthetic module located at position one in the aba1 gene lacks recognizable specificity-conferring code elements, consistent with it being responsible for incorporation of the 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid residue at that position in AbA. An unusual feature of the aba1 gene sequence is a very high degree of shared identity among eight of the biosynthetic modules, at both the nucleotide and amino acid level. The majority of the modules share better than 70% nucleotide identity with another module in the complex, and modules with the same amino acid adenylation specificity share up to 95% identity. Insertion of a hygromycin B phosphotransferase (HPT) gene cassette in place of the module 4 sequence in aba1 resulted in a cessation of AbA production, thus validating that the isolated gene encodes the AbA biosynthesis complex.	1
Title: Nonregular structure-property relationships for inclusion parameters of tert-butylcalix[5]arene Abstract: The effect of macrocycle size on the structure-property relationships was studied for inclusion compounds of tert-butylcalix[n]arenes (n=4,5) with volatile organic guests having various molecular size and group composition. Vapor-sorption isotherms, guest-inclusion stoichiometry and Gibbs energy, thermostability parameters and decomposition enthalpies were determined for host-guest compounds (clathrates) obtained using saturation of solid calixarene powder with guest vapor. The increase of the host macrocycle in the studied calixarene pair changes the observed structure-property relationship from the guest-binding selectivity mostly seen in inclusion Gibbs energy to the high sensitivity for guest structure in inclusion stoichiometry. The host with the larger macrocycle has more clathrates with stepwise formation and decomposition. Specific types of guest binding with solid hosts are discussed.	0
Title: Depletion of T cell epitopes in lysostaphin mitigates anti-drug antibody response and enhances antibacterial efficacy in vivo Abstract: The enzyme lysostaphin possesses potent anti-staphylococcal activity and represents a promising antibacterial drug candidate; however, its immunogenicity poses a barrier to clinical translation. Here, structure-based biomolecular design enabled widespread depletion of lysostaphin DRB1(∗)0401 restricted T cell epitopes, and resulting deimmunized variants exhibited striking reductions in anti-drug antibody responses upon administration to humanized HLA-transgenic mice. This reduced immunogenicity translated into improved efficacy in the form of protection against repeated challenges with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In contrast, while wild-type lysostaphin was efficacious against the initial MRSA infection, it failed to clear subsequent bacterial challenges that were coincident with escalating anti-drug antibody titers. These results extend the existing deimmunization literature, in which reduced immunogenicity and retained efficacy are assessed independently of each other. By correlating in vivo efficacy with longitudinal measures of anti-drug antibody development, we provide the first direct evidence that T cell epitope depletion manifests enhanced biotherapeutic efficacy.	0
Title: Protein folding, protein collapse, and tanford's transfer model: lessons from single-molecule FRET Abstract: The essential and nontrivial role of the denatured state of proteins in their folding reaction is being increasingly scrutinized in recent years. Single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments show that the denatured state undergoes a continuous collapse (or coil-to-globule) transition as the concentration of a chemical denaturant is decreased, suggesting that conformational entropy of the denatured state is an important part of the free energy of folding. Such observations question the validity of the classical Tanford transfer model, which suggests that the folding free energy can be understood solely based on the difference in amino acid solvation between the folded state and a fixed unfolded state. An alternative to the transfer model is obtained here from a polymer theoretical analysis of a series of published smFRET data. The analysis shows that the free energy of denatured-state collapse has a linear dependence on denaturant concentration, an outcome of the interplay between enthalpic and entropic contributions. Surprisingly, the slope of the free energy of collapse agrees very well with the respective slope of the free energy of folding. This conformity of values obtained from two very different measurements shows that it is the collapse transition in the denatured state which mediates the effect of denaturants on folding. The energetics of folding are thus governed by the competition of solvation and conformational entropy in the denatured state.	0
Title: The RRM1 domain of the poly(A)-binding protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is critical to control of mRNA deadenylation Abstract: The poly(A)-binding protein PAB1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays an important role in controlling mRNA deadenylation rates. Deletion of either its RRM1 or proline-rich domain (P domain) severely restricts deadenylation and slows mRNA degradation. Because these large deletions could be having unknown effects on the structure of PAB1, different strategies were used to determine the importance of the RRM1 and P domains to deadenylation. Since the P domain is quite variable in size and sequence among eukaryotes, P domains from two human PABPCs and from Xenopus were substituted for that of PAB1. The resultant PAB1 hybrid proteins, however, displayed limited or no difference in mRNA deadenylation as compared with PAB1. In contrast to the P domain, the RRM1 domain is highly conserved across species, and a systematic mutagenesis of the RRM1 domain was undertaken to identify its functional regions. Several mutations along the RNA-binding surface of RRM1 inhibited deadenylation, whereas one set of mutations on its exterior non-RNA binding surface shifted deadenylation from a slow distributive process to a rapid processive deadenylation. These results suggest that the RRM1 domain is the more critical region of PAB1 for controlling deadenylation and consists of at least two distinguishable functional regions.	0
Title: Phage display to identify Nedd8-mimicking peptides as inhibitors of the Nedd8 transfer cascade Abstract: The Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) launches the transfer of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 through an enzymatic cascade to covalently modify a diverse array of proteins, thus regulating their biological functions in the cell. The C-terminal peptide of Nedd8 extends deeply into the active site of NAE and plays an important role in the specific recognition of Nedd8 by NAE. We used phage display to profile C-terminal mutant sequences of Nedd8 that could be recognized by NAE for the activation reaction. We found that NAE can accommodate diverse changes in the Nedd8 C-terminal sequence (⁷¹ LALRGG⁷⁶), including Arg and Ile replacing Leu71, Leu, Ser, and Gln replacing Ala72, and substitutions by bulky aromatic residues at positions 73 and 74. We also observed that short peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of the Nedd8 variants can be activated by NAE to form peptide~NAE thioester conjugates. Once NAE is covalently loaded with these Nedd8-mimicking peptides, it can no longer activate full-length Nedd8 for transfer to the neddylation targets, such as the cullin subunits of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). We have thus developed a new method to inhibit protein neddylation by Nedd8-mimicking peptides.	0
Title: Cloning of the pactamycin biosynthetic gene cluster and characterization of a crucial glycosyltransferase prior to a unique cyclopentane ring formation Abstract: The biosynthetic gene (pct) cluster for an antitumor antibiotic pactamycin was identified by use of a gene for putative radical S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase as a probe. The pct gene cluster is localized to a 34 kb contiguous DNA from Streptomyces pactum NBRC 13433 and contains 24 open reading frames. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for pactamycin comprising of a unique cyclopentane ring, 3-aminoacetophenone, and 6-methylsalicylate was proposed. The pctL gene encoding a glycosyltransferase was speculated to be involved in an N-glycoside formation between 3-aminoacetophenone and UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine prior to a unique cyclopentane ring formation. The pctL gene was then heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and the enzymatic activity of the recombinant PctL protein was investigated. Consequently, the PctL protein was found to catalyze the expected reaction forming beta-N-glycoside. The enzymatic activity of the PctL protein clearly confirmed that the present identified gene cluster is for the biosynthesis of pactamycin. Also, a glycosylation prior to cyclopentane ring formation was proposed to be a general strategy in the biosynthesis of the structurally related cyclopentane containing compounds.	1
Title: Remote Photodamaging of DNA by Photoinduced Energy Transport Abstract: Local DNA photodamaging by light is well-studied and leads to a number of structurally identified direct damage, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and indirect oxidatively generated damage, such as 8-oxo-7,8-hydroxyguanine. Similar damages have now been found at remote sites, at least more than 105 Å (30 base pairs) away from the site of photoexcitation. In contrast to the established mechanisms of local DNA photodamaging, the processes of remote photodamage are only partially understood. Known pathways include those to remote oxidatively generated DNA photodamages, which were elucidated by studying electron hole transport through the DNA about 20 years ago. Recent studies with DNA photosensitizers and mechanistic proposals on photoinduced DNA-mediated energy transport are summarized in this minireview. These new mechanisms to a new type of remote DNA photodamaging provide an important extension to our general understanding to light-induced DNA damage and their mutations.	0
Title: Complexity generation in fungal peptidyl alkaloid biosynthesis: a two-enzyme pathway to the hexacyclic MDR export pump inhibitor ardeemin Abstract: Ardeemins are hexacyclic peptidyl alkaloids isolated from Aspergillus fischeri as agents that block efflux of anticancer drugs by MultiDrug Resistance (MDR) export pumps. To evaluate the biosynthetic logic and enzymatic machinery for ardeemin framework assembly, we sequenced the A. fischeri genome and identified the ardABC gene cluster. Through both genetic deletions and biochemical characterizations of purified ArdA and ArdB we show this ArdAB enzyme pair is sufficient to convert anthranilate (Ant), L-Ala, and L-Trp to ardeemin. ArdA is a 430 kDa trimodular nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) that converts the three building blocks into a fumiquinazoline (FQ) regioisomer termed ardeemin FQ. ArdB is a prenyltransferase that takes tricyclic ardeemin FQ and dimethylallyl diphosphate to the hexacyclic ardeemin scaffold via prenylation at C2 of the Trp-derived indole moiety with intramolecular capture by an amide NH of the fumiquinazoline ring. The two-enzyme ArdAB pathway reveals remarkable efficiency in construction of the hexacyclic peptidyl alkaloid scaffold.	1
Title: On-line monitoring of nitrogenase activity in cyanobacteria by sensitive laser photoacoustic detection of ethylene Abstract: A new and extremely sensitive method for measuring nitrogenase activity through acetylene reduction is presented. Ethylene produced by nitrogenase-mediated reduction of acetylene is detected by using laser photoacoustics (LPA). This method possesses a detection limit making it 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional gas chromatographic analysis. Photoacoustic detection is based on the strong and unique absorption pattern of ethylene in the CO(inf2) laser wavelength region (9 to 11 (mu)m). The high sensitivity allowed on-line monitoring of nitrogenase activity in a culture of the heterocystous cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena, which was isolated from a water bloom in the Baltic Sea. This setup makes it unnecessary to take subsamples from the culture and avoids long incubations in sealed vials. The fast response of the LPA technique allows measurement of real-time dynamic changes of nitrogenase activity. The method was used to analyze in vivo saturation of nitrogenase by acetylene in N. spumigena. It is demonstrated that 20% acetylene does not saturate nitrogenase and that the degree of saturation depends on light intensity. With concentrations of acetylene as low as 2.5% it is possible to assess the degree of saturation and to extrapolate to total nitrogenase activity. In N. spumigena nitrogenase activity becomes independent of light intensity above 20 to 80 (mu)mol of photons m(sup-2) s(sup-1) at 20% O(inf2).	0
Title: Effects of geminal methyl groups on the tunnelling rates in the ring opening of cyclopropylcarbinyl radical at cryogenic temperature Abstract: CVT + SCT calculations on the rate of tunnelling at 20 K in the ring opening of cyclopropylcarbinyl radical, substituted with geminal methyl groups at a ring carbon (1b), have been performed. The calculations predict that, contrary to expectations based on the effect of mass on the rate of tunnelling, the geminal methyl substituents in 1b should make the rate of ring opening to 1,1-dimethyl-3-butenyl radical (2b) 10(4) times faster than the rate of ring opening of unsubstituted cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (1a) to 3-butenyl radical (2a) and almost 10(6) times faster than the rate of ring opening of 1b to 2,2-dimethyl-3-butenyl radical (2c). The reasons for these unexpected findings are discussed.	0
Title: Oxepinamide F biosynthesis involves enzymatic D-aminoacyl epimerization, 3H-oxepin formation, and hydroxylation induced double bond migration Abstract: Oxepinamides are derivatives of anthranilyl-containing tripeptides and share an oxepin ring and a fused pyrimidinone moiety. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the elucidation of an oxepinamide biosynthetic pathway and conversion of a quinazolinone to a pyrimidinone-fused 1H-oxepin framework by a cytochrome P450 enzyme in fungal natural product biosynthesis. Here we report the isolation of oxepinamide F from Aspergillus ustus and identification of its biosynthetic pathway by gene deletion, heterologous expression, feeding experiments, and enzyme assays. The nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) OpaA assembles the quinazolinone core with D-Phe incorporation. The cytochrome P450 enzyme OpaB catalyzes alone the oxepin ring formation. The flavoenzyme OpaC installs subsequently one hydroxyl group at the oxepin ring, accompanied by double bond migration. The epimerase OpaE changes the D-Phe residue back to L-form, which is essential for the final methylation by OpaF.	1
Title: Arixanthomycins A-C: Phylogeny-guided discovery of biologically active eDNA-derived pentangular polyphenols Abstract: Soil microbiomes are a rich source of uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Here we use short conserved biosynthetic gene sequences (natural product sequence tags) amplified from soil microbiomes as phylogenetic markers to correlate genotype to chemotype and target the discovery of novel bioactive pentangular polyphenols from the environment. The heterologous expression of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster (the ARX cluster), whose ketosynthase beta (KSβ) sequence tag was phylogenetically distinct from any known KSβ sequence, led to the discovery of the arixanthomycins. Arixanthomycin A (1) exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines.	1
Title: Identification of novel metabolites from Aspergillus flavus by high resolution and multiple stage mass spectrometry Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavus is one of the most important species in the Aspergillus genus and is distributed worldwide as a prevalent aflatoxin-producing food and feed contaminant. A. flavus contains more than 55 gene clusters that are predicted to encode proteins involved in secondary metabolite production. One of these, cluster 27, contains a polyketide synthase (pks27) gene that encodes a protein that is highly homologous to the aflatoxin cluster PKS. Comparative metabolomics, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) was used to detect metabolites differentially expressed in the A. flavus wild-type and ∆pks27 mutant strains. Metabolite profiling was aided by a statistical differential analysis of MS data using SIEVE software. This differential analysis combined with accurate mass data from the Orbitrap and ion trap multiple stage MS allowed four metabolites to be identified that were produced only by the wild-type culture. These included asparasone A (358 Da), an anthraquinone pigment, and related anthraquinones with masses of 316, 340 and 374 Da. These latter three compounds had similar fragmentation patterns to that of asparasone A. The 316 Da anthraquinone is particularly interesting because it is most likely formed by incorporation of seven malonyl-CoA units rather than the eight units required for the formation of asparasone A. The 340 and 374 Da metabolites are the dehydration and an oxy-derivative of asparasone A, respectively. Asparasone A was also identified in extracts from several other Aspergillus species.	1
Title: An improved assay for rapid detection of viable Staphylococcus aureus cells by incorporating surfactant and PMA treatments in qPCR Abstract: Background:                       Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen causing a variety of life-threatening diseases. Rapid and accurate detection of Staphylococcus aureus is a necessity for prevention of outbreaks caused by this pathogen. PCR is a useful tool for rapid detection of foodborne pathogens, however, its inability to differentiate DNA from dead cells and live cells in amplification severely limits its application in pathogen detection. The aim of this study was to develop an improved assay was developed by incorporating the sample treatments with a surfactant and propidium monoazide (PMA) in qPCR for detection of viable S. aureus cells.                  Results:                       The cell toxic effect testing with the two surfactants showed that the viability of S. aureus was virtually not affected by the treatment with 0.5% triton x-100 or 0.025% sarkosyl. Triton x-100 was coupled with PMA for sample treatments for detection of viable S. aureus cells in artificially contaminated milk. The qPCR results indicated that the assay reached high an amplification efficiency of 98.44% and the live S. aureus cells were accurately detected from the triton-treated spiked milk samples by the PMA-qPCR assay.                  Conclusions:                       The qPCR assay combined with treatments of PMA and surfactants offers a sensitive and accurate means for detection of viable S. aureus cells. Cell toxic effect testing with the two surfactants showed that the viability of S. aureus was virtually not affected by the treatment with 0.5% triton x-100 or 0.025% sarkosyl. The information on sample treatment with surfactants to improve the dead cell DNA removal efficiency in qPCR by increasing PMA's permeability to dead cells can be used for other pathogens, especially for Gram-positive bacteria.	0
Title: Production of the Bengamide Class of Marine Natural Products in Myxobacteria: Biosynthesis and Structure-Activity Relationships Abstract: The bengamides, sponge-derived natural products that have been characterized as inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs), have been intensively investigated as anticancer compounds. We embarked on a multidisciplinary project to supply bengamides by fermentation of the terrestrial myxobacterium M. virescens, decipher their biosynthesis, and optimize their properties as drug leads. The characterization of the biosynthetic pathway revealed that bacterial resistance to bengamides is conferred by Leu 154 of the myxobacterial MetAP protein, and enabled transfer of the entire gene cluster into the more suitable production host M. xanthus DK1622. A combination of semisynthesis of microbially derived bengamides and total synthesis resulted in an optimized derivative that combined high cellular potency in the nanomolar range with high metabolic stability, which translated to an improved half-life in mice and antitumor efficacy in a melanoma mouse model.	1
Title: Identification of diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters and functional analysis of labdane-related diterpene cyclases in Phomopsis amygdali Abstract: Two diterpene biosynthesis gene clusters in the fusicoccin-producing fungus, Phomopsis amygdali, were identified by genome walking from PaGGS1 and PaGGS4 which encode the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthases. The diterpene cyclase-like genes, PaDC1 and PaDC2, were respectively located proximal to PaGGS1 and PaGGS4. The amino acid sequences of these two enzymes were similar to those of fungal labdane-related diterpene cyclases. Recombinant PaDC1 converted GGDP mainly into phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol via (+)-copalyl diphosphate (CDP) and trace amounts of several labdane-related hydrocarbons which had been identified from the P. amygdali F6 mycelia. Since phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol had not been identified in P. amygdali F6 mycelia, we isolated phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol from the mycelia. Recombinant PaDC2 converted GGDP into (+)-CDP. Furthermore, we isolated the novel diterpenoid, phyllocladan-11 alpha,16 alpha,18-triol, which is a possible metabolite of phyllocladan-16 alpha-ol in the mycelia. We propose that genome walking offers a useful strategy for the discovery of novel natural products in fungi.	1
Title: An archaebacterial ATPase, homologous to ATPases in the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome, activates protein breakdown by 20 S proteasomes Abstract: In eukaryotes, the 20 S proteasome is the proteolytic core of the 26 S proteasome, which degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent process. Archaebacteria lack ubiquitin and 26 S proteasomes but do contain 20 S proteasomes. Many archaebacteria, such as Methanococcus jannaschii, also contain a gene (S4) that is highly homologous to the six ATPases in the 19 S (PA700) component of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. To test if this putative ATPase may regulate proteasome function, we expressed it in Escherichia coli and purified the 50-kDa product as a 650-kDa complex with ATPase activity. When mixed with the well characterized 20 S proteasomes from Thermoplasma acidophilum and ATP, this complex stimulated degradation of several unfolded proteins 8-25-fold. It also stimulated proteolysis by 20 S proteasomes from another archaebacterium and mammals. This effect required ATP hydrolysis since ADP and the nonhydrolyzable analog, 5'-adenylyl beta, gamma-imidophosphate, were ineffective. CTP and to a lesser extent GTP and UTP were also hydrolyzed and also stimulated proteolysis. We therefore named this complex PAN for proteasome-activating nucleotidase. However, PAN did not promote the degradation of small peptides, which, unlike proteins, should readily diffuse into the proteasome. This ATPase complex appears to have been the evolutionary precursor of the eukaryotic 19 S complex, before the coupling of proteasome function to ubiquitination.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the ravidomycin and chrysomycin biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: The gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of two antitumor antibiotics, ravidomycin and chrysomycin, have been cloned from Streptomyces ravidus and Streptomyces albaduncus, respectively. Sequencing of the 33.28 kb DNA region of the cosmid cosRav32 and the 34.65 kb DNA region of cosChry1-1 and cosChryF2 revealed 36 and 35 open reading frames (ORFs), respectively, harboring tandem sets of type II polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, D-ravidosamine and D-virenose biosynthetic genes, post-PKS tailoring genes, regulatory genes, and genes of unknown function. The isolated ravidomycin gene cluster was confirmed to be involved in ravidomycin biosynthesis through the production of a new analogue of ravidomycin along with anticipated pathway intermediates and biosynthetic shunt products upon heterologous expression of the cosmid, cosRav32, in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The identity of the cluster was further verified through cross complementation of gilvocarcin V (GV) mutants. Similarly, the chrysomycin gene cluster was demonstrated to be indirectly involved in chrysomycin biosynthesis through cross-complementation of gilvocarcin mutants deficient in the oxygenases GilOII, GilOIII, and GilOIV with the respective chrysomycin monooxygenase homologues. The ravidomycin glycosyltransferase (RavGT) appears to be able to transfer both amino- and neutral sugars, exemplified through the structurally distinct 6-membered D-ravidosamine and 5-membered D-fucofuranose, to the coumarin-based polyketide derived backbone. These results expand the library of biosynthetic genes involved in the biosyntheses of gilvocarcin class compounds that can be used to generate novel analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Differential regulation of the alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha IIb beta 3 integrin genes during megakaryocytic differentiation of pluripotential K562 cells Abstract: Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha IIb beta 3 integrin genes is differentially regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation of pluripotent K562 cells induced with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Upon megakaryocytic differentiation, steady-state alpha 2 mRNA increased markedly from the undetectable level present in the uninduced cells. The level of beta 1 mRNA did not change. Expression of alpha IIb beta 3 is regulated differently. beta 3 mRNA was undetectable in uninduced cells but increased significantly following induction. alpha IIb mRNA was detectable at a low level prior to induction, but at an increased level following differentiation. Altered mRNA stability did not contribute to changes in mRNA levels. Nuclear run-off experiments revealed a 20-fold increase in alpha 2 gene transcription upon megakaryocytic differentiation, but no change in transcription of the beta 1 gene. Transcription of both the alpha IIb and beta 3 genes increased 10- and 5-fold, respectively. Thus, the increase in alpha 2 beta 1 protein which accompanies the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is a consequence of the increased steady-state level of alpha 2 mRNA due to transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 gene. The long-lived beta 1 mRNA is not altered during differentiation. In contrast, increased alpha IIb beta 3 protein appears due to increased steady-state levels of both alpha IIb and beta 3 mRNAs that result from transcriptional activation of both integrin genes.	0
Title: Aryl Group Transfer from Tetraarylborato Anions to an Electrophilic Dicopper(I) Center and Mixed-Valence μ-Aryl Dicopper(I,II) Complexes Abstract: The synthesis of discrete, cationic binuclear μ-aryl dicopper complexes [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ar)DPFN]X (Ar = C6H5, 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3, and C6F5; DPFN = 2,7-bis(fluoro-di(2-pyridyl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridine; X = BAr4(-) and NTf2(-); Tf = SO2CF3) was achieved by treatment of a dicopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-NCCH3)DPFN]X2 (X = PF6(-) and NTf2(-)) with tetraarylborates. Structural characterization revealed symmetrically bridging aryl groups, and (1)H NMR spectroscopy evidenced the same structure in solution at 24 °C. Electrochemical investigation of the resulting arylcopper complexes uncovered reversible redox events that led to the synthesis and isolation of a rare mixed-valence organocopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ph)DPFN](NTf2)2 in high yield. The solid-state structure of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex exhibits inequivalent copper centers, despite a short Cu···Cu distance. Electronic and variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex suggest that the degree of spin localization is temperature-dependent, with a high degree of spin localization observed at lower temperatures. Electronic structure calculations agree with the experimental results and suggest that the spin is localized almost entirely on one metal center.	0
Title: Chemical probes identify a role for histone deacetylase 3 in Friedreich's ataxia gene silencing Abstract: We recently identified a class of pimelic diphenylamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that show promise as therapeutics in the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and Huntington's disease. Here, we describe chemical approaches to identify the HDAC enzyme target of these inhibitors. Incubation of a trifunctional activity-based probe with a panel of class I and class II recombinant HDAC enzymes, followed by click chemistry addition of a fluorescent dye and gel electrophoresis, identifies HDAC3 as a unique high-affinity target of the probe. Photoaffinity labeling in a nuclear extract prepared from human lymphoblasts with the trifunctional probe, followed by biotin addition through click chemistry, streptavidin enrichment, and Western blotting also identifies HDAC3 as the preferred cellular target of the inhibitor. Additional inhibitors with different HDAC specificity profiles were synthesized, and results from transcription experiments in FRDA cells point to a unique role for HDAC3 in gene silencing in Friedreich's ataxia.	0
Title: Starter unit choice determines the production of two tetraene macrolides, rimocidin and CE-108, in Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108 Abstract: Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108, a newly isolated strain, produces two closely related tetraene macrolides (rimocidin and CE-108) as well as oxytetracycline. A region of 19,065 base pairs of DNA from the S. diastaticus var. 108 genome was isolated, sequenced, and characterized. Ten complete genes and one truncated ORF were located. Disruption of these genes proved that this genomic region is part of the biosynthetic cluster for the two tetraenes. The choice of starter units by the loading module and the in vivo availability of the starter metabolites are crucial for the final ratio of the two macrolides. A second type I PKS, unrelated to tetraene biosynthesis, was also identified; disruption of these genes suggests that they would code for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a polyketide that might compete metabolically with rimocidin production.	1
Title: Identification, heterologous production and bioactivity of lentinulin A and dendrothelin A, two natural variants of backbone N-methylated peptide macrocycle omphalotin A Abstract: Backbone N-methylation and macrocyclization improve the pharmacological properties of peptides by enhancing their proteolytic stability, membrane permeability and target selectivity. Borosins are backbone N-methylated peptide macrocycles derived from a precursor protein which contains a peptide α-N-methyltransferase domain autocatalytically modifying the core peptide located at its C-terminus. Founding members of borosins are the omphalotins from the mushroom Omphalotus olearius (omphalotins A-I) with nine out of 12 L-amino acids being backbone N-methylated. The omphalotin biosynthetic gene cluster codes for the precursor protein OphMA, the protease prolyloligopeptidase OphP and other proteins that are likely to be involved in other post-translational modifications of the peptide. Mining of available fungal genome sequences revealed the existence of highly homologous gene clusters in the basidiomycetes Lentinula edodes and Dendrothele bispora. The respective borosins, referred to as lentinulins and dendrothelins are naturally produced by L. edodes and D. bispora as shown by analysis of respective mycelial extracts. We produced all three homologous peptide natural products by coexpression of OphMA hybrid proteins and OphP in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant peptides differ in their nematotoxic activity against the plant pathogen Meloidogyne incognita. Our findings pave the way for the production of borosin peptide natural products and their potential application as novel biopharmaceuticals and biopesticides.	1
Title: Diversity and plasticity of the intracellular plant pathogen and insect symbiont "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" as revealed by hypervariable prophage genes with intragenic tandem repeats Abstract: "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" is a psyllid-transmitted, phloem-limited alphaproteobacterium and the most prevalent species of "Ca. Liberibacter" associated with a devastating worldwide citrus disease known as huanglongbing (HLB). Two related and hypervariable genes (hyv(I) and hyv(II)) were identified in the prophage regions of the Psy62 "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" genome. Sequence analyses of the hyv(I) and hyv(II) genes in 35 "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" DNA isolates collected globally revealed that the hyv(I) gene contains up to 12 nearly identical tandem repeats (NITRs, 132 bp) and 4 partial repeats, while hyv(II) contains up to 2 NITRs and 4 partial repeats and shares homology with hyv(I). Frequent deletions or insertions of these repeats within the hyv(I) and hyv(II) genes were observed, none of which disrupted the open reading frames. Sequence conservation within the individual repeats but an extensive variation in repeat numbers, rearrangement, and the sequences flanking the repeat region indicate the diversity and plasticity of "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" bacterial populations in the world. These differences were found not only in samples of distinct geographical origins but also in samples from a single origin and even from a single "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"-infected sample. This is the first evidence of different "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" populations coexisting in a single HLB-affected sample. The Florida "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" isolates contain both hyv(I) and hyv(II), while all other global "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" isolates contain either one or the other. Interclade assignments of the putative Hyv(I) and Hyv(II) proteins from Florida isolates with other global isolates in phylogenetic trees imply multiple "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" populations in the world and a multisource introduction of the "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" bacterium into Florida.	0
Title: The same mutation in Gsalpha and transducin alpha reveals behavioral differences between these highly homologous G protein alpha-subunits Abstract: Mutating Arg-238 to Glu (R238E) in the switch 3 region of a transducin alpha (*Talpha) in which 27 aa of the GTPase domain have been replaced with those of the alpha-subunit of the inhibitory G protein 1 (Gi1alpha), was reported to create an alpha-subunit that is resistant to activation by GTPgammaS, is devoid of resident nucleotide, and has dominant negative (DN) properties. In an attempt to create a DN stimultory G protein alpha (Gsalpha) with a single mutation we created Gsalpha-R265E, equivalent to *Talpha-R238E. Gsalpha-R265E has facilitated activation by GTPgammaS, a slightly facilitated activation by GTP but much reduced receptor plus GTP stimulated activation, and an apparently unaltered ability to interact with receptor as seen in ligand binding studies. Further, the activity profile of Gsalpha-R265E is that of an alpha-subunit with unaltered or increased GTPase activity. The only change in Gsalpha that is similar to that in *Talpha is that the apparent affinity for guanine nucleotides is decreased in both proteins. The molecular basis of the changed properties are discussed based on the known crystal structure of Gsalpha and the changes introduced by the same mutation in a *Talpha (Gtalpha*) with only 23 aa from Gi1alpha. Gtalpha*-R238E, with four fewer mutations in switch 3, was reported to show no evidence of DN properties, is activated by GTPgammaS, and has reduced GTPase activity. The data highlight a critical role for the switch 3 region in setting overall properties of signal-transducing GTPases.	0
Title: C-Methylation of S-adenosyl-L-Methionine Occurs Prior to Cyclopropanation in the Biosynthesis of 1-Amino-2-Methylcyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (Norcoronamic Acid) in a Bacterium Abstract: Many pharmacologically important peptides are bacterial or fungal in origin and contain nonproteinogenic amino acid (NPA) building blocks. Recently, it was reported that, in bacteria, a cyclopropane-containing NPA 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) is produced from the L-methionine moiety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) by non-canonical ACC-forming enzymes. On the other hand, it has been suggested that a monomethylated ACC analogue, 2-methyl-ACC (MeACC), is derived from L-valine. Therefore, we have investigated the MeACC biosynthesis by identifying a gene cluster containing bacterial MeACC synthase genes. In this gene cluster, we identified two genes, orf29 and orf30, which encode a cobalamin (B12)-dependent radical SAM methyltransferase and a bacterial ACC synthase, respectively, and were found to be involved in the MeACC biosynthesis. In vitro analysis using their recombinant enzymes (rOrf29 and rOrf30) further revealed that the ACC structure of MeACC was derived from the L-methionine moiety of SAM, rather than L-valine. In addition, rOrf29 was found to catalyze the C-methylation of the L-methionine moiety of SAM. The resulting methylated derivative of SAM was then converted into MeACC by rOrf30. Thus, we demonstrate that C-methylation of SAM occurs prior to cyclopropanation in the biosynthesis of a bacterial MeACC (norcoronamic acid).	1
Title: Aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster gene cypA is required for G aflatoxin formation Abstract: Aspergillus flavus isolates produce only aflatoxins B1 and B2, while Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus nomius produce aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2. Sequence comparison of the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway gene cluster upstream from the polyketide synthase gene, pksA, revealed that A. flavus isolates are missing portions of genes (cypA and norB) predicted to encode, respectively, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and an aryl alcohol dehydrogenase. Insertional disruption of cypA in A. parasiticus yielded transformants that lack the ability to produce G aflatoxins but not B aflatoxins. The enzyme encoded by cypA has highest amino acid identity to Gibberella zeae Tri4 (38%), a P450 monooxygenase previously shown to be involved in trichodiene epoxidation. The substrate for CypA may be an intermediate formed by oxidative cleavage of the A ring of O-methylsterigmatocystin by OrdA, the P450 monooxygenase required for formation of aflatoxins B1 and B2.	1
Title: Scalable Biosynthesis of the Seaweed Neurochemical, Kainic Acid Abstract: Kainic acid, the flagship member of the kainoid family of natural neurochemicals, is a widely used neuropharmacological agent that helped unravel the key role of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including the kainate receptor, in the central nervous system. Worldwide shortages of this seaweed natural product in the year 2000 prompted numerous chemical syntheses, including scalable preparations with as few as six-steps. Herein we report the discovery and characterization of the concise two-enzyme biosynthetic pathway to kainic acid from l-glutamic acid and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate in red macroalgae and show that the biosynthetic genes are co-clustered in genomes of Digenea simplex and Palmaria palmata. Moreover, we applied a key biosynthetic α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme in a biotransformation methodology to efficiently construct kainic acid on the gram scale. This study establishes both the feasibility of mining seaweed genomes for their biotechnological prowess.	1
Title: Cell-Compatible Nanoprobes for Imaging Intracellular Phosphatase Activities Abstract: Phosphatases play an important role in cell biology, but only a few probes are suitable for selectively imaging phosphatase activity in live cells, because the current probes require cell fixation or exhibit considerable cytotoxicity. Herein, we show that conjugating a d-peptide to a quinazolinone derivative generates cell-compatible, biostable probes for imaging the phosphatase activity inside live cells. Moreover, our results show that inhibiting ectophosphatases is a critical factor for imaging intracellular phosphatases. As the first example of using selective inhibitors to ensure intracellular function of molecular probes, this work illustrates a facile approach to design molecular probes for profiling the activities of enzymes in a spatial, selective manner in a complicated environment.	0
Title: Enantioselective copper-catalyzed construction of aryl pyrroloindolines via an arylation-cyclization cascade Abstract: An enantioselective arylation-cyclization cascade has been accomplished using a combination of diaryliodonium salts and asymmetric copper catalysis. These mild catalytic conditions provide a new strategy for the enantioselective construction of pyrroloindolines, an important alkaloid structural motif that is commonly found among biologically active natural products.	0
Title: Characterization of Methanobactin from Methylosinus sp. LW4 Abstract: Methanobactins (Mbns) are a growing family of ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified natural products. Characteristic nitrogen-containing heterocycles and neighboring thioamides allow these compounds to bind copper with high affinity. Genome mining has enabled the identification of Mbn operons in bacterial genomes and the prediction of diverse Mbn structures from operon content and precursor peptide sequence. Here we report the characterization of Mbn from Methylosinus (Ms.) species (sp.) LW4. The peptide backbone is distinct from all previously characterized Mbns, and the post-translational modifications correspond precisely to those predicted on the basis of the Ms. sp. LW4 Mbn operon. Thus, prediction based on genome analysis combined with isolation and structural characterization represents a phylogenetic approach to finding diverse Mbns and elucidating their biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Functional analysis of a prenyltransferase gene (paxD) in the paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Paxilline is an indole-diterpene produced by Penicillium paxilli. Six genes (paxB, C, G, M, P, and Q) in paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster were previously shown to be responsible for paxilline biosynthesis. In this study, we have characterized paxD, which is located next to paxQ and has weak similarities to fungal dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase genes. PaxD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the purified enzyme was used for in vitro analysis. When paxilline and dimethylallyl diphosphate were used as substrates, one major and one minor product, which were identified as di-prenyl paxilline and mono-prenyl paxilline by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, were formed. The structure of the major product was determined to be 21,22-diprenylated paxilline, showing that PaxD catalyzed the successive di-prenylation. Traces of both products were detected in culture broth of P. paxilli by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The enzyme is likely to be a dimer and required no divalent cations. The optimum pH and temperature were 8.0 and 37 °C, respectively. The Km values were calculated as 106.4 ± 5.4 μM for paxilline and 0.57 ± 0.02 μM for DMAPP with a kcat of 0.97 ± 0.01/s.	1
Title: Rufomycins or Ilamycins: Naming Clarifications and Definitive Structural Assignments Abstract: Rufomycin and ilamycin are synonymous for the same class of cyclopeptides, currently encompassing 33 structurally characterized isolates and 9 semisynthetic derivatives. Elucidation of new structures prioritized the consolidation of the names and established the structures of four diastereoisomeric rufomycins with a 2-piperidinone, named rufomycins 4-7, including full 1H/13C NMR assignments. The characteristic HSQC cross-peak for the CH-5, the hemiaminal carbon in amino acid #5, allows assignment of the stereocenters C-4 and C-5 within this ring. Semisynthetic derivatives (rufomycinSS 1, 2, and 3) were prepared from a rufomycins 4 and 6 mixture to validate the structural assignments. Based on the X-ray crystal structures of rufomycins 2 and 4, considering the NMR differences of rufomycins 7 vs 4-6 compared to rufomycinSS 1 vs 2 and 3, and taking into account that two major conformers, A and B, occur in both rufomycinSS 2 and 3, structural modeling was pursued. Collectively, this paper discusses the NMR spectroscopic differences of the stereoisomers and their possible 3D conformers and correlates these with the anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity. In addition, a look at the history prioritizes names and numbering schemes for this group of antibiotics and leads to consolidated nomenclature for all currently known members, natural and semisynthetic derivatives, and serves to accommodate future discoveries.	0
Title: Bacteriophage T4D receptors and the Escherichia coli cell wall structure: role of spherical particles and protein b of the cell wall in bacteriophage infection Abstract: The nature of the interaction of bacteriophage T4D and the outer cell wall of its host, Escherichia coli B, has been investigated. Bacteria with altered or modified cell walls have been obtained by two different growth procedures: (i) growth in high osmolarity medium or (ii) growth in broth in the presence of divalent heavy metal ions. When these altered host cells were washed and subsequently added to regular growth medium, they interacted with added phage particles, but successful infection did not occur. Most of the phage particles released from these treated cells were observed to have full heads and an altered tail structure. The altered phage tails had contracted sheaths and unusual pieces of the bacterial cell wall attached to the distal portion of the exposed phage tail tube. Phage released from bacteria grown in the high osmolarity medium had attached cell wall pieces of two major types, these pieces being either 40 or 21 nm in diameter. The smaller-type cell wall pieces (21 nm) were formed by three spheres each measuring 7 nm in diameter. Phage particles released from cells previously exposed to the divalent metal ions had only one 7-nm cell wall sphere attached to the distal end of the tail tube. It was found that these 7-nm spheres (i) are normal components of the cell wall and are morphologically similar to endotoxin, (ii) are held in place on the cell wall by a component of the cell wall called protein b, and (iii) are most likely the site of penetration of the phage tail tube through which the phage DNA enters the host cell.	0
Title: Sphaerocyclamide, a prenylated cyanobactin from the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249 Abstract: Cyanobactins are a family of linear and cyclic peptides produced through the post-translational modification of short precursor peptides. A mass spectrometry-based screening of potential cyanobactin producers led to the discovery of a new prenylated member of this family of compounds, sphaerocyclamide (1), from Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249. The sphaerocyclamide biosynthetic gene cluster (sph) encoding the novel macrocyclic prenylated cyanobactin, was sequenced. Heterologous expression of the sph gene cluster in Escherichia coli confirmed the connection between genomic and mass spectrometric data. Unambiguous establishment of the orientation and site of prenylation required the full structural elucidation of 1 using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which demonstrated that a forward prenylation occurred on the tyrosine residue. Compound 1 was tested in pharmacologically or ecologically relevant biological assays and revealed moderate antimicrobial activity towards the fouling bacterium Halomonas aquamarina CECT 5000.	1
Title: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Title: Characterization of an Orphan Type III Polyketide Synthase Conserved in Uncultivated "Entotheonella" Sponge Symbionts Abstract: Uncultivated bacterial symbionts from the candidate genus "Entotheonella" have been shown to produce diverse natural products previously attributed to their sponge hosts. In addition to these known compounds, "Entotheonella" genomes contain rich sets of biosynthetic gene clusters that lack identified natural products. Among these is a small type III polyketide synthase (PKS) cluster, one of only three clusters present in all known "Entotheonella" genomes. This conserved "Entotheonella" PKS (cep) cluster encodes the type III PKS CepA and the putative methyltransferase CepB. Herein, the characterization of CepA as an enzyme involved in phenolic lipid biosynthesis is reported. In vitro analysis showed a specificity for alkyl starter substrates and the production of tri- and tetraketide pyrones and tetraketide resorcinols. The conserved distribution of the cep cluster suggests an important role for the phenolic lipid polyketides produced in "Entotheonella" variants.	1
Title: Remarkable and Unexpected Mechanism for ( S)-3-Amino-4-(difluoromethylenyl)cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic Acid as a Selective Inactivator of Human Ornithine Aminotransferase Abstract: Human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that was recently found to play an important role in the metabolic reprogramming of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the proline and glutamine metabolic pathways. The selective inhibition of hOAT by compound 10 exhibited potent in vivo antitumor activity. Inspired by the discovery of the aminotransferase inactivator (1S,3S)-3-amino-4-(difluoromethylene)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (5), we rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of six-membered-ring analogs. Among them, 14 was identified as a new selective hOAT inactivator, which demonstrated a potency 22× greater than that of 10. Three different types of protein mass spectrometry approaches and two crystallographic approaches were employed to identify the structure of hOAT-14 and the formation of a remarkable final adduct (32') in the active site. These spectral studies reveal an enzyme complex heretofore not observed in a PLP-dependent enzyme, which has covalent bonds to two nearby residues. Crystal soaking experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to identify the structure of the active-site intermediate 27' and elucidate the order of the two covalent bonds that formed, leading to 32'. The initial covalent reaction of the activated warhead occurs with *Thr322 from the second subunit, followed by a subsequent nucleophilic attack by the catalytic residue Lys292. The turnover mechanism of 14 by hOAT was supported by a mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites and fluoride ion release experiments. This novel mechanism for hOAT with 14 will contribute to the further rational design of selective inactivators and an understanding of potential inactivation mechanisms by aminotransferases.	0
Title: Refactored genetic codes enable bidirectional genetic isolation Abstract: The near-universal genetic code defines the correspondence between codons in genes and amino acids in proteins. We refactored the structure of the genetic code in Escherichia coli and created orthogonal genetic codes that restrict the escape of synthetic genetic information into natural life. We developed orthogonal and mutually orthogonal horizontal gene transfer systems, which permit the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use the same genetic code but restrict the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use different genetic codes. Moreover, we showed that locking refactored codes into synthetic organisms completely blocks invasion by mobile genetic elements, including viruses, which carry their own translation factors and successfully invade organisms with canonical and compressed genetic codes.	0
Title: 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-5-fluorocytidine inhibits duck hepatitis B virus reverse transcription and suppresses viral DNA synthesis in hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo Abstract: beta-L-Nucleoside analogs represent a new class of potent antiviral agents with low cytotoxicity which provide new hope in the therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. We evaluated the anti-HBV activity of 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-5-fluorocytidine (beta-L-F-ddC), a beta-L-nucleoside analog derived from 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), in the duck HBV (DHBV) model. This compound was previously shown to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis in a stably transfected hepatoma cell line (F2215). Using a cell-free system for the expression of an enzymatically active DHBV polymerase, we could demonstrate that the triphosphate form of beta-L-F-ddC does inhibit hepadnavirus reverse transcription. In primary duck hepatocyte culture, beta-L-F-ddC showed a potent inhibitory effect on DHBV DNA synthesis which was concentration dependent. Although beta-L-F-ddC was shown to be less active than ddC against the DHBV reverse transcriptase in vitro, beta-L-F-ddC was a stronger inhibitor in hepatocytes. The oral administration of beta-L-F-ddC in experimentally infected ducklings showed that beta-L-F-ddC is a potent inhibitor of viral replication in vivo. Short-term therapy could not prevent a rebound of viral replication after the drug was withdrawn. Preventive therapy with beta-L-F-ddC could delay the onset of viremia by only 1 day compared with the time to the onset of viremia in the control group. The in vivo inhibitory effect of beta-L-F-ddC was much stronger than that of ddC and was not associated with signs of toxicity. Our data show that beta-L-F-ddC inhibits hepadnavirus reverse transcription and is a strong inhibitor of viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.	0
Title: Derivatives of salarin A, salarin C and tulearin A--Fascaplysinopsis sp. metabolites Abstract: Derivatives of salarin A, salarin C and tulearin A, three new cytotoxic sponge derived nitrogenous macrolides, were prepared and bio-evaluated as inhibitors of K562 leukemia cells. Interesting preliminary SAR (structure activity relationship) information was obtained from the products. The most sensitive functionalities were the 16,17-vinyl epoxide in both salarins, the triacylamino group in salarin A and the oxazole in salarin C (less sensitive). Regioselectivity of reactions was also found for tulearin A.	0
Title: Guttation capsules containing hydrogen peroxide: an evolutionarily conserved NADPH oxidase gains a role in wars between related fungi Abstract: When resources are limited, the hypocrealean fungus Trichoderma guizhouense can overgrow another hypocrealean fungus Fusarium oxysporum, cause sporadic cell death and arrest growth. A transcriptomic analysis of this interaction shows that T. guizhouense undergoes a succession of metabolic stresses while F. oxysporum responded relatively neutrally but used the constitutive expression of several toxin-encoding genes as a protective strategy. Because of these toxins, T. guizhouense cannot approach it is potential host on the substrate surface and attacks F. oxysporum from above. The success of T. guizhouense is secured by the excessive production of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), which is stored in microscopic bag-like guttation droplets hanging on the contacting hyphae. The deletion of NADPH oxidase nox1 and its regulator, nor1 in T. guizhouense led to a substantial decrease in H2 O2 formation with concomitant loss of antagonistic activity. We envision the role of NOX proteins in the antagonism of T. guizhouense as an example of metabolic exaptation evolved in this fungus because the primary function of these ancient proteins was probably not linked to interfungal relationships. In support of this, F. oxysporum showed almost no transcriptional response to T. guizhouense Δnox1 strain indicating the role of NOX/H2 O2 in signalling and fungal communication.	0
Title: A new family of iron-dependent halogenases acts on freestanding substrates Abstract: Regio- and stereospecific incorporation of a halogen atom to an unactivated sp(3) carbon in a freestanding molecule is a challenging transformation that is currently missing in the inventory of enzyme-mediated reactions. Here we report what is to our knowledge the first example of a nonheme iron enzyme (WelO5) in the welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathway that can monochlorinate an aliphatic carbon in 12-epi-fischerindole U and 12-epi-hapalindole C, substrates that are free from peptidyl or acyl carrier protein.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analyses of the vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis Abstract: Background:                       Amycolatopsis orientalis is the type species of the genus and its industrial strain HCCB10007, derived from ATCC 43491, has been used for large-scale production of the vital antibiotic vancomycin. However, to date, neither the complete genomic sequence of this species nor a systemic characterization of the vancomycin biosynthesis cluster (vcm) has been reported. With only the whole genome sequence of Amycolatopsis mediterranei available, additional complete genomes of other species may facilitate intra-generic comparative analysis of the genus.                  Results:                       The complete genome of A. orientalis HCCB10007 comprises an 8,948,591-bp circular chromosome and a 33,499-bp dissociated plasmid. In total, 8,121 protein-coding sequences were predicted, and the species-specific genomic features of A. orientalis were analyzed in comparison with that of A. mediterranei. The common characteristics of Amycolatopsis genomes were revealed via intra- and inter-generic comparative genomic analyses within the domain of actinomycetes, and led directly to the development of sequence-based Amycolatopsis molecular chemotaxonomic characteristics (MCCs). The chromosomal core/quasi-core and non-core configurations of the A. orientalis and the A. mediterranei genome were analyzed reciprocally, with respect to further understanding both the discriminable criteria and the evolutionary implementation. In addition, 26 gene clusters related to secondary metabolism, including the 64-kb vcm cluster, were identified in the genome. Employing a customized PCR-targeting-based mutagenesis system along with the biochemical identification of vancomycin variants produced by the mutants, we were able to experimentally characterize a halogenase, a methyltransferase and two glycosyltransferases encoded in the vcm cluster. The broad substrate spectra characteristics of these modification enzymes were inferred.                  Conclusions:                       This study not only extended the genetic knowledge of the genus Amycolatopsis and the biochemical knowledge of vcm-related post-assembly tailoring enzymes, but also developed methodology useful for in vivo studies in A. orientalis, which has been widely considered as a barrier in this field.	1
Title: Measurement and modeling of multiple substrate oxidation by methanotrophs at 20 degrees C Abstract: Earlier experiments have shown that when Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was grown at 30 degrees C, greater growth and degradation of chlorinated ethenes was observed under particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)-expressing conditions than sMMO-expressing conditions. The effect of temperature on the growth and ability of methanotrophs to degrade chlorinated ethenes, however, has not been examined, particularly temperatures more representative of groundwater systems. Thus, experiments were performed at 20 degrees C to examine the effect of mixtures of trichloroethylene, trans-dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride in the presence of methane on the growth and ability of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b cells to degrade these pollutants. Although the maximal rates of chlorinated ethane degradation were greater by M. trichosporium OB3b expressing sMMO as compared with the same cell expressing pMMO, the growth and ability of sMMO-expressing cells to degrade these cosubstrates was substantially inhibited in their presence as compared with the same cell expressing pMMO. The Delta model developed earlier was found to be useful for predicting the effect of chlorinated ethenes on the growth and ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to degrade these compounds at a growth temperature of 20 degrees C. Finally, it was also discovered that at 20 degrees C, cells expressing pMMO exhibited faster turnover of methane than sMMO-expressing cells, unlike that found earlier at 30 degrees C, suggesting that temperature may exert selective pressure on methanotrophic communities to express sMMO or pMMO.	0
Title: NADP+-Preferring D-Lactate Dehydrogenase from Sporolactobacillus inulinus Abstract: Hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, including l- and d-lactate dehydrogenases (L-LDH and D-LDH), are responsible for the stereospecific conversion of 2-keto acids to 2-hydroxyacids and extensively used in a wide range of biotechnological applications. A common feature of LDHs is their high specificity for NAD(+) as a cofactor. An LDH that could effectively use NADPH as a coenzyme could be an alternative enzymatic system for regeneration of the oxidized, phosphorylated cofactor. In this study, a d-lactate dehydrogenase from a Sporolactobacillus inulinus strain was found to use both NADH and NADPH with high efficiencies and with a preference for NADPH as its coenzyme, which is different from the coenzyme utilization of all previously reported LDHs. The biochemical properties of the D-LDH enzyme were determined by X-ray crystal structural characterization and in vivo and in vitro enzymatic activity analyses. The residue Asn(174) was demonstrated to be critical for NADPH utilization. Characterization of the biochemical properties of this enzyme will contribute to understanding of the catalytic mechanism and provide referential information for shifting the coenzyme utilization specificity of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.	0
Title: Crystal structures of an oligopeptide-binding protein from the biosynthetic pathway of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid Abstract: Clavulanic acid (CA) is a clinically important beta-lactamase inhibitor that is produced by fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus. The CA biosynthesis pathway starts from arginine and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and proceeds via (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid, which is converted to (3R,5R)-clavaldehyde, the immediate precursor of (3R,5R)-CA. Open reading frames 7 (orf7) and 15 (orf15) of the CA biosynthesis cluster encode oligopeptide-binding proteins (OppA1 and OppA2), which are essential for CA biosynthesis. OppA1/2 are proposed to be involved in the binding and/or transport of peptides across the S. clavuligerus cell membrane. Peptide binding assays reveal that recombinant OppA1 and OppA2 bind di-/tripeptides containing arginine and certain nonapeptides including bradykinin. Crystal structures of OppA2 in its apo form and in complex with arginine or bradykinin were solved to 1.45, 1.7, and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. The overall fold of OppA2 consists of two lobes with a deep cavity in the center, as observed for other oligopeptide-binding proteins. The large cavity creates a peptide/arginine binding cleft. The crystal structures of OppA2 in complex with arginine or bradykinin reveal that the C-terminal arginine of bradykinin binds similarly to arginine. The results are discussed in terms of the possible roles of OppA1/2 in CA biosynthesis.	1
Title: Synthesis and Evaluation of Spumigin Analogues Library with Thrombin Inhibitory Activity Abstract: Spumigins are marine natural products derived from cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena, which mimics the structure of the d-Phe-Pro-Arg sequence and is crucial for binding to the active site of serine proteases thrombin and factor Xa. Biological evaluation of spumigins showed that spumigins with a (2S,4S)-4-methylproline central core represent potential lead compounds for the development of a new structural type of direct thrombin inhibitors. Herein, we represent synthesis and thrombin inhibitory activity of a focused library of spumigins analogues with indoline ring or l-proline as a central core. Novel compounds show additional insight into the structure and biological effects of spumigins. The most active analogue was found to be a derivative containing l-proline central core with low micromolar thrombin inhibitory activity.	0
Title: Characterization of an orphan diterpenoid biosynthetic operon from Salinispora arenicola Abstract: While more commonly associated with plants than microbes, diterpenoid natural products have been reported to have profound effects in marine microbe-microbe interactions. Intriguingly, the genome of the marine bacterium Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 contains a putative diterpenoid biosynthetic operon, terp1. Here recombinant expression studies are reported, indicating that this three-gene operon leads to the production of isopimara-8,15-dien-19-ol (4). Although 4 is not observed in pure cultures of S. arenicola, it is plausible that the terp1 operon is only expressed under certain physiologically relevant conditions such as in the presence of other marine organisms.	0
Title: Nonribosomal biosynthesis of fusaricidins by Paenibacillus polymyxa PKB1 involves direct activation of a D-amino acid Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa PKB1 produces fusaricidins, a family of lipopeptide antibiotics that strongly inhibits the growth of many plant pathogenic fungi. The fusaricidin biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and sequenced, and it spans 32.4 kb, including an open reading frame (fusA) encoding a six-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The second, fourth, and fifth modules of fusaricidin synthetase each contain an epimerization domain, consistent with the structure of fusaricidins. However, no epimerization domain is found in the sixth module, corresponding to D-Ala. This sixth adenylation domain was produced at a high level in Escherichia coli and is shown to activate D-Ala specifically, providing evidence for direct activation of a D-amino acid by a prokaryotic peptide synthetase. The fusaricidin gene cluster also includes genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lipid moiety, but no genes for resistance, regulation, or transport functions were encountered.	1
Title: S-MART, a software toolbox to aid RNA-Seq data analysis Abstract: High-throughput sequencing is now routinely performed in many experiments. But the analysis of the millions of sequences generated, is often beyond the expertise of the wet labs who have no personnel specializing in bioinformatics. Whereas several tools are now available to map high-throughput sequencing data on a genome, few of these can extract biological knowledge from the mapped reads. We have developed a toolbox called S-MART, which handles mapped RNA-Seq data. S-MART is an intuitive and lightweight tool which performs many of the tasks usually required for the analysis of mapped RNA-Seq reads. S-MART does not require any computer science background and thus can be used by all of the biologist community through a graphical interface. S-MART can run on any personal computer, yielding results within an hour even for Gb of data for most queries. S-MART may perform the entire analysis of the mapped reads, without any need for other ad hoc scripts. With this tool, biologists can easily perform most of the analyses on their computer for their RNA-Seq data, from the mapped data to the discovery of important loci.	0
Title: Charging OBO-Fused Double [5]Helicene with Electrons Abstract: Chemical reduction of OBO-fused double[5]helicene with Group 1 metals (Na and K) has been investigated for the first time. Two doubly-reduced products have been isolated and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing a solvent-separated ion triplet (SSIT) with Na+ ions and a contact-ion pair (CIP) with K+ ion. As the key structural outcome, the X-ray crystallographic analysis discloses the consequences of adding two electrons to the double helicene core in the SSIT without metal binding and reveals the preferential binding site in the CIP with K+ counterions. In both products, an increase in the twisting of the double helicene core upon charging was observed. The negative charge localization at the central core has been identified by theoretical calculations, which are in full agreement with X-ray crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic results. Notably, it was confirmed that the two-electron reduction of OBO-fused double[5]helicene is reversible.	0
Title: Phylogeny and genomic organization of the TIR and non-tIR NBS-LRR resistance gene family in Medicago truncatula Abstract: Sequences homologous to the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain of NBS-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) resistance genes were retrieved from the model legume M. truncatula through several methods. Phylogenetic analysis classified these sequences into TIR (toll and interleukin-1 receptor) and non-TIR NBS subfamilies and further subclassified them into several well-defined clades within each subfamily. Comparison of M. truncatula NBS sequences with those from several closely related legumes, including members of the tribes Trifoleae, Viceae, and Phaseoleae, reveals that most clades contain sequences from multiple legume species. Moreover, sequences from species within the closely related Trifoleae and Viceae tribes (e.g., Medicago and Pisum spp.) tended to be cophyletic and distinct from sequences of Phaseoleae species (e.g., soybean and bean). These results suggest that the origin of major clades within the NBS-LRR family predate radiation of these Papilionoid legumes, while continued diversification of these sequences mirrors speciation within this legume subfamily. Detailed genetic and physical mapping of both TIR and non-TIR NBS sequences in M. truncatula reveals that most NBS sequences are organized into clusters, and few, if any, clusters contain both TIR and non-TIR sequences. Examples were found, however, of physical clusters that contain sequences from distinct phylogenetic clades within the TIR or non-TIR subfamilies. Comparative mapping reveals several blocks of resistance gene loci that are syntenic between M. truncatula and soybean and between M. truncatula and pea.	0
Title: A designer bleomycin with significantly improved DNA cleavage activity Abstract: The bleomycins (BLMs) are used clinically in combination with a number of other agents for the treatment of several types of tumors, and the BLM, etoposide, and cisplatin treatment regimen cures 90-95% of metastatic testicular cancer patients. BLM-induced pneumonitis is the most feared, dose-limiting side effect of BLM in chemotherapy, which can progress into lung fibrosis and affect up to 46% of the total patient population. There have been continued efforts to develop new BLM analogues in the search for anticancer drugs with better clinical efficacy and lower lung toxicity. We have previously cloned and characterized the biosynthetic gene clusters for BLMs from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003, tallysomycins from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158, and zorbamycin (ZBM) from Streptomyces flavoviridis SB9001. Comparative analysis of the three biosynthetic machineries provided the molecular basis for the formulation of hypotheses to engineer novel analogues. We now report engineered production of three new analogues, 6'-hydroxy-ZBM, BLM Z, and 6'-deoxy-BLM Z and the evaluation of their DNA cleavage activities as a measurement for their potential anticancer activity. Our findings unveiled: (i) the disaccharide moiety plays an important role in the DNA cleavage activity of BLMs and ZBMs, (ii) the ZBM disaccharide significantly enhances the potency of BLM, and (iii) 6'-deoxy-BLM Z represents the most potent BLM analogue known to date. The fact that 6'-deoxy-BLM Z can be produced in reasonable quantities by microbial fermentation should greatly facilitate follow-up mechanistic and preclinical studies to potentially advance this analogue into a clinical drug.	1
Title: Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors OspB and OspF target the nucleus to downregulate the host inflammatory response via interactions with retinoblastoma protein Abstract: OspF, OspG and IpaH(9.8) are type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors of Shigella flexneri that downregulate the host innate immune response. OspF modifies mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration associated with Shigella invasion. OspF also localizes in the nucleus to mediate chromatin remodelling, resulting in reduced transcription of inflammatory cytokines. We now report that OspB can be added to the set of S. flexneri T3SS effectors required to modulate the innate immune response. T84 cells infected with a Delta ospB mutant resulted in reduced polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Tagged versions of OspB localized with endosomes and the nucleus. Further, T84 cells infected with the Delta ospB mutant showed increased levels of secreted IL-8 compared with wild-type infected cells. Both GST-OspB and GST-OspF coprecipitated retinoblastoma protein from host cell lysates. Because Delta ospB and Delta ospF mutants share similar phenotypes, and OspB and OspF share a host binding partner, we propose that OspB and OspF facilitate the remodelling of chromatin via interactions with retinoblastoma protein, resulting in diminished inflammatory cytokine production. The requirement of multiple T3SS effectors to modulate the innate immune response correlates to the complexity of the human immune system.	0
Title: Expression of ccaR, encoding the positive activator of cephamycin C and clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus, is dependent on bldG Abstract: In Streptomyces coelicolor, bldG encodes a putative anti-anti-sigma factor that regulates both aerial hypha formation and antibiotic production, and a downstream transcriptionally linked open reading frame (orf3) encodes a putative anti-sigma factor protein. A cloned DNA fragment from Streptomyces clavuligerus contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein showing 92% identity to the S. coelicolor BldG protein and 91% identity to the BldG ortholog in Streptomyces avermitilis. Sequencing of the region downstream of bldG in S. clavuligerus revealed the presence of an open reading frame encoding a protein showing 72 and 69% identity to the ORF3 proteins in S. coelicolor and S. avermitilis, respectively. Northern analysis indicated that, as in S. coelicolor, the S. clavuligerus bldG gene is expressed as both a monocistronic and a polycistronic transcript, the latter including the downstream orf3 gene. High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping of S. clavuligerus bldG transcripts revealed the presence of three bldG-specific promoters, and analysis of expression of a bldGp-egfp reporter indicated that the bldG promoter is active at various stages of development and in both substrate and aerial hyphae. A bldG null mutant was defective in both morphological differentiation and in the production of secondary metabolites, such as cephamycin C, clavulanic acid, and the 5S clavams. This inability to produce cephamycin C and clavulanic acid was due to the absence of the CcaR transcriptional regulator, which controls the expression of biosynthetic genes for both secondary metabolites as well as the expression of a second regulator of clavulanic acid biosynthesis, ClaR. This makes bldG the first regulatory protein identified in S. clavuligerus that functions upstream of CcaR and ClaR in a regulatory cascade to control secondary metabolite production.	1
Title: Chi18A, the endochitinase in the cellulosome of the thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum Abstract: The chitinase gene chiA was identified on the Clostridium thermocellum genome downstream of the endoglucanase gene celA. It contains a catalytic module of glycosyl hydrolase family 18 and a cellulosomal dockerin module. Chi18A hydrolyzes aryl-acetyl-chito-oligosaccharides preferentially. In denaturing electrophoresis of purified cellulosomes, a single chitinase activity band was identified in zymograms and Western blots, indicating that Chi18A is the only chitinase in the cellulosome.	0
Title: Substantially improving the enantioconvergence of PvEH1, a Phaseolus vulgaris epoxide hydrolase, towards m-chlorostyrene oxide by laboratory evolution Abstract: Background:                       Epoxide hydrolase can regioselectively catalyze the oxirane ring-opening hydrolysis of rac-epoxides producing the corresponding chiral diols. In our laboratory, a gene named pveh1 encoding an EH from Phaseolus vulgaris was cloned. Although the directed modification of PvEH1 was carried out, the mutant PvEH1Y3 showed a limited degree of enantioconvergence towards racemic (rac-) m-chlorostyrene oxide (mCSO).                  Results:                       PvEH1 and PvEH1Y3 were combinatively subjected to laboratory evolution to further enhance the enantioconvergence of PvEH1Y3 towards rac-mCSO. Firstly, the substrate-binding pocket of PvEH1 was identified using a CAVER 3.0 software, and divided into three zones. After all residues in zones 1 and 3 were subjected to leucine scanning, two E. coli transformants, E. coli/pveh1Y149L and /pveh1P184L, were selected, by which rac-mCSO was transformed into (R)-m-chlorophenyl-1,2-ethanediol (mCPED) having 55.1% and 27.2% eep. Secondly, two saturation mutagenesis libraries, E. coli/pveh1Y149X and /pveh1P184X (X: any one of 20 residues) were created at sites Y149 and P184 of PvEH1. Among all transformants, both E. coli/pveh1Y149L (65.8% αS and 55.1% eep) and /pveh1P184W (66.6% αS and 59.8% eep) possessed the highest enantioconvergences. Finally, the combinatorial mutagenesis was conducted by replacements of both Y149L and P184W in PvEH1Y3, constructing E. coli/pveh1Y3Z2, whose αS reached 97.5%, higher than that (75.3%) of E. coli/pveh1Y3. In addition, the enantioconvergent hydrolysis of 20 mM rac-mCSO was performed by E. coli/pveh1Y3Z2, giving (R)-mCPED with 95.2% eep and 97.2% yield.                  Conclusions:                       In summary, the enantioconvergence of PvEH1Y3Z2 was successfully improved by laboratory evolution, which was based on the study of substrate-binding pocket by leucine scanning. Our present work introduced an effective strategy for the directed modification of enantioconvergence of PvEH1.	0
Title: Genome mining and functional genomics for siderophore production in Aspergillus niger Abstract: Iron is an essential metal for many organisms, but the biologically relevant form of iron is scarce because of rapid oxidation resulting in low solubility. Simultaneously, excessive accumulation of iron is toxic. Consequently, iron uptake is a highly controlled process. In most fungal species, siderophores play a central role in iron handling. Siderophores are small iron-specific chelators that can be secreted to scavenge environmental iron or bind intracellular iron with high affinity. A second high-affinity iron uptake mechanism is reductive iron assimilation (RIA). As shown in Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans, synthesis of siderophores in Aspergilli is predominantly under control of the transcription factors SreA and HapX, which are connected by a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Abolishing this fine-tuned regulation corroborates iron homeostasis, including heme biosynthesis, which could be biotechnologically of interest, e.g. the heterologous production of heme-dependent peroxidases. Aspergillus niger genome inspection identified orthologues of several genes relevant for RIA and siderophore metabolism, as well as sreA and hapX. Interestingly, genes related to synthesis of the common fungal extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C were absent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the absence of triacetylfusarinine C, and demonstrated that the major secreted siderophores of A. niger are coprogen B and ferrichrome, which is also the dominant intracellular siderophore. In A. niger wild type grown under iron-replete conditions, the expression of genes involved in coprogen biosynthesis and RIA was low in the exponential growth phase but significantly induced during ascospore germination. Deletion of sreA in A. niger resulted in elevated iron uptake and increased cellular ferrichrome accumulation. Increased sensitivity toward phleomycin and high iron concentration reflected the toxic effects of excessive iron uptake. Moreover, SreA-deficiency resulted in increased accumulation of heme intermediates, but no significant increase in heme content. Together with the upregulation of several heme biosynthesis genes, these results reveal a complex heme regulatory mechanism.	1
Title: Nocardiopsistins A-C: New angucyclines with anti-MRSA activity isolated from a marine sponge-derived Nocardiopsis sp. HB-J378 Abstract: Marine natural products have become an increasingly important source of new drug leads during recent years. In an attempt to identify novel anti-microbial natural products by bioprospecting deep-sea Actinobacteria, three new angucyclines, nocardiopsistins A-C, were isolated from Nocardiopsis sp. strain HB-J378. Notably, the supplementation of the rare earth salt Lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) during fermentation of HB-J378 significantly increased the yield of these angucyclines. The structures of nocardiopsistins A-C were identified by 1D and 2D NMR and HR-MS data. Nocardiopsistins A-C have activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) with MICs of 3.12-12.5 μg/mL; the potency of nocardiopsistin B is similar to that of the positive control, chloramphenicol. Bioinformatic analysis of the draft genome of HB-J378 identified a set of three core genes in a biosynthetic gene cluster that encode a typical aromatic or type II polyketide synthase (PKS) system, including ketoacyl:ACP synthase α-subunit (KSα), β-subunit (KSβ) and acyl carrier protein (ACP). The production of nocardiopsistins A-C was abolished when the three genes were knocked out, indicating their indispensable role in the production of nocardiopsistins.	1
Title: Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic Giant Type I PKS Gene Cluster Leads to the Production of Ansaseomycin Abstract: Genome mining of the marine Streptomyces seoulensis A01 enabled the identification of a giant type I polyketide synthase gene cluster ( asm). Heterologous expression of the cryptic asm cluster using a bacterial artificial chromosome vector in heterologous host led to the production of ansaseomycins A (1) and B (2). A plausible biosynthetic pathway was also proposed. Additionally, compounds 1 and 2 are active against K562 cell lines with IC50 values of 13.3 and 18.1 μM, respectively.	1
Title: Newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides Abstract: One of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. In ruminant animals, the majority of their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. Eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. A total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six phyla were represented: Firmicutes (51.9%), Bacteroidetes (30.9%), Proteobacteria (11.1%), Actinobacteria (3.5%), Synergistetes (1.5%), and Fusobacteria (1.1%). The majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project and thus represent new species and/or genera. Within the Firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Clostridiaceae I. The majority of the Bacteroidetes were most closely related to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and B. xylanisolvens and members of the Porphyromonadaceae family. Many of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. The microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. With over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured, there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.	0
Title: Hybrid anthracycline antibiotics: production of new anthracyclines by cloned genes from Streptomyces purpurascens in Streptomyces galilaeus Abstract: A DNA segment cloned from Streptomyces purpurascens ATCC 25489 close to a region that hybridized to a probe containing part of the actinorhodin polyketide synthase caused S. galilaeus ATCC 31615 to produce new anthracyclines. When transformed with certain sub-clones of this segment, the host produced glycosides of epsilon-rhodomycinone, beta-rhodomycinone, 10-demethoxycarbonylaklavinone and 11-deoxy-beta-rhodomycinone in addition to those of aklavinone, the natural anthracyclines of S. galilaeus. The first two compounds are S. purpurascens products and the other two are novel compounds that conceptually are structural hybrids between S. galilaeus and S. purpurascens products. Three glycosides of one of the novel aglycones, 11-deoxy-beta-rhodomycinone, were purified and found to possess cytotoxic activity against L1210 mouse leukaemia cells. Separate regions of the cloned S. purpurascens DNA are responsible for modification of the S. galilaeus host product at the 10- and 11-positions.	1
Title: A CLC-type chloride channel gene is required for laccase activity and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans Abstract: Laccase is a major virulence factor required for infection caused by the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. However, cellular processes involved in the regulation and expression of laccase remain largely unknown in C. neoformans. Here we report the identification of a chloride channel gene CLC-A which is essential for laccase activity in C. neoformans. CLC-A shares homology to CLC-type voltage-gated chloride channels from other organisms; for example, 63% homology to GEF1, a chloride channel gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A clc-a mutant, Mlac3, generated by insertional mutagenesis as well as a targeted Deltaclc-a mutant produced undetectable laccase in a liquid assay and produced no melanin on asparagine agar containing norepinephrine. Mlac3 was complemented with wild-type CLC-A which restored laccase activity and melanin biosynthesis. The clc-a mutants also showed reduced synthesis of another important virulence factor, capsule, and showed reduced growth at elevated pH. In addition, the clc-a mutation resulted in attenuated virulence in a mouse cryptococcosis model that was restored by complementation with wild-type CLC-A, indicating that the chloride channel plays an important role in the virulence of the organism. Further analysis revealed that the basis for absent laccase expression in the clc-a mutant was a laccase transcriptional defect that could be restored by adding exogenous copper. In conclusion, our findings show that CLC-A plays a role in the expression of two important virulence factors, capsule and laccase expression, which are required for virulence of the fungal pathogen.	0
Title: Discovery of Unusual Biaryl Polyketides by Activation of a Silent Streptomyces venezuelae Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Comparative transcriptional profiling of a ΔbldM mutant of Streptomyces venezuelae with its unmodified progenitor revealed that the expression of a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster containing both type I and type III polyketide synthase genes is activated in the mutant. The 29.5 kb gene cluster, which was predicted to encode an unusual biaryl metabolite, which we named venemycin, and potentially halogenated derivatives, contains 16 genes including one-vemR-that encodes a transcriptional activator of the large ATP-binding LuxR-like (LAL) family. Constitutive expression of vemR in the ΔbldM mutant led to the production of sufficient venemycin for structural characterisation, confirming its unusual biaryl structure. Co-expression of the venemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and vemR in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor also resulted in venemycin production. Although the gene cluster encodes two halogenases and a flavin reductase, constitutive expression of all three genes led to the accumulation only of a monohalogenated venemycin derivative, both in the native producer and the heterologous host. A competition experiment in which equimolar quantities of sodium chloride and sodium bromide were fed to the venemycin-producing strains resulted in the preferential incorporation of bromine, thus suggesting that bromide is the preferred substrate for one or both halogenases.	1
Title: Identification of the grincamycin gene cluster unveils divergent roles for GcnQ in different hosts, tailoring the L-rhodinose moiety Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for grincamycin (GCN, 1) biosynthesis in Streptomyces lusitanus SCSIO LR32 was identified; heterologous expression of the GCN cluster in S. coelicolor M512 yielded P-1894B (1b) as a predominant product. The ΔgcnQ mutant accumulates intermediate 1a and two shunt products 2a and 3a bearing L-rhodinose for L-cinerulose A substitutions. In vitro data demonstrated that GcnQ is capable of iteratively tailoring the two L-rhodinose moieties into L-aculose moieties, supporting divergent roles of GcnQ in different hosts.	1
Title: Adherence of bacteria, yeast, blood cells, and latex spheres to large-porosity membrane filters Abstract: Strong adherence of bacteria, yeast, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, spores, and polystyrene spheres to membrane filter materials was noted during filtration through membranes with pore size diameters much larger than the particles themselves. Quantitative recovery on the membrane filters of these particles from low-concentration suspensions was achieved during gravity- or vacuum-assisted filtration through membranes with pore diameters as much as 30 times that of the filtered particles. Mechanical sieving was not responsible. The phenomenon was judged to be electrostatic. It could be partially blocked by pretreating the filter with a nonionic surfactant (Tween 20), and elution of adherent particles was achieved with 0.05% Tween 20. Gram-positive cocci were removed from suspension more efficiently than gram-negative rods. The commonly used cellulose membranes adsorbed more bacteria, blood cells, and other particles than did polycarbonate filters. Of lesser adsorptive capacity were vinyl acetate, nylon, acrylic, and Teflon membranes. Backwashing with saline, serum, 6% NaCl, dextran solutions, or phosphate buffers of varying molality and pH removed only a fraction of adherent particles. Tween 20 (0.05%) eluted up to 45% of adherent particles in a single back-filtration. Selected filters quantitatively removed the particles tested, which then could be washed and subjected to reagents for a variety of purposes. It is important to anticipate the removal of particles during membrane filtration, since it is not a simple mechanical event.	0
Title: The complete genome of Burkholderia phenoliruptrix strain BR3459a, a symbiont of Mimosa flocculosa: highlighting the coexistence of symbiotic and pathogenic genes Abstract: Background:                       Burkholderia species play an important ecological role related to xenobiosis, the promotion of plant growth, the biocontrol of agricultural diseases, and symbiotic and non-symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation. Here, we highlight our study as providing the first complete genome of a symbiotic strain of B. phenoliruptrix, BR3459a (=CLA1), which was originally isolated in Brazil from nodules of Mimosa flocculosa and is effective in fixing nitrogen in association with this leguminous species.                  Results:                       Genomic comparisons with other pathogenic and non-pathogenic Burkholderia strains grouped B. phenoliruptrix BR3459a with plant-associated beneficial and environmental species, although it shares a high percentage of its gene repertoire with species of the B. cepacia complex (Bcc) and "pseudomallei" group. The genomic analyses showed that the bce genes involved in exopolysaccharide production are clustered together in the same genomic region, constituting part of the Group III cluster of non-pathogenic bacteria. Regarding environmental stresses, we highlight genes that might be relevant in responses to osmotic, heat, cold and general stresses. Furthermore, a number of particularly interesting genes involved in the machinery of the T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T4ASS and T6SS secretion systems were identified. The xenobiotic properties of strain BR3459a were also investigated, and some enzymes involved in the degradation of styrene, nitrotoluene, dioxin, chlorocyclohexane, chlorobenzene and caprolactam were identified. The genomic analyses also revealed a large number of antibiotic-related genes, the most important of which were correlated with streptomycin and novobiocin. The symbiotic plasmid showed high sequence identity with the symbiotic plasmid of B. phymatum. Additionally, comparative analysis of 545 housekeeping genes among pathogenic and non-pathogenic Burkholderia species strongly supports the definition of a new genus for the second branch, which would include BR3459a.                  Conclusions:                       The analyses of B. phenoliruptrix BR3459a showed key property of fixing nitrogen that together with genes for high tolerance to environmental stresses might explain a successful strategy of symbiosis in the tropics. The strain also harbours interesting sets of genes with biotechnological potential. However, the resemblance of certain genes to those of pathogenic Burkholderia raise concerns about large-scale applications in agriculture or for bioremediation.	0
Title: The kapurimycins, new antitumor antibiotics produced by Streptomyces. Physico-chemical properties and structure determination Abstract: The kapurimycins A1, A2 and A3 were revealed to be new antitumor antibiotics with molecular formula of C27H26O9, C26H24O9 and C27H24O9, respectively. The structures of the kapurimycins were determined by NMR spectroscopic analysis. The kapurimycins are new class of polycyclic microbial metabolites having the tetrahydroanthra-gamma-pyrone skeleton and the beta, gamma-unsaturated delta-keto carboxylic acid structure. The individual components of the kapurimycins differ from one another in the side chain at the pyrone ring of the molecule.	0
Title: Labdane diterpenoids from Leonurus sibiricus Abstract: Six new labdane diterpenoids, preleosibirone A (1), 13-epi-preleosibirone A (2), isopreleosibirone A (3), leosibirone A (4), leosibirone B (5), and 15-epi-leosibirone B (6), were isolated from the leaves of Leonurus sibiricus. The absolute configurations of 1, 2, 5, and 6 were established by X-ray crystallographic analyses, and leosibirone A (4) was shown to be an artifact of the isolation process.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the microtubule-stabilizing agents epothilones A and B from Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 Abstract: Background:                       Epothilones are produced by the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce90, and, like paclitaxel (Taxol((R))), they inhibit microtubule depolymerisation and arrest the cell cycle at the G2-M phase. They are effective against P-glycoprotein-expressing multiple-drug-resistant tumor cell lines and are more water soluble than paclitaxel. The total synthesis of epothilones has been achieved, but has not provided an economically viable alternative to fermentation. We set out to clone, sequence and analyze the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the epothilones in S. cellulosum So ce90.                  Results:                       A cluster of 22 open reading frames spanning 68,750 base pairs of the S. cellulosum So ce90 genome has been sequenced and found to encode nine modules of a polyketide synthase (PKS), one module of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a cytochrome P450, and two putative antibiotic transport proteins. Disruptions in the genes encoding the PKS abolished epothilone production. The first PKS module and the NRPS module are proposed to co-operate in forming the thiazole heterocycle of epothilone from an acetate and a cysteine by condensation, cyclodehydration and subsequent dehydrogenation. The remaining eight PKS modules are responsible for the elaboration of the rest of the epothilone carbon skeleton.                  Conclusions:                       The overall architecture of the gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis has been determined. The availability of the cluster should facilitate the generation of designer epothilones by combinatorial biosynthesis approaches, and the heterologous expression of epothilones in surrogate microbial hosts.	1
Title: Automated structure prediction of trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase products Abstract: Bacterial trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are among the most complex known enzymes from secondary metabolism and are responsible for the biosynthesis of highly diverse bioactive polyketides. However, most of these metabolites remain uncharacterized, since trans-AT PKSs frequently occur in poorly studied microbes and feature a remarkable array of non-canonical biosynthetic components with poorly understood functions. As a consequence, genome-guided natural product identification has been challenging. To enable de novo structural predictions for trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides, we developed the trans-AT PKS polyketide predictor (TransATor). TransATor is a versatile bio- and chemoinformatics web application that suggests informative chemical structures for even highly aberrant trans-AT PKS biosynthetic gene clusters, thus permitting hypothesis-based, targeted biotechnological discovery and biosynthetic studies. We demonstrate the applicative scope in several examples, including the characterization of new variants of bioactive natural products as well as structurally new polyketides from unusual bacterial sources.	1
Title: Compound prioritization methods increase rates of chemical probe discovery in model organisms Abstract: Preselection of compounds that are more likely to induce a phenotype can increase the efficiency and reduce the costs for model organism screening. To identify such molecules, we screened ~81,000 compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified ~7500 that inhibit cell growth. Screening these growth-inhibitory molecules across a diverse panel of model organisms resulted in an increased phenotypic hit-rate. These data were used to build a model to predict compounds that inhibit yeast growth. Empirical and in silico application of the model enriched the discovery of bioactive compounds in diverse model organisms. To demonstrate the potential of these molecules as lead chemical probes, we used chemogenomic profiling in yeast and identified specific inhibitors of lanosterol synthase and of stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase. As community resources, the ~7500 growth-inhibitory molecules have been made commercially available and the computational model and filter used are provided.	0
Title: ISEcp1-mediated transposition and homologous recombination can explain the context of bla(CTX-M-62) linked to qnrB2 Abstract: bla(CTX-M-62), a C508T variant of bla(CTX-M-3b), was transferred from Klebsiella pneumoniae JIE137 on a conjugative plasmid together with a class 1 integron containing the dfrA12-gcuF-aadA2 cassette array, ISCR1, and qnrB2. bla(CTX-M-62) lies between intact and rearranged copies of ISEcp1 in a configuration that can be explained by a combination of transposition and homologous recombination and which also illustrates the ability of ISEcp1 to mobilize an adjacent gene as part of transposition units of different sizes.	0
Title: Selecting the highest of three binomial probabilities Abstract: A sequential elimination procedure for selecting the highest probability in binomial trials, proposed by Levin and Robbins [Levin, B. & Robbins, H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4663-4666], is examined further in the special case of trials involving three probabilities. A conjectured inequality relating ratios of selection probabilities to odds ratios is shown to hold only under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. Weaker conjectured inequalities involving the probability of correct selection are shown to hold without restriction.	0
Title: Concentration and detection of hepatitis A virus and rotavirus from shellfish by hybridization tests Abstract: A modified polyethylene glycol precipitation method for concentration of virus followed by a new method to recover nucleic acid was used to detect hepatitis A virus (HAV) and rotavirus (SA11) in shellfish (oysters and hard-shell clams) by hybridization tests. Infectious virus, seeded into relatively large quantities of shellfish, was recovered consistently, with greater than 90% efficiency as measured by either in situ hybridization (HAV) or plaque assay (rotavirus SA11). Viral nucleic acid for dot blot hybridization assays was extracted and purified from virus-containing polyethylene glycol concentrates. Separation of shellfish polysaccharides from nucleic acid was necessary before viral RNA could be detected by dot blot hybridization. Removal of shellfish polysaccharides was accomplished by using the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Use of CTAB reduced background interference with hybridization signals, which resulted in increased hybridization test sensitivity. After polysaccharide removal, dot blot hybridization assays could detect approximately 10(6) physical particles (corresponding to approximately 10(3) infectious particles) of HAV and 10(4) PFU of SA11 rotavirus present in 20-g samples of oyster and clam meats. These studies show continuing promise for the development of uniform methods to directly detect human viral pathogens in different types of shellfish. However, practical applications of such methods to detect noncultivatable human viral pathogens of public health interest will require additional improvements in test sensitivity.	0
Title: Flavoenzyme-catalyzed atropo-selective N,C-bipyrrole homocoupling in marinopyrrole biosynthesis Abstract: Axially chiral biaryl compounds are frequently encountered in nature where they exhibit diverse biological properties. Many are biphenols that have C-C or C-O linkages installed by cytochrome P450 oxygenases that control the regio- and stereoselectivity of the intermolecular coupling reaction. In contrast, bipyrrole-coupling enzymology has not been observed. Marinopyrroles, produced by a marine-derived streptomycete, are the first 1,3'-bipyrrole natural products. On the basis of marinopyrrole's unusual bipyrrole structure, we explored its atropo-selective biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. CNQ-418 in order to elucidate the N,C-bipyrrole homocoupling enzymology. Through a series of genetic experiments involving the discovery and heterologous expression of marinopyrrole biosynthesis genes, we report that two flavin-dependent halogenases catalyze the unprecedented homocoupling reaction.	1
Title: The eight amino-acid differences within three leucine-rich repeats between Pi2 and Piz-t resistance proteins determine the resistance specificity to Magnaporthe grisea Abstract: The rice blast resistance (R) genes Pi2 and Piz-t confer broad-spectrum resistance against different sets of Magnaporthe grisea isolates. We first identified the Pi2 gene using a map-based cloning strategy. The Pi2 gene is a member of a gene cluster comprising nine gene members (named Nbs1-Pi2 to Nbs9-Pi2) and encodes a protein with a nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Fine genetic mapping, molecular characterization of the Pi2 susceptible mutants, and complementation tests indicated that Nbs4-Pi2 is the Pi2 gene. The Piz-t gene, a Pi2 allele in the rice cultivar Toride 1, was isolated based on the Pi2 sequence information. Complementation tests confirmed that the family member Nbs4-Piz-t is Piz-t. Sequence comparison revealed that only eight amino-acid changes, which are confined within three consecutive LRR, differentiate Piz-t from Pi2. Of the eight variants, only one locates within the xxLxLxx motif. A reciprocal exchange of the single amino acid between Pi2 and Piz-t did not convert the resistance specificity to each other but, rather, abolished the function of both resistance proteins. These results indicate that the single amino acid in the xxLxLxx motif may be critical for maintaining the recognition surface of Pi2 and Piz-t to their respective avirulence proteins.	0
Title: Peritoneal cavity is dominated by IFNγ-secreting CXCR3+ Th1 cells Abstract: The chemokine receptor CXCR3, which was shown to take part in many inflammatory processes, is considered as a Th1 specific marker. Here, we show in a mouse model that CXCR3 expressing CD4(+) cells preferentially migrate to the peritoneal cavity under steady-state conditions. The peritoneal cavity milieu leads to an up-regulated expression of CXCR3. However, blocking of known ligands of this chemokine receptor did not alter the preferential migration. The peritoneal cavity environment also results in an increased percentage of memory cells producing cytokines. Up-regulation of IFNγ production occurs mostly in CXCR3(+) cells considered as Th1, whereas the up-regulation of IL-4 affects mostly in CXCR3(-) cells which are considered as Th2. We conclude that the peritoneal cavity does not change the Th-lineage of the cells, but that domination of this anatomic niche by Th1 cells rather results from preferential migration to this compartment.	0
Title: Characterization of the azinomycin B biosynthetic gene cluster revealing a different iterative type I polyketide synthase for naphthoate biosynthesis Abstract: Azinomycin B is a complex natural product containing densely assembled functionalities with potent antitumor activity. Cloning and sequence analysis of the azi gene cluster revealed an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene, five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) genes and numerous genes encoding the biosynthesis of unusual building blocks and tailoring steps for azinomycin B production. Characterization of AziB as a 5-methyl-naphthoic acid (NPA) synthase showed a distinct selective reduction pattern in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis governed by bacterial iterative type I PKSs. Heterologous expression established the PKS-post modification route from 5-methyl-NPA to reach the first building block 3-methoxy-5-methyl-NPA. This proposed azinomycin B biosynthetic pathway sets the stage to investigate the enzymatic mechanisms for building structurally unique and pharmaceutically important groups, including the unprecedented azabicyclic ring system and highly active epoxide moiety.	1
Title: Heterologous production of the antifungal polyketide antibiotic soraphen A of Sorangium cellulosum So ce26 in Streptomyces lividans Abstract: The antifungal polyketide soraphen A is produced by the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce26. The slow growth, swarming motility and general intransigence of the strain for genetic manipulations make industrial strain development, large-scale fermentation and combinatorial biosynthetic manipulation of the soraphen producer very challenging. To provide a better host for soraphen A production and molecular engineering, the biosynthetic gene cluster for this secondary metabolite was integrated into the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans ZX7. The upstream border of the gene cluster in Sor. cellulosum was defined by disrupting sorC, which is proposed to take part in the biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl-coenzyme A, to yield a Sor. cellulosum strain with abolished soraphen A production. Insertional inactivation of orf2 further upstream of sorC had no effect on soraphen A production. The genes sorR, C, D, F and E thus implicated in soraphen biosynthesis were then introduced into an engineered Str. lividans strain that carried the polyketide synthase genes sorA and sorB, and the methyltransferase gene sorM integrated into its chromosome. A benzoate-coenzyme A ligase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris was also included in some constructs. Fermentations with the engineered Str. lividans strains in the presence of benzoate and/or cinnamate yielded soraphen A. Further feeding experiments were used to delineate the biosynthesis of the benzoyl-coenzyme A starter unit of soraphen A in the heterologous host.	0
Title: Gausemycins A,B: Cyclic Lipoglycopeptides from Streptomyces sp.* Abstract: We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by Streptomyces sp. INA-Ac-5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of d-amino acids, lack of the Ca2+ -binding Asp-X-Asp-Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), and N-acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco- and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca2+ -dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.	1
Title: Novel genomic locus with atypical G+C content that is required for extracellular polysaccharide production and virulence in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Abstract: Three exopolysaccharide (EPS)- and virulence-deficient mutants of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight of rice, were isolated by Tn5 mutagenesis. These insertions are not located within the gum gene cluster. A 40-kb cosmid clone that restored EPS production and virulence to all three mutants was isolated, and the three transposon insertions were localized to contiguous 4.3- and 3.5-kb EcoRI fragments that are included in this clone. Sequence data indicate that two of the transposon insertions are in genes that encode a putative sugar nucleotide epimerase and a putative glycosyl transferase, respectively; the third insertion is located between the glycosyl transferase gene and a novel open reading frame (ORF). A 5.5-kb genomic region in which these three ORFs are located has a G+C content of 5-1.7%, quite different from the G+C content of approximately 65.0% that is typical of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Homologues of this locus have not yet been reported in any other xanthomonad.	1
Title: Helix-Dependent Spin Filtering through the DNA Duplex Abstract: Recent work suggests that electrons can travel through DNA and other chiral molecules in a spin-selective manner, but little is known about the origin of this spin selectivity. Here we describe experiments on magnetized DNA-modified electrodes to explore spin-selective electron transport through hydrated duplex DNA. Our results show that the two spins migrate through duplex DNA with a different yield and that spin selectivity requires charge transport through the DNA duplex. Significantly, shifting the same duplex DNA between right-handed B- and left-handed Z-forms leads to a diode-like switch in spin selectivity; which spin moves more efficiently through the duplex depends upon the DNA helicity. With DNA, the supramolecular organization of chiral moieties, rather than the chirality of the individual monomers, determines the selectivity in spin, and thus a conformational change can switch the spin selectivity.	0
Title: Modulating Enzyme Catalysis through Mutations Designed to Alter Rapid Protein Dynamics Abstract: The relevance of sub-picosecond protein motions to the catalytic event remains a topic of debate. Heavy enzymes (isotopically substituted) provide an experimental tool for bond-vibrational links to enzyme catalysis. A recent transition path sampling study with heavy purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) characterized the experimentally observed mass-dependent slowing of barrier crossing (Antoniou, D.; Ge, X.; Schramm, V. L.; Schwartz, S. D. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 3538). Here we computationally identify second-sphere amino acid residues predicted to influence the freedom of the catalytic site vibrational modes linked to heavy enzyme effects in PNP. We mutated heavy and light PNPs to increase the catalytic site vibrational freedom. Enzymatic barrier-crossing rates were converted from mass-dependent to mass-independent as a result of the mutations. The mutagenic uncoupling of femtosecond motions between catalytic site groups and reactants decreased transition state barrier crossing by 2 orders of magnitude, an indication of the femtosecond dynamic contributions to catalysis.	0
Title: Insights into the biosynthesis of hormaomycin, an exceptionally complex bacterial signaling metabolite Abstract: Hormaomycin produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus is a structurally highly modified depsipeptide that contains several unique building blocks with cyclopropyl, nitro, and chlorine moieties. Within the genus Streptomyces, it acts as a bacterial hormone that induces morphological differentiation and the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. In addition, hormaomycin is an extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. In this study, we shed light on hormaomycin biosynthesis by a combination of feeding studies, isolation of the biosynthetic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster, and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes. In addition, several nonnatural hormaomycin congeners were generated by feeding-induced metabolic rerouting. The NRPS contains numerous highly repetitive regions that suggest an evolutionary scenario for this unusual bacterial hormone, providing new opportunities for evolution-inspired metabolic engineering of novel nonribosomal peptides.	1
Title: Terpenoid tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids emetine, klugine, and isocephaeline inhibit the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in breast tumor cells Abstract: Klugine (1), isocephaeline (2), and emetine (4) inhibited hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation by hypoxia in T47D breast tumor cells (IC(50) values 0.2, 1.1, and 0.11 muM, respectively). Compounds 1, 2, and 4 inhibited both hypoxia- and iron chelator-induced HIF-1 activation by blocking HIF-1alpha protein accumulation.	0
Title: c-Yes tyrosine kinase is a potent suppressor of ES cell differentiation and antagonizes the actions of its closest phylogenetic relative, c-Src Abstract: Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage embryo and are characterized by self-renewal and pluripotency. Previous work has shown that Src-family tyrosine kinases display dynamic expression and activity changes during ES cell differentiation, suggesting distinct functions in the control of developmental fate. Here we used ES cells to test the hypothesis that c-Src and its closest phylogenetic relative, c-Yes, act in biological opposition despite their strong homology. Unlike c-Src, enforced expression of active c-Yes blocked ES cell differentiation to embryoid bodies by maintaining pluripotency gene expression. To explore the interplay of c-Src and c-Yes in ES cell differentiation, we engineered c-Src and c-Yes mutants that are resistant to A-419259, a potent pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor of the Src kinase family. Previous studies have shown that A-419259 treatment blocks all Src-family kinase activity in ES cells, preventing differentiation while maintaining pluripotency. Expression of inhibitor-resistant c-Src but not c-Yes rescued the A-419259 differentiation block, resulting in a cell population with properties of both primitive ectoderm and endoderm. Remarkably, when inhibitor-resistant c-Src and c-Yes were expressed together in ES cells, c-Yes activity suppressed c-Src-mediated differentiation. These studies show that even closely related kinases such as c-Src and c-Yes have unique and opposing functions in the same cell type. Selective agonists or inhibitors of c-Src versus c-Yes activity may allow more precise pharmacological manipulation of ES cell fate and have broader applications in other biological systems that express multiple Src family members such as tumor cells.	0
Title: Production of volatile sulfur compounds during the decomposition of algal mats Abstract: Blue-green algal mats incubated anaerobically rapidly produce large amounts of volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide. The major organic sulfur compound is methyl mercaptan, in contrast to previous results with marine eucaryotic algae. Light inhibited production of volatile sulfur compounds, apparently because the algae then produced O2, rendering the system aerobic.	0
Title: The genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506 reveals several gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of toxins and secondary metabolites Abstract: We report a draft sequence of the genome of Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, a cyanobacterium that produces anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a, two neurotoxins, and cylindrospermopsin, a cytotoxin. Beside the clusters of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins, we have found other clusters of genes likely involved in the biosynthesis of not-yet-identified secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Discovery of Ubonodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Active against Members of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex Abstract: We report the heterologous expression, structure, and antimicrobial activity of a lasso peptide, ubonodin, encoded in the genome of Burkholderia ubonensis. The topology of ubonodin is unprecedented amongst lasso peptides, with 18 of its 28 amino acids found in the mechanically bonded loop segment. Ubonodin inhibits RNA polymerase in vitro and has potent antimicrobial activity against several pathogenic members of the Burkholderia genus, most notably B. cepacia and B. multivorans, causative agents of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene clusters of coumermycin A(1), clorobiocin and caprazamycins in genetically modified Streptomyces coelicolor strains Abstract: The biosynthetic gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermycin A(1) and of the liponucleoside antibiotic caprazamycin were stably integrated into the genomes of different host strains derived from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). For the heterologous expression of clorobiocin derivatives in a chemically defined medium, inclusion of 0.6% of the siloxylated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer Q2-5247 into the growth medium proved to result in a 4.8-fold increase of productivity. Presumably, this copolymer acts as an oxygen carrier. The additional inclusion of cobalt chloride (0.2-2 mg l(-1)) dramatically increased the percentage of the desired compound clorobiocin within the total produced clorobiocin derivatives. This is very likely due to a stimulation of a cobalamin-dependent methylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme CloN6 of clorobiocin biosynthesis. All three investigated host strains (S. coelicolor M512, M1146 and M1154) gave similar production rates of total clorobiocin derivatives (on average, 158 mg l(-1) in the presence of 0.6% Q2-5247 and 0.2 mg l(-1) CoCl(2)). In contrast, heterologous production of caprazamycin derivatives was optimal in strain M1154 (amounts of 152 mg l(-1) on average).	1
Title: Global analysis of protein N-myristoylation and exploration of N-myristoyltransferase as a drug target in the neglected human pathogen Leishmania donovani Abstract: N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) modulates protein function through the attachment of the lipid myristate to the N terminus of target proteins, and is a promising drug target in eukaryotic parasites such as Leishmania donovani. Only a small number of NMT substrates have been characterized in Leishmania, and a global picture of N-myristoylation is lacking. Here, we use metabolic tagging with an alkyne-functionalized myristic acid mimetic in live parasites followed by downstream click chemistry and analysis to identify lipidated proteins in both the promastigote (extracellular) and amastigote (intracellular) life stages. Quantitative chemical proteomics is used to profile target engagement by NMT inhibitors, and to define the complement of N-myristoylated proteins. Our results provide new insight into the multiple pathways modulated by NMT and the pleiotropic effects of NMT inhibition. This work constitutes the first global experimental analysis of protein lipidation in Leishmania, and reveals the extent of NMT-related biology yet to be explored for this neglected human pathogen.	0
Title: Chromosomal organization governs the timing of cell type-specific gene expression required for spore formation in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: During the early stages of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, asymmetric division precedes chromosome segregation, such that the forespore transiently contains only about one-third of the genetic material surrounding the origin of replication. Shortly after septum formation, the transcription factor sigmaF initiates forespore-specific gene expression that is essential for the proteolytic activation of pro-sigmaE in the neighbouring mother cell. Moving the sigmaF-dependent spoIIR gene from its original origin-proximal position to an ectopic origin-distal site caused a delay in spoIIR transcription, as well as delays and reductions in the proteolytic activation of pro-sigmaE and sigmaE-directed gene expression. These defects correlated with the accumulation of disporic sporangia, thus reducing sporulation efficiency in a manner that depended upon the distance that spoIIR had been moved from the origin-proximal third of the chromosome. A significant proportion of disporic sporangia exhibited sigmaE activity in their central compartment, indicating that delays and reductions in sigmaE activation can lead to the formation of a second septum at the opposite pole. These observations support a model in which chromosomal spoIIR position temporally regulates sigmaE activation, thereby allowing for the rapid establishment of mother cell-specific gene expression that is essential for efficient spore formation. The implications of these findings for cell type-specific gene expression during the early stages of spore formation in B. subtilis are discussed.	0
Title: Genome sequencing reveals complex secondary metabolome in the marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica Abstract: Recent fermentation studies have identified actinomycetes of the marine-dwelling genus Salinispora as prolific natural product producers. To further evaluate their biosynthetic potential, we sequenced the 5,183,331-bp S. tropica CNB-440 circular genome and analyzed all identifiable secondary natural product gene clusters. Our analysis shows that S. tropica dedicates a large percentage of its genome ( approximately 9.9%) to natural product assembly, which is greater than previous Streptomyces genome sequences as well as other natural product-producing actinomycetes. The S. tropica genome features polyketide synthase systems of every known formally classified family, nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and several hybrid clusters. Although a few clusters appear to encode molecules previously identified in Streptomyces species, the majority of the 17 biosynthetic loci are novel. Specific chemical information about putative and observed natural product molecules is presented and discussed. In addition, our bioinformatic analysis not only was critical for the structure elucidation of the polyene macrolactam salinilactam A, but its structural analysis aided the genome assembly of the highly repetitive slm loci. This study firmly establishes the genus Salinispora as a rich source of drug-like molecules and importantly reveals the powerful interplay between genomic analysis and traditional natural product isolation studies.	1
Title: α-Methylene-β-Lactone Scaffold for Developing Chemical Probes at the Two Ends of the Selectivity Spectrum Abstract: The utilities of an α-methylene-β-lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac-alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe, but also recruits reduced endogenous glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH-β-lactone (GSH-Lac)-alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael or acyl addition. A peptide-centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac-alkyne as a high-coverage probe. The GSH-Lac-alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S-transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance. The assembly of the GSH-Lac probe exemplifies a modular and scalable route to develop selective probes with different recognizing moieties.	0
Title: Targeted Genome Mining-From Compound Discovery to Biosynthetic Pathway Elucidation Abstract: Natural products are an important source of novel investigational compounds in drug discovery. Especially in the field of antibiotics, Actinobacteria have been proven to be a reliable source for lead structures. The discovery of these natural products with activity- and structure-guided screenings has been impeded by the constant rediscovery of previously identified compounds. Additionally, a large discrepancy between produced natural products and biosynthetic potential in Actinobacteria, including representatives of the order Pseudonocardiales, has been revealed using genome sequencing. To turn this genomic potential into novel natural products, we used an approach including the in-silico pre-selection of unique biosynthetic gene clusters followed by their systematic heterologous expression. As a proof of concept, fifteen Saccharothrixespanaensis genomic library clones covering predicted biosynthetic gene clusters were chosen for expression in two heterologous hosts, Streptomyceslividans and Streptomycesalbus. As a result, two novel natural products, an unusual angucyclinone pentangumycin and a new type II polyketide synthase shunt product SEK90, were identified. After purification and structure elucidation, the biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of pentangumycin and SEK90 were deduced using mutational analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster and feeding experiments with 13C-labelled precursors.	1
Title: ClpP inhibitors are produced by a widespread family of bacterial gene clusters Abstract: The caseinolytic protease (ClpP) is part of a highly conserved proteolytic complex whose disruption can lead to antibacterial activity but for which few specific inhibitors have been discovered. Specialized metabolites produced by bacteria have been shaped by evolution for specific functions, making them a potential source of selective ClpP inhibitors. Here, we describe a target-directed genome mining strategy for discovering ClpP-interacting compounds by searching for biosynthetic gene clusters that contain duplicated copies of ClpP as putative antibiotic resistance genes. We identify a widespread family of ClpP-associated clusters that are known to produce pyrrolizidine alkaloids but whose connection to ClpP has never been made. We show that previously characterized molecules do not affect ClpP function but are shunt metabolites derived from the genuine product of these gene clusters, a reactive covalent ClpP inhibitor. Focusing on one such cryptic gene cluster from Streptomyces cattleya, we identify the relevant inhibitor, which we name clipibicyclene, and show that it potently and selectively inactivates ClpP. Finally, we solve the crystal structure of clipibicyclene-modified Escherichia coli ClpP. Clipibicyclene's discovery reveals the authentic function of a family of natural products whose specificity for ClpP and abundance in nature illuminate the role of eco-evolutionary forces during bacterial competition.	1
Title: Genetic locus for streptolysin S production by group A streptococcus Abstract: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis. Streptolysin S (SLS) is the cytolytic factor that creates the zone of beta-hemolysis surrounding GAS colonies grown on blood agar. We recently reported the discovery of a potential genetic determinant involved in SLS production, sagA, encoding a small peptide of 53 amino acids (S. D. Betschel, S. M. Borgia, N. L. Barg, D. E. Low, and J. C. De Azavedo, Infect. Immun. 66:1671-1679, 1998). Using transposon mutagenesis, chromosomal walking steps, and data from the GAS genome sequencing project (www.genome.ou.edu/strep. html), we have now identified a contiguous nine-gene locus (sagA to sagI) involved in SLS production. The sag locus is conserved among GAS strains regardless of M protein type. Targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis of each gene in the sag operon resulted in an SLS-negative phenotype. Targeted integrations (i) upstream of the sagA promoter and (ii) downstream of a terminator sequence after sagI did not affect SLS production, establishing the functional boundaries of the operon. A rho-independent terminator sequence between sagA and sagB appears to regulate the amount of sagA transcript produced versus transcript for the entire operon. Reintroduction of the nine-gene sag locus on a plasmid vector restored SLS activity to the nonhemolytic sagA knockout mutant. Finally, heterologous expression of the intact sag operon conferred the SLS beta-hemolytic phenotype to the nonhemolytic Lactococcus lactis. We conclude that gene products of the GAS sag operon are both necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Sequence homologies of sag operon gene products suggest that SLS is related to the bacteriocin family of microbial toxins.	1
Title: A cryptic pigment biosynthetic pathway uncovered by heterologous expression is essential for conidial development in Pestalotiopsis fici Abstract: Spore pigmentation is very common in the fungal kingdom. The best studied pigment in fungi is melanin which coats the surface of single cell spores. What and how pigments function in a fungal species with multiple cell conidia is poorly understood. Here, we identified and deleted a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene PfmaE and showed that it is essential for multicellular conidial pigmentation and development in a plant endophytic fungus, Pestalotiopsis fici. To further characterize the melanin pathway, we utilized an advanced Aspergillus nidulans heterologous system for the expression of the PKS PfmaE and the Pfma gene cluster. By structural elucidation of the pathway metabolite scytalone in A. nidulans, we provided chemical evidence that the Pfma cluster synthesizes DHN melanin. Combining genetic deletion and combinatorial gene expression of Pfma cluster genes, we determined that the putative reductase PfmaG and the PKS are sufficient for the synthesis of scytalone. Feeding scytalone back to the P. fici ΔPfmaE mutant restored pigmentation and multicellular adherence of the conidia. These results cement a growing understanding that pigments are essential not simply for protection of spores from biotic and abiotic stresses but also for spore structural development.	1
Title: Discovery and structure of the antimicrobial lasso peptide citrocin Abstract: We report the identification of citrocin, a 19-amino acid-long antimicrobial lasso peptide from the bacteria Citrobacter pasteurii and Citrobacter braakii We refactored the citrocin gene cluster and heterologously expressed it in Escherichia coli We determined citrocin's NMR structure in water and found that is reminiscent of that of microcin J25 (MccJ25), an RNA polymerase-inhibiting lasso peptide that hijacks the TonB-dependent transporter FhuA to gain entry into cells. Citrocin has moderate antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Citrobacter strains. We then performed an in vitro RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibition assay using citrocin and microcin J25 against E. coli RNAP. Citrocin has a higher minimal inhibition concentration than microcin J25 does against E. coli but surprisingly is ∼100-fold more potent as an RNAP inhibitor. This suggests that citrocin uptake by E. coli is limited. We found that unlike MccJ25, citrocin's activity against E. coli relied on neither of the two proton motive force-linked systems, Ton and Tol-Pal, for transport across the outer membrane. The structure of citrocin contains a patch of positive charge consisting of Lys-5 and Arg-17. We performed mutagenesis on these residues and found that the R17Y construct was matured into a lasso peptide but no longer had activity, showing the importance of this side chain for antimicrobial activity. In summary, we heterologously expressed and structurally and biochemically characterized an antimicrobial lasso peptide, citrocin. Despite being similar to MccJ25 in sequence, citrocin has an altered activity profile and does not use the same outer-membrane transporter to enter susceptible cells.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the nargenicin A1 pyrrole moiety from Nocardia sp. CS682 Abstract: A number of structurally diverse natural products harboring pyrrole moieties possess a wide range of biological activities. Studies on biosynthesis of pyrrole ring have shown that pyrrole moieties are derived from L-proline. Nargenicin A(1), a saturated alicyclic polyketide from Nocardia sp. CS682, is a pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester of nodusmicin. We cloned and identified a set of four genes from Nocardia sp. CS682 that show sequence similarity to the respective genes involved in the biosynthesis of the pyrrole moieties of pyoluteorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens, clorobiocin in Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. Oscitans, coumermycin A(1) in Streptomyces rishiriensis, one of the pyrrole rings of undecylprodigiosin in Streptomyces coelicolor, and leupyrrins in Sorangium cellulosum. These genes were designated as ngnN4, ngnN5, ngnN3, and ngnN2. In this study, we presented the evidences that the pyrrole moiety of nargenicin A(1) was also derived from L-proline by the coordinated action of three proteins, NgnN4 (proline adenyltransferase), NgnN5 (proline carrier protein), and NgnN3 (flavine-dependent acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenases). Biosynthesis of pyrrole moiety in nargenicin A(1) is initiated by NgnN4 that catalyzes ATP-dependent activation of L-proline into L-prolyl-AMP, and the latter is transferred to NgnN5 to create prolyl-S-peptidyl carrier protein (PCP). Later, NgnN3 catalyzes the two-step oxidation of prolyl-S-PCP into pyrrole-2-carboxylate. Thus, this study presents another example of a pyrrole moiety biosynthetic pathway that uses a set of three genes to convert L-proline into pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the chaetoviridin and chaetomugilin gene cluster in Chaetomium globosum reveal dual functions of an iterative highly-reducing polyketide synthase Abstract: We report the identification and characterization of the caz biosynthetic cluster from Chaetomium globosum and the characterization of a highly reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) that acts in both a sequential and convergent manner with a nonreducing PKS to form the chaetomugilin and chaetoviridin azaphilones. Genetic inactivation studies verified the involvement of individual caz genes in the biosynthesis of the azaphilones. Through in vitro reconstitution, we demonstrated the in vitro synthesis of chaetoviridin A from the pyranoquinone intermediate cazisochromene using the highly reducing PKS and an acyltransferase.	1
Title: Origin of Free Energy Barriers of Decarboxylation and the Reverse Process of CO2 Capture in Dimethylformamide and in Water Abstract: In aqueous solution, biological decarboxylation reactions proceed irreversibly to completion, whereas the reverse carboxylation processes are typically powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. The exchange of the carboxylate of ring-substituted arylacetates with isotope-labeled CO2 in polar aprotic solvents reported recently suggests a dramatic change in the partition of reaction pathways. Yet, there is little experimental data pertinent to the kinetic barriers for protonation and thermodynamic data on CO2 capture by the carbanions of decarboxylation reactions. Employing a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical simulation approach, we investigated the decarboxylation reactions of a series of organic carboxylate compounds in aqueous and in dimethylformamide solutions, revealing that the reverse carboxylation barriers in solution are fully induced by solvent effects. A linear Bell-Evans-Polanyi relationship was found between the rates of decarboxylation and the Gibbs energies of reaction, indicating diminishing recombination barriers in DMF. In contrast, protonation of the carbanions by the DMF solvent has large free energy barriers, rendering the competing exchange of isotope-labeled CO2 reversible in DMF. The finding of an intricate interplay of carbanion stability and solute-solvent interaction in decarboxylation and carboxylation could be useful to designing novel materials for CO2 capture.	0
Title: Supramolecular templating in kirromycin biosynthesis: the acyltransferase KirCII loads ethylmalonyl-CoA extender onto a specific ACP of the trans-AT PKS Abstract: In the biosynthesis of complex polyketides, acyltransferase domains (ATs) are key determinants of structural diversity. Their specificity and position in polyketide synthases (PKSs) usually controls the location and structure of building blocks in polyketides. Many bioactive polyketides, however, are generated by trans-AT PKSs lacking internal AT domains. They were previously believed to use mainly malonyl-specific free-standing ATs. Here, we report a mechanism of structural diversification, in which the trans-AT KirCII regiospecifically incorporates the unusual extender unit ethylmalonyl-CoA in kirromycin polyketide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of microcystin hepatotoxins in the cyanobacterial genus Fischerella Abstract: Microcystins (MCs) are serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors synthesized by several members of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Mining the draft genome sequence of the nostocalean MC-producing Fischerella sp. strain CENA161 led to the identification of three contigs containing mcy genes. Subsequent PCR and Sanger sequencing allowed the assembling of its complete biosynthetic mcy gene cluster with 55,016 bases in length. The cluster encoding ten genes (mcyA-J) with a central bidirectional promoter was organized in a similar manner as found in other genera of nostocalean cyanobacteria. However, the nucleotide sequence of the mcy gene cluster of Fischerella sp. CENA161 showed significant differences from all the other MC-producing cyanobacterial genera, sharing only 85.2 to 74.1% identities. Potential MC variants produced by Fischerella sp. CENA161 were predicted by the analysis of the adenylation domain binding pockets and further investigated by LC-MS/MS analysis. To our knowledge, this study presents the first complete mcy cluster characterization from a strain of the genus Fischerella, providing new insight into the distribution and evolution of MCs in the phylum Cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Experimental and Computational Analysis of Protein Stabilization by Gly-to-d-Ala Substitution: A Convolution of Native State and Unfolded State Effects Abstract: The rational and predictable enhancement of protein stability is an important goal in protein design. Most efforts target the folded state, however stability is the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states thus both are suitable targets. Strategies directed at the unfolded state usually seek to decrease chain entropy by introducing cross-links or by replacing glycines. Cross-linking has led to mixed results. Replacement of glycine with an l-amino acid, while reducing the entropy of the unfolded state, can introduce unfavorable steric interactions in the folded state, since glycine is often found in conformations that require a positive φ angle such as helical C-capping motifs or type I' and II″ β-turns. l-Amino acids are strongly disfavored in these conformations, but d-amino acids are not. However, there are few reported examples and conflicting results have been obtained when glycines are replaced with d-Ala. We critically examine the effect of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions on protein stability using experimental approaches together with molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. The data, together with a survey of high resolution structures, show that the vast majority of proteins can be stabilized by substitution of C-capping glycines with d-Ala. Sites suitable for substitutions can be identified via sequence alignment with a high degree of success. Steric clashes in the native state due to the new side chain are rarely observed, but are likely responsible for the destabilizing or null effect observed for the small subset of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions which are not stabilizing. Changes in backbone solvation play less of a role. Favorable candidates for d-Ala substitution can be identified using a rapid algorithm based on molecular mechanics.	0
Title: Quorum-sensing-dependent regulation of biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic mupirocin in Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 Abstract: Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid) is a polyketide antibiotic, targeting isoleucyl-tRNA synthase, and produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586. It is used clinically as a topical treatment for staphylococcal infections, particularly in contexts where there is a problem with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In studying the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster the authors identified two putative regulatory genes, mupR and mupI, whose predicted amino acid sequences showed significant identity to proteins involved in quorum-sensing-dependent regulatory systems such as LasR/LuxR (transcriptional activators) and LasI/LuxI (synthases for N-acylhomoserine lactones--AHLs--that activate LasR/LuxR). Inactivation by deletion mutations using a suicide vector strategy confirmed the requirement for both genes in mupirocin biosynthesis. Cross-feeding experiments between bacterial strains as well as solvent extraction showed that, as predicted, wild-type P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586 produces a diffusible substance that overcomes the defect of a mupI mutant. Use of biosensor strains showed that the MupI product can activate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasRlasI system and that P. aeruginosa produces one or more compounds that can replace the MupI product. Insertion of a xylE reporter gene into mupA, the first ORF of the mupirocin biosynthetic operon, showed that together mupR/mupI control expression of the operon in such a way that the cluster is switched on late in exponential phase and in stationary phase.	1
Title: The proteome and phosphoproteome of Neurospora crassa in response to cellulose, sucrose and carbon starvation Abstract: Improving cellulolytic enzyme production by plant biomass degrading fungi holds great potential in reducing costs associated with production of next-generation biofuels generated from lignocellulose. How fungi sense cellulosic materials and respond by secreting enzymes has mainly been examined by assessing function of transcriptional regulators and via transcriptional profiling. Here, we obtained global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of the plant biomass degrading filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa grown on different carbon sources, i.e. sucrose, no carbon, and cellulose, by performing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based LC-MS/MS analyses. A comparison between proteomes and transcriptomes under identical carbon conditions suggests that extensive post-transcriptional regulation occurs in N. crassa in response to exposure to cellulosic material. Several hundred amino acid residues with differential phosphorylation levels on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) or carbon-free medium vs sucrose medium were identified, including phosphorylation sites in a major transcriptional activator for cellulase genes, CLR1, as well as a cellobionic acid transporter, CBT1. Mutation of phosphorylation sites on CLR1 did not have a major effect on transactivation of cellulase production, while mutation of phosphorylation sites in CBT1 increased its transporting capacity. Our data provides rich information at both the protein and phosphorylation levels of the early cellular responses to carbon starvation and cellulosic induction and aids in a greater understanding of the underlying post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in filamentous fungi.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the maytansinoid antitumor agent ansamitocin from Actinosynnema pretiosum Abstract: Maytansinoids are potent antitumor agents found in plants and microorganisms. To elucidate their biosynthesis at the biochemical and genetic level and to set the stage for their structure modification through genetic engineering, we have cloned two gene clusters required for the biosynthesis of the maytansinoid, ansamitocin, from a cosmid library of Actinosynnema pretiosum ssp. auranticum ATCC 31565. This is a rare case in which the genes involved in the formation of a secondary metabolite are dispersed in separate regions in an Actinomycete. A set of genes, asm22-24, asm43-45, and asm47, was identified for the biosynthesis of the starter unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA). Remarkably, there are two AHBA synthase gene homologues, which may have different functions in AHBA formation. Four type I polyketide synthase genes, asmA-D, followed by the downloading asm9, together encode eight homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of chain initiation, elongation, or termination steps, which assemble the ansamitocin polyketide backbone. Another set of genes, asm13-17, encodes the formation of an unusual "methoxymalonate" polyketide chain extension unit that, notably, seems to be synthesized on a dedicated acyl carrier protein rather than as a CoA thioester. Additional ORFs are involved in postsynthetic modifications of the initial polyketide synthase product, which include methylations, an epoxidation, an aromatic chlorination, and the introduction of acyl and carbamoyl groups. Tentative functions of several asm genes were confirmed by inactivation and heterologous expression.	1
Title: Mass spectrometry and the emerging field of glycomics Abstract: The biological significance of protein and lipid glycosylation is well established. For example, cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering glycan structures on their surfaces, and cancer cells evade normal growth regulation in part by remodeling their surface glycans. In general, glycan chemical properties differ significantly from those of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecule metabolites. Thus, advances in glycomics, a comprehensive study to identify all glycans in an organism, rely on the development of specialized analytical methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as an enabling technology in the field of glycomics. This review summarizes recent developments in mass spectrometric analysis methods for protein-based glycomics and glycoproteomics workflows.	0
Title: CylA is a sequence-specific protease involved in toxin biosynthesis Abstract: CylA is a subtilisin-like protein belonging to a recently expanded serine protease family related to class II lanthipeptide biosynthesis. As a leader peptidase, CylA is responsible for maturation of the enterococcal cytolysin, a lantibiotic important for Enterococcus faecalis virulence. In vitro reconstitution of CylA reveals that it accepts both linear and modified cytolysin peptides with a preference for cyclized peptides. Further characterization indicates that CylA activates itself by removing its N-terminal 95 amino acids. CylA achieves sequence-specific traceless cleavage of non-cognate peptides even if they are post-translationally modified, which makes the peptidase a powerful tool for mining novel lanthipeptides by providing a general strategy for leader peptide removal. Knowledge about the substrate specificity of CylA may also facilitate the development of protease inhibitors targeting cytolysin biosynthesis as a potential therapeutic approach for enterococcal infections.	0
Title: Synthesis of the ABCD and ABCDE ring systems of azaspiracid-1 Abstract: The efficient syntheses of the ABCD ring system of the originally proposed structure of azaspiracid-1 and the ABCDE ring system of the revised structure of azaspiracid-1 containing the correct stereochemistry at C(6), C(10), C(13), C(14), C(16), C(17), C(19), C(21), C(22), C(24) and C(25) have been achieved.	0
Title: Diisonitrile Natural Product SF2768 Functions As a Chalkophore That Mediates Copper Acquisition in Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster (sfa) was identified in Streptomyces thioluteus to direct the biosynthesis of the diisonitrile antibiotic SF2768. Its biosynthetic pathway was reasonably proposed based on bioinformatics analysis, metabolic profiles of mutants, and the elucidation of the intermediate and shunt product structures. Bioinformatics-based alignment found a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter related to iron import within the biosynthetic gene cluster, which implied that the product might be a siderophore. However, characterization of the metal-binding properties by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), metal-ligand titration, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and chrome azurol S (CAS) assays revealed that the final product SF2768 and its diisonitrile derivatives specifically bind copper, rather than iron, to form stable complexes. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that the intracellular cupric content of S. thioluteus significantly increased upon incubation with the copper-SF2768 complex, direct evidence for the copper acquisition function of SF2768. Further in vivo functional characterization of the transport elements for the copper-SF2768 complexes not only confirmed the chalkophore identity of the compound but also gave initial clues into the copper uptake mechanism of this nonmethanotrophic microorganism.	1
Title: ANTAGONISM OF D-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF MYCOBACTERIAL GROWTH BY D-ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Antagonism of d-cycloserine inhibition of mycobacterial growth by d-alanine. J. Bacteriol. 85:1217-1220. 1963.-Reversal of the antimycobacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidinone (d-cycloserine) by alanine in two species of mycobacteria actively growing on chemically defined media was compared. In both instances, d-alanine was the most effective reversal agent. The specificity with which the d isomer reversed the antimycobacterial activity of d-cycloserine was more pronounced than that observed with other species of bacteria. Mycobactin, a growth factor for certain mycobacteria, showed no reversal activity.	0
Title: Engineering the substrate specificity of the DhbE adenylation domain by yeast cell surface display Abstract: The adenylation (A) domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) activate aryl acids or amino acids to launch their transfer through the NRPS assembly line for the biosynthesis of many medicinally important natural products. In order to expand the substrate pool of NRPSs, we developed a method based on yeast cell surface display to engineer the substrate specificities of the A-domains. We acquired A-domain mutants of DhbE that have 11- and 6-fold increases in k(cat)/K(m) with nonnative substrates 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-aminobenzoic acid, respectively and corresponding 3- and 33-fold decreases in k(cat)/K(m) values with the native substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, resulting in a dramatic switch in substrate specificity of up to 200-fold. Our study demonstrates that yeast display can be used as a high throughput selection platform to reprogram the "nonribosomal code" of A-domains.	0
Title: The phtE locus in the phaseolotoxin gene cluster has ORFs with homologies to genes encoding amino acid transferases, the AraC family of transcriptional factors, and fatty acid desaturases Abstract: A cluster of genes involved in the production of phaseolotoxin, a phytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, contains eight (phtA through phtH) complementation groups (Y. X. Zhang, K. B. Rowley, and S. S. Patil, J. Bacteriol., 175:6451-6458, 1993). In this study, sequencing of the region encompassing the phtE locus revealed six putative open reading frames (ORFs), each preceded by a putative ribosomal binding site, and all oriented in the same direction. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction suggested that the phtE locus is transcribed as one large (6.4 kb) transcript, indicating that the ORFs constitute an operon. Primer extension analysis showed that the transcript begins at a T, located 31 bp upstream of the ATG codon of ORF1. Comparison of the sequences of the putative ORFs with the sequences of known genes revealed that ORF3, encoding a protein containing 395 amino acids, has 55% similarity to the acetylornithine aminotransferase gene from Escherichia coli, and the ornithine aminotransferase genes from other organisms. A lysine residue that is a binding site for pyridoxal phosphate and an arginine residue that is a binding site for the alpha-carboxylate group of the substrate are conserved in ORF3. These data suggest that ORF3 encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of ornithine, a constituent of phaseolotoxin. ORF5, encoding a peptide of 378 amino acid residues, possesses a helix-turn-helix motif at the C-terminal end that is characteristic of the AraC family of transcriptional factors, and there is a possible leucine zipper at the N-terminal end of this peptide. ORF6, encoding a protein of 327 amino acids, has about 40% similarity with the fatty acid desaturase gene, desA, of Synechocystis Pcc6803 and considerable similarity with fatty acid desaturase genes from other organisms. ORF6 and desA show very similar hydropathy profiles and both contain a copper binding signature. Computer searches did not discover significant homologies in the data base for the other ORFs, but hydropathy analysis showed that all of them contain one to several hydrophobic domains, suggesting that the gene products of these ORFs may be membrane associated.	1
Title: Unveiling of Swainsonine Biosynthesis via a Multibranched Pathway in Fungi Abstract: The indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine (SW) is a deadly mycotoxin to livestock that can be produced by different plant-associated fungi, including the endophytic entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium species. The SW biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified but the genetic mechanism of SW biosynthesis remains obscure. To unveil the SW biosynthetic pathway, we performed gene deletions in M. robertsii, heterologous expression of a core biosynthetic gene, substrate feedings, mass spectrometry, and bioassay analyses in this study. It was unveiled that SW is produced via a multibranched pathway by the hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) gene cluster in M. robertsii. The precursor pipecolic acid can be converted from lysine by both the SW biosynthetic cluster and the unclustered genes such as lysine cyclodeaminase. The hybrid NRPS-PKS enzyme produces three intermediates with and without domain skipping. Intriguingly, the biosynthetic process is coupled with the cis to trans nonenzymatic epimerization of C1-OH for both hydroxyl- and dihydroxyl-indolizidine intermediates. We also found that SW production was dispensable for fungal colonization of plants and infection of insect hosts. Functional characterization of the SW biosynthetic genes in this study may benefit the safe use of Metarhizium fungi as insect biocontrol agents and the management of livestock pastures from SW contamination by genetic manipulation of the toxin-producing fungi.	1
Title: Fueling up skeletal muscle to reduce obesity: A TrkB story Abstract: Targeting TrkB signaling could represent a good therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Chan et al. report the efficacy of 7,8-DHT, a TrkB agonist, in preventing obesity in female mice. The underlying molecular mechanisms behind this activity seem to involve increased energy expenditure in skeletal muscle.	0
Title: Manipulation of quorum sensing regulation in Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 to increase mupirocin production Abstract: Transcription of the 74 kb Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin [pseudomonic acid (PA)] biosynthesis cluster depends on quorum sensing-dependent regulation via the LuxI/LuxR homologues MupI/MupR. To facilitate analysis of novel PAs from pathway mutants, we investigated factors that affect mup gene expression. First, the signal produced by MupI was identified as N-(3-oxodecanoyl)homoserine lactone, but exogenous addition of this molecule did not activate mupirocin production prematurely nor did expression of mupI in trans increase metabolite production. Second, we confirmed that mupX, encoding an amidase/hydrolase that can degrade N-acylhomoserine lactones, is also required for efficient expression, consistent with its occurrence in a regulatory module linked to unrelated genes in P. fluorescens. Third, and most significantly, mupR expression in trans to wild type and mutants can increase production of antibiotic and novel intermediates up to 17-fold.	1
Title: Regulation of the Streptomyces coelicolor calcium-dependent antibiotic by absA, encoding a cluster-linked two-component system Abstract: The Streptomyces coelicolor absA two-component system was initially identified through analysis of mutations in the sensor kinase absA1 that caused inhibition of all four antibiotics synthesized by this strain. Previous genetic analysis had suggested that the phosphorylated form of AbsA2 acted as a negative regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor (T. B. Anderson, P. Brian, and W. C. Champness, Mol. Microbiol. 39:553-566, 2001). Genomic sequence data subsequently provided by the Sanger Centre (Cambridge, United Kingdom) revealed that absA was located within the gene cluster for production of one of the four antibiotics, calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA). In this paper we have identified numerous transcriptional start sites within the CDA cluster and have shown that the original antibiotic-negative mutants used to identify absA exhibit a stronger negative regulation of promoters upstream of the proposed CDA biosynthetic genes than of promoters in the clusters responsible for production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. The same antibiotic-negative mutants also showed an increase in transcription from a promoter divergent to that of absA, upstream of a putative ABC transporter, in addition to an increase in transcription of absA itself. Interestingly, the negative regulation of the biosynthetic transcripts did not appear to be mediated by transcriptional regulation of cdaR (a gene encoding a homolog of the pathway-specific regulators of the act and red clusters) or by any other recognizable transcriptional regulator associated with the cluster. The role of absA in regulating the expression of the diverse antibiotic biosynthesis clusters in the genome is discussed in light of its location in the cda cluster.	1
Title: The biosynthetic pathway to tetromadurin (SF2487/A80577), a polyether tetronate antibiotic Abstract: The type I polyketide SF2487/A80577 (herein referred to as tetromadurin) is a polyether tetronate ionophore antibiotic produced by the terrestrial Gram-positive bacterium Actinomadura verrucosospora. Tetromadurin is closely related to the polyether tetronates tetronasin (M139603) and tetronomycin, all of which are characterised by containing a tetronate, cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran, and at least one tetrahydrofuran ring. We have sequenced the genome of Actinomadura verrucosospora to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tetromadurin biosynthesis (the mad gene cluster). Based on bioinformatic analysis of the 32 genes present within the cluster a plausible biosynthetic pathway for tetromadurin biosynthesis is proposed. Functional confirmation of the mad gene cluster is obtained by performing in-frame deletions in each of the genes mad10 and mad31, which encode putative cyclase enzymes responsible for cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran formation, respectively. Furthermore, the A. verrucosospora Δmad10 mutant produces a novel tetromadurin metabolite that according to mass spectrometry analysis is analogous to the recently characterised partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate lacking its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. Our results therefore elucidate the biosynthetic machinery of tetromadurin biosynthesis and lend support for a conserved mechanism of cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran biosynthesis across polyether tetronates.	1
Title: Characterization of the terminal activation step catalyzed by oxygenase CmmOIV of the chromomycin biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Inactivation and initial interrogation of key oxygenase CmmOIV of the biosynthetic pathway of chromomycin A(3) in Streptomyces griseus ssp. griseus revealed that a completely methylated and acetylated prechromomycin is the preferred substrate of this enzyme. This suggests that the three sugar decoration reactions, two O-acetylations and an O-methylation, which were previously believed to occur as the final steps of chromomycin A(3) biosynthesis, indeed take place prior to the CmmOIV reaction. Upon inactivation of CmmOIV, four new compounds accumulated; the fully decorated prechromomycin and its incompletely acetylated precursor along with a diketoprechromomycin-type compound were fully characterized and assayed with CmmOIV.	1
Title: Three previously unrecognised classes of biosynthetic enzymes revealed during the production of xenovulene A Abstract: Xenovulene A is a complex fungal meroterpenoid, produced by the organism hitherto known as Acremonium strictum IMI 501407, for which limited biosynthetic evidence exists. Here, we generate a draft genome and show that the producing organism is previously unknown and should be renamed as Sarocladium schorii. A biosynthetic gene cluster is discovered which bears resemblance to those involved in the biosynthesis of fungal tropolones, with additional genes of unknown function. Heterologous reconstruction of the entire pathway in Aspergillus oryzae allows the chemical steps of biosynthesis to be dissected. The pathway shows very limited similarity to the biosynthesis of other fungal meroterpenoids. The pathway features: the initial formation of tropolone intermediates; the likely involvement of a hetero Diels-Alder enzyme; a terpene cyclase with no significant sequence homology to any known terpene cyclase and two enzymes catalysing oxidative-ring contractions.	1
Title: Ligand-Enabled Pd(II)-Catalyzed Bromination and Iodination of C(sp3)-H Bonds Abstract: We herein report the palladium(II)-catalyzed bromination and iodination of a variety of α-hydrogen-containing carboxylic acid and amino acid-derived amides. These reactions are exclusively enabled by quinoline-type ligands. The halogenated products obtained in this reaction are highly versatile and rapidly undergo further diversification. Further, we report the first example of a free carboxylic acid-directed Pd(II)-catalyzed C(sp3)-H bromination, enabled by quinoline ligands.	0
Title: Two different lantibiotic-like peptides originate from the ericin gene cluster of Bacillus subtilis A1/3 Abstract: A lantibiotic gene cluster was identified in Bacillus subtilis A1/3 showing a high degree of homology to the subtilin gene cluster and occupying the same genetic locus as the spa genes in B. subtilis ATCC 6633. The gene cluster exhibits diversity with respect to duplication of two subtilin-like genes which are separated by a sequence similar to a portion of a lanC gene. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses of B. subtilis A1/3 culture extracts confirmed the presence of two lantibiotic-like peptides, ericin S (3,442 Da) and ericin A (2,986 Da). Disruption of the lanB-homologous gene eriB resulted in loss of production of both peptides, demonstrating that they are processed in an eriB-dependent manner. Although precursors of ericins S and A show only 75% of identity, the matured lantibiotic-like peptides reveal highly similar physical properties; separation was only achieved after multistep, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on Edman and peptidase degradation in combination with MALDI-TOF MS, for ericin S a subtilin-like, lanthionine-bridging pattern is supposed. For ericin A two C-terminal rings are different from the lanthionine pattern of subtilin. Due to only four amino acid exchanges, ericin S and subtilin revealed similar antibiotic activities as well as similar properties in response to heat and protease treatment. For ericin A only minor antibiotic activity was found.	1
Title: Role of the FeoB protein and siderophore in promoting virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae on rice Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice. Our analysis revealed that the X. oryzae pv. oryzae genome encodes genes responsible for iron uptake through FeoB (homolog of the major bacterial ferrous iron transporter) and a siderophore. A mutation in the X. oryzae pv. oryzae feoB gene causes severe virulence deficiency, growth deficiency in iron-limiting medium, and constitutive production of a siderophore. We identified an iron regulated xss gene cluster, in which xssABCDE (Xanthomonas siderophore synthesis) and xsuA (Xanthomonas siderophore utilization) genes encode proteins involved in biosynthesis and utilization of X. oryzae pv. oryzae siderophore. Mutations in the xssA, xssB, and xssE genes cause siderophore deficiency and growth restriction under iron-limiting conditions but are virulence proficient. An xsuA mutant displayed impairment in utilization of native siderophore, suggesting that XsuA acts as a specific receptor for a ferric-siderophore complex. Histochemical and fluorimetric assays with gusA fusions indicate that, during in planta growth, the feoB gene is expressed and that the xss operon is not expressed. This study represents the first report describing a role for feoB in virulence of any plant-pathogenic bacterium and the first functional characterization of a siderophore-biosynthetic gene cluster in any xanthomonad.	1
Title: GriC and GriD constitute a carboxylic acid reductase involved in grixazone biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: In grixazone biosynthesis by Streptomyces griseus, a key intermediate 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) is converted to another key intermediate 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AHBAL). Two genes griC and griD in the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster were found to be responsible for this conversion, because disruption of each gene resulted in the extracellular accumulation of 3-acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a shunt product from 3,4-AHBA. Significant sequence similarity of GriC to AMP-binding proteins and of GriD to NAD(P)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases suggested that GriC and GriD constituted an ATP- and NAD(P)-dependent carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) catalyzing reduction of 3,4-AHBA to produce 3,4-AHBAL through acyl-AMP formation, as is found for the reactions catalyzed by some CARs. griG encoding a benzoate transporter homologue in the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster was nonessential for grixazone biosynthesis but probably enhanced the membrane permeability for 3,4-AHBA. Simultaneous overexpression of griC, griD, and griG in S. griseus mutant cells deficient in an acetyltransferase responsible for N-acetylation of 3,4-AHBA led to efficient bioconversion of exogenously added 3,4-AHBA to 3,4-AHBAL. This system also turned out to be useful for reduction of some aryl carboxylates to the corresponding aryl aldehydes.	1
Title: The effect of varying levels of sodium bicarbonate on polychlorinated biphenyl dechlorination in Hudson River sediment cultures Abstract: The addition of different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate had a profound effect on 2,3,4,5-chlorobiphenyl (2,3,4,5-CB) dechlorination in Hudson River sediment cultures. The most extensive dechlorination was observed in cultures to which 100 mg l(-1) bicarbonate was added. Cultures amended with 1000 mg l(-1) bicarbonate had the least extensive dechlorination, with 2,4-CB and 2,5-CB as predominant end-products. A significant loss of total chlorinated biphenyl mass was observed in cultures to which < or = 500 mg l(-1) bicarbonate was added, suggesting that degradation beyond chlorinated biphenyls occurred. The dynamics of acetate formation were different among the treatments, with high acetate concentrations detected throughout the 303-day experiment in cultures to which 1000 mg l(-1) bicarbonate had been added. Sodium bicarbonate addition also had a significant impact on bacterial community structure as detected by polymerase chain reaction-denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Three putative polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) dechlorinators were identified; one Dehalococcoides-like population was detected in all enrichment cultures, whereas two Dehalobacter-like populations were only detected in the enrichment cultures with the most extensive dechlorination. These results suggest that the availability of bicarbonate, and potentially sodium, may affect PCB dechlorination in Hudson River sediment and thus need to be taken into consideration when assessing the fate of PCBs or implementing bioremediation.	0
Title: The mtmVUC genes of the mithramycin gene cluster in Streptomyces argillaceus are involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar moieties Abstract: Mithramycin is a glycosylated aromatic polyketide produced by Streptomyces argillaceus, and is used as an antitumor drug. Three genes (mtmV, mtmU and mtmC) from the mithramycin gene cluster have been cloned, and characterized by DNA sequencing and by analysis of the products that accumulate in nonproducing mutants, which were generated by insertional inactivation of these genes. The mtm V gene codes for a 2,3-dehydratase that catalyzes early and common steps in the biosynthesis of the three sugars found in mithramycin (D-olivose, D-oliose and D-mycarose); its inactivation caused the accumulation of the nonglycosylated intermediate premithramycinone. The mtmU gene codes for a 4-ketoreductase involved in D-oliose biosynthesis, and its inactivation resulted in the accumulation of premithramycinone and premithramycin A , the first glycosylated intermediate which contains a D-olivose unit. The third gene, mtmC, is involved in D-mycarose biosynthesis and codes for a C-methyltransferase. Two mutants with lesions in the mtmC gene accumulated mithramycin intermediates lacking the D-mycarose moiety but containing D-olivose units attached to C-12a in which the 4-keto group is unreduced. This suggests that mtmC could code for a second enzyme activity, probably a D-olivose 4-ketoreductase, and that the glycosyltransferase responsible for the incorporation of D-olivose (MtmGIV) shows some degree of flexibility with respect to its sugar co-substrate, since the 4-ketoanalog is also transferred. A pathway is proposed for the biosynthesis of the three sugar moieties in mithramycin.	1
Title: Salivaricin D, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c isolated from a healthy infant Abstract: In this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin D) from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c. Salivaricin D is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 Da); the locus of the gene encoding this peptide is a 16.5-kb DNA segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an ABC transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and ABC transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. The immunity gene (salI) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin D, confirming its immunity function. Salivaricin D is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. It is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of Gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a probiotic bacterium.	1
Title: Protein folding, protein collapse, and tanford's transfer model: lessons from single-molecule FRET Abstract: The essential and nontrivial role of the denatured state of proteins in their folding reaction is being increasingly scrutinized in recent years. Single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments show that the denatured state undergoes a continuous collapse (or coil-to-globule) transition as the concentration of a chemical denaturant is decreased, suggesting that conformational entropy of the denatured state is an important part of the free energy of folding. Such observations question the validity of the classical Tanford transfer model, which suggests that the folding free energy can be understood solely based on the difference in amino acid solvation between the folded state and a fixed unfolded state. An alternative to the transfer model is obtained here from a polymer theoretical analysis of a series of published smFRET data. The analysis shows that the free energy of denatured-state collapse has a linear dependence on denaturant concentration, an outcome of the interplay between enthalpic and entropic contributions. Surprisingly, the slope of the free energy of collapse agrees very well with the respective slope of the free energy of folding. This conformity of values obtained from two very different measurements shows that it is the collapse transition in the denatured state which mediates the effect of denaturants on folding. The energetics of folding are thus governed by the competition of solvation and conformational entropy in the denatured state.	0
Title: The human innate immune protein calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Most microbial pathogens have a metabolic iron requirement, necessitating the acquisition of this nutrient in the host. In response to pathogen invasion, the human host limits iron availability. Although canonical examples of nutritional immunity are host strategies that limit pathogen access to Fe(III), little is known about how the host restricts access to another biologically relevant oxidation state of this metal, Fe(II). This redox species is prevalent at certain infection sites and is utilized by bacteria during chronic infection, suggesting that Fe(II) withholding by the host may be an effective but unrecognized form of nutritional immunity. Here, we report that human calprotectin (CP; S100A8/S100A9 or MRP8/MRP14 heterooligomer) inhibits iron uptake and induces an iron starvation response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells by sequestering Fe(II) at its unusual His6 site. Moreover, under aerobic conditions in which the Fe(III) oxidation state is favored, Fe(II) withholding by CP was enabled by (i) its ability to stabilize this redox state in solution and (ii) the production and secretion of redox-active, P. aeruginosa-produced phenazines, which reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II). Analyses of the interplay between P. aeruginosa secondary metabolites and CP indicated that Fe(II) withholding alters P. aeruginosa physiology and expression of virulence traits. Lastly, examination of the effect of CP on cell-associated metal levels in diverse human pathogens revealed that CP inhibits iron uptake by several bacterial species under aerobic conditions. This work implicates CP-mediated Fe(II) sequestration as a component of nutritional immunity in both aerobic and anaerobic milieus during P. aeruginosa infection.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Heterologous Production of Argyrins Abstract: Argyrins represent a family of cyclic octapeptides exhibiting promising antimicrobial, antitumorigenic and immunosuppressant activities. They derive from a nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway, which was identified and characterized in this study from the myxobacterial producer strain Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. Using the native biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) sequence as template synthetic BGC versions were designed and assembled from gene synthesis fragments. A heterologous expression system was established after chromosomal deletion of a well-expressed lipopeptide pathway from the host strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. Different approaches were applied to engineer and improve heterologous argyrin production, which was finally increased to 160 mg/L, around 20-fold higher yields compared to the native producer. Heterologous production platform also led to identification of several novel argyrin derivatives (A2, F3, G3, I, J, K, and L). The optimized production system provides a versatile platform for future supply of argyrins and novel derivatives thereof.	1
Title: Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Si-Stereogenic Silyl Ethers Abstract: Functionalized enantiopure organosilanes are important building blocks with applications in various fields of chemistry; nevertheless, asymmetric synthetic methods for their preparation are rare. Here we report the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of tertiary silyl ethers possessing "central chirality" on silicon. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrizing carbon-carbon bond forming silicon-hydrogen exchange reaction of symmetrical bis(methallyl)silanes with phenols using newly developed imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalysts. A variety of enantiopure silyl ethers was obtained in high yields with good chemo- and enantioselectivities and could be readily derivatized to several useful chiral silicon compounds, leveraging the olefin functionality and the leaving group nature of the phenoxy substituent.	0
Title: Negative capacitance in multidomain ferroelectric superlattices Abstract: The stability of spontaneous electrical polarization in ferroelectrics is fundamental to many of their current applications, which range from the simple electric cigarette lighter to non-volatile random access memories. Research on nanoscale ferroelectrics reveals that their behaviour is profoundly different from that in bulk ferroelectrics, which could lead to new phenomena with potential for future devices. As ferroelectrics become thinner, maintaining a stable polarization becomes increasingly challenging. On the other hand, intentionally destabilizing this polarization can cause the effective electric permittivity of a ferroelectric to become negative, enabling it to behave as a negative capacitance when integrated in a heterostructure. Negative capacitance has been proposed as a way of overcoming fundamental limitations on the power consumption of field-effect transistors. However, experimental demonstrations of this phenomenon remain contentious. The prevalent interpretations based on homogeneous polarization models are difficult to reconcile with the expected strong tendency for domain formation, but the effect of domains on negative capacitance has received little attention. Here we report negative capacitance in a model system of multidomain ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices across a wide range of temperatures, in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Using a phenomenological model, we show that domain-wall motion not only gives rise to negative permittivity, but can also enhance, rather than limit, its temperature range. Our first-principles-based atomistic simulations provide detailed microscopic insight into the origin of this phenomenon, identifying the dominant contribution of near-interface layers and paving the way for its future exploitation.	0
Title: Gold(I)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,3-Diols through Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of Allenes Abstract: A gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of 1,3-diols was achieved by intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenes. The catalyst system 3-F-dppe(AuCl)2/(R)-C8-TRIPAg proved to be specifically efficient to promote the desymmetrizing cyclization of 2-aryl-1,3-diols, which have proven challenging substrates in previous reports. Multisubstituted tetrahydrofurans were prepared in good yield with good enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity by this method.	0
Title: Structure elucidation and biosynthetic gene cluster analysis of caniferolides A-D, new bioactive 36-membered macrolides from the marine-derived Streptomyces caniferus CA-271066 Abstract: Bioassay-guided isolation based on the antifungal activity of a culture broth of the marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces caniferus CA-271066 led to the discovery of new 36-membered polyol macrolides, caniferolides A-D (1-4). Their connectivity was determined by spectroscopic methods including ESITOF-MS and 1D/2D NMR. The relative stereochemistry of each stereocluster in these compounds was established using NOE analysis, the universal database method and J-based configuration analysis, further assisted by comparisons with NMR data of structurally related macrolides. Genome sequencing followed by detailed bioinformatics analysis led to the identification of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster and allowed the prediction of the stereochemical outcome of their biosynthesis, confirming the relative stereochemistry of each stereocluster already determined by NMR and establishing their stereochemical relationship, ultimately rendering the absolute configuration of all chiral centers. Furthermore, based on our results and already published data, it has been possible to derive the complete absolute configuration of the related macrolides PM100117 and PM100118, astolides A and B, and deplelides A and B. Caniferolides A-D have shown pronounced antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus alongside antiproliferative activity against five human tumoral cell lines.	1
Title: Draft genome sequence of the Paenibacillus polymyxa type strain (ATCC 842T), a plant growth-promoting bacterium Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa is an endospore-forming Gram-positive soil bacterium that is well-known for its ability to promote plant growth. Here we report the draft genome sequence of P. polymyxa ATCC 842(T), the type strain of the species P. polymyxa, and the family Paenibacillaceae. The P. polymyxa genome contains a repertoire of biosynthetic genes for antibiotics and hydrolytic enzymes that account for its beneficial effects in the rhizosphere to the host plants it associates with.	1
Title: Interrogating PP1 Activity in the MAPK Pathway with Optimized PP1-Disrupting Peptides Abstract: Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1)-disrupting peptides (PDPs) are selective chemical modulators of PP1 that liberate the active PP1 catalytic subunit from regulatory proteins; thus allowing the dephosphorylation of nearby substrates. We have optimized the original cell-active PDP3 for enhanced stability, and obtained insights into the chemical requirements for stabilizing this 23-mer peptide for cellular applications. The optimized PDP-Nal was used to dissect the involvement of PP1 in the MAPK signaling cascade. Specifically, we have demonstrated that, in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, phosphoMEK1/2 is a direct substrate of PP1, whereas dephosphorylation of phosphoERK1/2 is indirect and likely mediated through enhanced tyrosine phosphatase activity after PDP-mediated PP1 activation. Thus, as liberators of PP1 activity, PDPs represent a valuable tool for identifying the substrates of PP1 and understanding its role in diverse signaling cascades.	0
Title: Protection and Isolation of Bioorthogonal Metal Catalysts by Using Monolayer-Coated Nanozymes Abstract: We demonstrate here the protection of biorthogonal transition metal catalysts (TMCs) in biological environments by using self-assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Encapsulation of TMCs in this hydrophobic environment preserves catalytic activity in presence of pH conditions and complex biological media that would deactivate free catalyst. Significantly, the protection affords by these nanozymes extends to isolation of the catalyst active site, as demonstrated by the independence of rate over a wide pH range, in strong contrast to the behavior of the free catalyst.	0
Title: Screening for a diamond in the rough Abstract: Contrary to the standard of eliminating antimicrobial hits that collapse bacterial proton motive force (PMF), in this issue of Chemistry and Biology, Farha and colleagues describe the value of screens to identify molecules that dissipate PMF, yet are nonbacteriolytic and selectively toxic.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin: genomic organization and membrane localization of the NisB protein Abstract: Nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis 6F3 is used as a food preservative and is the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Götz, H. Zähner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). Nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisA, encodes a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active lantibiotic (C. Kaletta and K.-D. Entian, J. Bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). Adjacent to nisA, the additional genes nisB, nisT, and nisC were identified. Over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis Tü 3298. Genes nisB, nisT, and nisC corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. The nisT open reading frame is homologous to proteins of the HlyB (hemolysin B protein of Escherichia coli) subfamily. Proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and anti-drug tumors, indicating that NisT may be involved in nisin transport. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisA structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisA gene was determined by primer extension. Additionally, a mRNA of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisB. Antibodies were raised against the NisB protein, and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kDa, which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kDa as calculated from the nisB open reading frame. Several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that NisB is associated with the membrane. This was confirmed by preparing L. lactis vesicles. The NisB protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. These results suggest that NisB is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.	1
Title: Development of thermostable sucrose phosphorylase by semi-rational design for efficient biosynthesis of alpha-D-glucosylglycerol Abstract: Sucrose phosphorylase (SPase) can specifically catalyze transglycosylation reactions and can be used to enzymatically synthesize α-D-glycosides. However, the low thermostability of SPase has been a bottleneck for its industrial application. In this study, a SPase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides ATCC 12,291 (LmSPase) was synthesized with optimized codons and overexpressed successfully in Escherichia coli. A semi-rational design strategy that combined the FireProt (a web server designing thermostable proteins), structure-function analysis, and molecular dynamic simulations was used to improve the thermostability of LmSPase. Finally, one single-point mutation T219L and a combination mutation I31F/T219L/T263L/S360A (Mut4) with improved thermostability were obtained. The half-lives at 50 °C of T219L and Mut4 both increased approximately two-fold compared to that of wild-type LmSPase (WT). Furthermore, the two variants T219L and Mut4 were used to produce α-D-glucosylglycerol (αGG) from sucrose and glycerol by incubating with 40 U/mL crude extracts at 37 °C for 60 h and achieved the product concentration of 193.2 ± 12.9 g/L and 195.8 ± 13.1 g/L, respectively, which were approximately 1.3-fold higher than that of WT (150.4 ± 10.0 g/L). This study provides an effective strategy for improving the thermostability of an industrial enzyme. KEY POINTS: • Predicted potential hotspot residues directing the thermostability of LmSPase by semi-rational design • Screened two positive variants with higher thermostability and higher activity • Synthesized α-D-glucosylglycerol to a high level by two screened positive variants.	0
Title: Olefin-Directed Palladium-Catalyzed Regio- and Stereoselective Oxidative Arylation of Allenes Abstract: An olefin-directed palladium-catalyzed oxidative regio- and stereoselective arylation of allenes to afford 1,3,6-trienes has been established. A number of functionalized allenes, including 2,3- and 3,4-dienoates and 3,4-dienol derivatives, have been investigated and found to undergo the olefin-directed allene arylation. The olefin moiety has been proven to be a crucial element for the arylating transformation.	0
Title: Nonribosomal peptide synthetase with a unique iterative-alternative-optional mechanism catalyzes amonabactin synthesis in Aeromonas Abstract: Based on the exploration of data generated by genome sequencing, a bioinformatics approach has been chosen to identify the biosynthetic pathway of the siderophores produced by Aeromonas species. The amonabactins, considered as a virulence factor, represent a family of four variants of catechol peptidic siderophores containing Dhb, Lys, Gly, and an aromatic residue either Trp or Phe in a D-configuration. The synthesis operon is constituted of seven genes named amoCEBFAGH and is iron-regulated. The cluster includes genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and incorporation of the Dhb monomer, and genes encoding specific nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which are responsible for the building of the peptidic moiety. The amonabactin assembly line displays a still so far not described atypical mode of synthesis that is iterative, alternative, and optional. A disruption mutant in the adenylation domain of AmoG was unable to synthesize any amonabactin and to grow in iron stress conditions while a deletion of amoH resulted in the production of only two over the four forms. The amo cluster is widespread among most of the Aeromonas species, only few species produces the enterobactin siderophore.	1
Title: Isolation, Structure Elucidation, Biosynthesis, and Synthesis of Antalid, a Secondary Metabolite from Polyangium species Abstract: The isolation, structure elucidation, and synthesis of antalid (1), a novel secondary metabolite from Polyangium sp., is described herein. The structure elucidation of 1 was performed with the aid of mass spectrometry, high field NMR experiments, and crystal structure analysis. The absolute configuration of antalid was confirmed through the Mosher ester method and ultimately by total synthesis. In addition, the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: Skyllamycins D and E, Non-Ribosomal Cyclic Depsipeptides from Lichen-Sourced Streptomyces anulatus Abstract: The skyllamycins are a class of heavily modified, non-ribosomal peptides, first isolated from Streptomyces sp. KY11784. A Streptomyces strain with potent antibiotic activity against Bacillus subtilis was isolated from a sample of the New Zealand lichen Pseudocyphellaria dissimilis. Whole genome sequencing and biosynthetic gene cluster genetic analysis coupled with GNPS LCMS/MS molecular networking revealed that this strain had the capacity to produce skyllamycins, including previously undescribed congeners, and that these were likely the source of the observed biological activity. Guided by the results of the molecular networking, we isolated the previously reported skyllamycins A-C (1-3), along with two new congeners, skyllamycins D (4) and E (5). The structures of these compounds were elucidated using comprehensive 1D and 2D NMR analyses, along with HRESIMS fragmentation experiments. Antibacterial assays revealed that skyllamycin D possessed improved activity against B. subtilis E168 compared to previously reported congeners.	1
Title: Discovery of the 2,4'-Dihydroxy-3'-methoxypropiophenone Biosynthesis Genes in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae has 27 putative iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, but the secondary metabolites produced by them are mostly unknown. Here, we focused on eight clusters that were reported to be expressed at relatively high levels in a transcriptome analysis. By comparing metabolites between an octuple-deletion mutant of these eight PKS gene clusters and its parent strain, we found that A. oryzae produced 2,4'-dihydroxy-3'-methoxypropiophenone (1) and its precursor, 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxypropiophenone (3) in a specific liquid medium. Furthermore, an iterative type I PKS (PpsB) encoded by AO090102000166 and an acetyl-CoA ligase (PpsA) encoded downstream from ppsB were shown to be essential for their biosynthesis. PpsC, encoded upstream from ppsB, was shown to have 3-binding activity (Kd =26.0±6.2 μM) and is suggested to be involved in the conversion of 3 to 1. This study deepens our understanding of cryptic secondary metabolism in A. oryzae.	1
Title: Structural basis of head to head polyketide fusion by CorB Abstract: Corallopyronin A is a polyketide derived from the myxobacterium Corallococcus coralloides with potent antibiotic features. The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of corallopyronin A has been described recently, and it was proposed that CorB acts as a ketosynthase to interconnect two polyketide chains in a rare head-to-head condensation reaction. We determined the structure of CorB, the interconnecting polyketide synthase, to high resolution and found that CorB displays a thiolase fold. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the catalytic triad consisting of a cysteine, a histidine and an asparagine is crucial for catalysis, and that this triad shares similarities with the triad found in HMG-CoA synthases. We synthesized a substrate mimic to derivatize purified CorB and confirmed substrate attachment by ESI-MS. Structural analysis of the complex yielded an electron density-based model for the polyketide chain and showed that the unusually wide, T-shaped active site is able to accommodate two polyketides simultaneously. Our structural analysis provides a platform for understanding the unusual head-to-head polyketide-interconnecting reaction catalyzed by CorB.	0
Title: In situ transformation of TON silica zeolite into the less dense ITW: structure-direction overcoming framework instability in the synthesis of SiO2 zeolites Abstract: Under specific synthesis conditions the crystallization of a dense silica zeolite (TON) is followed by its in situ transformation into a less dense and, in the absence of occluded species, less stable zeolite (ITW). Periodic ab initio calculations including energy corrections for van der Waals interactions as well as zero-point and thermal effects are used first to assess the relative stability of both SiO(2) (calcined) phases and then to investigate host-guest interactions in the as-made zeolites, as well as their relative stability. The less dense SiO(2)-ITW is less stable than SiO(2)-TON, with an energy difference that is significantly larger than expected from their difference in molar volume. This extra destabilization is ascribed to the strained double 4-ring units of silica tetrahedra (D4R). Regarding the as-made materials, the organic cation fills in more efficiently the zeolitic voids in ITW than in TON, bringing about a larger stabilization in the former owing to the extension of the long-range addition of dispersion force contributions. On the other hand, fluoride induces a polarization of the silica framework that is highly localized in TON (showing pentacoordinated [SiO(4/2)F](-) units) but has a large global character in ITW (where fluoride is encapsulated into D4R units). We argue that the structure-directing role toward D4R materials that has been proposed for fluoride consists fundamentally in the ability to induce a global polarization of the silica framework that allows relaxation of the strain associated with these units. In this sense, fluoride stabilizes the otherwise strained D4R-SiO(2) frameworks making them reachable for crystallization. This work documents a case in which the structure directing agents "choose" a structure not kinetically but through stabilization.	0
Title: Decoding cyclase-dependent assembly of hapalindole and fischerindole alkaloids Abstract: The formation of C-C bonds in an enantioselective fashion to create complex polycyclic scaffolds in the hapalindole- and fischerindole- type alkaloids from Stigonematales cyanobacteria represents a compelling and urgent challenge in adapting microbial biosynthesis as a catalytic platform in drug development. Here we determine the biochemical basis for tri- and tetracyclic core formation in these secondary metabolites, involving a new class of cyclases that catalyze a complex cyclization cascade.	1
Title: 6-Thioguanine and S⁶-methylthioguanine are mutagenic in human cells Abstract: Thiopurines are effective immunosuppressants and anticancer agents. However, the long-term use of thiopurines was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of various types of cancer. To date, the specific mechanism(s) underlying the carcinogenicity associated with thiopurine treatment remain(s) unclear. Herein, we constructed duplex pTGFP-Hha10 shuttle vectors carrying a 6-thioguanine ((S)G) or S⁶-methylthioguanine (S⁶mG) at a unique site and allowed the vectors to propagate in three different human cell lines. Analysis of the replication products revealed that although neither thionucleoside blocked considerably DNA replication in any of the human cell lines, both (S)G and S⁶mG were mutagenic, resulting in G→A mutation at frequencies of ~8% and ~39%, respectively. Consistent with what was found from our previous study in E. coli cells, our data demonstrated that the mutagenic properties of (S)G and S⁶mG provided significant evidence for mutation induction as a potential carcinogenic mechanism associated with chronic thiopurine intervention.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of polyoxypeptin A, a potent apoptosis inducer Abstract: Background:                       Polyoxypeptin A was isolated from a culture broth of Streptomyces sp. MK498-98 F14, which has a potent apoptosis-inducing activity towards human pancreatic carcinoma AsPC-1 cells. Structurally, polyoxypeptin A is composed of a C₁₅ acyl side chain and a nineteen-membered cyclodepsipeptide core that consists of six unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid residues (N-hydroxyvaline, 3-hydroxy-3-methylproline, 5-hydroxypiperazic acid, N-hydroxyalanine, piperazic acid, and 3-hydroxyleucine) at high oxidation states.                  Results:                       A gene cluster containing 37 open reading frames (ORFs) has been sequenced and analyzed for the biosynthesis of polyoxypeptin A. We constructed 12 specific gene inactivation mutants, most of which abolished the production of polyoxypeptin A and only ΔplyM mutant accumulated a dehydroxylated analogue polyoxypeptin B. Based on bioinformatics analysis and genetic data, we proposed the biosynthetic pathway of polyoxypeptin A and biosynthetic models of six unusual amino acid building blocks and a PKS extender unit.                  Conclusions:                       The identified gene cluster and proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of polyoxypeptin A will pave a way to understand the biosynthetic mechanism of the azinothricin family natural products and provide opportunities to apply combinatorial biosynthesis strategy to create more useful compounds.	1
Title: Biphenyl-derived phosphepines as chiral nucleophilic catalysts: enantioselective [4+1] annulations to form functionalized cyclopentenes Abstract: Because of the frequent occurrence of cyclopentane subunits in bioactive compounds, the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their synthesis is an important objective. Introduced herein is a new family of chiral nucleophilic catalysts, biphenyl-derived phosphepines, and we apply them to an enantioselective variant of a useful [4+1] annulation. A range of one-carbon coupling partners can be employed, thereby generating cyclopentenes which bear a fully substituted stereocenter [either all-carbon or heteroatom-substituted (sulfur and phosphorus)]. Stereocenters at the other four positions of the cyclopentane ring can also be introduced with good stereoselectivity. An initial mechanistic study indicates that phosphine addition to the electrophilic four-carbon coupling partner is not the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle.	0
Title: Development of putative probiotics as feed additives: validation in a porcine-specific gastrointestinal tract model Abstract: Enforced restrictions on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters (AGPs) in animal production have prompted investigations into alternative feed additives in recent decades. Probiotics are currently the main feed additive used in livestock. However, the selection of probiotic candidates relies on human-based methods and little is known about the verification criteria for host-specific selection. We investigated the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus salivarius strains isolated from fed pig feces for their use as porcine feed additives. Two methods were developed that simulated the pig gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the intestinal epithelium, and these were compared with human-based in vitro methods and used for selecting porcine probiotics. Lactobacillus salivarius strain LS6 was identified as a promising probiotic strain for potential use as a porcine feed additive. This strain prevented disruption of the epithelial integrity of pig small intestine (PSI) cells by inhibiting the adherence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88. It also showed high survival rates in the in vitro pig GI tract model and good adhesion to PSI cells. We propose that host target-specific screening and validation methods are important tools in the development of effective probiotic feed additives, and this approach may support future-oriented agriculture.	0
Title: Characteristics of an anaerobic, syntrophic, butyrate-degrading bacterium in paddy field soil Abstract: The number of syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacteria in a flooded paddy field soil was 1.7 x 10(3) MPN/g dry soil. Butyrate was degraded to acetate and methane when paddy soils were incubated anaerobically with the addition of butyrate. However, butyrate degradation was completely suppressed by the addition of the specific inhibitor of methanogenesis, 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) to the soil. A hydrogen-using methanogen, strain TM-8, was isolated from flooded paddy field soil. Strain TM-8 was identified as Methanobacterium formicicum based on its physiology and phylogeny. Syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacteria were enumerated and isolated using strain TM-8. A syntrophic butyrate-degrading bacterium, strain TB-6, was isolated in coculture with strain TM-8 from paddy soil. The strain was Gram-negative, had curved rods, and grew on crotonate. Sulfate was not used as an electron acceptor. Strain TB-6 was closely related to S. wolfei subsp. wolfei. The relation between strain TB-6 and the members of Syntrophomonas are discussed.	0
Title: In Vitro Biosynthesis of the Nonproteinogenic Amino Acid Methoxyvinylglycine Abstract: Oxyvinylglycines are a family of nonproteinogenic amino acids featuring an essential vinyl ether conferring mechanism-based inhibition of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. The gene clusters for a few oxyvinylglycines are known, yet the biosynthetic origin of the vinyl ether is elusive. The in vitro biosynthesis of methoxyvinylglycine or l-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB) is reported. It is shown that AMB is made from glutamate as an alanyl-AMB dipeptide and the rationale is provided for the N-term Ala. Using a chemical capture method, the order and timing of the modifications on non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-bound substrates was determined, including a cryptic hydroxylation of the Glu β-carbon. Eliminating this hydroxy group likely generates a key α,β-dehydroamino acid intermediate that facilitates decarboxylation. This work sheds light on vinyl ether biosynthesis and uncovers new NRPS chemistry.	1
Title: Lactic acid bacteria--20 years exploring their potential as live vectors for mucosal vaccination Abstract: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a diverse group of Gram-positive, nonsporulating, low G + C content bacteria. Many of them have been given generally regarded as safe status. Over the past two decades, intensive genetic and molecular research carried out on LAB, mainly Lactococcus lactis and some species of the Lactobacillus genus, has revealed new, potential biomedical LAB applications, including the use of LAB as adjuvants, immunostimulators, or therapeutic drug delivery systems, or as factories to produce therapeutic molecules. LAB enable immunization via the mucosal route, which increases effectiveness against pathogens that use the mucosa as the major route of entry into the human body. In this review, we concentrate on the encouraging application of Lactococcus and Lactobacillus genera for the development of live mucosal vaccines. First, we present the progress that has recently been made in the field of developing tools for LAB genetic manipulations, which has resulted in the successful expression of many bacterial, parasitic, and viral antigens in LAB strains. Next, we discuss the factors influencing the efficacy of the constructed vaccine prototypes that have been tested in various animal models. Apart from the research focused on an application of live LABs as carriers of foreign antigens, a lot of work has been recently done on the potential usage of nonliving, nonrecombinant L. lactis designated as Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM), as a delivery system for mucosal vaccination. The advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are also presented.	0
Title: Functional Analysis of Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Enterocin NKR-5-3B, a Novel Circular Bacteriocin Abstract: A putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the enterocin NKR-5-3B (Ent53B), a novel circular bacteriocin, was analyzed by sequencing the flanking regions around enkB, the Ent53B structural gene, using a fosmid library. A region approximately 9 kb in length was obtained, and the enkB1, enkB2, enkB3, and enkB4 genes, encoding putative biosynthetic proteins involved in the production, maturation, and secretion of Ent53B, were identified. We also determined the identity of proteins mediating self-immunity against the effects of Ent53B. Heterologous expression systems in various heterologous hosts, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis strains, were successfully established. The production and secretion of the mature Ent53B required the cooperative functions of five genes. Ent53B was produced only by those heterologous hosts that expressed protein products of the enkB, enkB1, enkB2, enkB3, and enkB4 genes. Moreover, self-immunity against the antimicrobial action of Ent53B was conferred by at least two independent mechanisms. Heterologous hosts harboring the intact enkB4 gene and/or a combination of intact enkB1 and enkB3 genes were immune to the inhibitory action of Ent53B.                  Importance:                       In addition to their potential application as food preservatives, circular bacteriocins are now considered possible alternatives to therapeutic antibiotics due to the exceptional stability conferred by their circular structure. The successful practical application of circular bacteriocins will become possible only if the molecular details of their biosynthesis are fully understood. The results of the present study offer a new perspective on the possible mechanism of circular bacteriocin biosynthesis. In addition, since some enterococcal strains are associated with pathogenicity, virulence, and drug resistance, the establishment of the first multigenus host heterologous production of Ent53B has very high practical significance, as it widens the scope of possible Ent53B applications.	1
Title: Near-real-time analysis of the phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli to 1-butanol exposure using Raman Spectroscopy Abstract: Raman spectroscopy was used to study the time course of phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli (DH5α) to 1-butanol exposure (1.2% [vol/vol]). Raman spectroscopy is of interest for bacterial phenotyping because it can be performed (i) in near real time, (ii) with minimal sample preparation (label-free), and (iii) with minimal spectral interference from water. Traditional off-line analytical methodologies were applied to both 1-butanol-treated and control cells to draw correlations with Raman data. Here, distinct sets of Raman bands are presented that characterize phenotypic traits of E. coli with maximized correlation to off-line measurements. In addition, the observed time course phenotypic responses of E. coli to 1.2% (vol/vol) 1-butanol exposure included the following: (i) decreased saturated fatty acids levels, (ii) retention of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cyclopropane fatty acids, (iii) increased membrane fluidity following the initial response of increased rigidity, and (iv) no changes in total protein content or protein-derived amino acid composition. For most phenotypic traits, correlation coefficients between Raman spectroscopy and traditional off-line analytical approaches exceeded 0.75, and major trends were captured. The results suggest that near-real-time Raman spectroscopy is suitable for approximating metabolic and physiological phenotyping of bacterial cells subjected to toxic environmental conditions.	0
Title: Structural organization, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of the Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ gene Abstract: The Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ protein plays a central role in DNA metabolism, participating in general homologous recombination, recombinational (postreplication) DNA repair, and prophage induction. Although many H. influenzae rec-1 mutants have been phenotypically characterized, little is known about the rec-1+ gene at the molecular level. In this study, we present the genetic organization of the rec-1+ locus, the DNA sequence of rec-1+, and studies of the transcriptional regulation of rec-1+ during cellular assault by DNA-damaging agents and during the induction of competence for genetic transformation. Although little is known about promoter structure in H. influenzae, we identified a potential rec-1+ promoter that is identical in 11 of 12 positions to the bacterial sigma 70-dependent promoter consensus sequence. Results from a primer extension analysis revealed that the start site of rec-1+ transcription is centered 6 nucleotides downstream of this promoter. We identified potential DNA binding sites in the rec-1+ gene for LexA, integration host factor, and cyclic AMP receptor protein. We obtained evidence that at least one of the proposed cyclic AMP receptor protein binding sites is active in modulating rec-1+ transcription. This finding makes rec-1+ control circuitry novel among recA+ homologs. Two H. influenzae DNA uptake sequences that may function as a transcription termination signal were identified in inverted orientations at the end of the rec-1+ coding sequence. In addition, we report the first use of the Escherichia coli lacZ operon fusion technique in H. influenzae to study the transcriptional control of rec-1+. Our results indicate that rec-1+ is transcriptionally induced about threefold during DNA-damaging events. Furthermore, we show that rec-1+ can substitute for recA+ in E. coli to modulate SOS induction of dinB1 expression. Surprisingly, although 5% of the H. influenzae genome is in the form of single-stranded DNA during competence for genetic transformation, an event that could be a potent SOS-inducing signal, we failed to detect significant changes in rec-1+ transcription during the induction of genetic competence.	0
Title: Functional characterization of Crp/Fnr-type global transcriptional regulators in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough Abstract: Crp/Fnr-type global transcriptional regulators regulate various metabolic pathways in bacteria and typically function in response to environmental changes. However, little is known about the function of four annotated Crp/Fnr homologs (DVU0379, DVU2097, DVU2547, and DVU3111) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. A systematic study using bioinformatic, transcriptomic, genetic, and physiological approaches was conducted to characterize their roles in stress responses. Similar growth phenotypes were observed for the crp/fnr deletion mutants under multiple stress conditions. Nevertheless, the idea of distinct functions of Crp/Fnr-type regulators in stress responses was supported by phylogeny, gene transcription changes, fitness changes, and physiological differences. The four D. vulgaris Crp/Fnr homologs are localized in three subfamilies (HcpR, CooA, and cc). The crp/fnr knockout mutants were well separated by transcriptional profiling using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and more genes significantly changed in expression in a ΔDVU3111 mutant (JW9013) than in the other three paralogs. In fitness studies, strain JW9013 showed the lowest fitness under standard growth conditions (i.e., sulfate reduction) and the highest fitness under NaCl or chromate stress conditions; better fitness was observed for a ΔDVU2547 mutant (JW9011) under nitrite stress conditions and a ΔDVU2097 mutant (JW9009) under air stress conditions. A higher Cr(VI) reduction rate was observed for strain JW9013 in experiments with washed cells. These results suggested that the four Crp/Fnr-type global regulators play distinct roles in stress responses of D. vulgaris. DVU3111 is implicated in responses to NaCl and chromate stresses, DVU2547 in nitrite stress responses, and DVU2097 in air stress responses.	0
Title: Chiral gold nanowires with Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal structure Abstract: A Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal (BCB) helix is made of linearly stacked regular tetrahedra (tetrahelix). As such, it is chiral without nontrivial translational or rotational symmetries. We demonstrate here an example of the chiral BCB structure made of totally symmetrical gold atoms, created in nanowires by direct chemical synthesis. Detailed study by high-resolution electron microscopy illustrates their elegant chiral structure and the unique one-dimensional "pseudo-periodicity". The BCB-type atomic packing mode is proposed to be a result of the competition and compromise between the lattice and surface energy.	0
Title: Rational programming of history-dependent logic in cellular populations Abstract: Genetic programs operating in a history-dependent fashion are ubiquitous in nature and govern sophisticated processes such as development and differentiation. The ability to systematically and predictably encode such programs would advance the engineering of synthetic organisms and ecosystems with rich signal processing abilities. Here we implement robust, scalable history-dependent programs by distributing the computational labor across a cellular population. Our design is based on standardized recombinase-driven DNA scaffolds expressing different genes according to the order of occurrence of inputs. These multicellular computing systems are highly modular, do not require cell-cell communication channels, and any program can be built by differential composition of strains containing well-characterized logic scaffolds. We developed automated workflows that researchers can use to streamline program design and optimization. We anticipate that the history-dependent programs presented here will support many applications using cellular populations for material engineering, biomanufacturing and healthcare.	0
Title: Recruitment of a foreign quinone into the A(1) site of photosystem I. II. Structural and functional characterization of phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway mutants by electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance studies of the photosystem (PS) I quinone acceptor, A(1), in phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway mutants are described. Room temperature continuous wave EPR measurements at X-band of whole cells of menA and menB interruption mutants show a transient reduction and oxidation of an organic radical with a g-value and anisotropy characteristic of a quinone. In PS I complexes, the continuous wave EPR spectrum of the photoaccumulated Q(-) radical, measured at Q-band, and the electron spin-polarized transient EPR spectra of the radical pair P700(+) Q(-), measured at X-, Q-, and W-bands, show three prominent features: (i) Q(-) has a larger g-anisotropy than native phylloquinone, (ii) Q(-) does not display the prominent methyl hyperfine couplings attributed to the 2-methyl group of phylloquinone, and (iii) the orientation of Q(-) in the A(1) site as derived from the spin polarization is that of native phylloquinone in the wild type. Electron spin echo modulation experiments on P700(+) Q(-) show that the dipolar coupling in the radical pair is the same as in native PS I, i.e. the distance between P700(+) and Q(-) (25.3 +/- 0.3 A) is the same as between P700(+) and A(1)(-) in the wild type. Pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance studies show two sets of resolved spectral features with nearly axially symmetric hyperfine couplings. They are tentatively assigned to the two methyl groups of the recruited plastoquinone-9, and their difference indicates a strong inequivalence among the two groups when in the A(1) site. These results show that Q (i) functions in accepting an electron from A(0)(-) and in passing the electron forward to the iron-sulfur clusters, (ii) occupies the A(1) site with an orientation similar to that of phylloquinone in the wild type, and (iii) has spectroscopic properties consistent with its identity as plastoquinone-9.	0
Title: Characterization of the two-component monooxygenase system AlnT/AlnH reveals early timing of quinone formation in alnumycin biosynthesis Abstract: Alnumycin A is an aromatic polyketide with a strong resemblance to related benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) antibiotics, such as the model antibiotic actinorhodin. One intriguing difference between these metabolites is that the positions of the benzene and quinone rings are reversed in alnumycin A in comparison to the BIQ polyketides. In this paper we demonstrate that inactivation of either the monooxygenase alnT gene or the flavin reductase alnH gene results in the accumulation of a novel nonquinoid metabolite, thalnumycin A (ThA), in the culture medium. Additionally, two other previously characterized metabolites, K1115 A and 1,6-dihydroxy-8-propylanthraquinone (DHPA), were identified, which had oxidized into quinones putatively nonenzymatically at the incorrect position in the central ring. None of the compounds isolated contained correctly formed pyran rings, which suggests that on the alnumycin pathway quinone biosynthesis occurs prior to third ring cyclization. The regiochemistry of the two-component monooxygenase system AlnT/AlnH was finally confirmed in vitro by using ThA, FMN, and NADH in enzymatic synthesis, where the reaction product, thalnumycin B (ThB), was verified to contain the expected p-hydroquinone structure in the lateral ring.	1
Title: Molecular and chemical characterization of the biosynthesis of the 6-MSA-derived meroterpenoid yanuthone D in Aspergillus niger Abstract: Secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi constitute a rich source of bioactive molecules. We have deduced the genetic and biosynthetic pathway of the antibiotic yanuthone D from Aspergillus niger. Our analyses show that yanuthone D is a meroterpenoid derived from the polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA). Yanuthone D formation depends on a cluster composed of ten genes including yanA and yanI, which encode a 6-MSA polyketide synthase and a previously undescribed O-mevalon transferase, respectively. In addition, several branching points in the pathway were discovered, revealing five yanuthones (F, G, H, I, and J). Furthermore, we have identified another compound (yanuthone X1) that defines a class of yanuthones that depend on several enzymatic activities encoded by genes in the yan cluster but that are not derived from 6-MSA.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. DSM 4137 for the novel neuroprotectant polyketide meridamycin Abstract: Meridamycin is a non-immunosuppressant, FKBP-binding macrocyclic polyketide, which has major potential as a neuroprotectant in a range of neurodegenerative disorders including dementia, Parkinson's disease and ischaemic stroke. A biosynthetic cluster predicted to encode biosynthesis of meridamycin was cloned from the prolific secondary-metabolite-producing strain Streptomyces sp. DSM 4137, not previously known to produce this compound, and specific gene deletion was used to confirm the role of this cluster in the biosynthesis of meridamycin. The meridamycin modular polyketide synthase consists of 14 extension modules distributed between three giant multienzyme proteins. The terminal module is flanked by a highly unusual cytochrome P450-like domain. The characterization of the meridamycin biosynthetic locus in this readily manipulated streptomycete species opens the way to the engineering of new, altered meridamycins of potential therapeutic importance.	1
Title: Swainsonine Biosynthesis Genes in Diverse Symbiotic and Pathogenic Fungi Abstract: Swainsonine-a cytotoxic fungal alkaloid and a potential cancer therapy drug-is produced by the insect pathogen and plant symbiont Metarhizium robertsii, the clover pathogen Slafractonia leguminicola, locoweed symbionts belonging to Alternaria sect. Undifilum, and a recently discovered morning glory symbiont belonging to order Chaetothyriales. Genome sequence analyses revealed that these fungi share orthologous gene clusters, designated "SWN," which included a multifunctional swnK gene comprising predicted adenylylation and acyltransferase domains with their associated thiolation domains, a β-ketoacyl synthase domain, and two reductase domains. The role of swnK was demonstrated by inactivating it in M. robertsii through homologous gene replacement to give a ∆swnK mutant that produced no detectable swainsonine, then complementing the mutant with the wild-type gene to restore swainsonine biosynthesis. Other SWN cluster genes were predicted to encode two putative hydroxylases and two reductases, as expected to complete biosynthesis of swainsonine from the predicted SwnK product. SWN gene clusters were identified in six out of seven sequenced genomes of Metarhzium species, and in all 15 sequenced genomes of Arthrodermataceae, a family of fungi that cause athlete's foot and ringworm diseases in humans and other mammals. Representative isolates of all of these species were cultured, and all Metarhizium spp. with SWN clusters, as well as all but one of the Arthrodermataceae, produced swainsonine. These results suggest a new biosynthetic hypothesis for this alkaloid, extending the known taxonomic breadth of swainsonine producers to at least four orders of Ascomycota, and suggest that swainsonine has roles in mutualistic symbioses and diseases of plants and animals.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of xenoamicins from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus Abstract: During the search for novel natural products from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus doucetiae DSM17909 and X. mauleonii DSM17908 novel peptides named xenoamicins were identified in addition to the already known antibiotics xenocoumacin and xenorhabdin. Xenoamicins are acylated tridecadepsipeptides consisting of mainly hydrophobic amino acids. The main derivative xenoamicin A (1) was isolated from X. mauleonii DSM17908, and its structure elucidated by detailed 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Detailed MS experiments, also in combination with labeling experiments, confirmed the determined structure and allowed structure elucidation of additional derivatives. Moreover, the xenoamicin biosynthesis gene cluster was identified and analyzed in X. doucetiae DSM17909, and its participation in xenoamicin biosynthesis was confirmed by mutagenesis. Advanced Marfey's analysis of 1 showed that the absolute configuration of the amino acids is in agreement with the predicted stereochemistry deduced from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase XabABCD. Biological testing revealed activity of 1 against Plasmodium falciparum and other neglected tropical diseases but no antibacterial activity.	1
Title: Draft genome sequence of an efficient antibiotic-producing industrial strain of Saccharomonospora azurea, SZMC 14600 Abstract: Although certain rare actinomycetes have been recognized as prolific sources of bioactive natural products, their potential for producing biologically active metabolites still remains unexplored. With the aim of gaining global insights into the genetic background and the metabolic capability of Saccharomonospora azurea SZMC 14600, whole-genome sequencing was performed.	1
Title: The Biosynthesis of Norsesquiterpene Aculenes Requires Three Cytochrome P450 Enzymes to Catalyze a Stepwise Demethylation Process Abstract: Aculenes are a unique class of norsequiterpenes (C14 ) that are produced by Aspergillus aculeatus. The nordaucane skeleton in aculenes A-D may be derived from an ent-daucane precursor through demethylation, however, the enzymes involved remain unexplored. We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster and characterized the biosynthetic pathway based on gene inactivation, feeding experiments, and heterologous reconstitution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae. We discovered that three cytochrome P450 monoxygenases are required to catalyze the stepwise demethylation process. AneF converts the 12-methyl group into a carboxylic acid and AneD installs the 10-hydroxy group for later tautomerization and stabilization. Finally, AneG installs an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group at the C-2 position, which triggers C-12 decarboxylation to yield the nordaucane skeleton. Additionally, a terpene cyclase (AneC) was found that forms a new product (dauca-4,7-diene).	1
Title: Novel nonadride, heptadride and maleic acid metabolites from the byssochlamic acid producer Byssochlamys fulva IMI 40021 - an insight into the biosynthesis of maleidrides Abstract: The filamentous fungus Byssochlamys fulva strain IMI 40021 produces (+)-byssochlamic acid 1, its novel dihydroanalogue 2 and four related secondary metabolites. Agnestadrides A, 17 and B, 18 constitute a novel class of seven-membered ring, maleic anhydride-containing (hence termed heptadride) natural products. The putative maleic anhydride precursor 5 for both nonadride and heptadride biosynthesis was isolated as a fermentation product for the first time and its structure confirmed by synthesis. Acid 5 undergoes facile decarboxylation to anhydride 6. The generic term maleidrides is proposed to encompass biosynthetically-related compounds containing maleic anhydride moieties fused to an alicyclic ring, varying in size and substituents.	1
Title: Widespread Sterol Methyltransferase Participates in the Biosynthesis of Both C4α- and C4β-Methyl Sterols Abstract: The 4-methyl steranes serve as molecular fossils and are used for studying both eukaryotic evolution and geological history. The occurrence of 4α-methyl steranes in sediments has long been considered evidence of products of partial demethylation mediated by sterol methyl oxidases (SMOs), while 4β-methyl steranes are attributed entirely to diagenetic generation from 4α-methyl steroids since possible biological sources of their precursor 4β-methyl sterols are unknown. Here, we report a previously unknown C4-methyl sterol biosynthetic pathway involving a sterol methyltransferase rather than the SMOs. We show that both C4α- and C4β-methyl sterols are end products of the sterol biosynthetic pathway in an endosymbiont of reef corals, Breviolum minutum, while this mechanism exists not only in dinoflagellates but also in eukaryotes from alveolates, haptophytes, and aschelminthes. Our discovery provides a previously untapped route for the generation of C4-methyl steranes and overturns the paradigm that all 4β-methyl steranes are diagenetically generated from the 4α isomers. This may facilitate the interpretation of molecular fossils and understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life in general.	0
Title: Cyclic-di-AMP synthesis by the diadenylate cyclase CdaA is modulated by the peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzyme GlmM in Lactococcus lactis Abstract: The second messenger cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) plays important roles in growth, virulence, cell wall homeostasis, potassium transport and affects resistance to antibiotics, heat and osmotic stress. Most Firmicutes contain only one c-di-AMP synthesizing diadenylate cyclase (CdaA); however, little is known about signals and effectors controlling CdaA activity and c-di-AMP levels. In this study, a genetic screen was employed to identify components which affect the c-di-AMP level in Lactococcus. We characterized suppressor mutations that restored osmoresistance to spontaneous c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase gdpP mutants, which contain high c-di-AMP levels. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations were identified in the cdaA and gdpP genes, respectively, which led to lower c-di-AMP levels. A mutation was also identified in the phosphoglucosamine mutase gene glmM, which is commonly located within the cdaA operon in bacteria. The glmM I154F mutation resulted in a lowering of the c-di-AMP level and a reduction in the key peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in L. lactis. C-di-AMP synthesis by CdaA was shown to be inhibited by GlmM(I154F) more than GlmM and GlmM(I154F) was found to bind more strongly to CdaA than GlmM. These findings identify GlmM as a c-di-AMP level modulating protein and provide a direct connection between c-di-AMP synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.	0
Title: Aminoacyl sulfonamide assembly in SB-203208 biosynthesis Abstract: Sulfonamide is present in many important drugs, due to its unique chemical and biological properties. In contrast, naturally occurring sulfonamides are rare, and their biosynthetic knowledge are scarce. Here we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of sulfonamide antibiotics, altemicidin, SB-203207, and SB-203208, from Streptomyces sp. NCIMB40513. The heterologous gene expression and biochemical analyses reveal unique aminoacyl transfer reactions, including the tRNA synthetase-like enzyme SbzA-catalyzed L-isoleucine transfer and the GNAT enzyme SbzC-catalyzed β-methylphenylalanine transfer. Furthermore, we elucidate the biogenesis of 2-sulfamoylacetic acid from L-cysteine, by the collaboration of the cupin dioxygenase SbzM and the aldehyde dehydrogenase SbzJ. Remarkably, SbzM catalyzes the two-step oxidation and decarboxylation of L-cysteine, and the subsequent intramolecular amino group rearrangement leads to N-S bond formation. This detailed analysis of the aminoacyl sulfonamide antibiotics biosynthetic machineries paves the way toward investigations of sulfonamide biosynthesis and its engineering.	1
Title: Colonization of medical devices by staphylococci Abstract: The use of medical devices in modern medicine is constantly increasing. Despite the multiple precautionary strategies that are being employed in hospitals, which include increased hygiene and sterilization measures, bacterial infections on these devices still happen frequently. Staphylococci are among the major causes of medical device infection. This is mostly due to the strong capacity of those bacteria to form device-associated biofilms, which provide resistance to chemical and physical treatments as well as attacks by the host's immune system. Biofilm development is a multistep process with specific factors participating in each step. It is tightly regulated to provide a balance between biofilm expansion and detachment. Detachment from a biofilm on a medical device can lead to severe systemic infection, such as bacteremia and sepsis. While our understanding of staphylococcal biofilm formation has increased significantly and staphylococcal biofilm formation on medical devices is among the best understood biofilm-associated infections, the extensive effort put in preclinical studies with the goal to find novel therapies against staphylococcal device-associated infections has not yet resulted in efficient, applicable therapeutic options for that difficult-to-treat type of disease.	0
Title: Molecular study on the carAB operon reveals that carB gene is required for swimming and biofilm formation in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri Abstract: Background:                       The carA and carB genes code the small and large subunits of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPS) that responsible for arginine and pyrimidine production. The purpose of this work was to study the gene organization and expression pattern of carAB operon, and the biological functions of carA and carB genes in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri.                  Methods:                       RT-PCR method was employed to identify the full length of carAB operon transcript in X. citri subsp. citri. The promoter of carAB operon was predicted and analyzed its activity by fusing a GUS reporter gene. The swimming motility was tested on 0.25% agar NY plates with 1% glucose. Biofilm was measured by cell adhesion to polyvinyl chloride 96-well plate.                  Results:                       The results indicated that carAB operon was composed of five gene members carA-orf-carB-greA-rpfE. A single promoter was predicted from the nucleotide sequence upstream of carAB operon, and its sensitivity to glutamic acid, uracil and arginine was confirmed by fusing a GUS reporter gene. Deletion mutagenesis of carB gene resulted in reduced abilities in swimming on soft solid media and in forming biofilm on polystyrene microtiter plates.                  Conclusions:                       From these results, we concluded that carAB operon was involved in multiple biological processes in X. citri subsp. citri.	0
Title: Illuminating the diversity of aromatic polyketide synthases in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the ability to synthesize many more natural products (NPs) than are currently known, but methods for obtaining suitable expression of NPs have been inadequate. We have developed a successful strategy that bypasses normal regulatory mechanisms. By efficient gene targeting, we have replaced, en masse, the promoters of nonreducing polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) genes, key genes in NP biosynthetic pathways, and other genes necessary for NR-PKS product formation or release. This has allowed us to determine the products of eight NR-PKSs of Aspergillus nidulans, including seven novel compounds, as well as the NR-PKS genes required for the synthesis of the toxins alternariol (8) and cichorine (19).	1
Title: Patulin is a cultivar-dependent aggressiveness factor favouring the colonization of apples by Penicillium expansum Abstract: The blue mould decay of apples is caused by Penicillium expansum and is associated with contamination by patulin, a worldwide regulated mycotoxin. Recently, a cluster of 15 genes (patA-patO) involved in patulin biosynthesis was identified in P. expansum. blast analysis revealed that patL encodes a Cys6 zinc finger regulatory factor. The deletion of patL caused a drastic decrease in the expression of all pat genes, leading to an absence of patulin production. Pathogenicity studies performed on 13 apple varieties indicated that the PeΔpatL strain could still infect apples, but the intensity of symptoms was weaker compared with the wild-type strain. A lower growth rate was observed in the PeΔpatL strain when this strain was grown on nine of the 13 apple varieties tested. In the complemented PeΔpatL:patL strain, the ability to grow normally in apple and the production of patulin were restored. Our results clearly demonstrate that patulin is not indispensable in the initiation of the disease, but acts as a cultivar-dependent aggressiveness factor for P. expansum. This conclusion was strengthened by the fact that the addition of patulin to apple infected by the PeΔpatL mutant restored the normal fungal colonization in apple.	1
Title: Cervimycin C resistance in Bacillus subtilis is due to a promoter up-mutation and increased mRNA stability of the constitutive ABC-transporter gene bmrA Abstract: Two independent cervimycin C (CmC)-resistant clones of Bacillus subtilis were identified, each carrying two mutations in the intergenic region preceding the ABC transporter gene bmrA. In the double mutant, real-time PCR revealed an increased amount of bmrA mRNA with increased stability. Accordingly, isolation of membrane proteins yielded a strong band at 64 kDa corresponding to BmrA. Analyses showed that one mutation optimized the -35 box sequence conferring resistance to 3 μM CmC, while the +6 mutation alone had no effect, but increased the potential of the strain harboring the -35 mutation to grow at 5 μM CmC. Transcriptional fusions revealed an elevated bmrA promoter activity for the double mutant. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed a 30-fold higher binding affinity of RNA polymerase for this mutant compared with the wild type, and the effect was due to the -35 box alteration of the bmrA promoter. In vitro transcription experiments substantiated the results of the EMSA. EMSAs in the presence of heparin indicated that the mutations did not influence the formation and/or the stability of open complexes. Half-life measurements demonstrated that the +6 mutation stabilized bmrA mRNA ≈ 2-fold. Overall, we found that an ABC transporter confers antibiotic resistance by the cumulative effects of two mutations in the promoter region.	1
Title: Melatonin Improves the Photosynthetic Carbon Assimilation and Antioxidant Capacity in Wheat Exposed to Nano-ZnO Stress Abstract: The release of nanoparticles into the environment is inevitable, which has raised global environmental concern. Melatonin is involved in various stress responses in plants. The present study investigated the effects of melatonin on photosynthetic carbon (C) assimilation and plant growth in nano-ZnO stressed plants. It was found that melatonin improved the photosynthetic C assimilation in nano-ZnO stressed wheat plants, mainly due to the enhanced photosynthetic energy transport efficiency, higher chlorophyll concentration and higher activities of Rubisco and ATPases. In addition, melatonin enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes to protect the photosynthetic electron transport system in wheat leaves against the oxidative burst caused by nano-ZnO stress. These results suggest that melatonin could improve the tolerance of wheat plants to nano-ZnO stress.	0
Title: Non-Deprotonative Primary and Secondary Amination of (Hetero)Arylmetals Abstract: Herein we disclose a novel method for the facile transfer of primary (-NH2) and secondary amino groups (-NHR) to heteroaryl- as well as arylcuprates at low temperature without the need for precious metal catalysts, ligands, excess reagents, protecting and/or directing groups. This one-pot transformation allows unprecedented functional group tolerance and it is well-suited for the amination of electron-rich, electron-deficient as well as structurally complex (hetero)arylmetals. In some of the cases, only catalytic amounts of a copper(I) salt is required.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the iturin A operon Abstract: Bacillus subtilis RB14 is a producer of the antifungal lipopeptide iturin A. Using a transposon, we identified and cloned the iturin A synthetase operon of RB14, and the sequence of this operon was also determined. The iturin A operon spans a region that is more than 38 kb long and is composed of four open reading frames, ituD, ituA, ituB, and ituC. The ituD gene encodes a putative malonyl coenzyme A transacylase, whose disruption results in a specific deficiency in iturin A production. The second gene, ituA, encodes a 449-kDa protein that has three functional modules homologous to fatty acid synthetase, amino acid transferase, and peptide synthetase. The third gene, ituB, and the fourth gene, ituC, encode 609- and 297-kDa peptide synthetases that harbor four and two amino acid modules, respectively. Mycosubtilin, which is produced by B. subtilis ATCC 6633, has almost the same structure as iturin A, but the amino acids at positions 6 and 7 in the mycosubtilin sequence are D-Ser-->L-Asn, while in iturin A these amino acids are inverted (i.e., D-Asn-->L-Ser). Comparison of the amino acid sequences encoded by the iturin A operon and the mycosubtilin operon revealed that ituD, ituA, and ituB have high levels of homology to the counterpart genes fenF (79%), mycA (79%), and mycB (79%), respectively. Although the overall level of homology of the amino acid sequences encoded by ituC and mycC, the counterpart of ituC, is relatively low (64%), which indicates that there is a difference in the amino acid sequences of the two lipopeptides, the levels of homology between the putative serine adenylation domains and between the asparagine adenylation domains in the two synthetases are high (79 and 80%, respectively), implying that there is an intragenic domain change in the synthetases. The fact that the flanking sequence of the iturin A synthetase coding region was highly homologous to the flanking sequence that of xynD of B. subtilis 168 and the fact that the promoter of the iturin A operon which we identified was also conserved in an upstream sequence of xynD imply that horizontal transfer of this operon occurred. When the promoter was replaced by the repU promoter of the plasmid pUB110 replication protein, production of iturin A increased threefold.	1
Title: Targeted therapy in the treatment of solid tumors: practice contradicts theory Abstract: The basic principle of targeted therapy formulated about ten years ago consists in the design and application of drugs specifically directed against well-defined targets that are critical for tumor survival and not compromising for normal organs and tissues. The past decade has been marked by the appearance of an immense diversity of novel antitumor agents with claimed targeted action. Unfortunately, despite indisputable progress in clinical settings, some popular drugs against solid tumors (e.g. bevacizumab, trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib) nominally assigned to targeted-action drugs, cannot actually be classified with this group being nonconforming to a priori stated goals of targeted therapy. The state-of-the-art and current problems in targeted therapy of solid tumors are reviewed.	0
Title: Biosynthetic potential-based strain prioritization for natural product discovery: a showcase for diterpenoid-producing actinomycetes Abstract: Natural products remain the best sources of drugs and drug leads and serve as outstanding small-molecule probes to dissect fundamental biological processes. A great challenge for the natural product community is to discover novel natural products efficiently and cost effectively. Here we report the development of a practical method to survey biosynthetic potential in microorganisms, thereby identifying the most promising strains and prioritizing them for natural product discovery. Central to our approach is the innovative preparation, by a two-tiered PCR method, of a pool of pathway-specific probes, thereby allowing the survey of all variants of the biosynthetic machineries for the targeted class of natural products. The utility of the method was demonstrated by surveying 100 strains, randomly selected from our actinomycete collection, for their biosynthetic potential of four classes of natural products, aromatic polyketides, reduced polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and diterpenoids, identifying 16 talented strains. One of the talented strains, Streptomyces griseus CB00830, was finally chosen to showcase the discovery of the targeted classes of natural products, resulting in the isolation of three diterpenoids, six nonribosomal peptides and related metabolites, and three polyketides. Variations of this method should be applicable to the discovery of other classes of natural products.	0
Title: Iteratively improving natamycin production in Streptomyces gilvosporeus by a large operon-reporter based strategy Abstract: Many high-value secondary metabolites are assembled by very large multifunctional polyketide synthases or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encoded by giant genes, for instance, natamycin production in an industrial strain of Streptomyces gilvosporeus. In this study, a large operon reporter-based selection system has been developed using the selectable marker gene neo to report the expression both of the large polyketide synthase genes and of the entire gene cluster, thereby facilitating the selection of natamycin-overproducing mutants by iterative random mutagenesis breeding. In three successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection, the natamycin titer was increased by 110%, 230%, and 340%, respectively, and the expression of the whole biosynthetic gene cluster was correspondingly increased. An additional copy of the natamycin gene cluster was found in one overproducer. These findings support the large operon reporter-based selection system as a useful tool for the improvement of industrial strains utilized in the production of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides.	1
Title: "FlashMap" - A Semi-Automatic Tool for Rapid and Accurate Spatial Analysis of Marker Expression in the Subventricular Zone Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a region of ongoing postnatal germinal activity that shows complex spatial heterogeneity. For instance, different SVZ microdomains contain neural stem cells that express distinct transcription factors and generate different glial and neuronal progenies. These unique characteristics call for the development of new methods to integrate a spatial dimension to histological analyses performed in this germinal region. We developed "FlashMap", a semi-automatic software that allows the segmentation and rapid measurement of optical densities throughout the full SVZ coordinates. "FlashMap" generates easily readable two-dimensional heatmaps that can be superimposed onto three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricular system for optimal spatial exploration. Accurate heatmaps can be obtained, even following serial section subsampling thereby reducing the amount of tissue and time required for histological analysis. We first illustrate the potential of "FlashMap" by spatially exploring the correlation of SVZ thickness and cellular density with germinal activity throughout its rostro-caudal coordinates. We then used "FlashMap" to analyse the spatial expression of the transcription factors Dlx2, Tbr2 and Hopx as well as of the immature neuronal marker Dcx, to demonstrate the suitability of this approach to explore the regional production of cells of distinct lineages by defined SVZ microdomains.	0
Title: Cloning a part of the ochratoxin A biosynthetic gene cluster of Penicillium nordicum and characterization of the ochratoxin polyketide synthase gene Abstract: Penicillium nordicum is a fungal species able to produce high amounts of ochratoxin A. A 10kb genomic DNA fragment of P. nordicumn has been cloned which carries three long open reading frames. One open reading frame (otapksPN) has homology to fungal polyketide synthases. The second open reading frame (npsPN) has homology to non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and the third open reading frame (aspPN) has homology to fungal alkaline serine proteinases. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and the polyketide synthase are convergently transcribed. Interestingly, the polyketide synthase can be identified by PCR only in P. nordicum strains and not in the related species Penicillium verrucosum or in ochratoxigenic Aspergillus species, indicating that the ochratoxin polyketide synthases are different in the important ochratoxigenic species. In contrast, the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase can be identified in P. nordicum and P. verrucosum, but not in other species. An inactivation of the polyketide synthase resulted in strains with abolished capacity to produce ochratoxin A. Expression of the polyketide synthase correlates with ochratoxin A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of functionally clustered nystatin-like biosynthetic genes in a rare actinomycetes, Pseudonocardia autotrophica Abstract: The polyene antibiotics, including nystatin, pimaricin, amphotericin, and candicidin, comprise a family of very valuable antifungal polyketide compounds, and they are typically produced by soil actinomycetes. Previously, using a polyene cytochrome P450 hydroxylase-specific genome screening strategy, Pseudonocardia autotrophica KCTC9441 was determined to contain genes potentially encoding polyene biosynthesis. Here, sequence information of an approximately 125.7-kb contiguous DNA region in five overlapping cosmids isolated from the P. autotrophica KCTC9441 genomic library revealed a total of 23 open reading frames, which are presumably involved in the biosynthesis of a nystatin-like compound tentatively named NPP. The deduced roles for six multi-modular polyketide synthase (PKS) catalytic domains were found to be highly homologous to those of previously identified nystatin biosynthetic genes. Low NPP productivity suggests that the functionally clustered NPP biosynthetic pathway genes are tightly regulated in P. autotrophica. Disruption of a NPP PKS gene completely abolished both NPP biosynthesis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, suggesting that polyene-specific genome screening may constitute an efficient method for isolation of potentially valuable previously identified polyene genes and compounds from various rare actinomycetes widespread in nature.	1
Title: CmlI is an N-oxygenase in the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol Abstract: The N-oxygenation of an amine group is one of the steps in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic chloramphenicol. The non-heme di-iron enzyme CmlI was identified as the enzyme catalyzing this reaction through bioinformatics studies and reconstitution of enzymatic activity. In vitro reconstitution was achieved using phenazine methosulfate and NADH as electron mediators, while in vivo activity was demonstrated in Escherichia coli using two substrates. Kinetic analysis showed a biphasic behavior of the enzyme. Oxidized hydroxylamine and nitroso compounds in the reaction were detected both in vitro and in vivo based on LC-MS. The active site metal was confirmed to be iron based on a ferrozine assay. These findings provide new insights into the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol and could lead to further development of CmlI as a useful biocatalyst.	1
Title: Prephenate decarboxylases: a new prephenate-utilizing enzyme family that performs nonaromatizing decarboxylation en route to diverse secondary metabolites Abstract: Prephenate is the direct precursor of phenylpyruvate and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in the biogenesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine by action of the decarboxylative, aromatizing enzymes prephenate dehydratase and dehydrogenase, respectively. The recent characterization of BacA in bacilysin biosynthesis as a nonaromatizing decarboxylase reveals a new route from prephenate in the biosynthesis of nonproteinogenic amino acids. This study describes two additional enzymes, AerD from Planktothrix agardhii and SalX from Salinispora tropica, that utilize the central building block prephenate for flux down distinct pathways to amino acid products, representing a new metabolic fate for prephenate and establishing a new family of nonaromatizing prephenate decarboxylases.	1
Title: A membrane-bound prenyltransferase catalyzes the O-prenylation of 1,6-dihydroxyphenazine in the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 produces the rare O-prenylated phenazines marinophenazines A and B. To identify the enzyme catalyzing the O-prenyl transfer in marinophenazine biosynthesis, we sequenced the genome of S. sp. CNQ-509. This led to the identification of two genomic loci harboring putative phenazine biosynthesis genes. The first locus contains orthologues for all seven genes involved in phenazine-1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in pseudomonads. The second locus contains two known phenazine biosynthesis genes and a putative prenyltransferase gene termed cnqPT1. cnqPT1 codes for a membrane protein with sequence similarity to the prenyltransferase UbiA of ubiquinone biosynthesis. The enzyme CnqPT1 was identified as a 1,6-dihydroxyphenazine geranyltransferase, which catalyzes the C-O bond formation between C-1 of the geranyl moiety and O-6 of the phenazine scaffold. CnqPT1 is the first example of a prenyltransferase catalyzing O-prenyl transfer to a phenazine.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a female genital complex cDNA from the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica Abstract: A cDNA clone whose RNA is abundant in the female genital complex of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica has been isolated from a cDNA library in lambda gt10 by differential screening. The pattern of expression in different fluke tissues and at different stages of miracidium formation suggests that this gene is expressed in the F. hepatica vitelleria. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA was determined and the primary structure of the putative protein was deduced. The proposed protein is rich in glycine, lysine, and tyrosine and its overall amino acid composition agrees with that reported for the F. hepatica egg shell. The clone has homology with DNA from other trematodes; this homology is higher in organisms in which egg development is similar to that of F. hepatica and suggests that the protein is conserved in organisms in which miracidium formation occurs in fresh water.	0
Title: Two sequence elements of glycosyltransferases involved in urdamycin biosynthesis are responsible for substrate specificity and enzymatic activity Abstract: Background:                       Two deoxysugar glycosyltransferases (GTs), UrdGT1b and UrdGT1c, involved in urdamycin biosynthesis share 91% identical amino acids. However, the two GTs show different specificities for both nucleotide sugar and acceptor substrate. Generally, it is proposed that GTs are two-domain proteins with a nucleotide binding domain and an acceptor substrate site with the catalytic center in an interface cleft between these domains. Our work aimed at finding out the region responsible for determination of substrate specificities of these two urdamycin GTs.                  Results:                       A series of 10 chimeric GT genes were constructed consisting of differently sized and positioned portions of urdGT1b and urdGT1c. Gene expression experiments in host strains Streptomyces fradiae Ax and XTC show that nine of 10 chimeric GTs are still functional, with either UrdGT1b- or UrdGT1c-like activity. A 31 amino acid region (aa 52-82) located close to the N-terminus of these enzymes, which differs in 18 residues, was identified to control both sugar donor and acceptor substrate specificity. Only one chimeric gene product of the 10 was not functional. Targeted stepwise alterations of glycine 226 (G226R, G226S, G226SR) were made to reintroduce residues conserved among streptomycete GTs. Alterations G226S and G226R restored a weak activity, whereas G226SR showed an activity comparable with other functional chimeras.                  Conclusions:                       A nucleotide sugar binding motif is present in the C-terminal moiety of UrdGT1b and UrdGT1c from S. fradiae. We could demonstrate that it is an N-terminal section that determines specificity for the nucleotide sugar and also the acceptor substrate. This finding directs the way towards engineering this class of streptomycete enzymes for antibiotic derivatization applications. Amino acids 226 and 227, located outside the putative substrate binding site, might be part of a larger protein structure, perhaps a solvent channel to the catalytic center. Therefore, they could play a role in substrate accessibility to it.	1
Title: A critical question for HIV vaccine development: which antibodies to induce? Abstract: A vaccine against HIV-1 must prevent infection against genetically diverse virus strains. Two approaches are currently being pursued to elicit antibody-mediated protection: vaccines that induce potent and broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) or vaccines that induce "conventional antibodies," which are less potent and broadly neutralizing in comparison. Although bnAbs may provide the greatest level of protection, their structural and genetic characteristics make their elicitation through vaccination a major challenge. In contrast, conventional HIV-1 antibodies have been induced by vaccination and correlated with reduced HIV-1 infection in a phase III vaccine trial. Here, I present evidence that both approaches should be pursued with equal vigor.	0
Title: Molecular genetic analysis of the orsellinic acid/F9775 gene cluster of Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: F-9775A and F-9775B are cathepsin K inhibitors that arise from a chromatin remodelling deletant strain of Aspergillus nidulans. A polyketide synthase gene has been determined to be responsible for their formation and for the simpler, archetypical polyketide orsellinic acid. We have discovered simple culture conditions that result in the production of the three compounds, and this facilitates analysis of the genes responsible for their synthesis. We have now analysed the F9775/orsellinic acid gene cluster using a set of targeted deletions. We find that the polyketide synthase alone is required for orsellinic acid biosynthesis and only two additional genes in the cluster are required for F9775 A and B synthesis. Our deletions also yielded the bioactive metabolites gerfelin and diorcinol.	1
Title: Withanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis peruviana and Their Selective Cytotoxicity to Prostate Cancer and Renal Carcinoma Cells Abstract: Investigation of aeroponically grown Physalis peruviana resulted in the isolation of 11 new withanolides, including perulactones I-L (1-4), 17-deoxy-23β-hydroxywithanolide E (5), 23β-hydroxywithanolide E (6), 4-deoxyphyperunolide A (7), 7β-hydroxywithanolide F (8), 7β-hydroxy-17-epi-withanolide K (9), 24,25-dihydro-23β,28-dihydroxywithanolide G (10), and 24,25-dihydrowithanolide E (11), together with 14 known withanolides (12-25). The structures of 1-11 were elucidated by the analysis of their spectroscopic data, and 12-25 were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported. All withanolides were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of tumor cell lines including LNCaP (androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma), 22Rv1 (androgen-resistant human prostate adenocarcinoma), ACHN (human renal adenocarcinoma), M14 (human melanoma), SK-MEL-28 (human melanoma), and normal human foreskin fibroblast cells. Of these, the 17β-hydroxywithanolides (17-BHWs) 6, 8, 9, 11-13, 15, and 19-22 showed selective cytotoxic activity against the two prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1, whereas 13 and 20 exhibited selective toxicity for the ACHN renal carcinoma cell line. These cytotoxicity data provide additional structure-activity relationship information for the 17-BHWs.	0
Title: The SapB morphogen is a lantibiotic-like peptide derived from the product of the developmental gene ramS in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: SapB is a morphogenetic peptide that is important for aerial mycelium formation by the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Production of SapB commences during aerial mycelium formation and depends on most of the genes known to be required for the morphogenesis of aerial hyphae. Furthermore, the application of purified SapB to mutants blocked in morphogenesis restores their capacity to form aerial hyphae. Here, we present evidence that SapB is a lantibiotic-like peptide that is derived by posttranslational modification from the product of a gene (ramS) in the four-gene ram operon, which is under the control of the regulatory gene ramR. We show that the product of another gene in the operon (ramC) contains a region that is similar to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, suggesting that it might be involved in the posttranslational processing of RamS. We conclude that SapB is derived from RamS through proteolytic cleavage and the introduction of four dehydroalanine residues and two lanthionine bridges. We provide an example of a morphogenetic role for an antibiotic-like molecule.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of trioxacarcin revealing a different starter unit and complex tailoring steps for type II polyketide synthase Abstract: Trioxacarcins (TXNs) are highly oxygenated, polycyclic aromatic natural products with remarkable biological activity and structural complexity. Evidence from 13C-labelled precursor feeding studies demonstrated that the scaffold was biosynthesized from one unit of l-isoleucine and nine units of malonyl-CoA, which suggested a different starter unit in the biosynthesis. Genetic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster revealed 56 genes encoding a type II polyketide synthase (PKS), combined with a large amount of tailoring enzymes. Inactivation of seven post-PKS modification enzymes resulted in the production of a series of new TXN analogues, intermediates, and shunt products, most of which show high anti-cancer activity. Structural elucidation of these new compounds not only helps us to propose the biosynthetic pathway, featuring a type II PKS using a novel starter unit, but also set the stage for further characterization of the enzymatic reactions and combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Growth of Toxoplasma gondii is inhibited by aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase Abstract: Aryloxyphenoxypropionates, inhibitors of the plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of grasses, also inhibit Toxoplasma gondii ACC. Clodinafop, the most effective of the herbicides tested, inhibits growth of T. gondii in human fibroblasts by 70% at 10 microM in 2 days and effectively eliminates the parasite in 2-4 days at 10-100 microM. Clodinafop is not toxic to the host cell even at much higher concentrations. Parasite growth inhibition by different herbicides is correlated with their ability to inhibit ACC enzyme activity, suggesting that ACC is a target for these agents. Fragments of genes encoding the biotin carboxylase domain of multidomain ACCs of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium knowlesi, and Cryptosporidium parvum were sequenced. One T. gondii ACC (ACC1) amino acid sequence clusters with P. falciparum ACC, P. knowlesi ACC, and the putative Cyclotella cryptica chloroplast ACC. Another sequence (ACC2) clusters with that of C. parvum ACC, probably the cytosolic form.	0
Title: Combination of antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing activities of novel oleoylamines Abstract: A combination of antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing activities is desired in order to prevent progression from infection to sepsis due to the release of lipopolysaccharide from dying gram-negative bacteria. Lipopolyamines have emerged as a new type of endotoxin-neutralizing compound, but their antimicrobial activity has not been investigated. We synthesized a series of 10 oleoylamines differing in the polyamino head group, particularly in the number and separation between nitrogen atoms and the position of the oleoyl moiety. Compounds showed activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in the micromolar range. Compounds were able to provide penetration of ethidium bromide into bacteria, indicating effects on the bacterial membrane. Oleoylamines neutralized endotoxin in Limulus amoebocyte lysate assays and by neutralization of tumor necrosis factor alpha release in human blood. Comparison of biological activities of compounds identified structural properties responsible for antimicrobial activity, and quantitative structure-property relationship analysis provided a quantitative model for prediction of activity of oleoylamines.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of rhizocticins, antifungal phosphonate oligopeptides produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 Abstract: Rhizocticins are phosphonate oligopeptide antibiotics containing the C-terminal nonproteinogenic amino acid (Z)-l-2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (APPA). Here we report the identification and characterization of the rhizocticin biosynthetic gene cluster (rhi) in Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633. Rhizocticin B was heterologously produced in the nonproducer strain Bacillus subtilis 168. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed on the basis of bioinformatics analysis of the rhi genes. One of the steps during the biosynthesis of APPA is an unusual aldol reaction between phosphonoacetaldehyde and oxaloacetate catalyzed by an aldolase homolog RhiG. Recombinant RhiG was prepared, and the product of an in vitro enzymatic conversion was characterized. Access to this intermediate allows for biochemical characterization of subsequent steps in the pathway.	1
Title: Metathramycin, a new bioactive aureolic acid discovered by heterologous expression of a metagenome derived biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Bacterial natural products have been a rich source of bioactive compounds for drug development, and advances in DNA sequencing, informatics and molecular biology have opened new avenues for their discovery. Here, we describe the isolation of an aureolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster from a metagenome library derived from a New Zealand soil sample. Heterologous expression of this pathway in Streptomyces albus resulted in the production and isolation of two new aureolic acid compounds, one of which (metathramycin, 6) possesses potent bioactivity against a human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116, IC50 = 14.6 nM). As metathramycin was a minor constituent of the fermentation extract, its discovery relied on a combination of approaches including bioactivity guided fractionation, MS/MS characterisation and pathway engineering. This study not only demonstrates the presence of previously uncharacterised aureolic acids in the environment, but also the value of an integrated natural product discovery approach which may be generally applicable to low abundance bioactive metabolites.	1
Title: Mitochondrion-targeted platinum complexes suppressing lung cancer through multiple pathways involving energy metabolism Abstract: Mitochondria are potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drugs. A series of mitochondrion-targeted monofunctional platinum complexes, [Pt(ortho-PPh3CH2Py)(NH3)2Cl](NO3)2 (OPT), [Pt(meta-PPh3CH2Py)(NH3)2Cl](NO3)2 (MPT), and [Pt(para-PPh3CH2Py)(NH3)2Cl](NO3)2 (PPT) (PPh3 = triphenylphosphonium, Py = pyridine), are studied in this article. The antitumor activity and mechanism of action have been investigated in vitro and in vivo as well as on molecular levels. OPT exhibits higher efficacy than cisplatin against A549 lung cancer cells; furthermore, it shows a strong inhibition towards the growth of non-small-cell lung cancer in nude mice. The DNA binding ability of these complexes follows an order of PPT > OPT > MPT. Cellular uptake and distribution studies show that OPT accumulates mainly in mitochondria, while MPT and PPT accumulate more preferentially in nuclei than in mitochondria. As a result, OPT induces remarkable changes in the ultrastructure and membrane of mitochondria, leading to more radical mitochondrial dysfunctions than cisplatin. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is more evident for cells treated with OPT than with cisplatin, though the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by OPT is similar to that induced by cisplatin. Disruption to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis is involved in the antitumor mechanism of these compounds. The results indicate that in addition to DNA binding, bioenergetic pathways also play crucial roles in the antitumor activity of mitochondrion-targeted monofunctional platinum complexes.	0
Title: The filamentous fungal gene expression database (FFGED) Abstract: Filamentous fungal gene expression assays provide essential information for understanding systemic cellular regulation. To aid research on fungal gene expression, we constructed a novel, comprehensive, free database, the filamentous fungal gene expression database (FFGED), available at http://bioinfo.townsend.yale.edu. FFGED features user-friendly management of gene expression data, which are assorted into experimental metadata, experimental design, raw data, normalized details, and analysis results. Data may be submitted in the process of an experiment, and any user can submit multiple experiments, thus classifying the FFGED as an "active experiment" database. Most importantly, FFGED functions as a collective and collaborative platform, by connecting each experiment with similar related experiments made public by other users, maximizing data sharing among different users, and correlating diverse gene expression levels under multiple experimental designs within different experiments. A clear and efficient web interface is provided with enhancement by AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and through a collection of tools to effectively facilitate data submission, sharing, retrieval and visualization.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Origin of the Atypical Stereochemistry in the Thioheptose Core of Albomycin Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Albomycins are peptidyl thionucleoside natural products that display antimicrobial activity against clinically important pathogens. Their structures are characterized by a thioheptose with atypical stereochemistry including a d-xylofuranose ring modified with a d-amino acid moiety. Herein it is demonstrated that AbmH is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaldolase that catalyzes a threo-selective aldol-type reaction to generate the thioheptose core with a d-ribofuranose ring and an l-amino acid moiety. The conversion of l-to d-amino acid configuration is catalyzed by the PLP-dependent epimerase AbmD. The d- ribo to d- xylo conversion of the thiofuranose ring appears according to gene deletion experiments to be mediated by AbmJ, which is annotated as a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme. These studies establish several key steps in the assembly of the thioheptose core during the biosynthesis of albomycins.	1
Title: STUDIES ON THE STABILITY OF THE NORMAL HUMAN FECAL FLORA Abstract: Zubrzycki, Leonard (Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.) and Earle H. Spaulding. Studies on the stability of the normal human fecal flora. J. Bacteriol. 83:968-974. 1962.-The results of two series of stool cultures show that members of the genus Bacteriodes constitute the most numerous group of bacteria in the normal human adult fecal flora. Together with the enterococci, coliform bacilli, diphtheroids, and lactobacilli, these major components account for more than 99% of the total counts. Wide fluctuations in the number and types of minor organisms observed suggest the probability that they are held in check by these major components which may also possess mechanisms for preventing pathogens from establishing themselves in the large bowel.	0
Title: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activation by (-)-epicatechin gallate: potential adverse effects of cancer chemoprevention with high-dose green tea extracts Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that induces oxygen-regulated genes in response to reduced oxygen conditions (hypoxia). Expression of the oxygen-regulated HIF-1alpha subunit correlates positively with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Green tea catechins are believed to be responsible for the cancer chemopreventive activities of green tea. We found that (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG, 1), one of the major green tea catechins, strongly activates HIF-1 in T47D human breast carcinoma cells. Among the green tea catechins tested, 1 demonstrated the strongest HIF-1-inducing activity, while (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, 2) was significantly less active. However, 2 is relatively unstable in the in vitro system studied. Compound 1 also increases the expression of HIF-1 target genes including GLUT-1, VEGF, and CDKN1A. In T47D cells, 1 induces nuclear HIF-1alpha protein without affecting HIF-1alpha mRNA. Both the induction of HIF-1alpha protein and activation of HIF-1 by 1 can be blocked by iron and ascorbate, indicating that 1 may activate HIF-1 through the chelation of iron. These results suggest that intended cancer chemoprevention with high-dose green tea extracts may be compromised, by the ability of tea catechins to promote tumor cell survival pathways associated with HIF-1 activation.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme Abstract: Tenuazonic acid (TeA) is a well-known mycotoxin produced by various plant pathogenic fungi. However, its biosynthetic gene has been unknown to date. Here we identify the TeA biosynthetic gene from Magnaporthe oryzae by finding two TeA-inducing conditions of a low-producing strain. We demonstrate that TeA is synthesized from isoleucine and acetoacetyl-coenzyme A by TeA synthetase 1 (TAS1). TAS1 is a unique non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) hybrid enzyme that begins with an NRPS module. In contrast to other NRPS/PKS hybrid enzymes, the PKS portion of TAS1 has only a ketosynthase (KS) domain and this domain is indispensable for TAS1 activity. Phylogenetic analysis classifies this KS domain as an independent clade close to type I PKS KS domain. We demonstrate that the TAS1 KS domain conducts the final cyclization step for TeA release. These results indicate that TAS1 is a unique type of NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.	1
Title: Bufadienolides from the Eggs of the Toad Bufo bufo gargarizans and Their Antimelanoma Activities Abstract: Toads produce potent toxins, named bufadienolides, to defend against their predators. Pharmacological research has revealed that bufadienolides are potential anticancer drugs. In this research, we reported nine bufadienolides from the eggs of the toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, including two new compounds (1 and 3). The chemical structures of 1 and 3, as well as of one previously reported semisynthesized compound (2), were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data interpretation, chemical methods, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Compound 1 is an unusual 19-norbufadienolide with rearranged A/B rings. A biological test revealed that compounds 2 and 4-8 showed potent cytotoxic activities toward human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-1 with IC50 values less than 1.0 μM. A preliminary mechanism investigation revealed that the most potent compound, 8, could induce apoptosis via PARP cleavage, while 5 and 6 significantly suppressed angiogenesis in zebrafish. Furthermore, an in vivo biological study showed that 5, 6, and 8 inhibit SK-MEL-1 cell growth significantly.	0
Title: Cloning and analysis of the spinosad biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora spinosa Abstract: Background:                       Spinosad is a mixture of novel macrolide secondary metabolites produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is used in agriculture as a potent insect control agent with exceptional safety to non-target organisms. The cloning of the spinosyn biosynthetic gene cluster provides the starting materials for the molecular genetic manipulation of spinosad yields, and for the production of novel derivatives containing alterations in the polyketide core or in the attached sugars.                  Results:                       We cloned the spinosad biosynthetic genes by molecular probing, complementation of blocked mutants, and cosmid walking, and sequenced an 80 kb region. We carried out gene disruptions of some of the genes and analyzed the mutants for product formation and for the bioconversion of intermediates in the spinosyn pathway. The spinosyn gene cluster contains five large open reading frames that encode a multifunctional, multi-subunit type I polyketide synthase (PKS). The PKS cluster is flanked on one side by genes involved in the biosynthesis of the amino sugar forosamine, in O-methylations of rhamnose, in sugar attachment to the polyketide, and in polyketide cross-bridging. Genes involved in the early common steps in the biosynthesis of forosamine and rhamnose, and genes dedicated to rhamnose biosynthesis, were not located in the 80 kb cluster.                  Conclusions:                       Most of the S. spinosa genes involved in spinosyn biosynthesis are found in one 74 kb cluster, though it does not contain all of the genes required for the essential deoxysugars. Characterization of the clustered genes suggests that the spinosyns are synthesized largely by mechanisms similar to those used to assemble complex macrolides in other actinomycetes. However, there are several unusual genes in the spinosyn cluster that could encode enzymes that generate the most striking structural feature of these compounds, a tetracyclic polyketide aglycone nucleus.	1
Title: Formation of the preprimosome protects lambda O from RNA transcription-dependent proteolysis by ClpP/ClpX Abstract: Using the bacteriophage lambda DNA replication system, composed entirely of purified proteins, we have tested the accessibility of the short-lived lambda O protein to the ClpP/ClpX protease during the various stages of lambda DNA replication. We find that binding of lambda O protein to its orilambda DNA sequence, leading to the so-called "O-some" formation, largely inhibits its degradation. On the contrary, under conditions permissive for transcription, the lambda O protein bound to the orilambda sequence becomes largely accessible to ClpP/ClpX-mediated proteolysis. However, when the lambda O protein is part of the larger orilambda:O.P.DnaB preprimosomal complex, transcription does not significantly increase ClpP/ClpX-dependent lambda O degradation. These results show that transcription can stimulate proteolysis of a protein that is required for the initiation of DNA replication.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Timing and Substrate Specificity for the Thiopeptide Thiomuracin Abstract: The biosynthesis of the thiopeptide thiomuracin is a well-orchestrated process involving a multitude of posttranslational modifications. We show that six Cys residues of a precursor peptide are first cyclodehydrated and oxidized to thiazoles in an ordered, but nonlinear fashion that is leader-peptide-dependent. Then four alcohols are glutamylated and converted to alkenes in a C-to-N terminal directional process that is leader-peptide-independent. Finally, two of these alkenes undergo a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition to form a trithiazole-substituted pyridine macrocycle. We describe here the factors that govern the substrate specificity and order of biosynthetic events that turn a ribosomal peptide into a powerful antibiotic.	1
Title: Biosynthetic Pathway of the Reduced Polyketide Product Citreoviridin in Aspergillus terreus var. aureus Revealed by Heterologous Expression in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Citreoviridin (1) belongs to a class of F1-ATPase β-subunit inhibitors that are synthesized by highly reducing polyketide synthases. These potent mycotoxins share an α-pyrone polyene structure, and they include aurovertin, verrucosidin, and asteltoxin. The identification of the citreoviridin biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus terreus var. aureus and its reconstitution using heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans are reported. Two intermediates were isolated that allowed the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway of citreoviridin.	1
Title: Functional analysis of genes for biosynthesis of pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboxamide from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Abstract: Two seven-gene phenazine biosynthetic loci were cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The operons, designated phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2, are homologous to previously studied phenazine biosynthetic operons from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Functional studies of phenazine-nonproducing strains of fluorescent pseudomonads indicated that each of the biosynthetic operons from P. aeruginosa is sufficient for production of a single compound, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). Subsequent conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is mediated in P. aeruginosa by two novel phenazine-modifying genes, phzM and phzS, which encode putative phenazine-specific methyltransferase and flavin-containing monooxygenase, respectively. Expression of phzS alone in Escherichia coli or in enzymes, pyocyanin-nonproducing P. fluorescens resulted in conversion of PCA to 1-hydroxyphenazine. P. aeruginosa with insertionally inactivated phzM or phzS developed pyocyanin-deficient phenotypes. A third phenazine-modifying gene, phzH, which has a homologue in Pseudomonas chlororaphis, also was identified and was shown to control synthesis of phenazine-1-carboxamide from PCA in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Our results suggest that there is a complex pyocyanin biosynthetic pathway in P. aeruginosa consisting of two core loci responsible for synthesis of PCA and three additional genes encoding unique enzymes involved in the conversion of PCA to pyocyanin, 1-hydroxyphenazine, and phenazine-1-carboxamide.	1
Title: A diastereoselective oxa-Pictet-Spengler-based strategy for (+)-frenolicin B and epi-(+)-frenolicin B synthesis Abstract: An efficient diastereoselective oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction strategy was developed to construct benzoisochroman diastereomers. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated in the context of both the total synthesis of naturally occurring pyranonaphthoquinones (+)-frenolicin B and epi-(+)-frenolicin B as well as a range of frenolicin precursor analogs. The method is versatile and offers exquisite stereocontrol and, as such, offers a synthetic advance for the synthesis of pyranonaphthoquinone analogs.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster of the herbicide phosphinothricin tripeptide from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü494 Abstract: The antibiotic phosphinothricin tripeptide (PTT) consists of two molecules of L-alanine and one molecule of the unusual amino acid phosphinothricin (PT) which are nonribosomally combined. The bioactive compound PT has bactericidal, fungicidal, and herbicidal properties and possesses a C-P-C bond, which is very rare in natural compounds. Previously uncharacterized flanking and middle regions of the PTT biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü494 were isolated and sequenced. The boundaries of the gene cluster were identified by gene inactivation studies. Sequence analysis and homology searches led to the completion of the gene cluster, which consists of 24 genes. Four of these were identified as undescribed genes coding for proteins that are probably involved in uncharacterized early steps of antibiotic biosynthesis or in providing precursors of PTT biosynthesis (phosphoenolpyruvate, acetyl-coenzyme A, or L-alanine). The involvement of the genes orfM and trs and of the regulatory gene prpA in PTT biosynthesis was analyzed by gene inactivation and overexpression, respectively. Insight into the regulation of PTT was gained by determining the transcriptional start sites of the pmi and prpA genes. A previously undescribed regulatory gene involved in morphological differentiation in streptomycetes was identified outside of the left boundary of the PTT biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of radiolabeled curacin A and its rapid and apparently irreversible binding to the colchicine site of tubulin Abstract: Curacin A is a potent competitive inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin, and it inhibits the growth of tumor cells. We prepared [(14)C]curacin A biosynthetically to investigate its interaction with tubulin. Binding was rapid, even at 0 degrees C, with a minimum k(f) of 4.4 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1). We were unable to demonstrate any dissociation of the [(14)C]curacin A from tubulin. Consistent with these observations, the K(a) value was so high that an accurate determination by Scatchard analysis was not possible. The [(14)C]curacin A was released from tubulin following urea treatment, indicating that covalent bond formation does not occur. We concluded that curacin A binds more tightly to tubulin than does colchicine. Besides high-affinity binding to the colchicine site, we observed significant superstoichiometric amounts of the [(14)C]curacin A bound to tubulin, and Scatchard analysis confirmed the presence of two binding sites of relatively low affinity with a K(a) of 3.2 x 10(-5) M(-1).	1
Title: Expansion of RiPP biosynthetic space through integration of pan-genomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides Abstract: Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.	1
Title: The adamantane-derived bananins are potent inhibitors of the helicase activities and replication of SARS coronavirus Abstract: Bananins are a class of antiviral compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative. Six members of this class of compounds: bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, ansabananin, eubananin, and adeninobananin were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of the SARS Coronavirus (SCV) helicase. Bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin were effective inhibitors of the ATPase activity of the SCV helicase with IC50 values in the range 0.5-3 microM. A similar trend, though at slightly higher inhibitor concentrations, was observed for inhibition of the helicase activities, using a FRET-based fluorescent assay. In a cell culture system of SCV, bananin exhibited an EC50 of less than 10 microM and a CC50 of over 300 microM. Kinetics of inhibition are consistent with bananin inhibiting an intracellular process or processes involved in SCV replication.	0
Title: Effects of deletions of mbtH-like genes on clorobiocin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: In the biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, the small ORF cloY encodes a 71 aa protein which shows significant sequence similarity to mbtH from the mycobactin biosynthetic gene cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. mbtH-like genes are frequently found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of peptide antibiotics and siderophores, but their function has remained enigmatic. In a recent publication it has been suggested that these genes may have no function for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. An in-frame deletion of cloY in the clorobiocin cluster has now been carried out. When the modified cluster was expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512, clorobiocin was still formed. However, when the two further mbtH-like genes from elsewhere in the host genome were inactivated as well, clorobiocin formation was reduced dramatically. Complementation with cloY or with any of three other mbtH-like genes restored clorobiocin formation. This is the first report proving the requirement of an mbtH-like gene for secondary metabolite formation, and the first proof that different mbtH-like genes can functionally replace each other. Feeding of an mbtH-defective triple mutant strain with an intact 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-coumarin moiety restored antibiotic production, showing that cloY is specifically required for the formation of this moiety of the clorobiocin molecule.	1
Title: Naphthyridinomycin, a DNA-reactive antibiotic Abstract: Naphthyridinomycin is a novel quinone antibiotic that is produced in liquid shake cultures by Streptomyces lusitanus. Fermentation studies have shown that this antibiotic is produced maximally after 96 h of cell growth. L-[methyl-3H]methionine efficiently labels naphthyridinomycin when it is added to a fermentation mixture 24 h before culture is harvested. Unlabeled and radioactively labeled naphthyridinomycin were used to determine the mechanism of action of this unique antibiotic. Naphthyridinomycin inhibited bacterial growth primarily by inhibiting DNA synthesis. The structural similarity between naphthyridinomycin and the saframycins suggested that naphthyridinomycin might inhibit DNA synthesis by binding to the template. In vitro studies with radiolabeled naphthyridinomycin indicated that this antibiotic does specifically bind to calf thymus DNA. The binding reaction was enhanced by adding sulfhydryl-containing compounds; dithiothreitol was the best activating agent. DNA-naphthyridinomycin complexes were a poor substrate for enzymes that catalyze DNA-directed DNA and RNA syntheses. These results showed that naphthyridinomycin is similar to the saframycins in its reactivity toward DNA and suggested that the mechanism by which naphthyridinomycin inhibits DNA synthesis is through its ability to bind specifically to the DNA template of the cell.	0
Title: A nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene (mgoA) of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is involved in mangotoxin biosynthesis and is required for full virulence Abstract: Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes the bacterial apical necrosis of mango, produces the antimetabolite mangotoxin. We report here the cloning, sequencing, and identity analysis of a chromosomal region of 11.1 kb from strain P syringae pv. syringae UMAF0158, which is involved in mangotoxin biosynthesis. This chromosomal region contains six complete open reading frames (ORFs), including a large gene (ORF5) with a modular architecture characteristic of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) named mgoA. A Tn5 mutant disrupted in mgoA was defective in mangotoxin production, revealing the involvement of the putative NRPS gene in the biosynthesis of mangotoxin. This derivative strain impaired in mangotoxin production also showed a reduction in virulence as measured by necrotic symptoms on tomato leaflets. Mangotoxin production and virulence were restored fully in the NRPS mutant by complementation with plasmid pCG2-6, which contains an 11,103-bp chromosomal region cloned from the wild-type strain P syringae pv. syringae UMAF0158 that includes the putative NPRS gene (mgoA). The results demonstrate that mgoA has a role in the virulence of P. syringae pv. syringae. The involvement of an NRPS in the production of an antimetabolite toxin from P. syringae inhibiting ornithine acetyltransferase activity is proposed.	1
Title: A γ-butyrolactone-sensing activator/repressor, JadR3, controls a regulatory mini-network for jadomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Two regulatory genes, jadR2 and jadR3, in the jadomycin (jad) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces venezuelae encode homologues of γ-butyrolactone receptor. JadR2 was previously shown to be a pseudo γ-butyrolactone receptor. jadR3 is situated at the upstream of jadW123 encoding putative enzymes for γ-butyrolactone biosynthesis. Disruption of jadR3 resulted in markedly decreased production of jadomycin. Transcriptional analysis revealed that JadR3 represses jadW1, jadR2 and jadR3 but activates jadR1, the key activator gene for jadomycin biosynthesis. DNase I footprinting showed that JadR3 has four binding sites in the intergenic regions of jadR2-jadR1 and jadR3-jadW1. A JadR3 interactive molecule, SVB1, was purified from a large-scale fermentation and its structure found to be the same as SCB3, a γ-butyrolactone from Streptomyces coelicolor, and was absent from a jadW123 mutant lacking jadomycin production. Addition of SVB1 or extract from S. coelicolor to the mutant restored jadomycin production. Overall, our results revealed that the association of JadR3 and SVB1 plays an important role in controlling a regulatory mini-network governing jadomycin biosynthesis, providing new insights into the ways in which γ-butyrolactone/receptor systems modulate antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces.	0
Title: Molecular characterization of two genes from Streptomyces tendae Tü901 required for the formation of the 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one-containing nucleoside moiety of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin Abstract: The genes nikQ and nikR were identified by sequencing DNA of the nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces tendae Tü901/8c. The nikQ gene encodes a P450 cytochrome, and the predicted NikR gene product shows 48-56% sequence identity with uracil phosphoribosyltransferases from eukaryotic organisms. The nikQ and nikR genes were inactivated separately by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette. Inactivation of the nikQ gene abolished synthesis of nikkomycins containing 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one as the base (nikkomycins X and I), whereas production of nikkomycins containing uracil (nikkomycins Z and J) was not affected. Nikkomycin X and I production could be restored by feeding 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to the nikQ mutants, indicating that NikQ is responsible for its formation from L-histidine. Disruption of the nikR gene resulted in formation of decreased amounts of nikkomycins X and I, whereas nikkomycins Z and J were synthesized at wild-type levels. A fluorouracil-resistant nikR mutant lacking uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) activity did not synthesize nikkomycins X and I and accumulated 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one in its culture filtrate, whereas formation of nikkomycins Z and J was unimpaired. The mutant was complemented to nikkomycin X and I production by nikR expressed from the mel promoter of plasmid pIJ702. The nikR gene expressed in Escherichia coli led to the production of UPRTase activity. Our results indicate that NikR converts 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to yield 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one, the precursor of nikkomycins containing this base.	1
Title: The ornibactin biosynthesis and transport genes of Burkholderia cenocepacia are regulated by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor which is a part of the Fur regulon Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia mutants that fail to produce the siderophore ornibactin were obtained following mutagenesis with mini-Tn5Tp. These mutants were shown to be growth restricted under conditions of iron depletion. In eight of the mutants, the transposon had integrated into one of two genes, orbI and orbJ, encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In the other mutant, the transposon had inserted into an open reading frame, orbS, located upstream from orbI. The polypeptide product of orbS exhibits a high degree of similarity to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor PvdS but possesses an N-terminal extension of approximately 29 amino acids that is not present in PvdS. Three predicted OrbS-dependent promoters were identified within the ornibactin gene cluster, based on their similarity to PvdS-dependent promoters. The iron-regulated activity of these promoters was shown to require OrbS. Transcription of the orbS gene was found to be under the control of an iron-regulated sigma(70)-dependent promoter. This promoter, but not the OrbS-dependent promoters, was shown to be a target for repression by the global regulator Fur. Our results demonstrate that production of ornibactin by B. cenocepacia in response to iron starvation requires transcription of an operon that is dependent on the Fur-regulated ECF sigma factor gene orbS. A mechanism is also proposed for the biosynthesis of ornibactin.	1
Title: Characterization of representative rpoB gene mutations leading to a significant change in toyocamycin production of Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628 Abstract: Modification of enzymes involved in transcription- or translation-processes is an interesting way to increase secondary metabolite production in Streptomycetes. However, application of such methods has not been widely described for strains which produce nucleoside antibiotics. The nucleoside antibiotic toyocamycin (TM) is produced by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628. For improving TM production in S. diastatochromogenes 1628, the strain was spread on rifamycin-resistant (Rif(r)) medium. Several spontaneous mutants were obtained with mutations in the rpoB gene which encodes a RNA polymerase β-subunit. The mutants which showed increased TM production were detected at a frequency of 7.5 % among the total Rif(r) mutants. Mutant 1628-T15 harboring amino acid substitution His437Arg was the best TM producer with a 4.5-fold increase in comparison to that of the wild-type strain. The worst producer was mutant 1628-T62 which also showed a poor sporulation behavior. RT-PCR was performed to study the transcription levels of the TM biosynthetic gene toyG in the parental strain as well as in mutants 1628-T15 and 1628-T62. The transcriptional level of toyG was higher in mutant 1628-T15 than that in parental strain 1628, while much lower in mutant 1628-T62. In mutant strain 1628-T62 the expression of adpA sd gene, which is required for morphological differentiation, was also much lower. Our studies also indicate that the introduction of mutations into rpoB is an effective strategy to improve the production of TM which is an important nucleoside antibiotic.	1
Title: Effect of starvation on cytoplasmic pH, proton motive force, and viability of an acidophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The question of whether Thiobacillus acidophilus maintains its cytoplasmic pH at values close to neutrality by active or passive means was explored by subjecting the organism to long-term starvation (up to 22 days). Starving cells maintained a delta pH of 2 to 3 U throughout starvation, although cellular poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid and ATP, the proton motive force, and culture viability were low or not detectable after 200 h. Cells exposed to azide or azide plus N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide immediately exhibited characteristics of cells starved for more than 200 h. Thus, a large delta pH in T. acidophilus was maintained in the absence of ATP, ATPase activity, respiration, significant levels of proton motive force, and cell viability and was therefore not dependent on chemiosmotic ionic pumping. The transition from a metabolically active to an inactive state was accompanied by a large increase in the positive membrane potential, which nearly completely compensated for the delta pH in the inactive cells. The longevity of the acidophile during starvation was comparable to that reported previously for neutrophiles, and the loss of viability occurred not because of the acidification of the cytoplasm but apparently because of energy depletion.	0
Title: Overexpression of a three-gene conidial pigment biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus nidulans reveals the first NRPS known to acetylate tryptophan Abstract: Fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are megasynthetases that produce cyclic and acyclic peptides. In Aspergillus nidulans, the NRPS ivoA (AN10576) has been associated with the biosynthesis of grey-brown conidiophore pigments. Another gene, ivoB (AN0231), has been demonstrated to be an N-acetyl-6-hydroxytryptophan oxidase that putatively acts downstream of IvoA. A third gene, ivoC, has also been predicted to be involved in pigment biosynthesis based on publicly available genomic and transcriptomic information. In this paper, we report the replacement of the promoters of the ivoA, ivoB, and ivoC genes with the inducible promoter alcA in a single cotransformation. Co-overexpression of the three genes resulted in the production of a dark-brown pigment in hyphae. In addition, overexpression of each of the Ivo genes, ivoA-C, individually or in combination, allowed us to isolate intermediates and confirm the function of each gene. IvoA was found to be the first known NRPS to carry out the acetylation of the amino acid, tryptophan.	1
Title: Enzymatic reconstitution of ribosomal peptide backbone thioamidation Abstract: Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is an essential enzyme found strictly in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea. MCR catalyzes a reversible reaction involved in the production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α-subunit of this enzyme (McrA) contains several unusual posttranslational modifications, including the only known naturally occurring example of protein thioamidation. We have recently demonstrated by genetic deletion and mass spectrometry that the tfuA and ycaO genes of Methanosarcina acetivorans are involved in thioamidation of Gly465 in the MCR active site. Modification to thioGly has been postulated to stabilize the active site structure of MCR. Herein, we report the in vitro reconstitution of ribosomal peptide thioamidation using heterologously expressed and purified YcaO and TfuA proteins from M. acetivorans Like other reported YcaO proteins, this reaction is ATP-dependent but requires an external sulfide source. We also reconstitute the thioamidation activity of two TfuA-independent YcaOs from the hyperthermophilic methanogenic archaea Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Using these proteins, we demonstrate the basis for substrate recognition and regioselectivity of thioamide formation based on extensive mutagenesis, biochemical, and binding studies. Finally, we report nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound crystal structures for the YcaO proteins from M. kandleri Sequence and structure-guided mutagenesis with subsequent biochemical evaluation have allowed us to assign roles for residues involved in thioamidation and confirm that the reaction proceeds via backbone O-phosphorylation. These data assign a new biochemical reaction to the YcaO superfamily and paves the way for further characterization of additional peptide backbone posttranslational modifications.	1
Title: Critical role of calcium- dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation in PC12 cell membrane depolarization and bradykinin signaling Abstract: PC12 cells respond to a variety of external stimuli such as growth factors, neurotransmitters, and membrane depolarization by activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Here we demonstrate that both depolarization-induced calcium influx and treatment with bradykinin stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Using a tetracycline-controlled expression system in conjunction with a dominant-negative EGFR mutant, we demonstrate that depolarization and bradykinin triggered signals involve EGFR function upstream of SHC and MAP kinase. Furthermore, bradykinin-stimulated EGFR transactivation is critically dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, and when triggered by ionophore treatment, calcium influx is already sufficient to induce EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, our results establish calcium-dependent EGFR transactivation as a signaling mechanism mediating activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in neuronal cell types.	0
Title: Structures and Biosynthetic Pathway of Coprisamides C and D, 2-Alkenylcinnamic Acid-Containing Peptides from the Gut Bacterium of the Carrion Beetle Silpha perforata Abstract: Coprisamides C and D (1 and 2) were isolated from a gut bacterium, Micromonospora sp. UTJ3, of the carrion beetle Silpha perforata. Based on the combined analysis of UV, MS, and NMR spectral data, the planar structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated to be unreported derivatives of coprisamides A and B, cyclic depsipeptides bearing a 2-alkenylcinnamic acid unit and the unusual amino acids β-methylaspartic acid and 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined using the advanced Marfey's method, phenylglycine methyl ester derivatization, and J-based configuration analysis. The biosynthetic gene clusters for the coprisamides were investigated based on genomic data from coprisamide-producing strains Micromonospora sp. UTJ3 and Streptomyces sp. SNU533. Coprisamide C (1) was active against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis mc2 6230 strain.	1
Title: Generation of bioinspired structural colors via two-photon polymerization Abstract: Colors of crystals, pigments, metals, salt solutions and bioluminescence occur in nature due to the optical properties of electrons in atoms and molecules. However, colors can also result from interference effects on nanostructures. In contrast to artificial coloration, which are caused by well-defined regular structures, the structural colors of living organisms are often more intense and almost angle-independent. In this paper, we report the successful manufacturing of a lamellar nanostructure that mimics the ridge shape of the Morpho butterfly using a 3d-direct laser writing technique. The viewing angle dependency of the color was analyzed via a spectrometer and the structure was visualized using a scanning electron microscope. The generated nano- and micro-structures and their optical properties were comparable to those observed in the Morpho butterfly.	0
Title: Evidence for a staphylococcal-like mercury resistance gene in Enterococcus faecalis Abstract: We investigated mercury resistance (Hgr) in 52 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis from two different geographical regions. Eleven of the 52 strains were resistant to HgCl2, and plasmids from these enterococci hybridized with a staphylococcal mercury resistance gene probe. Hgr from 5 of the 11 transferred at frequencies ranging from approximately 2 X 10(-7) to 2 X 10(-3).	0
Title: Genomic and metabolomic insights into the natural product biosynthetic diversity of a feral-hog-associated Brevibacillus laterosporus strain Abstract: Bacteria associated with mammals are a rich source of microbial biodiversity; however, little is known concerning the abilities of these microbes to generate secondary metabolites. This report focuses on a bacterium isolated from the ear of a feral hog from southwestern Oklahoma, USA. The bacterium was identified as a new strain (PE36) of Brevibacillus latersporus, which was shown via genomic analysis to contain a large number of gene clusters presumably involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. A scale-up culture of B. latersporus PE36 yielded three bioactive compounds that inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (basiliskamides A and B and 12-methyltetradecanoic acid). Further studies of the isolate's secondary metabolome provided both new (auripyrazine) and previously-described pyrazine-containing compounds. In addition, a new peptidic natural product (auriporcine) was purified that was determined to be composed of a polyketide unit, two L-proline residues, two D-leucine residues, one L-leucine residue, and a reduced L-phenylalanine (L-phenylalanol). An examination of the genome revealed two gene clusters that are likely responsible for generating the basiliskamides and auriporcine. These combined genomic and chemical studies confirm that new and unusual secondary metabolites can be obtained from the bacterial associates of wild mammals.	1
Title: The cluster of penicillin biosynthetic genes. Identification and characterization of the pcbAB gene encoding the alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase and linkage to the pcbC and penDE genes Abstract: Penicillium chrysogenum DNA fragments cloned in EMBL3 or cosmid vectors from the upstream region of the pcbC-penDE cluster carry a gene (pcbAB) that complemented the deficiency of alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase of mutants npe5 and npe10, and restored penicillin production to mutant npe5. A protein of about 250 kDa was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of cell-free extracts of complemented strains that was absent in the npe5 and npe10 mutants but exists in the parental strain from which the mutants were obtained. Transcriptional mapping studies showed the presence of one long transcript of about 11.5 kilobases that hybridized with several probes internal to the pcbAB gene, and two small transcripts of 1.15 kilobases that hybridized with the pcbC or the penDE gene, respectively. The transcription initiation and termination regions of the pcbAB gene were mapped by hybridization with several small probes. The region has been completely sequenced. It includes an open reading frame of 11,376 nucleotides that encodes a protein with a deduced Mr of 425,971. Three repeated dominia were found in the alpha-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valine synthetase which have high homology with the gramicidin synthetase I and tyrocidine synthetase I. The pcbAB is linked to the pcbC and penDE genes and is transcribed in the opposite orientation to them.	1
Title: Complexity generation in fungal peptidyl alkaloid biosynthesis: oxidation of fumiquinazoline A to the heptacyclic hemiaminal fumiquinazoline C by the flavoenzyme Af12070 from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus makes a series of fumiquinazoline (FQ) peptidyl alkaloids of increasing scaffold complexity using L-Trp, 2 equiv of L-Ala, and the non-proteinogenic amino acid anthranilate as building blocks. The FQ gene cluster encodes two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and two flavoproteins. The trimodular NRPS Af12080 assembles FQF (the first level of complexity) while the next two enzymes, Af12060 and Af12050, act in tandem in an oxidative annulation sequence to couple alanine to the indole side chain of FQF to yield the imidazolindolone-containing FQA. In this study we show that the fourth enzyme, the monocovalent flavoprotein Af12070, introduces a third layer of scaffold complexity by converting FQA to the spirohemiaminal FQC, presumably by catalyzing the formation of a transient imine within the pyrazinone ring (and therefore acting in an unprecedented manner as an FAD-dependent amide oxidase). FQC subsequently converts nonenzymatically to the known cyclic aminal FQD. We also investigated the effect of substrate structure on Af12070 activity and subsequent cyclization with a variety of FQA analogues, including an FQA diastereomer (2'-epi-FQA), which is an intermediate in the fungal biosynthesis of the tremorgenic tryptoquialanine. 2'-epi-FQA is processed by Af12070 to epi-FQD, not epi-FQC, illustrating that the delicate balance in product cyclization regiochemistry can be perturbed by a remote stereochemical center.	1
Title: Nannocystin A: an Elongation Factor 1 Inhibitor from Myxobacteria with Differential Anti-Cancer Properties Abstract: Cultivation of myxobacteria of the Nannocystis genus led to the isolation and structure elucidation of a class of novel cyclic lactone inhibitors of elongation factor 1. Whole genome sequence analysis and annotation enabled identification of the putative biosynthetic cluster and synthesis process. In biological assays the compounds displayed anti-fungal and cytotoxic activity. Combined genetic and proteomic approaches identified the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) as the primary target for this compound class. Nannocystin A (1) displayed differential activity across various cancer cell lines and EEF1A1 expression levels appear to be the main differentiating factor. Biochemical and genetic evidence support an overlapping binding site of 1 with the anti-cancer compound didemnin B on EF-1α. This myxobacterial chemotype thus offers an interesting starting point for further investigations of the potential of therapeutics targeting elongation factor 1.	1
Title: Non-enzymatic pyridine ring formation in the biosynthesis of the rubrolone tropolone alkaloids Abstract: The pyridine ring is a potent pharmacophore in alkaloid natural products. Nonetheless, its biosynthetic pathways are poorly understood. Rubrolones A and B are tropolone alkaloid natural products possessing a unique tetra-substituted pyridine moiety. Here, we report the gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic pathway for rubrolones, identifying a key intermediate that accumulates upon inactivation of sugar biosynthetic genes. Critically, this intermediate was converted to the aglycones of rubrolones by non-enzymatic condensation and cyclization with either ammonia or anthranilic acid to generate the respective pyridine rings. We propose that this non-enzymatic reaction occurs via hydrolysis of the key intermediate, which possesses a 1,5-dione moiety as an amine acceptor capable of cyclization. This study suggests that 1,5-dione moieties may represent a general strategy for pyridine ring biosynthesis, and more broadly highlights the utility of non-enzymatic diversification for exploring and expanding natural product chemical space.	1
Title: Sequence-universal recognition of duplex DNA by oligonucleotides via pseudocomplementarity and helix invasion Abstract: The well-known Watson-Crick complementarity rules, which were discovered 50 years ago, elegantly direct the specific pairing of two DNA single strands. On the contrary, once formed, the double-stranded (ds) DNA lacks such a simple and sequence-universal recognition principle, since most of the characteristic chemical groups of nucleobases are now buried deep inside the double helix, the major DNA form. We report a promising versatile approach for highly selective recognition of designated sites within dsDNA featuring considerable practical potential for a variety of molecular-biological, biotechnological, gene-therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. It may also have implications for prebiotic evolution of genetic machinery at the primordial stages of the origin of life. Our design synergistically employs the robust helix-invasion ability of recently developed DNA mimics and analogs, pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acids and pseudocomplementary oligonucleotides, thus enabling the sequence-unrestricted recognition of chosen DNA duplexes by nucleobase oligomers. Using this basically general approach, we selectively tagged a unique mixed-base site on the target dsDNA fragment with streptavidin and/or multiply labeled this site with fluorophores via the primer-extension reaction.	0
Title: Functional Analyses of the Diels-Alderase Gene sol5 of Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani Indicate that the Solanapyrone Phytotoxins Are Not Required for Pathogenicity Abstract: Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani, the causal agents of Ascochyta blight of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and early blight of potato (Solanum tuberosum), respectively, produce a set of phytotoxic compounds including solanapyrones A, B, and C. Although both the phytotoxicity of solanapyrones and their universal production among field isolates have been documented, the role of solanapyrones in pathogenicity is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the sol5 gene, which encodes a Diels-Alderase that catalyzes the final step of solanapyrone biosynthesis. Deletion of sol5 in both Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani completely prevented production of solanapyrones and led to accumulation of the immediate precursor compound, prosolanapyrone II-diol, which is not toxic to plants. Deletion of sol5 did not negatively affect growth rate or spore production in vitro, and led to overexpression of the other solanapyrone biosynthesis genes, suggesting a possible feedback regulation mechanism. Phytotoxicity tests showed that solanapyrone A is highly toxic to several legume species and Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite the apparent phytotoxicity of solanapyrone A, pathogenicity tests showed that solanapyrone-minus mutants of Ascochyta rabiei and Alternaria solani were equally virulent as their corresponding wild-type progenitors, suggesting that solanapyrones are not required for pathogenicity.	1
Title: tRNA overexpression rescues peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in tRNA synthetase Abstract: Heterozygous mutations in six transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase genes cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy. CMT mutant tRNA synthetases inhibit protein synthesis by an unknown mechanism. We found that CMT mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases bound tRNAGly but failed to release it, resulting in tRNAGly sequestration. This sequestration potentially depleted the cellular tRNAGly pool, leading to insufficient glycyl-tRNAGly supply to the ribosome. Accordingly, we found ribosome stalling at glycine codons and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in affected motor neurons. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of tRNAGly rescued protein synthesis, peripheral neuropathy, and ISR activation in Drosophila and mouse CMT disease type 2D (CMT2D) models. Conversely, inactivation of the ribosome rescue factor GTPBP2 exacerbated peripheral neuropathy. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for CMT2D, and elevating tRNAGly levels may thus have therapeutic potential.	0
Title: Glycerol kinase, the pacemaker for the dissimilation of glycerol in Escherichia coli Abstract: The activity of glycerol kinase is rate-limiting in the metabolism of glycerol by cells of Escherichia coli. A mutant strain producing a glycerol kinase resistant to inhibition by fructose-1,6-diphosphate grows faster than its wild-type parent on glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy. The amount of intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate was determined for wild-type cells growing exponentially on glycerol. The water content of such cells was also determined, allowing calculation of the intracellular concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. This value, 1.7 mm, is adequate to exert substantial inhibition on the wild-type glycerol kinase. The desensitization of glycerol kinase to feedback inhibition also enhances the power of glycerol to exert catabolite repression, both on the enzymes of the glycerol system itself and on those of the lactose system. However, desensitization of glycerol kinase alone does not eliminate the phenomenon of diauxic growth in a glucose-glycerol medium. Biphasic growth in such a medium is abolished if the altered enzyme is produced constitutively. The constitutive production of the mutant kinase at high levels, however, renders the cells vulnerable to glycerol. Thus, when the cells have been grown on a carbon source with a low power for catabolite repression, e.g., succinate, sudden exposure to glycerol leads to overconsumption of the nutrient and cell death.	0
Title: Class IV Lasso Peptides Synergistically Induce Proliferation of Cancer Cells and Sensitize Them to Doxorubicin Abstract: Heterologous expression of a biosynthesis gene cluster from Amycolatopsis sp. resulted in the discovery of two unique class IV lasso peptides, felipeptins A1 and A2. A mixture of felipeptins stimulated proliferation of cancer cells, while having no such effect on the normal cells. Detailed investigation revealed, that pre-treatment of cancer cells with a mixture of felipeptins resulted in downregulation of the tumor suppressor Rb, making the cancer cells to proliferate faster. Pre-treatment with felipeptins made cancer cells considerably more sensitive to the anticancer agent doxorubicin and re-sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to this drug. Structural characterization and binding experiments showed an interaction between felipeptins resulting in complex formation, which explains their synergistic effect. This discovery may open an alternative avenue in cancer treatment, helping to eliminate quiescent cells that often lead to cancer relapse.	1
Title: Sulfopeptide probes of the CXCR4/CXCL12 interface reveal oligomer-specific contacts and chemokine allostery Abstract: Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification that enhances protein-protein interactions and may identify druggable sites in the extracellular space. The G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 is a prototypical example with three potential sulfation sites at positions 7, 12, and 21. Each receptor sulfotyrosine participates in specific contacts with its chemokine ligand in the structure of a soluble, dimeric CXCL12:CXCR4(1-38) complex, but their relative importance for CXCR4 binding and activation by the monomeric chemokine remains undefined. NMR titrations with short sulfopeptides showed that the tyrosine motifs of CXCR4 varied widely in their contributions to CXCL12 binding affinity and site specificity. Whereas the Tyr21 sulfopeptide bound the same site as in previously solved structures, the Tyr7 and Tyr12 sulfopeptides interacted nonspecifically. Surprisingly, the unsulfated Tyr7 peptide occupied a hydrophobic site on the CXCL12 monomer that is inaccessible in the CXCL12 dimer. Functional analysis of CXCR4 mutants validated the relative importance of individual CXCR4 sulfotyrosine modifications (Tyr21 > Tyr12 > Tyr7) for CXCL12 binding and receptor activation. Biophysical measurements also revealed a cooperative relationship between sulfopeptide binding at the Tyr21 site and CXCL12 dimerization, the first example of allosteric behavior in a chemokine. Future ligands that occupy the sTyr21 recognition site may act as both competitive inhibitors of receptor binding and allosteric modulators of chemokine function. Together, our data suggests that sulfation does not ubiquitously enhance complex affinity and that distinct patterns of tyrosine sulfation could encode oligomer selectivity, implying another layer of regulation for chemokine signaling.	0
Title: Analysis of the Substrate Specificity of the SMYD2 Protein Lysine Methyltransferase and Discovery of Novel Non-Histone Substrates Abstract: The SMYD2 protein lysine methyltransferase methylates various histone and non-histone proteins and is overexpressed in several cancers. Using peptide arrays, we investigated the substrate specificity of the enzyme, revealing a recognition of leucine (or weaker phenylalanine) at the -1 peptide site and disfavor of acidic residues at the +1 to +3 sites. Using this motif, novel SMYD2 peptide substrates were identified, leading to the discovery of 32 novel peptide substrates with a validated target site. Among them, 19 were previously reported to be methylated at the target lysine in human cells, strongly suggesting that SMYD2 is the protein lysine methyltransferase responsible for this activity. Methylation of some of the novel peptide substrates was tested at the protein level, leading to the identification of 14 novel protein substrates of SMYD2, six of which were more strongly methylated than p53, the best SMYD2 substrate described so far. The novel SMYD2 substrate proteins are involved in diverse biological processes such as chromatin regulation, transcription, and intracellular signaling. The results of our study provide a fundament for future investigations into the role of this important enzyme in normal development and cancer.	0
Title: A Phosphinate-Containing Fluorophore Capable of Selectively Inducing Apoptosis in Cancer Cells Abstract: Chemotherapeutic agents generally suffer from off-target cytotoxicity in noncancerous cell types, leading to undesired side effects. As a result, significant effort has been put into identifying compounds that are selective for cancerous over noncancerous cell types. Our laboratory has recently developed a series of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores containing a phosphinate functionality at the bridging position of a xanthene scaffold, termed Nebraska Red (NR) fluorophores. Herein, we report the selective cytotoxicity of one NR derivative, NR744 , against HeLa (cervical cancer) cells versus NIH-3T3 (noncancerous fibroblast) cells. Mechanistic studies based on the NIR fluorescence signal of NR744 showed distinct subcellular localization in HeLa (mitochondrial) versus NIH-3T3 (lysosomal) that resulted from the elevated mitochondrial potential in HeLa cells. This study provides a new, NIR scaffold for the further development of reagents for targeted cancer therapy.	0
Title: Structural and functional analysis of the gene cluster encoding the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of Lactobacillus sake Abstract: Lactobacillus sake can use arginine via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. We designed degenerate primers based on an alignment of known sequences of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)-encoding genes in order to amplify the L. sake counterpart sequences by PCR. Screening a genomic library of L. sake in lambdaEMBL3 allowed us to isolate a clone containing a 10-kb L. sake genomic DNA insert. Sequence analysis revealed that the genes involved in arginine catabolism were clustered and encoded ADI (arcA), OTC (arcB), carbamate kinase (arcC), and a putative carrier with high similarity to the arginine/ornithine antiporter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (arcD). Additionally, a putative transaminase-encoding gene (arcT) was located in this region. The genes followed the order arcA arcB arcC arcT arcD, which differs from that found in other microorganisms. arcA, arcB, arcC, and arcD mutants were constructed, and the ADI pathway was impaired in all of them. Transcriptional studies indicated that arcA gene is subject to catabolite repression, and under the conditions used, several transcripts could be detected, suggesting the existence of different initiation sites or processing of a larger mRNA.	0
Title: Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster in rice for momilactones Abstract: Rice diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor and in rice leaves irradiated with UV light. The common substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate is converted into diterpene hydrocarbon precursors via a two-step sequential cyclization and then into the bioactive phytoalexins via several oxidation steps. It has been suggested that microsomal cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s) are involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons leading to the phytoalexins and that a dehydrogenase is involved in momilactone biosynthesis. However, none of the enzymes involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons have been identified. In this study, we found that a putative dehydrogenase gene (AK103462) and two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3) form a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV-inducible gene cluster, together with OsKS4 and OsCyc1, the diterpene cyclase genes involved in momilactone biosynthesis. Functional analysis by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli followed by enzyme assays demonstrated that the AK103462 protein catalyzes the conversion of 3beta-hydroxy-9betaH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6beta-olide into momilactone A. The double knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 specifically suppressed the elicitor-inducible production of momilactones, strongly suggesting that CYP99A2, CYP99A3, or both are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. These results provide strong evidence for the presence on chromosome 4 of a gene cluster involved in momilactone biosynthesis.	1
Title: A multifunctional ATP-binding cassette transporter system from Vibrio cholerae transports vibriobactin and enterobactin Abstract: Vibrio cholerae uses the catechol siderophore vibriobactin for iron transport under iron-limiting conditions. We have identified genes for vibriobactin transport and mapped them within the vibriobactin biosynthetic gene cluster. Within this genetic region we have identified four genes, viuP, viuD, viuG and viuC, whose protein products have homology to the periplasmic binding protein, the two integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins, and the ATPase component, respectively, of other iron transport systems. The amino-terminal region of ViuP has homology to a lipoprotein signal sequence, and ViuP could be labeled with [(3)H]palmitic acid. This suggests that ViuP is a membrane lipoprotein. The ViuPDGC system transports both vibriobactin and enterobactin in Escherichia coli. In the same assay, the E. coli enterobactin transport system, FepBDGC, allowed the utilization of enterobactin but not vibriobactin. Although the entire viuPDGC system could complement mutations in fepB, fepD, fepG, or fepC, only viuC was able to independently complement the corresponding fep mutation. This indicates that these proteins usually function as a complex. V. cholerae strains carrying a mutation in viuP or in viuG were constructed by marker exchange. These mutations reduced, but did not completely eliminate, vibriobactin utilization. This suggests that V. cholerae contains genes in addition to viuPDGC that function in the transport of catechol siderophores.	1
Title: Synergistic antibacterial and antibiotic effects of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids on clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Abstract: The antibacterial activity of two bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, tetrandrine (Tet) and demethyltetrandrine (d-Tet), alone and in combination with the antibiotics ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), cefazolin (CFZ) and levofloxacin (LEV) against 10 clinical isolates of staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) III type methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was studied. Susceptibility to each agent alone was tested using a broth microdilution method. The chequerboard and time-kill tests were used for the combined evaluations. The minimal inhibitory concentrations/minimal bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs, μg/mL) ranges alone were 64-128/256-1,024 for both Tet and d-Tet. Significant synergies against 90% of the isolates were observed for the Tet/CFZ combination, with their MICs being reduced by 75-94% [fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) ranged from 0.188 to 0.625], respectively. An additive bactericidal result was also observed for the Tet (d-Tet)/CFZ combination in the time-kill experiments. These results demonstrated that Tet and d-Tet enhanced the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of CFZ. Their potential for combinatory therapy of patients infected with MRSA warrants further pharmacological investigation.	0
Title: Inhibition of heat shock transcription factor binding by a linear polyamide binding in an unusual 1:1 mode Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to protect cells from heat, oxidative stress, and the cytotoxic effects of drugs, and thus can enhance cancer cell survival. As a result, HSPs are a newly emerging class of protein targets for chemotherapy. Among the various HSPs, the HSP70 family is the most highly conserved and prevalent. Herein we describe the development of a β-alanine rich linear polyamide that binds the GGA heat shock elements (HSEs) 3 and 4 in the HSP70 promoter in an unusual 1:1 mode and inhibits heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) binding in vitro.	0
Title: The heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 of Cryptococcus neoformans is associated with the fungal cell surface and influences the interaction between yeast and host cells Abstract: The pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans secretes numerous proteins, such as heat shock proteins, by unconventional mechanisms during its interaction with host cells. Hsp70 is a conserved chaperone that plays important roles in various cellular processes, including the interaction of fungi with host immune cells. Here, we report that sera from individuals with cryptococcosis infection recognize a recombinant C. neoformans Hsp70 (Cn_rHsp70). Moreover, immunofluorescence assays using antibodies against Cn_rHsp70 revealed the localization of this protein at the cell surface mainly in association with the capsular network. We found that the addition of Cn_rHsp70 positively modulated the interaction of C. neoformans with human alveolar epithelial cells and decreased fungal killing by mouse macrophages, without affecting phagocytosis rates. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that there was a competitive association among the receptor, GXM and Cn_rHsp70, indicating that the Hsp70-binding sites in host cells appear to be shared by glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major capsular antigen in C. neoformans. Our observations suggest additional mechanisms by which Hsp70 influences the interaction of C. neoformans with host cells.	0
Title: Generation of complexity in fungal terpene biosynthesis: discovery of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 in the fumagillin pathway Abstract: Fumagillin (1), a meroterpenoid from Aspergillus fumigatus, is known for its antiangiogenic activity due to binding to human methionine aminopeptidase 2. 1 has a highly oxygenated structure containing a penta-substituted cyclohexane that is generated by oxidative cleavage of the bicyclic sesquiterpene β-trans-bergamotene. The chemical nature, order, and biochemical mechanism of all the oxygenative tailoring reactions has remained enigmatic despite the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the use of targeted-gene deletion experiments. Here, we report the identification and characterization of three oxygenases from the fumagillin biosynthetic pathway, including a multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, a hydroxylating nonheme-iron-dependent dioxygenase, and an ABM family monooxygenase for oxidative cleavage of the polyketide moiety. Most significantly, the P450 monooxygenase is shown to catalyze successive hydroxylation, bicyclic ring-opening, and two epoxidations that generate the sesquiterpenoid core skeleton of 1. We also characterized a truncated polyketide synthase with a ketoreductase function that controls the configuration at C-5 of hydroxylated intermediates.	1
Title: Expanding the repertoire of glycosynthases Abstract: As reported in this issue, Moracci and coworkers have now expanded the glycosynthase concept to two retaining alpha-L-fucosidases. The newly generated alpha-fucosynthases can use beta-L-fucosyl azide as donors for transglycosylation, enabling the synthesis of fucose-containing oligosaccharides.	0
Title: New cell-cell adhesion inhibitors from Streptomyces sp. UMA-044 Abstract: Three compounds, NP25301 (1), NP25302 (2) and bohemamine (3), inhibitors of cell adhesion based on LFA-1/ICAM-1, were isolated from the cultured broth of the strain Streptomyces sp. UMA-044. New compounds 1 and 2 were identified as 2-(3'-carbamoylphenoxy)acrylic acid methyl ester and deoxybohemamine, respectively, based on spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1 approximately 3 inhibited adhesion of HL-60 cells to CHO-ICAM-1 cells at IC50 values of 29.5 microg/ml for 1, 24.3 microg/ml for 2, and 27.2 microg/ml for 3.	0
Title: Regulation of the hepatic synthesis of C1 inhibitor by the hepatocyte stimulating factors interleukin 6 and interferon gamma Abstract: C1 inhibitor (C1INH), the major plasma inhibitor of activated C1, kallikrein, and activated Hageman factor, may be an important factor in limiting inflammatory injury mediated by the complement and contact systems. C1INH is thought to be synthesized primarily in the liver; however, the regulators of hepatic C1 inhibitor synthesis are completely unknown. In this report, we analyze the regulation of C1INH synthesis by hepatocyte stimulating factors in human hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. Interleukin-6 and interferon gamma increase C1INH production in both hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. These cytokines stimulate de novo synthesis of functional C1INH, acting at a pretranslational level as assessed by Northern blotting. The stimulatory effects of interleukin-6 and interferon gamma on C1INH synthesis are separate and are differentially modulated by interleukin-1. These results establish that hepatic C1INH synthesis is regulated by hepatocyte stimulating factors and reveal novel interactions between these factors.	0
Title: Ionic liquid-tolerant microorganisms and microbial communities for lignocellulose conversion to bioproducts Abstract: Chemical and physical pretreatment of biomass is a critical step in the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels and bioproducts. Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment has attracted significant attention due to the unique ability of certain ILs to solubilize some or all components of the plant cell wall. However, these ILs inhibit not only the enzyme activities but also the growth and productivity of microorganisms used in downstream hydrolysis and fermentation processes. While pretreated biomass can be washed to remove residual IL and reduce inhibition, extensive washing is costly and not feasible in large-scale processes. IL-tolerant microorganisms and microbial communities have been discovered from environmental samples and studies begun to elucidate mechanisms of IL tolerance. The discovery of IL tolerance in environmental microbial communities and individual microbes has lead to the proposal of molecular mechanisms of resistance. In this article, we review recent progress on discovering IL-tolerant microorganisms, identifying metabolic pathways and mechanisms of tolerance, and engineering microorganisms for IL tolerance. Research in these areas will yield new approaches to overcome inhibition in lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion processes and increase opportunities for the use of ILs in biomass pretreatment.	0
Title: Two surfaces on the histone chaperone Rtt106 mediate histone binding, replication, and silencing Abstract: The histone chaperone Rtt106 binds histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3K56ac) and facilitates nucleosome assembly during several molecular processes. Both the structural basis of this modification-specific recognition and how this recognition informs Rtt106 function are presently unclear. Guided by our crystal structure of Rtt106, we identified two regions on its double-pleckstrin homology domain architecture that mediated histone binding. When histone binding was compromised, Rtt106 localized properly to chromatin but failed to deliver H3K56ac, leading to replication and silencing defects. By mutating analogous regions in the structurally homologous chromatin-reorganizer Pob3, we revealed a conserved histone-binding function for a basic patch found on both proteins. In contrast, a loop connecting two β-strands was required for histone binding by Rtt106 but was dispensable for Pob3 function. Unlike Rtt106, Pob3 histone binding was modification-independent, implicating the loop of Rtt106 in H3K56ac-specific recognition in vivo. Our studies described the structural origins of Rtt106 function, identified a conserved histone-binding surface, and defined a critical role for Rtt106:H3K56ac-binding specificity in silencing and replication-coupled nucleosome turnover.	0
Title: An Iterative Module in the Azalomycin F Polyketide Synthase Contains a Switchable Enoylreductase Domain Abstract: Detailed analysis of the modular Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the marginolactone azalomycin F in mangrove Streptomyces sp. 211726 has shown that only nineteen extension modules are required to accomplish twenty cycles of polyketide chain elongation. Analysis of the products of a PKS mutant specifically inactivated in the dehydratase domain of extension-module 1 showed that this module catalyzes two successive elongations with different outcomes. Strikingly, the enoylreductase domain of this module can apparently be "toggled" off and on : it functions in only the second of these two cycles. This novel mechanism expands our understanding of PKS assembly-line catalysis and may explain examples of apparent non-colinearity in other modular PKS systems.	1
Title: Orthologous peramine and pyrrolopyrazine-producing biosynthetic gene clusters in Metarhizium rileyi, Metarhizium majus and Cladonia grayi Abstract: Peramine is a non-ribosomal peptide-derived pyrrolopyrazine (PPZ)-containing molecule with anti-insect properties. Peramine is known to be produced by fungi from genus Epichloë, which form mutualistic endophytic associations with cool-season grass hosts. Peramine biosynthesis has been proposed to require only the two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) peramine synthetase (PerA), which is encoded by the 8.3 kb gene perA, though this has not been conclusively proven. Until recently, both peramine and perA were thought to be exclusive to fungi of genus Epichloë; however, a putative perA homologue was recently identified in the genome of the insect-pathogenic fungus Metarhizium rileyi. We use a heterologous expression system and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography-based analysis method to confirm that PerA is the only pathway-specific protein required for peramine biosynthesis. The perA homologue from M. rileyi (MR_perA) is shown to encode a functional peramine synthetase, establishing a precedent for distribution of perA orthologs beyond genus Epichloë. Furthermore, perA is part of a larger seven-gene PPZ cluster in M. rileyi, Metarhizium majus and the stalked-cup lichen fungus Cladonia grayi. These PPZ genes encode proteins predicted to derivatize peramine into more complex PPZ metabolites, with the orphaned perA gene of Epichloë spp. representing an example of reductive evolution.	1
Title: Xanthan gum biosynthesis and application: a biochemical/genetic perspective Abstract: Xanthan gum is a complex exopolysaccharide produced by the plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. It consists of D-glucosyl, D-mannosyl, and D-glucuronyl acid residues in a molar ratio of 2:2:1 and variable proportions of O-acetyl and pyruvyl residues. Because of its physical properties, it is widely used as a thickener or viscosifier in both food and non-food industries. Xanthan gum is also used as a stabilizer for a wide variety of suspensions, emulsions, and foams. This article outlines aspects of the biochemical assembly and genetic loci involved in its biosynthesis, including the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide substrates, the building and decoration of the pentasaccharide subunit, and the polymerization and secretion of the polymer. An overview of the applications and industrial production of xanthan is also covered.	1
Title: Circular and linear plasmids of Lyme disease spirochetes have extensive homology: characterization of a repeated DNA element Abstract: We have cloned three copies of a repeated DNA segment from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31, present on both circular and linear plasmids of this and other B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains. The DNA sequences are characterized by a highly homologous segment containing two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF-A and ORF-B. Five additional ORFs can be found on the slightly less homologous flanking sequences: ORF-G on the opposite strand upstream of ORF-A, and ORF-C, ORF-D, ORF-E, and ORF-F downstream of ORF-B. The 4.6-kb-long element containing ORF-A through ORF-E is flanked by approximately 180-bp-long imperfect inverted repeats (IRs). The putative gene product of ORF-C displays homology to proteins involved in plasmid maintenance in a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ORF-E features several short, highly homologous direct repeats. ORF-A, ORF-B, and ORF-D are homologous to three ORFs on a recently described 8.3-kb circular plasmid of Borrelia afzelii Ip21 that are flanked by similar IRs (J. J. Dunn, S. R. Buchstein, L.-L. Butler, S. Fisenne, D. S. Polin, B. N. Lade, and B. J. Luft, J. Bacteriol. 176:2706-2717,1994). ORF-C and ORF-E, however, are missing from this region on the Ip21 plasmid. Furthermore, the repeated DNA element as defined by the IRs is present in opposite orientations relative to the flanking sequences on the B31 and Ip21 plasmids.	0
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and an additional gene for resistance to the antituberculosis drug capreomycin Abstract: Capreomycin (CMN) belongs to the tuberactinomycin family of nonribosomal peptide antibiotics that are essential components of the drug arsenal for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Members of this antibiotic family target the ribosomes of sensitive bacteria and disrupt the function of both subunits of the ribosome. Resistance to these antibiotics in Mycobacterium species arises due to mutations in the genes coding for the 16S or 23S rRNA but can also arise due to mutations in a gene coding for an rRNA-modifying enzyme, TlyA. While Mycobacterium species develop resistance due to alterations in the drug target, it has been proposed that the CMN-producing bacterium, Saccharothrix mutabilis subsp. capreolus, uses CMN modification as a mechanism for resistance rather than ribosome modification. To better understand CMN biosynthesis and resistance in S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus, we focused on the identification of the CMN biosynthetic gene cluster in this bacterium. Here, we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of the CMN biosynthetic gene cluster from S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus ATCC 23892. We provide evidence for the heterologous production of CMN in the genetically tractable bacterium Streptomyces lividans 1326. Finally, we present data supporting the existence of an additional CMN resistance gene. Initial work suggests that this resistance gene codes for an rRNA-modifying enzyme that results in the formation of CMN-resistant ribosomes that are also resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin. Thus, S. mutabilis subsp. capreolus may also use ribosome modification as a mechanism for CMN resistance.	1
Title: Adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) is recruited by the HEATR5 protein Laa1 and its co-factor Laa2 in yeast Abstract: Cellular membrane trafficking mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) is important for the proper composition and function of organelles of the endolysosomal system. Normal AP-1 function requires proteins of the HEAT repeat-containing 5 (HEATR5) family. Although HEATR5 proteins were first identified based on their ability to interact with AP-1, the functional significance of this interaction was unknown. We used bioinformatics-based phenotypic profiling and information from genome-wide fluorescence microscopy studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify a protein, Laa2, that mediates the interaction between AP-1 and the yeast HEATR5 protein Laa1. Further characterization of Laa2 revealed that it binds to both Laa1 and AP-1. Laa2 contains a motif similar to the characterized γ-ear-binding sites found in other AP-1-binding proteins. This motif in Laa2 is essential for the Laa1-AP-1 interaction. Moreover, mutation of this motif disrupted AP-1 localization and function and caused effects similar to mutations that remove the γ-ear of AP-1. These results indicate that Laa2 mediates the interaction between Laa1 and AP-1 and reveal that this interaction promotes the stable association of AP-1 with membranes in yeast.	0
Title: Identification and activation of novel biosynthetic gene clusters by genome mining in the kirromycin producer Streptomyces collinus Tü 365 Abstract: Streptomycetes are prolific sources of novel biologically active secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical potential. S. collinus Tü 365 is a Streptomyces strain, isolated 1972 from Kouroussa (Guinea). It is best known as producer of the antibiotic kirromycin, an inhibitor of the protein biosynthesis interacting with elongation factor EF-Tu. Genome Mining revealed 32 gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of diverse secondary metabolites in the genome of Streptomyces collinus Tü 365, indicating an enormous biosynthetic potential of this strain. The structural diversity of secondary metabolisms predicted for S. collinus Tü 365 includes PKS, NRPS, PKS-NRPS hybrids, a lanthipeptide, terpenes and siderophores. While some of these gene clusters were found to contain genes related to known secondary metabolites, which also could be detected in HPLC-MS analyses, most of the uncharacterized gene clusters are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. With this study we aimed to characterize the genome information of S. collinus Tü 365 to make use of gene clusters, which previously have not been described for this strain. We were able to connect the gene clusters of a lanthipeptide, a carotenoid, five terpenoid compounds, an ectoine, a siderophore and a spore pigment-associated gene cluster to their respective biosynthesis products.	1
Title: Visualization of alpha9 acetylcholine receptor expression in hair cells of transgenic mice containing a modified bacterial artificial chromosome Abstract: The alpha9 acetylcholine receptor (alpha9 AChR) is specifically expressed in hair cells of the inner ear and is believed to be involved in synaptic transmission between efferent nerves and hair cells. Using a recently developed method, we modified a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the mouse alpha9 AChR gene with a reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate transgenic mice. GFP expression in transgenic mice recapitulated the known temporal and spatial expression of alpha9 AChR. However, we observed previously unidentified dynamic changes in alpha9 AChR expression in cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia during neonatal development. In the cochlea, inner hair cells persistently expressed high levels of alpha9 AChR in both the apical and middle turns, whereas both outer and inner hair cells displayed dynamic changes of alpha9 AChR expression in the basal turn. In the utricle, we observed high levels of alpha9 AChR expression in the striolar region during early neonatal development and high levels of alpha9 AChR in the extrastriolar region in adult mice. Further, simultaneous visualization of efferent innervation and alpha9 AChR expression showed that dynamic expression of alpha9 AChR in developing hair cells was independent of efferent contacts. We propose that alpha9 AChR expression in developing auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia correlates with maturation of hair cells and is hair-cell autonomous.	0
Title: Inhibition of replication of hepatitis B virus by cytallene in vitro Abstract: The acyclic cytosine nucleoside analog cytallene [1-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)cytosine], which has both (+)- and (-)-enantiomers, was evaluated for its anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in 2.2.15 cells and was found to have potent activity against HBV DNA synthesis. The R-(-)-enantiomer was found to be the more active of the cytallene enantiomers, with a 50% inhibition concentration against HBV synthesis (HBIC50) of 0.08 microM. Its antiviral activity could be reversed by deoxycytidine (dC) and less efficiently by cytidine. Upon removal of the R-(-)-enantiomer from culture medium, the synthesis of HBV DNA could reinitiate, which suggested that the antiviral action is reversible. The R-(-)-enantiomer was also found to be more cytotoxic than the S-(+)-enantiomer. The degree of cytotoxicity varied among the cell lines, with a 50% inhibition of cell growth at greater than 10 microM. The R-(-)-enantiomer had no effect on HBV RNA synthesis and mitochondrial DNA synthesis at a concentration of 10 times or more than the HBIC50. The two enantiomers cannot be deaminated by dC deaminase, and they can be phosphorylated by cytoplasmic dC kinase. The R-(-)-enantiomer of cytallene is the first acyclic cytosine analog with potent inhibitory activity against HBV similar to those of other L-(-)-ddC analogs.	0
Title: The surface protein Shr of Streptococcus pyogenes binds heme and transfers it to the streptococcal heme-binding protein Shp Abstract: Background:                       The heme acquisition machinery in Streptococcus pyogenes is believed to consist of the surface proteins, Shr and Shp, and heme-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter HtsABC. Shp has been shown to rapidly transfer its heme to the lipoprotein component, HtsA, of HtsABC. The function of Shr and the heme source of Shp have not been established.                  Results:                       The objective of this study was to determine whether Shr binds heme and is a heme source of Shp. To achieve the objective, recombinant Shr protein was prepared. The purified Shr displays a spectrum typical of hemoproteins, indicating that Shr binds heme and acquires heme from Escherichia coli hemoproteins in vivo. Spectral analysis of Shr and Shp isolated from a mixture of Shr and heme-free Shp (apoShp) indicates that Shr and apoShp lost and gained heme, respectively; whereas Shr did not efficiently lose its heme in incubation with apoHtsA under the identical conditions. These results suggest that Shr directly transfers its heme to Shp. In addition, the rates of heme transfer from human hemoglobin to apoShp are close to those of simple ferric heme dissociation from hemoglobin, suggesting that methemoglobin does not directly transfer its heme to apoShp.                  Conclusion:                       We have demonstrated that recombinant Shr can acquire heme from E. coli hemoproteins in vivo and appears to directly transfer its heme to Shp and that Shp appears not to directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin. These results suggest the possibility that Shr is a source of heme for Shp and that the Shr-to-Shp heme transfer is a step of the heme acquisition process in S. pyogenes. Further characterization of the Shr/Shp/HtsA system would advance our understanding of the mechanism of heme acquisition in S. pyogenes.	0
Title: Investigation of a 6-MSA Synthase Gene Cluster in Aspergillus aculeatus Reveals 6-MSA-derived Aculinic Acid, Aculins A-B and Epi-Aculin A Abstract: Aspergillus aculeatus, a filamentous fungus belonging to the Aspergillus clade Nigri, is an industrial workhorse in enzyme production. Recently we reported a number of secondary metabolites from this fungus; however, its genetic potential for the production of secondary metabolites is vast. In this study we identified a 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthase from A. aculeatus, and verified its functionality by episomal expression in A. aculeatus and heterologous expression in A. nidulans. Feeding studies with fully (13) C-labeled 6-MSA revealed that 6-MSA is incorporated into aculinic acid, which further incorporates into three compounds that we name aculins A and B, and epi-aculin A, described here for the first time. Based on NMR data and bioinformatic studies we propose the structures of the compounds as well as a biosynthetic pathway leading to formation of aculins from 6-MSA.	1
Title: Site-Specific Immobilization of the Peptidoglycan Synthase PBP1B on a Surface Plasmon Resonance Chip Surface Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is one of the most powerful label-free methods to determine the kinetic parameters of molecular interactions in real time and in a highly sensitive way. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes present in most bacteria. Established protocols to analyze interactions of PBPs by SPR involve immobilization to an ampicillin-coated chip surface (a β-lactam antibiotic mimicking its substrate), thereby forming a covalent complex with the PBPs transpeptidase (TP) active site. However, PBP interactions measured with a substrate-bound TP domain potentially affect interactions near the TPase active site. Furthermore, in vivo PBPs are anchored in the inner membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane helix, and hence immobilization at the C-terminal TPase domain gives an orientation contrary to the in vivo situation. We designed a new procedure: immobilization of PBP by copper-free click chemistry at an azide incorporated in the N terminus. In a proof-of-principle study, we immobilized Escherichia coli PBP1B on an SPR chip surface and used this for the analysis of the well-characterized interaction of PBP1B with LpoB. The site-specific incorporation of the azide affords control over protein orientation, thereby resulting in a homogeneous immobilization on the chip surface. This method can be used to study topology-dependent interactions of any (membrane) protein.	0
Title: Genome Mining for Sesterterpenes Using Bifunctional Terpene Synthases Reveals a Unified Intermediate of Di/Sesterterpenes Abstract: Genome mining is a promising method to discover novel secondary metabolites in the postgenomic era. We applied the Aspergillus oryzae heterologous expression system to functionally characterize cryptic bifunctional terpene synthase genes found in fungal genomes and identified the sesterfisherol synthase gene (NfSS) from Neosartorya fischeri. Sesterfisherol contains a characteristic 5-6-8-5 tetracyclic ring system and is modified by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (NfP450) to sesterfisheric acid. The cyclization mechanism was proposed on the basis of the analysis of in vivo and in vitro enzymatic reactions with isotopically labeled precursors. The mechanism involves C1 cation-olefin IV-olefin V cyclization followed by five hydride shifts, allowing us to propose a unified biogenesis for sesterterpenes branching from bicyclic (5-15), tricyclic (5-12-5), and tetracyclic (5-6-8-5) cation intermediates. Furthermore, the mechanism is distinct from that of a separate class of di/sesterterpenes including fusicoccins and ophiobolins. The difference between mechanisms is consistent with phylogenetic analysis of bifunctional terpene synthases, suggesting that the amino acid sequence reflects the initial cyclization mode, which is most likely related to the initial conformation of a linear prenyl diphosphate.	1
Title: Antitumor polyketide biosynthesis by an uncultivated bacterial symbiont of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei Abstract: Bacterial symbionts have long been suspected to be the true producers of many drug candidates isolated from marine invertebrates. Sponges, the most important marine source of biologically active natural products, have been frequently hypothesized to contain compounds of bacterial origin. This symbiont hypothesis, however, remained unproven because of a general inability to cultivate the suspected producers. However, we have recently identified an uncultured Pseudomonas sp. symbiont as the most likely producer of the defensive antitumor polyketide pederin in Paederus fuscipes beetles by cloning the putative biosynthesis genes. Here we report closely related genes isolated from the highly complex metagenome of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, which is the source of the onnamides and theopederins, a group of polyketides that structurally resemble pederin. Sequence features of the isolated genes clearly indicate that it belongs to a prokaryotic genome and should be responsible for the biosynthesis of almost the entire portion of the polyketide structure that is correlated with antitumor activity. Besides providing further proof for the role of the related beetle symbiont-derived genes, these findings raise intriguing ecological and evolutionary questions and have important general implications for the sustainable production of otherwise inaccessible marine drugs by using biotechnological strategies.	1
Title: Acyl transfer in clorobiocin biosynthesis: involvement of several proteins in the transfer of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar Abstract: Clorobiocin is an aminocoumarin antibiotic containing a pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety, attached through an ester bond to a deoxysugar. The pyrrole moiety is important for the binding of the antibiotic to its biological target, gyrase. The complete biosynthetic gene cluster for clorobiocin has been cloned and sequenced from the natural producer, Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12.976. In this study, the genes cloN1 and cloN7 were deleted separately from a cosmid containing the complete clorobiocin cluster. The modified cosmids were introduced into the genome of the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512 by using the integration functions of the PhiC31 phage. While a heterologous producer strain harbouring the intact clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster accumulated clorobiocin, the cloN1- and cloN7-defective integration mutants accumulated a clorobiocin derivative that lacked the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety, while also producing free pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid. The structures of these metabolites were confirmed by NMR and MS analysis. These results showed that CloN1 and CloN7, together with the previously investigated CloN2, are involved in the transfer of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar of clorobiocin. A possible mechanism for the role of these three proteins in the acyl-transfer process is suggested.	1
Title: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. V. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)-acetamido]-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-azetidinones having various functional groups at C-4 position of beta-lactam Abstract: The synthesis and antibacterial activity of the 3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-(O-substituted oxyimino)acetamido]-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-azetidinones++ + having various functional groups at C-4 position of beta-lactam are described. These compounds exhibited a strong activity against a variety of Gram-negative bacteria including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Among various C-4 substituents explored, the fluoromethyl and carbamoyloxymethyl moiety were found to increase the activity.	0
Title: Coupled growth and division of model protocell membranes Abstract: The generation of synthetic forms of cellular life requires solutions to the problem of how biological processes such as cyclic growth and division could emerge from purely physical and chemical systems. Small unilamellar fatty acid vesicles grow when fed with fatty acid micelles and can be forced to divide by extrusion, but this artificial division process results in significant loss of protocell contents during each division cycle. Here we describe a simple and efficient pathway for model protocell membrane growth and division. The growth of large multilamellar fatty acid vesicles fed with fatty acid micelles, in a solution where solute permeation across the membranes is slow, results in the transformation of initially spherical vesicles into long thread-like vesicles, a process driven by the transient imbalance between surface area and volume growth. Modest shear forces are then sufficient to cause the thread-like vesicles to divide into multiple daughter vesicles without loss of internal contents. In an environment of gentle shear, protocell growth and division are thus coupled processes. We show that model protocells can proceed through multiple cycles of reproduction. Encapsulated RNA molecules, representing a primitive genome, are distributed to the daughter vesicles. Our observations bring us closer to the laboratory synthesis of a complete protocell consisting of a self-replicating genome and a self-replicating membrane compartment. In addition, the robustness and simplicity of this pathway suggests that similar processes might have occurred under the prebiotic conditions of the early Earth.	0
Title: The ergot alkaloid gene cluster in Claviceps purpurea: extension of the cluster sequence and intra species evolution Abstract: The genomic region of Claviceps purpurea strain P1 containing the ergot alkaloid gene cluster [Tudzynski, P., Hölter, K., Correia, T., Arntz, C., Grammel, N., Keller, U., 1999. Evidence for an ergot alkaloid gene cluster in Claviceps purpurea. Mol. Gen. Genet. 261, 133-141] was explored by chromosome walking, and additional genes probably involved in the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis have been identified. The putative cluster sequence (extending over 68.5kb) contains 4 different nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and several putative oxidases. Northern analysis showed that most of the genes were co-regulated (repressed by high phosphate), and identified probable flanking genes by lack of co-regulation. Comparison of the cluster sequences of strain P1, an ergotamine producer, with that of strain ECC93, an ergocristine producer, showed high conservation of most of the cluster genes, but significant variation in the NRPS modules, strongly suggesting that evolution of these chemical races of C. purpurea is determined by evolution of NRPS module specificity.	1
Title: The Northern Route for Human dispersal in Central and Northeast Asia: New evidence from the site of Tolbor-16, Mongolia Abstract: The fossil record suggests that at least two major human dispersals occurred across the Eurasian steppe during the Late Pleistocene. Neanderthals and Modern Humans moved eastward into Central Asia, a region intermittently occupied by the enigmatic Denisovans. Genetic data indicates that the Denisovans interbred with Neanderthals near the Altai Mountains (South Siberia) but where and when they met H. sapiens is yet to be determined. Here we present archaeological evidence that document the timing and environmental context of a third long-distance population movement in Central Asia, during a temperate climatic event around 45,000 years ago. The early occurrence of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic, a techno-complex whose sudden appearance coincides with the first occurrence of H. sapiens in the Eurasian steppes, establishes an essential archaeological link between the Siberian Altai and Northwestern China . Such connection between regions provides empirical ground to discuss contacts between local and exogenous populations in Central and Northeast Asia during the Late Pleistocene.	0
Title: Elucidation of the kijanimicin gene cluster: insights into the biosynthesis of spirotetronate antibiotics and nitrosugars Abstract: The antibiotic kijanimicin produced by the actinomycete Actinomadura kijaniata has a broad spectrum of bioactivities as well as a number of interesting biosynthetic features. To understand the molecular basis for its formation and to develop a combinatorial biosynthetic system for this class of compounds, a 107.6 kb segment of the A. kijaniata chromosome containing the kijanimicin biosynthetic locus was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The complete pathway for the formation of TDP-l-digitoxose, one of the two sugar donors used in construction of kijanimicin, was elucidated through biochemical analysis of four enzymes encoded in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicates that the aglycone kijanolide is formed by the combined action of a modular Type-I polyketide synthase, a conserved set of enzymes involved in formation, attachment, and intramolecular cyclization of a glycerate-derived three-carbon unit, which forms the core of the spirotetronate moiety. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar d-kijanose [2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-4-(methylcarbamyl)-3-C-methyl-3-nitro-d-xylo-hexopyranose], including one encoding a flavoenzyme predicted to catalyze the formation of the nitro group, have also been identified. This work has implications for the biosynthesis of other spirotetronate antibiotics and nitrosugar-bearing natural products, as well as for future mechanistic and biosynthetic engineering efforts.	1
Title: Computational design and experimental characterization of peptides intended for pH-dependent membrane insertion and pore formation Abstract: There are many opportunities to use macromolecules, such as peptides and oligonucleotides, for intracellular applications. Despite this, general methods for delivering these molecules to the cytosol in a safe and efficient manner are not available. Efforts to develop a variety of intracellular drug delivery systems such as viral vectors, lipoplexes, nanoparticles, and amphiphilic peptides have been made, but various challenges such as delivery efficiency, toxicity, and controllability remain. A central challenge is the ability to selectively perturb, not destroy, the membrane to facilitate cargo introduction. Herein, we describe our efforts to design and characterize peptides that form pores inside membranes at acidic pH, so-called pH-switchable pore formation (PSPF) peptides, as a potential means for facilitating cargo translocation through membranes. Consistent with pore formation, these peptides exhibit low-pH-triggered selective release of ATP and miRNA, but not hemoglobin, from red blood cells. Consistent with these observations, biophysical studies (tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy) show that decreased pH destabilizes the PSPF peptides in aqueous systems while promoting their membrane insertion. Together, these results suggest that reduced pH drives insertion of PSPF peptides into membranes, leading to target-specific escape through a proposed pore formation mechanism.	0
Title: A highly stereoselective synthesis of chiral alpha-amino-beta-lactams via the Kinugasa reaction employing ynamides Abstract: A highly stereoselective synthesis of chiral alpha-amino-beta-lactam through an ynamide-Kinugasa reaction is described. In addition, a mechanistic model is illustrated here to rationalize the observed diastereoselectivity, which depends on both the initial [3 + 2] cycloaddition step and the subsequent protonation for which both are highly selective.	0
Title: NPR1 differentially interacts with members of the TGA/OBF family of transcription factors that bind an element of the PR-1 gene required for induction by salicylic acid Abstract: NPR1 is a critical component of the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of defense genes, such as the pathogenesis-related (PR)-1 gene, and enhanced disease resistance. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified several NPR1-interacting proteins (NIPs). Two of these NIPs are members of the TGA/OBF family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors; this family has been implicated in the activation of SA-responsive genes, including PR-1. Six TGA family members were tested and shown to differentially interact with NPR1: TGA2 and TGA3 showed strong affinity for NPR1; TGA5 and TGA6 exhibited weaker affinity; and TGA1 and TGA4 displayed little or no detectable interaction with NPR1, respectively. Interestingly, the amino-termini of these factors were found to decrease their stability in yeast and differentially affect their apparent affinity toward NPR1. The interacting regions on NPR1 and the TGA factors were also defined. Each of four point mutations in NPR1 that disrupt SA signaling in Arabidopsis completely blocked interaction of NPR1 with TGA2 and TGA3. TGA2 and TGA3 were also found to bind the SA-responsive element of the Arabidopsis PR-1 promoter. These results directly link NPR1 to SA-induced PR-1 expression through members of the TGA family of transcription factors.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of 6-Hydroxymellein Requires a Collaborating Polyketide Synthase-like Enzyme Abstract: The polyketide synthase (PKS)-like protein TerB, consisting of inactive dehydratase, inactive C-methyltransferase, and functional ketoreductase domains collaborates with the iterative non reducing PKS TerA to produce 6-hydroxymellein, a key pathway intermediate during the biosynthesis of various fungal natural products. The catalytically inactive dehydratase domain of TerB appears to mediate productive interactions with TerA, demonstrating a new mode of trans-interaction between iterative PKS components.	1
Title: SP3-FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High-Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome* Abstract: Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome-wide discovery of functional, redox-sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample-preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample-preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample-preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on-line high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of >14000 unique cysteines in a single-shot 70 min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3-FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small-molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis-activity-based protein profiling (isoTOP-ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only ∼28 h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3-FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.	0
Title: Genetic and chemical characterisation of the cornexistin pathway provides further insight into maleidride biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthesis of the herbicide cornexistin in the fungus Paecilomyces variotii was investigated by full sequencing of its genome, knockout of key genes within its biosynthetic gene cluster and isolation and identification of intermediate compounds. The general biosynthetic pathway resembles that of byssochlamic acid and other nonadrides in the early stages, but differs in requiring fewer enzymes in the key nonadride dimerisation step, and in the removal of one maleic anhydride moiety.	1
Title: The Arabidopsis Kinome: phylogeny and evolutionary insights into functional diversification Abstract: Background:                       Protein kinases constitute a particularly large protein family in Arabidopsis with important functions in cellular signal transduction networks. At the same time Arabidopsis is a model plant with high frequencies of gene duplications. Here, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the Arabidopsis kinase complement, the kinome, with particular focus on gene duplication events. We matched Arabidopsis proteins to a Hidden-Markov Model of eukaryotic kinases and computed a phylogeny of 942 Arabidopsis protein kinase domains and mapped their origin by gene duplication.                  Results:                       The phylogeny showed two major clades of receptor kinases and soluble kinases, each of which was divided into functional subclades. Based on this phylogeny, association of yet uncharacterized kinases to families was possible which extended functional annotation of unknowns. Classification of gene duplications within these protein kinases revealed that representatives of cytosolic subfamilies showed a tendency to maintain segmentally duplicated genes, while some subfamilies of the receptor kinases were enriched for tandem duplicates. Although functional diversification is observed throughout most subfamilies, some instances of functional conservation among genes transposed from the same ancestor were observed. In general, a significant enrichment of essential genes was found among genes encoding for protein kinases.                  Conclusions:                       The inferred phylogeny allowed classification and annotation of yet uncharacterized kinases. The prediction and analysis of syntenic blocks and duplication events within gene families of interest can be used to link functional biology to insights from an evolutionary viewpoint. The approach undertaken here can be applied to any gene family in any organism with an annotated genome.	0
Title: An Outer Membrane Protein Involved in the Uptake of Glucose Is Essential for Cytophaga hutchinsonii Cellulose Utilization Abstract: Cytophaga hutchinsonii specializes in cellulose digestion by employing a collection of novel cell-associated proteins. Here, we identified a novel gene locus, CHU_1276, that is essential for C. hutchinsonii cellulose utilization. Disruption of CHU_1276 in C. hutchinsonii resulted in complete deficiency in cellulose degradation, as well as compromised assimilation of cellobiose or glucose at a low concentration. Further analysis showed that CHU_1276 was an outer membrane protein that could be induced by cellulose and low concentrations of glucose. Transcriptional profiling revealed that CHU_1276 exerted a profound effect on the genome-wide response to both glucose and Avicel and that the mutant lacking CHU_1276 displayed expression profiles very different from those of the wild-type strain under different culture conditions. Specifically, comparison of their transcriptional responses to cellulose led to the identification of a gene set potentially regulated by CHU_1276. These results suggest that CHU_1276 plays an essential role in cellulose utilization, probably by coordinating the extracellular hydrolysis of cellulose substrate with the intracellular uptake of the hydrolysis product in C. hutchinsonii.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn5-induced mutants of Pseudomonas perfectomarina defective in nitrous oxide respiration Abstract: Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of Pseudomonas perfectomarina with the plasmid pSUP2021 [(pBR325-Mob(RP4))::Tn5] and the chromosomally integrated RP4 plasmid in Escherichia coli as the donor, produced three distinct groups of mutants that were defective in nitrous oxide respiration. One group of mutants lacked the structural protein of N2O reductase, the second synthesized a copper-free apoprotein; and a third group expressed a low level of intact enzyme. The mutants provided evidence for N2O being the immediate precursor of dinitrogen in denitrification and documented the essentiality of the copper enzyme. Synthesis of N2O reductase depended strongly on the growth conditions, with N2O-grown cells expressing the lowest level of enzyme. Regulatory responses of mutants elicited by nitrate or oxygen were unaltered when compared with wild-type behavior.	0
Title: Colibrimycins, Novel Halogenated Hybrid Polyketide Synthase-Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase (PKS-NRPS) Compounds Produced by Streptomyces sp. Strain CS147 Abstract: The improvement of genome sequencing techniques has brought to light the biosynthetic potential of actinomycetes due to the large number of gene clusters they present compared to the number of known compounds. Genome mining is a recent strategy in the search for novel bioactive compounds, which involves the analysis of sequenced genomes to identify uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, many of which are cryptic or silent under laboratory conditions, and to develop experimental approaches to identify their products. Owing to the importance of halogenation in terms of structural diversity, bioavailability, and bioactivity, searching for new halogenated bioactive compounds has become an interesting issue in the field of natural product discovery. Following this purpose, a screening for halogenase coding genes was performed on 12 Streptomyces strains isolated from fungus-growing ants of the Attini tribe. Using the bioinformatics tools antiSMASH and BLAST, six halogenase coding genes were identified. Some of these genes were located within biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which were studied by construction of several mutants for the identification of the putative halogenated compounds produced. The comparison of the metabolite production profile of wild-type strains and their corresponding mutants by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-UV and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed us the identification of a novel family of halogenated compounds in Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, designated colibrimycins. IMPORTANCE Genome mining has proven its usefulness in the search for novel bioactive compounds produced by microorganisms, and halogenases comprise an interesting starting point. In this work, we have identified a new halogenase coding gene that led to the discovery of novel lipopetide nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS)-derived natural products, the colibrimycins, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, isolated from the Attini ant niche. Some colibrimycins display an unusual α-ketoamide moiety in the peptide structure. Although its biosynthetic origin remains unknown, its presence might be related to a hypothetical inhibition of virus proteases, and, together with the presence of the halogenase, it represents a feature to be incorporated in the arsenal of structural modifications available for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Short-duration low-direct-current electrical field treatment is a practical tool for considerably reducing counts of gram-negative bacteria entrapped in gel beads Abstract: Application of a direct-current electrical field for very short times can serve as a practical nonthermal procedure to reduce or modify the microbial distribution in gel beads. The viability of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens entrapped in alginate and agarose beads decreases as the field intensity and duration of electrical field increase.	0
Title: Novel photoactivatable substrates for Renilla luciferase imaging in vitro and in vivo Abstract: To develop a photoactivatable bioluminescence imaging technique, a set of high and efficient photoactivatable substrates for Renilla luciferase has been well designed and synthesized. Surprisingly, all of them could release the free luciferin that presented robust bioluminescent signals ex vivo and in living animals after UV irradiation at 365 nm.	0
Title: Discovery of dual inhibitors of the immune cell PI3Ks p110delta and p110gamma: a prototype for new anti-inflammatory drugs Abstract: PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma regulate immune cell signaling, while the related PI3Kalpha and PI3Kbeta regulate cell survival and metabolism. Selective inhibitors of PI3Kdelta/gamma represent a potential class of anti-inflammatory agents lacking the antiproliferative effects associated with PI3Kalpha/beta inhibition. Here we report the discovery of PI3Kdelta/gamma inhibitors that display up to 1000-fold selectivity over PI3Kalpha/beta and evaluate these compounds in a high-content inflammation assay using mixtures of primary human cells. We find selective inhibition of only PI3Kdelta is weakly anti-inflammatory, but PI3Kdelta/gamma inhibitors show superior inflammatory marker suppression through suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFalpha production and T cell activation. Moreover, PI3Kdelta/gamma inhibition yields an anti-inflammatory signature distinct from pan-PI3K inhibition and known anti-inflammatory drugs, yet bears striking similarities to glucocorticoid receptor agonists. These results highlight the potential of selectively designing drugs that target kinases with shared biological function.	0
Title: Expression profiling soybean response to Pseudomonas syringae reveals new defense-related genes and rapid HR-specific downregulation of photosynthesis Abstract: Transcript profiling during susceptible (S) and hypersensitive response-associated resistance (R) interactions was determined in soybean (Glycine max). Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea carrying or lacking the avirulence gene avrB, was infiltrated into cultivar Williams 82. Leaf RNA was sampled at 2, 8, and 24 h postinoculation (hpi). Significant changes in transcript abundance were observed for 3,897 genes during the experiment at P < or = 0.000005. Many of the genes showed a similar direction of increase or decrease in abundance in both the S and R responses, but the R response generally showed a significantly greater degree of differential expression. More than 25% of these responsive genes had not been previously reported as being associated with pathogen interactions, as 704 had no functional annotation and 378 had no homolog in National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. The highest number of transcriptional changes was noted at 8 hpi, including the downregulation of 94 chloroplast-associated genes specific to the R response. Photosynthetic measurements were consistent with an R-specific reduction in photosystem II operating efficiency (phiPSII) that was apparent at 8 hpi for the R response with little effect in the S or control treatments. Imaging analyses suggest that the decreased phiPSII was a result of physical damage to PSII reaction centers.	0
Title: Genes encoding enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of L-lyxose and attachment of eurekanate during avilamycin biosynthesis Abstract: The oligosaccharide antibiotic avilamycin A is composed of a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety attached to a heptasaccharide chain consisting of six hexoses and one unusual pentose moiety. We describe the generation of mutant strains of the avilamycin producer defective in different sugar biosynthetic genes. Inactivation of two genes (aviD and aviE2) resulted in the breakdown of the avilamycin biosynthesis. In contrast, avilamycin production was not influenced in an aviP mutant. Inactivation of aviGT4 resulted in a mutant that accumulated a novel avilamycin derivative lacking the terminal eurekanate residue. Finally, AviE2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized biochemically. AviE2 was shown to convert UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-D-xylose, indicating that the pentose residue of avilamycin A is derived from D-glucose and not from D-ribose. Here we report a UDP-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase in actinomycetes.	1
Title: Pyrodextrin enhances intestinal function through changing the intestinal microbiota composition and metabolism in early weaned piglets Abstract: Pyrodextrin (PD) is prepared from starch by heat treatment and is resistant to amylase. We hypothesized that PD might have prebiotic potential affecting the microbiota composition, because it contains a non-digestible portion that may behave as dietary fiber. This study investigated the effects of PD supplementation on growth performance, gut morphology, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the bacterial community in weaned piglets receiving dietary supplementation of 0.5% PD. The piglets in the PD (treated) groups showed greater antioxidant capacity and feed efficiency (P < 0.05), as well as improved intestinal morphology in comparison with the piglets in the weaned (control) group. Gut microbiota profiles were assessed through 16S rRNA sequencing on the ileum contents and feces of early weaned piglets. Several genus-level enrichments and depletions were observed in response to PD treatment. Of note, PD supplementation decreased the relative abundance of pathogenic organisms, including Defluviicoccus and Gardnerella, while markedly increasing that of commensal bacteria (genera Psychrobacter and Prevotella), which have important roles in nutrient absorption and immune response regulation. The most notable effect in the PD treatment groups was increased production of SCFAs in the feces of PD-treated weaned piglets. Correlation analysis revealed that the improvement in SCFAs was positively correlated with the increase in SCFA-producing bacteria. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of PD supplementation on the fecal microbial community and the modulation of SCFA production in early weaned piglets, thus indicating that PD can be used to alleviate weaning stress in piglets.	0
Title: Optimization of large animal MI models; a systematic analysis of control groups from preclinical studies Abstract: Large animal models are essential for the development of novel therapeutics for myocardial infarction. To optimize translation, we need to assess the effect of experimental design on disease outcome and model experimental design to resemble the clinical course of MI. The aim of this study is therefore to systematically investigate how experimental decisions affect outcome measurements in large animal MI models. We used control animal-data from two independent meta-analyses of large animal MI models. All variables of interest were pre-defined. We performed univariable and multivariable meta-regression to analyze whether these variables influenced infarct size and ejection fraction. Our analyses incorporated 246 relevant studies. Multivariable meta-regression revealed that infarct size and cardiac function were influenced independently by choice of species, sex, co-medication, occlusion type, occluded vessel, quantification method, ischemia duration and follow-up duration. We provide strong systematic evidence that commonly used endpoints significantly depend on study design and biological variation. This makes direct comparison of different study-results difficult and calls for standardized models. Researchers should take this into account when designing large animal studies to most closely mimic the clinical course of MI and enable translational success.	0
Title: Characterization of cyanobacterial hydrocarbon composition and distribution of biosynthetic pathways Abstract: Cyanobacteria possess the unique capacity to naturally produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids. Hydrocarbon compositions of thirty-two strains of cyanobacteria were characterized to reveal novel structural features and insights into hydrocarbon biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This investigation revealed new double bond (2- and 3-heptadecene) and methyl group positions (3-, 4- and 5-methylheptadecane) for a variety of strains. Additionally, results from this study and literature reports indicate that hydrocarbon production is a universal phenomenon in cyanobacteria. All cyanobacteria possess the capacity to produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids yet not all accomplish this through the same metabolic pathway. One pathway comprises a two-step conversion of fatty acids first to fatty aldehydes and then alkanes that involves a fatty acyl ACP reductase (FAAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO). The second involves a polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway that first elongates the acyl chain followed by decarboxylation to produce a terminal alkene (olefin synthase, OLS). Sixty-one strains possessing the FAAR/ADO pathway and twelve strains possessing the OLS pathway were newly identified through bioinformatic analyses. Strains possessing the OLS pathway formed a cohesive phylogenetic clade with the exception of three Moorea strains and Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 6406 which may have acquired the OLS pathway via horizontal gene transfer. Hydrocarbon pathways were identified in one-hundred-forty-two strains of cyanobacteria over a broad phylogenetic range and there were no instances where both the FAAR/ADO and the OLS pathways were found together in the same genome, suggesting an unknown selective pressure maintains one or the other pathway, but not both.	1
Title: Rate limiting step precedes C-C bond formation in the archetypical proline-catalyzed intramolecular aldol reaction Abstract: The archetypical proline-catalyzed intramolecular aldol reaction, the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, has served as a model reaction for the mechanistic study of the ever-growing class of proline-catalyzed conversions. Experimental measurements of the (13)C kinetic isotope effects for this reaction show conclusively that carbon-carbon bond formation is not rate-limiting.	0
Title: A stereoselective synthesis of digitoxin and digitoxigen mono- and bisdigitoxoside from digitoxigenin via a palladium-catalyzed glycosylation Abstract: A convergent and stereocontrolled route to trisaccharide natural product digitoxin has been developed. The route is amenable to the preparation of both the digitoxigen mono- and bisdigitoxoside. This route featured the iterative application of the palladium-catalyzed glycosylation reaction, reductive 1,3-transposition, diastereoselective dihydroxylation, and regioselective protection. The natural product digitoxin was fashioned in 15 steps starting from digitoxigenin 2 and pyranone 8a or 18 steps from achiral acylfuran.	0
Title: Characterization of tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster affording diversified tiacumicin analogues and revealing a tailoring dihalogenase Abstract: The RNA polymerase inhibitor tiacumicin B is currently undergoing phase III clinical trial for treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea with great promise. To understand the biosynthetic logic and to lay a foundation for generating structural analogues via pathway engineering, the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and characterized from the producer Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085. Sequence analysis of a 110,633 bp DNA region revealed the presence of 50 open reading frames (orfs). Functional investigations of 11 orfs by in vivo inactivation experiments, preliminarily outlined the boundaries of the tia-gene cluster and suggested that 31 orfs were putatively involved in tiacumicin B biosynthesis. Functions of a halogenase (TiaM), two glycosyltransferases (TiaG1 and TiaG2), a sugar C-methyltransferase (TiaS2), an acyltransferase (TiaS6), and two cytochrome P450s (TiaP1 and TiaP2) were elucidated by isolation and structural characterization of the metabolites from the corresponding gene-inactivation mutants. Accumulation of 18 tiacumicin B analogues from 7 mutants not only provided experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also set an example of accessing microbial natural product diversity via genetic approach. More importantly, biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase TiaM reveals a sequentially acting dihalogenation step tailoring tiacumicin B biosynthesis.	1
Title: Analysis of the pmsCEAB gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of salicylic acid and the siderophore pseudomonine in the biocontrol strain Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374 Abstract: Mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374 defective in biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore pseudobactin still display siderophore activity, indicating the production of a second siderophore. A recombinant cosmid clone (pMB374-07) of a WCS374 gene library harboring loci necessary for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) and this second siderophore pseudomonine was isolated. The salicylate biosynthesis region of WCS374 was localized in a 5-kb EcoRI fragment of pMB374-07. The SA and pseudomonine biosynthesis region was identified by transfer of cosmid pMB374-07 to a pseudobactin-deficient strain of P. putida. Sequence analysis of the 5-kb subclone revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORFs). Products of two ORFs (pmsC and pmsB) showed homologies with chorismate-utilizing enzymes; a third ORF (pmsE) encoded a protein with strong similarity with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores in other bacterial species. The region also contained a putative histidine decarboxylase gene (pmsA). A putative promoter region and two predicted iron boxes were localized upstream of pmsC. We determined by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR that the pmsCEAB genes are cotranscribed and that expression is iron regulated. In vivo expression of SA genes was achieved in P. putida and Escherichia coli cells. In E. coli, deletions affecting the first ORF (pmsC) diminished SA production, whereas deletion of pmsB abolished it completely. The pmsB gene induced low levels of SA production in E. coli when expressed under control of the lacZ promoter. Several lines of evidence indicate that SA and pseudomonine biosynthesis are related. Moreover, we isolated a Tn5 mutant (374-05) that is simultaneously impaired in SA and pseudomonine production.	1
Title: A novel streptococcal integrative conjugative element involved in iron acquisition Abstract: In this study, we determined the function of a novel non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system carried by a streptococcal integrative conjugative element (ICE), ICESe2. The NRPS shares similarity with the yersiniabactin system found in the high-pathogenicity island of Yersinia sp. and is the first of its kind to be identified in streptococci. We named the NRPS product 'equibactin' and genes of this locus eqbA-N. ICESe2, although absolutely conserved in Streptococcus equi, the causative agent of equine strangles, was absent from all strains of the closely related opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Binding of EqbA, a DtxR-like regulator, to the eqbB promoter was increased in the presence of cations. Deletion of eqbA resulted in a small-colony phenotype. Further deletion of the irp2 homologue eqbE, or the genes eqbH, eqbI and eqbJ encoding a putative ABC transporter, or addition of the iron chelator nitrilotriacetate, reversed this phenotype, implicating iron toxicity. Quantification of (55)Fe accumulation and sensitivity to streptonigrin suggested that equibactin is secreted by S. equi and that the eqbH, eqbI and eqbJ genes are required for its associated iron import. In agreement with a structure-based model of equibactin synthesis, supplementation of chemically defined media with salicylate was required for equibactin production.	1
Title: Effects of ionic strength on bacterial adhesion and stability of flocs in a wastewater activated sludge system Abstract: The success of biological wastewater treatment is to a large extent governed by the ability of bacteria to induce floc formation, thereby facilitating the separation of particles from the treated water. We performed studies on the dynamics of floc stability, the desorption of cells from the flocs, and the reflocculation of detached material. The floc stability was affected by the ionic strength of the medium in a way that strongly suggests that the interactions between the floc components can be explained by the theory of Derjaugin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO theory). At increasing concentrations of electrolytes, the stability of the flocs increased. However, above an ionic strength of about 0.1 the floc stability decreased, and it seems that at this high electrolyte concentration the DLVO theory cannot be applied. The reversibility of the electrostatic double-layer effects was experimentally shown by treating the sludge repeatedly with a low-ionic-strength solution until parts of the flocs detached. When salt was added at this point, flocs re-form, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the turbidity of the supernatant liquid. Both reflocculation and detachment of floc material were seen with calcium as well as with potassium. This finding clearly indicates that the reflocculation and destabilization of flocs were due to changes in double-layer thickness rather than bridging effects of multivalent ions such as calcium. The results indicate that the ionic strength may well be an important factor for the floc stability in wastewater in situ.	0
Title: Pentamycin Biosynthesis in Philippine Streptomyces sp. S816: Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Installation of the C-14 Hydroxyl Group Abstract: Pentamycin is a polyene antibiotic, registered in Switzerland for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and mixed infections. Chemical instability has hindered its widespread application and development as a drug. Here, we report the identification of Streptomyces sp. S816, isolated from Philippine mangrove soil, as a pentamycin producer. Genome sequence analysis identified the putative pentamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows a high degree of similarity to the gene cluster responsible for filipin III biosynthesis. The ptnJ gene, which is absent from the filipin III biosynthetic gene cluster, was shown to encode a cytochrome P450 capable of converting filipin III to pentamycin. This confirms that the cluster directs pentamycin biosynthesis, paving the way for biosynthetic engineering approaches to the production of pentamycin analogues. Several other Streptomyces genomes were found to contain ptnJ orthologues clustered with genes encoding polyketide synthases that appear to have similar architectures to those responsible for the assembly of filipin III and pentamycin, suggesting pentamycin production may be common in Streptomyces species.	1
Title: The GalF protein of Escherichia coli is not a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase but interacts with the GalU protein possibly to regulate cellular levels of UDP-glucose Abstract: We report the functional characterization of the galF gene of strain VW187 (Escherichia coli O7:K1), which encodes a polypeptide displaying structural features common to bacterial UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, including the E. coli GalU protein. These enzymes catalyse a reversible reaction converting UTP and glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucose and PPi. We show that, although the GalF protein is expressed in vivo, GalF-expressing plasmids cannot complement the phenotype of a galU mutant and extracts from this mutant which only produces GalF are enzymatically inactive. In contrast, the presence of GalU and GalF proteins in the same cell-free extract caused a significant reduction in the rate of pyrophosphorolysis (conversion of UDP-glucose into glucose-1-phosphate) but no significant effect on the kinetics of synthesis of UDP-glucose. The presence of GalF also increased the thermal stability of the enzyme in vitro. The effect of GalF in the biochemical properties of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase required the co-synthesis of GalF and GalU, suggesting that they could interact as components of the oligomeric enzyme. The physical interaction of GalU and GalF was demonstrated in vivo by the co-expression of both proteins as fusion products using a yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, using a pair of galF-/galU+ and galF/galU+ isogenic strains, we demonstrated that the presence of GalF is associated with an increased concentration of intracellular UDP-glucose as well as with an enhancement of the thermal stability of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in vivo. We propose that GalF is a non-catalytic subunit of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase modulating the enzyme activity to increase the formation of UDP-glucose, and this function is important for bacterial adaptation to conditions of stress.	1
Title: Regulation of pectate lyase synthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Erwinia carotovora Abstract: Inducible synthesis of extracellular pectate lyase occurs in Erwinia carotovora, a bacterial soft-rot pathogen of plants, and, to a lesser extent, in a nonpathogenic isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens. A combination of pectin and a heat-labile factor in fresh potato tissue or acetone powders of the tissue provided the best carbon source for induction. Yields of inducible pectate lyase were much greater than those usually reported. The pathogen, but not the saprophyte, produced a small amount of constitutive enzyme when grown on glucose. The relatively low level or absence of constitutive synthesis in these bacteria did not result from catabolite repression. Attempts were made to relieve any existing catabolite repression by restricting growth through slow feeding of glucose or by growing the organisms on glycerol. These conditions did not significantly alter the differential rate of lyase synthesis compared with changes observed in the presence of inducers. Previous growth history did not affect induction in the pathogen. However, P. fluorescens previously cultured on glucose required 10 to 20 generations of growth on inducing medium before appreciable lyase synthesis occurred. Differences between the pathogen and nonpathogen suggest that regulation of pectate lyase synthesis is related to pathogenicity of soft-rot bacteria.	0
Title: Dictyostelium transposable element DIRS-1 has 350-base-pair inverted terminal repeats that contain a heat shock promoter Abstract: DIRS-1 is a 4.7-kilobase-pair repetitive and apparently transposable Dictyostelium genetic element that is transcribed during differentiation or after heat shock. The terminal regions of DIRS-1 are inverted repeats of 330 base pairs. The repeats are highly conserved both within a given element as well as between different members of the family (less than 10% divergence). At the distal end of all left repeats is a 32-nucleotide sequence composed almost entirely of A and T residues. In addition to this 32-base A + T sequence, the distal region of all right repeats is extended by a 28-base-pair A + T-rich sequence that is identical in all copies. The sequences flanking each DIRS-1 sequence are completely dissimilar, and there appears to be no duplication of the genomic DNA sequence at the presumed point of DIRS-1 insertion. The terminal repeats can also be found interspersed in the genome independently of the complete element. In addition, the terminal repeats carry a 15-nucleotide sequence that greatly resembles the Drosophila consensus heat shock promoter and may be involved in the transcriptional induction of the DIRS-1 sequences.	0
Title: Prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster in the roseophilin producer Streptomyces griseoviridis Abstract: Streptomyces griseoviridis 2464-S5 produces prodigiosin R1, a tripyrrole antibiotic, and roseophilin, a structurally related compound containing two pyrrole and one furan rings. A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a prodigiosin was identified in S. griseoviridis. The cluster consisted of 24 open reading frames, including 21 genes (rphD-rphZ) homologous to prodigiosin biosynthesis genes in the red cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The expression of rphN in S. coelicolor lacking redN restored the production of prodigiosin.	1
Title: Characterization of gamma-butyrolactone autoregulatory signaling gene homologs in the angucyclinone polyketide WS5995B producer Streptomyces acidiscabies Abstract: Organisms belonging to the genus Streptomyces produce numerous important secondary metabolites and undergo a sophisticated morphological differentiation program. In many instances these processes are under the control of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) autoregulatory systems. Streptomyces acidiscabies strain 84.104 produces the secondary metabolite aromatic angucyclinone polyketide WS5995B. In order to explore the role of GBL regulatory circuitry in WS5995B production and morphogenesis in S. acidiscabies, a gene cluster encoding GBL autoregulatory signaling homologs was identified and characterized. Two GBL receptor homologs, sabR and sabS, were found flanking a GBL synthase homolog sabA. Strains carrying mutations in sabS produced elevated levels of WS5995B and displayed conditional morphological defects reminiscent of defects seen in Streptomyces bldA mutants. Notably, sabS possesses a TTA codon predicted to be recognized by tRNA(leu). sabA mutants produced higher levels of WS5995B than the wild-type strain but to a lesser extent than the levels of WS5995B seen in sabS mutants. Purified recombinant SabR and SabS were tested for their abilities to bind predicted AT-rich autoregulatory element (ARE) boxes within the sabRAS region. SabS did not bind any DNA sequences in this region, while SabR bound an ARE box in the region upstream of sabS. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed higher levels of sabS transcript in sabR mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting that sabS expression is repressed by SabR. Based on these data, we propose that the S. acidiscabies sabRAS genes encode components of a signaling pathway which participates in the regulation of WS5995B production and morphogenesis.	1
Title: Gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective carboalkoxylation of alkynes Abstract: A highly enantioselective carboalkoxylation of alkynes catalyzed by cationic (DTBM-MeO-Biphep)gold(I) complexes is reported. Various optically active β-alkoxyindanone derivatives were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Furthermore, this methodology was extended to the enantioselective synthesis of 3-methoxycyclopentenones. The reaction is proposed to proceed through an enantioselective cyclization of intermediates containing vinylgold(I) and prochiral oxocarbenium moieties.	0
Title: Probestin, a new inhibitor of aminopeptidase M, produced by Streptomyces azureus MH663-2F6. II. Structure determination of probestin Abstract: Probestin, a new inhibitor of aminopeptidase M, has been isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces azureus MH663-2F6. The 1H and 13C NMR studies and amino acid analysis confirmed the presence of one 3-amino-2-hydroxy-phenylbutanoic acid, leucine and two proline residues in the molecule. Stereochemistries of these amino acids were determined by HPLC analysis. The fragmentation pattern shown in the mass spectrum and the chemical analysis on probestin clarified the amino acid sequence. Thus the structure of probestin was defined as (2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl-L-leucyl-L-prolyl-L-pro line.	0
Title: Covariability of Vibrio cholerae microdiversity and environmental parameters Abstract: Fine-scale diversity of natural bacterial assemblages has been attributed to neutral radiation because correspondence between bacterial phylogenetic signals in the natural environment and environmental parameters had not been detected. Evidence that such correspondence occurs is provided for Vibrio cholerae, establishing a critical role for environmental parameters in bacterial diversity.	0
Title: Progress in Understanding Ferroptosis and Challenges in Its Targeting for Therapeutic Benefit Abstract: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell-death modality driven by oxidative phospholipid damage. In contrast to apoptosis, which enables organisms to eliminate targeted cells purposefully at specific times, ferroptosis appears to be a vulnerability of cells that otherwise use high levels of polyunsaturated lipids to their advantage. Cells in this high polyunsaturated lipid state generally have safeguards that mitigate ferroptotic risk. Since its recognition, ferroptosis has been implicated in degenerative diseases in tissues including kidney and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple cancers-each likely characterized by the high polyunsaturated lipid state with insufficient or overwhelmed ferroptotic safeguards. In this Perspective, we present progress toward defining the essential roles and key mediators of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in disease contexts. Moreover, we discuss gaps in our understanding of ferroptosis and list key challenges that have thus far limited the full potential of targeting ferroptosis for improving human health.	0
Title: Genomic sequence-based discovery of novel angucyclinone antibiotics from marine Streptomyces sp. W007 Abstract: A large number of novel bioactive compounds were discovered from microbial secondary metabolites based on the traditional bioactivity screenings. Recent fermentation studies indicated that the crude extract of marine Streptomyces sp. W007 possessed great potential in agricultural fungal disease control against Phomopsis asparagi, Polystigma deformans, Cladosporium cucumerinum, Monilinia fructicola, and Colletotrichum lagenarium. To further evaluate the biosynthetic potential of secondary metabolites, we sequenced the genome of Streptomyces sp. W007 and analyzed the identifiable secondary metabolite gene clusters. Moreover, one gene cluster with type II PKS implied the possibility of Streptomyces sp. W007 to produce aromatic polyketide of angucyclinone antibiotics. Therefore, two novel compounds, 3-hydroxy-1-keto-3-methyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-benz[α]anthracene and kiamycin with potent cytotoxicities against human cancer cell lines, were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. W007. In addition, other four known angucyclinone antibiotics were obtained. The gene cluster for these angucyclinone antibiotics could be assigned to 20 genes. This work provides powerful evidence for the interplay between genomic analysis and traditional natural product isolation research.	1
Title: Atypical Listeria innocua strains possess an intact LIPI-3 Abstract: Background:                       Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen which is the causative agent of listeriosis and can be divided into three evolutionary lineages I, II and III. While all strains possess the well established virulence factors associated with the Listeria pathogenicity island I (LIPI-1), lineage I strains also possess an additional pathogenicity island designated LIPI-3 which encodes listeriolysin S (LLS), a post-translationally modified cytolytic peptide. Up until now, this pathogenicity island has been identified exclusively in a subset of lineage I isolates of the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.                  Results:                       In total 64 L. innocua strains were screened for the presence of LIPI-3. Here we report the identification of an intact LIPI-3 in 11 isolates of L. innocua and the remnants of the cluster in several others. Significantly, we can reveal that placing the L. innocua lls genes under the control of a constitutive promoter results in a haemolytic phenotype, confirming that the cluster is capable of encoding a functional haemolysin.                  Conclusions:                       Although the presence of the LIPI-3 gene cluster is confined to lineage I isolates of L. monocytogenes, a corresponding gene cluster or its remnants have been identified in many L. innocua strains.	1
Title: Molecular basis for the recognition of structurally distinct autoinducer mimics by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing signaling receptor Abstract: The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the expression of virulence factors using quorum sensing, a signaling cascade triggered by the activation of signal receptors by small-molecule autoinducers. These homoserine lactone autoinducers stabilize their cognate receptors and activate their functions as transcription factors. Because quorum sensing regulates the progression of infection and host immune resistance, significant efforts have been devoted toward the identification of small molecules that disrupt this process. Screening efforts have identified a class of triphenyl compounds that are structurally distinct from the homoserine lactone autoinducer, yet interact specifically and potently with LasR receptor to modulate quorum sensing (Muh et al., 2006a). Here we present the high-resolution crystal structures of the ligand binding domain of LasR in complex with the autoinducer N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (1.4 A resolution), and with the triphenyl mimics TP-1, TP-3, and TP-4 (to between 1.8 A and 2.3 A resolution). These crystal structures provide a molecular rationale for understanding how chemically distinct compounds can be accommodated by a highly selective receptor, and provide the framework for the development of novel quorum-sensing regulators, utilizing the triphenyl scaffold.	0
Title: Dss1 release activates DNA binding potential in Brh2 Abstract: Dss1 is an intrinsically unstructured polypeptide that partners with the much larger Brh2 protein, the BRCA2 ortholog in Ustilago maydis, to form a tight complex. Mutants lacking Dss1 have essentially the same phenotype as mutants defective in Brh2, implying that through physical interaction Dss1 serves as a positive activator of Brh2. Dss1 associates with Brh2 through an interaction surface in the carboxy-terminal region. Certain derivatives of Brh2 lacking this interaction surface remain highly competent in DNA repair as long as a DNA-binding domain is present. However, the Dss1-independent activity raises the question of what function might be met in the native protein by having Brh2 under Dss1 control. Using a set of Brh2 fusions and truncated derivatives, we show here that Dss1 is capable of exerting control when there is a cognate Dss1-interacting surface present. We find that association of Dss1 attenuates the DNA binding potential of Brh2 and that the amino-terminal domain of Brh2 helps evict Dss1 from its carboxy-terminal interaction surface. The findings presented here add to the notion that Dss1 serves in a regulatory capacity to dictate order in association of Brh2's amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains with DNA.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of t-Butyl in Apratoxin A: Functional Analysis and Architecture of a PKS Loading Module Abstract: The unusual feature of a t-butyl group is found in several marine-derived natural products including apratoxin A, a Sec61 inhibitor produced by the cyanobacterium Moorea bouillonii PNG 5-198. Here, we determine that the apratoxin A t-butyl group is formed as a pivaloyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) by AprA, the polyketide synthase (PKS) loading module of the apratoxin A biosynthetic pathway. AprA contains an inactive "pseudo" GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain (ΨGNAT) flanked by two methyltransferase domains (MT1 and MT2) that differ distinctly in sequence. Structural, biochemical, and precursor incorporation studies reveal that MT2 catalyzes unusually coupled decarboxylation and methylation reactions to transform dimethylmalonyl-ACP, the product of MT1, to pivaloyl-ACP. Further, pivaloyl-ACP synthesis is primed by the fatty acid synthase malonyl acyltransferase (FabD), which compensates for the ΨGNAT and provides the initial acyl-transfer step to form AprA malonyl-ACP. Additionally, images of AprA from negative stain electron microscopy reveal multiple conformations that may facilitate the individual catalytic steps of the multienzyme module.	1
Title: Fractionation and Antitumor Activity of Polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa Mycelium Abstract: We developed a method for the fractionation and purification of antitumor polysaccharides, considered to be a type of immuno-potentiator or BRM (biological response modifier), from the mycelium of liquid cultured Grifola frondosa. The active polysaccharide fractions that showed higher antitumor activity were considered to be heteroglycans or their protein complexes as follows, in water-soluble fractions: FI0-a-α: fucoga-lactomannan-protein complex; FI0-a-β: mannogalactofucan; FA-1: galactoglucomannofucan-protein complex; FA-2-b-α: glucogalactomannan-protein complex; in water-insoluble fractions: FIII-1-a: mannofucoglucoxylan; FIII-1-b: mannoglucofucoxylan-protein complex; FIII-2-a: mannofucoglucoxylan-protein complex; FIII-2-b: glucomannofucoxylan-protein complex.	0
Title: Studies of aluminum reinsertion into borosilicate zeolites with intersecting channels of 10- and 12-ring channel systems Abstract: The work here describes the kinetic analyses of aluminum replacement for boron in a suite of borosilicate molecular sieves. While the method has been described before as a means of converting synthesized borosilicates (with weak inherent acidity) to aluminosilicates (with much stronger acid strength) when there are large pores in the structure, here we carry out the transformation under less than optimal replacement concentrations, in order to better follow the kinetics. We examined several zeolite structures with boundary conditions of boron MEL where there are only 10-ring (or intermediate) pore structures and no Al is taken up, to multidimensional large pore zeolites, like boron beta, where Al substitution can occur everywhere. We also studied materials with both intermediate and large pores, SSZ-56, 57, 70, and 82. In the case of 57 up to 90% of the structure is made up of boron MEL. We observe that the pH drop is proportional to the Al reinsertion and is the same for all zeolites we studied. In one case, we compared a zeolite (SSZ-24) with boron and then no boron sites and found that Al does not go into defect sites. It was again confirmed (shown in earlier work) that Al will go into nest sites created by boron hydrolysis out of the substrate before Al treatment. Along those lines we also made two new observations: (1) the profile for Al uptake, as followed by pH drop, is the same kinetically, whether the boron is there or not; and (2) NMR showed that the boron is leaving the structure faster than Al can go back in (SSZ-33 study), even when we treat a material with boron in the lattice.	0
Title: Bicyclic core estrogens as full antagonists: synthesis, biological evaluation and structure-activity relationships of estrogen receptor ligands based on bridged oxabicyclic core arylsulfonamides Abstract: Compounds that block estrogen action through the estrogen receptor (ER) or downregulate ER levels are useful for the treatment of breast cancer and endocrine disorders. In our search for structurally novel estrogens having three-dimensional core scaffolds, we found some compounds with a 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core that bound well to the ERs. The best of these compounds, a phenyl sulfonate ester (termed OBHS for oxabicycloheptene sulfonate), was a partial antagonist on both ERα and ERβ. Although OBHS bears no structural resemblance to other estrogen antagonists, it appears to achieve its partial antagonist character by stabilizing a novel conformation of the ER that involves a significant distortion of helix-11. To enhance the antagonist properties of these oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core ligands, we expanded the functional diversity of OBHS by replacing the sulfonate with secondary or tertiary sulfonamides (-SO(2)NR-), isoelectronic and potentially isostructural molecular replacements. An array of 16 OBHS sulfonamide analogues were prepared through a Diels-Alder reaction of a 3,4-diarylfuran using various N-aryl vinyl sulfonamide dienophiles. While the more polar secondary sulphonamides were weak ligands, certain of the tertiary sulfonamides had very good ER binding affinity. In HepG2 cell reporter gene assays, the sulphonamides had moderate potency, but they showed lower intrinsic transcriptional activity on ERα than the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) hydroxytamoxifen or OBHS, and they were inverse agonists on ERβ. Thus, the behaviour of these OBH-sulfonamides more closely mirrors the activity of full antagonists like the drug fulvestrant (ICI 182 780), and their greater antagonist biocharacter appears to arise from an accentuated distortion of helix-11.	0
Title: Characterization of the polyoxin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cacaoi and engineered production of polyoxin H Abstract: A gene cluster (pol) essential for the biosynthesis of polyoxin, a nucleoside antibiotic widely used for the control of phytopathogenic fungi, was cloned from Streptomyces cacaoi. A 46,066-bp region was sequenced, and 20 of 39 of the putative open reading frames were defined as necessary for polyoxin biosynthesis as evidenced by its production in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans TK24. The role of PolO and PolA in polyoxin synthesis was demonstrated by in vivo experiments, and their functions were unambiguously characterized as O-carbamoyltransferase and UMP-enolpyruvyltransferase, respectively, by in vitro experiments, which enabled the production of a modified compound differing slightly from that proposed earlier. These studies should provide a solid foundation for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms for polyoxin biosynthesis, and set the stage for combinatorial biosynthesis using genes encoding different pathways for nucleoside antibiotics.	1
Title: A Step toward Molecular Evolution of RNA: Ribose Binds to Prebiotic Fatty Acid Membranes, and Nucleosides Bind Better than Individual Bases Do Abstract: A major challenge in understanding how biological cells arose on the early Earth is explaining how RNA and membranes originally colocalized. We propose that the building blocks of RNA (nucleobases and ribose) bound to self-assembled prebiotic membranes. We have previously demonstrated that the bases bind to membranes composed of a prebiotic fatty acid, but evidence for the binding of sugars has remained a technical challenge. Here, we used pulsed-field gradient NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that ribose and other sugars bind to membranes of decanoic acid. Moreover, the binding of some bases is strongly enhanced when they are linked to ribose to form a nucleoside or - with the addition of phosphate - a nucleotide. This enhanced binding could have played a role in the molecular evolution leading to the production of RNA.	0
Title: Tandem Bioorthogonal Labeling Uncovers Endogenous Cotranslationally O-GlcNAc Modified Nascent Proteins Abstract: Hundreds of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins within multicellular eukaryotes have hydroxyl groups of specific serine and threonine residues modified by the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This modification, known as O-GlcNAc, has emerged as a central regulator of both cell physiology and human health. A key emerging function of O-GlcNAc appears to be to regulate cellular protein homeostasis. We previously showed, using overexpressed model proteins, that O-GlcNAc modification can occur cotranslationally and that this process prevents premature degradation of such nascent polypeptide chains. Here, we use tandem metabolic engineering strategies to label endogenously occurring nascent polypeptide chains within cells using O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) and target the specific subset of nascent chains that are cotranslationally glycosylated with O-GlcNAc by metabolic saccharide engineering using tetra-O-acetyl-2-N-azidoacetyl-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranose (Ac4GalNAz). Using various combinations of sequential chemoselective ligation strategies, we go on to tag these analytes with a series of labels, allowing us to define conditions that enable their robust labeling. Two-step enrichment of these glycosylated nascent chains, combined with shotgun proteomics, allows us to identify a set of endogenous cotranslationally O-GlcNAc modified proteins. Using alternative targeted methods, we examine three of these identified proteins and further validate their cotranslational O-GlcNAcylation. These findings detail strategies to enable isolation and identification of extremely low abundance endogenous analytes present within complex protein mixtures. Moreover, this work opens the way to studies directed at understanding the roles of O-GlcNAc and other cotranslational protein modifications and should stimulate an improved understanding of the role of O-GlcNAc in cytoplasmic protein quality control and proteostasis.	0
Title: More than anticipated - production of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: The genome of environmental Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 harbors numerous gene clusters involved in synthesis of antifungal and antibacterial acting secondary metabolites. Five gene clusters, srf, bmy, fen, nrs, dhb, covering altogether 137 kb, direct non-ribosomal synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides surfactin, bacillomycin, fengycin, an unknown peptide, and the iron siderophore bacillibactin. Bacillomycin and fengycin were shown to act against phytopathogenic fungi in a synergistic manner. Three gene clusters, mln, bae, and dif, with a total length of 199 kb were shown to direct synthesis of the antibacterial acting polyketides macrolactin, bacillaene, and difficidin. Both, non-ribosomal synthesis of cyclic lipopeptides and synthesis of polyketides are dependent on the presence of a functional sfp gene product, 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, as evidenced by knockout mutation of the sfp gene resulting in complete absence of all those eight compounds. In addition, here we present evidence that a gene cluster encoding enzymes involved in synthesis and export of the antibacterial acting dipeptide bacilysin is also functional in FZB42. In summary, environmental FZB42 devoted about 340 kb, corresponding to 8.5% of its total genetic capacity, to synthesis of secondary metabolites useful to cope with other competing microorganisms present in the plant rhizosphere.	1
Title: Stabilisation of the Fatty Acid Decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis by Caprylic Acid Abstract: The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64 A (CvFAP) catalyses the light-dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of CvFAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme en route to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of CvFAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium-chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining CvFAP stability is 'to keep the enzyme busy'.	0
Title: Utilization of the methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus for cloning the oxazolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces albus JA3453 Abstract: Oxazolomycin (OZM), a hybrid peptide-polyketide antibiotic, exhibits potent antitumor and antiviral activities. Using degenerate primers to clone genes encoding methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) biosynthesis as probes, a 135-kb DNA region from Streptomyces albus JA3453 was cloned and found to cover the entire OZM biosynthetic gene cluster. The involvement of the cloned genes in OZM biosynthesis was confirmed by deletion of a 12-kb DNA fragment containing six genes for methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis from the specific region of the chromosome, as well as deletion of the ozmC gene within this region, to generate OZM-nonproducing mutants.	1
Title: Identification of a second tetracycline-inducible polypeptide encoded by Tn10 Abstract: Three Tn10 polypeptides were detected by analyzing the proteins synthesized in ultraviolet light-irradiated Escherichia coli cells after infection with lambda::Tn10. One of these polypeptides was the previously identified 36,000-dalton TET polypeptide. The other two had approximate sizes of 25,000 and 13,000 daltons. The syntheses of both the TET polypeptide and the 25,000-dalton polypeptide were inducible by tetracycline in lambda-immune hosts. Similarly, the synthesis of the TET polypeptide was inducible in nonimmune hosts. However, the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton polypeptide was constitutive in nonimmune hosts. An amber mutation in a gene required for tetracycline resistance on lambda::Tn10 was isolated that eliminated the synthesis of the TET polypeptide in sup+ hosts but not the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton or the 13,000-dalton polypeptides. The expression of tetracycline resistance from wild-type Tn10 was found to be anomalous in E. coli strains carrying the amber suppressors supD, supE, and supF. In general, strains containing these nonsense suppressors were less resistant to tetracycline.	0
Title: Discovery of a Cryptic Antifungal Compound from Streptomyces albus J1074 Using High-Throughput Elicitor Screens Abstract: An important unresolved issue in microbial secondary metabolite production is the abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters that are not expressed under typical laboratory growth conditions. These so-called silent or cryptic gene clusters are sources of new natural products, but how they are silenced, and how they may be rationally activated are areas of ongoing investigation. We recently devised a chemogenetic high-throughput screening approach ("HiTES") to discover small molecule elicitors of silent biosynthetic gene clusters. This method was successfully applied to a Gram-negative bacterium; it has yet to be implemented in the prolific antibiotic-producing streptomycetes. Herein we have developed a high-throughput transcriptional assay format in Streptomyces spp. by leveraging eGFP, inserted both at a neutral site and inside the biosynthetic cluster of interest, as a read-out for secondary metabolite synthesis. Using this approach, we successfully used HiTES to activate a silent gene cluster in Streptomyces albus J1074. Our results revealed the cytotoxins etoposide and ivermectin as potent inducers, allowing us to isolate and structurally characterize 14 novel small molecule products of the chosen cluster. One of these molecules is a novel antifungal, while several others inhibit a cysteine protease implicated in cancer. Studies addressing the mechanism of induction by the two elicitors led to the identification of a pathway-specific transcriptional repressor that silences the gene cluster under standard growth conditions. The successful application of HiTES will allow future interrogations of the biological regulation and chemical output of the countless silent gene clusters in Streptomyces spp.	1
Title: CouO and NovO: C-methyltransferases for tailoring the aminocoumarin scaffold in coumermycin and novobiocin antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: During the biosynthesis of the streptomycete aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and the dimeric coumermycin A(1), the bicyclic coumarin scaffold is C-methylated adjacent to the phenolic oxygen. The SAM-dependent C-methyltransferases NovO and CouO have been heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and shown to act after the aminocoumarin ring has been constructed by prior action of Nov/CouHIJK. Neither C-methyltransferase works on the tyrosyl-derived S-pantetheinyl intermediates tethered to NovH or on the subsequently released free aminocoumarin. NovL ligates the aminocoumarin to prenylhydroxybenzoate to yield novobiocic acid, which is the substrate for NovO before it is O-glycosylated by NovM. In coumermycin assembly, the corresponding ligase CouL makes the bis-amide by tandem ligation of two aminocoumarins to a dicarboxypyrrole. CouO works on both the mono- and bis-amides for mono- and di-C-methylation adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl before it is glycosylated by CouM. Thus, the specific timing of C-methylation in the aminocoumarin antibiotic pathways is established.	1
Title: Colibactin assembly line enzymes use S-adenosylmethionine to build a cyclopropane ring Abstract: Despite containing an α-amino acid, the versatile cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is not a known building block for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we report an unusual NRPS module from colibactin biosynthesis that uses SAM for amide bond formation and subsequent cyclopropanation. Our findings showcase a new use for SAM and reveal a novel biosynthetic route to a functional group that likely mediates colibactin's genotoxicity.	0
Title: Production and properties of the native Chromobacterium violaceum fucose-binding lectin (CV-IIL) compared to homologous lectins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-IIL) and Ralstonia solanacearum (RS-IIL) Abstract: Chromobacterium violaceum is a versatile, violet pigment (violacein)-producing beta-proteobacterium, confined to tropical and subtropical regions, dwelling in soil and water, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia solanacearum. These three bacteria are saprophytes that occasionally become aggressive opportunistic pathogens virulently attacking animals (the first two) and plants (the third). The recent availability of their genome sequences enabled identification in the C. violaceum genome of an ORF (locus no. 1744) that is similar to those of P. aeruginosa and R. solanacearum lectins, PA-IIL and RS-IIL, respectively. A recombinant protein, CV-IIL, encoded by that ORF exhibited fucose>mannose-specific lectin activity resembling PA-IIL. This paper describes production and properties of the native CV-IIL, which, like PA-IIL and RS-IIL, is probably also a quorum-sensing-driven secondary metabolite, appearing concomitantly with violacein. Its formation is repressed in the CV026 mutant of C. violaceum, which lacks endogenous N-acylhomoserine lactone. The upstream extragenic sequence of its ORF contains a 20 bp sequence (5'-101-120) with partial similarities to the luxI-box and the related P. aeruginosa and R. solanacearum promoter boxes of quorum-sensing-controlled genes. The lectin level is augmented by addition of trehalose to the medium. The subunit size of CV-IIL (around 11.86 kDa) is similar to those of PA-IIL (11.73 kDa) and RS-IIL (11.60 kDa). Like PA-IIL, in the tetrameric form CV-IIL preferentially agglutinates alpha1-2 fucosylated H-positive human erythrocytes (regardless of their A, B or O type), as opposed to the O(h) Bombay type, but differs from it in having no interaction with rabbit erythrocytes and in displaying stronger affinity to l-galactose than to l-fucose. The greater similarity of CV-IIL to PA-IIL than to RS-IIL might be related to the selective adaptation of both C. violaceum and P. aeruginosa to animal tissues versus the preferential homing of R. solanacearum to plants.	0
Title: Integrated Omics Strategy Reveals Cyclic Lipopeptides Empedopeptins from Massilia sp. YMA4 and Their Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Empedopeptins-eight amino acid cyclic lipopeptides-are calcium-dependent antibiotics that act against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. However, to date, the biosynthetic mechanism of the empedopeptins has not been well identified. Through comparative genomics and metabolomics analysis, we identified empedopeptin and its new analogs from a marine bacterium, Massilia sp. YMA4. We then unveiled the empedopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. The core nonribosomal peptide gene null-mutant strains (ΔempC, ΔempD, and ΔempE) could not produce empedopeptin, while dioxygenase gene null-mutant strains (ΔempA and ΔempB) produced several unique empedopeptin analogs. However, the antibiotic activity of ΔempA and ΔempB was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type, demonstrating that the hydroxylated amino acid residues of empedopeptin and its analogs are important to their antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found seven bacterial strains that could produce empedopeptin-like cyclic lipopeptides using a genome mining approach. In summary, this study demonstrated that an integrated omics strategy can facilitate the discovery of potential bioactive metabolites from microbial sources without further isolation and purification.	1
Title: Aminoacylation of Indole Diterpenes by Cluster-Specific Monomodular NRPS-like Enzymes Abstract: Decoration of the core scaffolds of indole diterpene (IDT) natural products is key to generating structural and bioactivity diversity. Aminoacylation as a tailoring step is rarely linked to terpene biosynthesis and is extremely rare in IDT biosynthesis. Through heterologous pathway reconstruction, we have illuminated the genetic and biochemical basis for the only reported examples of aminoacylation in IDT biosynthesis, demonstrating the unusual involvement of monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like enzymes in IDT decoration.	1
Title: Characterization of the Jomthonic Acids Biosynthesis Pathway and Isolation of Novel Analogues in Streptomyces caniferus GUA-06-05-006A Abstract: Jomthonic acids (JAs) are a group of natural products (NPs) with adipogenic activity. Structurally, JAs are formed by a modified β-methylphenylalanine residue, whose biosynthesis involves a methyltransferase that in Streptomyces hygroscopicus has been identified as MppJ. Up to date, three JA members (A⁻C) and a few other natural products containing β-methylphenylalanine have been discovered from soil-derived microorganisms. Herein, we report the identification of a gene (jomM) coding for a putative methyltransferase highly identical to MppJ in the chromosome of the marine actinobacteria Streptomyces caniferus GUA-06-05-006A. In its 5' region, jomM clusters with two polyketide synthases (PKS) (jomP1, jomP2), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (jomN) and a thioesterase gene (jomT), possibly conforming a single transcriptional unit. Insertion of a strong constitutive promoter upstream of jomP1 led to the detection of JA A, along with at least two novel JA family members (D and E). Independent inactivation of jomP1, jomN and jomM abolished production of JA A, JA D and JA E, indicating the involvement of these genes in JA biosynthesis. Heterologous expression of the JA biosynthesis cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 and in Streptomyces albus J1074 led to the production of JA A, B, C and F. We propose a pathway for JAs biosynthesis based on the findings here described.	1
Title: Reconstitution of biosynthetic machinery for the synthesis of the highly elaborated indole diterpene penitrem Abstract: Penitrem A is one of the most elaborated members of the fungal indole diterpenes. Two separate penitrem gene clusters were identified using genomic and RNA sequencing data, and 13 out of 17 transformations in the penitrem biosynthesis were elucidated by heterologous reconstitution of the relevant genes. These reactions involve 1) a prenylation-initiated cationic cyclization to install the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane skeleton (PtmE), 2) a two-step P450-catalyzed oxidative processes forming the unique tricyclic penitrem skeleton (PtmK and PtmU), and 3) five sequential oxidative transformations (PtmKULNJ). Importantly, without conventional gene disruption, reconstitution of the biosynthetic machinery provided sufficient data to determine the pathway. It was thus demonstrated that the Aspergillus oryzae reconstitution system is a powerful method for studying the biosynthesis of complex natural products.	1
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the pacidamycin group of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics Abstract: Pacidamycins are a family of uridyl tetra/pentapeptide antibiotics that act on the translocase MraY to block bacterial cell wall assembly. To elucidate the biosynthetic logic of pacidamcyins, a putative gene cluster was identified by 454 shotgun genome sequencing of the producer Streptomyces coeruleorubidus NRRL 18370. The 31-kb gene cluster encodes 22 proteins (PacA-V), including highly dissociated nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules and a variety of tailoring enzymes. Gene deletions confirmed that two NRPSs, PacP and PacO, are required for the biosynthesis of pacidamycins. Heterologous expression and in vitro assays of PacL, PacO, and PacP established reversible formation of m-Tyr-AMP, l-Ala-AMP, and diaminopropionyl-AMP, respectively, consistent with the amino acids found in pacidamycin scaffolds. The unusual Ala(4)-Phe(5) dipeptidyl ureido linkage was formed during in vitro assays containing purified PacL, PacJ, PacN, and PacO. Both the genetic and enzymatic studies validate identification of the biosynthetic genes for this subclass of uridyl peptide antibiotics and provide the basis for future mechanistic study of their biosynthesis.	1
Title: Iodine-Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol Abstract: Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco-social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2-mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuI I2 ]- species, which undergoes subsequent ligand-exchange reactions and forms a stable bis-ligand AuI complex. H2 O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.	0
Title: Targeted metagenomics: finding rare tryptophan dimer natural products in the environment Abstract: Natural product discovery from environmental genomes (metagenomics) has largely been limited to the screening of existing environmental DNA (eDNA) libraries. Here, we have coupled a chemical-biogeographic survey of chromopyrrolic acid synthase (CPAS) gene diversity with targeted eDNA library production to more efficiently access rare tryptophan dimer (TD) biosynthetic gene clusters. A combination of traditional and synthetic biology-based heterologous expression efforts using eDNA-derived gene clusters led to the production of hydroxysporine (1) and reductasporine (2), two bioactive TDs. As suggested by our phylogenetic analysis of CPAS genes, identified in our survey of crude eDNA extracts, reductasporine (2) contains an unprecedented TD core structure: a pyrrolinium indolocarbazole core that is likely key to its unusual bioactivity profile. This work demonstrates the potential for the discovery of structurally rare and biologically interesting natural products using targeted metagenomics, where environmental samples are prescreened to identify the most phylogenetically unique gene sequences and molecules associated with these genes are accessed through targeted metagenomic library construction and heterologous expression.	1
Title: Shimalactone Biosynthesis Involves Spontaneous Double Bicyclo-Ring Formation with 8π-6π Electrocyclization Abstract: Shimalactones A and B are neuritogenic polyketides possessing characteristic oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene ring systems that are produced by the marine fungus Emericella variecolor GF10. We identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster and conducted heterologous expression analysis. Expression of ShmA polyketide synthase in Aspergillus oryzae resulted in the production of preshimalactone. Aspergillus oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants expressing ShmA and ShmB produced shimalactones A and B, thus suggesting that the double bicyclo-ring formation reactions proceed non-enzymatically from preshimalactone epoxide. DFT calculations strongly support the idea that oxabicyclo-ring formation and 8π-6π electrocyclization proceed spontaneously after opening of the preshimalactone epoxide ring through protonation. We confirmed the formation of preshimalactone epoxide in vitro, followed by its non-enzymatic conversion to shimalactones in the dark.	1
Title: S-layer glycan-specific loci on the chromosome of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a and dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis potential of G. stearothermophilus strains Abstract: The approximately 16.5 kb surface layer (S-layer) glycan biosynthesis (slg) gene cluster of the Gram-positive thermophile Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a has been sequenced. The cluster is located immediately downstream of the S-layer structural gene sgsE and consists of 13 ORFs that have been identified by database sequence comparisons. The cluster encodes dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis (rml operon), required for building up the polyrhamnan S-layer glycan, as well as for assembly and export of the elongated glycan chain, and its transfer to the S-layer protein. This is the first report of a gene cluster likely to be involved in the glycosylation of an S-layer protein. There is evidence that this cluster is transcribed as a polycistronic unit, whereas sgsE is transcribed monocistronically. To get insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying glycosylation of the S-layer protein, the influence of growth temperature on the S-layer was investigated in seven closely related G. stearothermophilus strains, of which only strain NRS 2004/3a possessed a glycosylated S-layer. Chromosomal DNA preparations of these strains were screened for the presence of the rml operon, because L-rhamnose is a frequent constituent of S-layer glycans. From rml-positive strains, flanking regions of the operon were sequenced. Comparison with the slg gene cluster of G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a revealed sequence homologies between adjacent genes. The temperature inducibility of S-layer protein glycosylation was investigated in those strains by raising the growth temperature from 55 degrees C to 67 degrees C; no change of either the protein banding pattern or the glycan staining behaviour was observed on SDS-PAGE gels, although the sgsE transcript was several-fold more abundant at 67 degrees C. Cell-free extracts of the strains were capable of converting dTDP-D-glucose to dtdp-L-rhamnose. Taken together, the results indicate that the rml locus is highly conserved among G. stearothermophilus strains, and that in the investigated rml-containing strains, dTDP-L-rhamnose is actively synthesized in vitro. However, in contrast to previous reports for G. stearothermophilus wild-type strains, an increase in growth temperature did not switch an S-layer protein phenotype to an S-layer glycoprotein phenotype, via the de novo generation of a new S-layer gene sequence.	1
Title: Mapping tenascin-C interaction with toll-like receptor 4 reveals a new subset of endogenous inflammatory triggers Abstract: Pattern recognition underpins innate immunity; the accurate identification of danger, including infection, injury, or tumor, is key to an appropriately targeted immune response. Pathogen detection is increasingly well defined mechanistically, but the discrimination of endogenous inflammatory triggers remains unclear. Tenascin-C, a matrix protein induced upon tissue damage and expressed by tumors, activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated sterile inflammation. Here we map three sites within tenascin-C that directly and cooperatively interact with TLR4. We also identify a conserved inflammatory epitope in related proteins from diverse families, and demonstrate that its presence targets molecules for TLR detection, while its absence enables escape of innate immune surveillance. These data reveal a unique molecular code that defines endogenous proteins as inflammatory stimuli by marking them for recognition by TLRs.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the class III lantipeptide catenulipeptin Abstract: Lantipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides containing lanthionine and/or labionin structures. In this study, a novel class III lantipeptide termed catenulipeptin was discovered from Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928, and its biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro. The multifunctional enzyme AciKC catalyzes both dehydration and cyclization of its peptide substrate AciA and installs two labionin structures in catenulipeptin. AciKC shows promiscuity with respect to cosubstrate and accepts all four NTPs. The C-terminal domain of AciKC is responsible for the labionin formation in catenulipeptin. The cyclase activity of AciKC requires the leader peptide of AciA substrate but does not require ATP or Zn(2+). Mutagenesis studies suggest that the labionin cyclization may proceed in a C-to-N-terminal direction. Catenulipeptin partially restores aerial hyphae growth when applied to surfactin-treated Streptomyces coelicolor.	1
Title: The Phormidolide Biosynthetic Gene Cluster: A trans-AT PKS Pathway Encoding a Toxic Macrocyclic Polyketide Abstract: Phormidolide is a polyketide produced by a cultured filamentous marine cyanobacterium and incorporates a 16-membered macrolactone. Its complex structure is recognizably derived from a polyketide synthase pathway, but possesses unique and intriguing structural features that prompted interest in investigating its biosynthetic origin. Stable isotope incorporation experiments confirmed the polyketide nature of this compound. We further characterized the phormidolide gene cluster (phm) through genome sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis. Two discrete trans-type acyltransferase (trans-AT) ORFs along with KS-AT adaptor regions (ATd) within the polyketide synthase (PKS) megasynthases, suggest that the phormidolide gene cluster is a trans-AT PKS. Insights gained from analysis of the mode of acetate incorporation and ensuing keto reduction prompted our reevaluation of the stereochemistry of phormidolide hydroxy groups located along the linear polyketide chain.	1
Title: Ustilago maydis produces itaconic acid via the unusual intermediate trans-aconitate Abstract: Itaconic acid is an important biomass-derived chemical building block but has also recently been identified as a metabolite produced in mammals, which has antimicrobial activity. The biosynthetic pathway of itaconic acid has been elucidated in the ascomycetous fungus Aspergillus terreus and in human macrophages. In both organisms itaconic acid is generated by decarboxylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. Here, we show that the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis uses an alternative pathway and produces itaconic acid via trans-aconitate, the thermodynamically favoured isomer of cis-aconitate. We have identified a gene cluster that contains all genes involved in itaconic acid formation. Trans-aconitate is generated from cis-aconitate by a cytosolic aconitate-Δ-isomerase (Adi1) that belongs to the PrpF family of proteins involved in bacterial propionate degradation. Decarboxylation of trans-aconitate is catalyzed by a novel enzyme, trans-aconitate decarboxylase (Tad1). Tad1 displays significant sequence similarity with bacterial 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes (CMLE). This suggests that U. maydis has evolved an alternative biosynthetic pathway for itaconate production using the toxic intermediate trans-aconitate. Overexpression of a pathway-specific transcription factor (Ria1) or a mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid transporter (Mtt1) resulted in a twofold increase in itaconate yield. Therefore, our findings offer new strategies for biotechnological production of this valuable biomass-derived chemical.	1
Title: Antimicrobial and antiproliferative prospective of kosinostatin - a secondary metabolite isolated from Streptomyces sp Abstract: Cancer is a communal health hazard worldwide. The present investigation attempts to evaluate antimicrobial and anticancer potential of kosinostatin on mammary carcinoma cell line (MCF-7). The anticancer and antiproliferative activities of kosinostatin were analyzed on MCF cell line by MTT assay and cytotoxicity assays like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione (GSH). The secondary metabolite kosinostatin exhibited its apoptotic nature by expressing p53 protein. Collectively, the results acquired from this study promise that kosinostatin shows the potent anticancer activity.	1
Title: Microcystin biosynthesis in planktothrix: genes, evolution, and manipulation Abstract: Microcystins represent an extraordinarily large family of cyclic heptapeptide toxins that are nonribosomally synthesized by various cyanobacteria. Microcystins specifically inhibit the eukaryotic protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Their outstanding variability makes them particularly useful for studies on the evolution of structure-function relationships in peptide synthetases and their genes. Analyses of microcystin synthetase genes provide valuable clues for the potential and limits of combinatorial biosynthesis. We have sequenced and analyzed 55.6 kb of the potential microcystin synthetase gene (mcy) cluster from the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii CYA 126. The cluster contains genes for peptide synthetases (mcyABC), polyketide synthases (PKSs; mcyD), chimeric enzymes composed of peptide synthetase and PKS modules (mcyEG), a putative thioesterase (mcyT), a putative ABC transporter (mcyH), and a putative peptide-modifying enzyme (mcyJ). The gene content and arrangement and the sequence of specific domains in the gene products differ from those of the mcy cluster in Microcystis, a unicellular cyanobacterium. The data suggest an evolution of mcy clusters from, rather than to, genes for nodularin (a related pentapeptide) biosynthesis. Our data do not support the idea of horizontal gene transfer of complete mcy gene clusters between the genera. We have established a protocol for stable genetic transformation of Planktothrix, a genus that is characterized by multicellular filaments exhibiting continuous motility. Targeted mutation of mcyJ revealed its function as a gene coding for a O-methyltransferase. The mutant cells produce a novel microcystin variant exhibiting reduced inhibitory activity toward protein phosphatases.	1
Title: A mutation in P23, the first gene in the RNA polymerase sigma A (sigma 43) operon, affects sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Mutations within P23, the first gene of the Bacillus subtilis sigma A operon, were not detrimental to vegetative growth or sporulation. One deletion of P23 resulted in a strain that sporulated earlier than the wild type. This aberrant phenotype may be due to the simultaneous deletion of a sigma H promoter from the sigma A operon.	0
Title: Unprecedented Utilization of Pelargonidin and Indole for the Biosynthesis of Plant Indole Alkaloids Abstract: Nudicaulins are a group of indole alkaloid glycosides responsible for the color of yellow petals of Papaver nudicaule (Iceland poppy). The unique aglycone scaffold of these alkaloids attracted our interest as one of the most unusual flavonoid-indole hybrid structures that occur in nature. Stable isotope labeling experiments with sliced petals identified free indole, but not tryptamine or l-tryptophan, as one of the two key biosynthetic precursors of the nudicaulin aglycone. Pelargonidin was identified as the second key precursor, contributing the polyphenolic unit to the nudicaulin molecule. This finding was inferred from the temporary accumulation of pelargonidin glycosides in the petals during flower bud development and a drop at the point in time when nudicaulin levels start to increase. The precursor-directed incorporation of cyanidin into a new 3'-hydroxynudicaulin strongly supports the hypothesis that anthocyanins are involved in the biosynthesis of nudicaulins.	0
Title: Overproduction, purification and characterization of FgaPT2, a dimethylallyltryptophan synthase from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: A putative dimethylallyltryptophan synthase gene, fgaPT2, was identified in the genome sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus. fgaPT2 was cloned and overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein FgaPT2 was purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. This enzyme was found to convert L-tryptophan to 4-dimethylallyltryptophan, a reaction known to be the first step in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis. FgaPT2 is a soluble, dimeric protein with a subunit size of 52 kDa, and contains no putative prenyl diphosphate binding site (N/D)DXXD. Km values for L-tryptophan and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) were determined as 8 and 4 microM, respectively. Metal ions, such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, enhance the reaction velocity, but are not essential for the enzymic reaction. FgaPT2 showed a relatively strict substrate specificity for both tryptophan and DMAPP. FgaPT2 is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids to be purified and characterized in homogeneous form after heterologous overproduction.	1
Title: Modular synthase-encoding gene involved in α-olefin biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 Abstract: A gene involved in the production of medium-chain α-olefins was identified in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. The gene encodes a large multidomain protein with homology to type I polyketide synthases, suggesting a route for hydrocarbon biosynthesis from fatty acids via an elongation decarboxylation mechanism.	1
Title: Diversity and movement of indoor Alternaria alternata across the mainland USA Abstract: Alternaria spp. from sect. Alternaria are frequently associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asthma and allergic fungal rhinitis and sinusitis. Since Alternaria is omnipresent in the outdoor environment, it is thought that the indoor spore concentration is mainly influenced by the outdoor spore concentration. However, few studies have investigated indoor Alternaria isolates, or attempted a phylogeographic or population genetic approach to investigate their movement. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the molecular diversity of indoor Alternaria isolates in the USA, and to test for recombination, using these approaches. Alternaria isolates collected throughout the USA were identified using ITS, gapdh and endoPG gene sequencing. This was followed by genotyping and population genetic inference of isolates belonging to Alternaria sect. Alternaria together with 37 reference isolates, using five microsatellite markers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that species of Alternaria sect. Alternaria represented 98% (153 isolates) of the indoor isolates collected throughout the USA, of which 137 isolates could be assigned to A. alternata, 15 to the A. arborescens species complex and a single isolate to A. burnsii. The remaining 2% (3 isolates) represented sect. Infectoriae (single isolate) and sect. Pseudoulocladium (2 isolates). Population assignment analyses of the 137 A. alternata isolates suggested that subpopulations did not exist within the sample. The A. alternata isolates were thus divided into four artificial subpopulations to represent four quadrants of the USA. Forty-four isolates representing the south-western quadrant displayed the highest level of uniqueness based on private alleles, while the highest level of gene flow was detected between the south-eastern (32 isolates) and south-western quadrants. Genotypic diversity was high for all quadrants, and a test for linkage disequilibrium suggested that A. alternata has a cryptic sexual cycle. These statistics could be correlated with environmental factors, suggesting that indoor A. alternata isolates, although extremely diverse, have a continental distribution and high levels of gene flow over the continent.	0
Title: Genetic localization and heterologous expression of validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. limoneus KCCM 11405 (IFO 12704) Abstract: The validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. limoneus KTCC 1715 (IFO 12704) using a pair of degenerated PCR primers designed from the sequence of AcbC, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase in the acarbose biosynthesis. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the 37-kb DNA region revealed 22 complete ORFs including vldA, the acbC ortholog. Located around vldA, vldB to K were predicted to encode adenyltransferase, kinase, ketoreductase (or epimerase/dehydratase), glycosyltransferase, aminotransferase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase/phosphomutase, glycosyl hydrolase, transport protein, and glycosyltransferase, respectively. Apparently absent were any regulatory components within the sequenced region. The disruption of vldA abolished the validamycin biosynthesis and the plasmid-based complementation with vldABC restored production to the vldA-mutant; this substantiated that vldABC are essential to validamycin biosynthesis. This finding enabled us to discover the complete validamycin biosynthetic cluster. The cosmid clone of pJWS3001 harboring the 37-kb DNA region conferred validamycin-accumulation to Streptomyces lividans, indicating that the entire gene cluster of validamycin biosynthesis had been isolated. Additionally, Streptomyces albus, transformed with pJWS3001, produced a high level of alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity in a R2YE liquid culture, which highlights the portability of the cluster within Streptomyces. The product of vldI was characterized as a glucoamylase (kcat, 32 s(-1); K(m), 5 mg/ml of starch) that does not play any apparent role in the validamycin biosynthesis. In order to characterize the upstream region, a vldW knockout was achieved via gene-replacement. A phenotypic study of the resulting mutant revealed that vldW is not essential for the host's ability to control Pellicularia filamentosa growth. The current information suggests that vldA to vldH is the genetic region essential to validamycin biosynthesis. This promises excellent opportunities to elucidate biosynthetic route(s) to the validamycin complex and to engineer the pathway for industrial application.	1
Title: Control of the Stereochemical Course of [4+2] Cycloaddition during trans-Decalin Formation by Fsa2-Family Enzymes Abstract: Enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition has been proposed to be a key transformation process in various natural product biosynthetic pathways. Recently Fsa2 was found to be involved in stereospecific trans-decalin formation during the biosynthesis of equisetin, a potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitor. To understand the mechanisms by which fsa2 determines the stereochemistry of reaction products, we sought an fsa2 homologue that is involved in trans-decalin formation in the biosynthetic pathway of an enantiomerically opposite analogue, and we found phm7, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phomasetin. A decalin skeleton with an unnatural configuration was successfully constructed by gene replacement of phm7 with fsa2, thus demonstrating enzymatic control of all stereochemistry in the [4+2] cycloaddition. Our findings highlight enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition as a stereochemically divergent step in natural product biosynthetic pathways and open new avenues for generating derivatives with different stereochemistry.	1
Title: Unlocking the Spatial Control of Secondary Metabolism Uncovers Hidden Natural Product Diversity in Nostoc punctiforme Abstract: Filamentous cyanobacteria belong to the most prolific producers of structurally unique and biologically active natural products, yet the majority of biosynthetic gene clusters predicted for these multicellular collectives are currently orphan. Here, we present a systems analysis of secondary metabolite gene expression in the model strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 using RNA-seq and fluorescence reporter analysis. Our data demonstrate that the majority of the cryptic gene clusters are not silent but are expressed with regular or sporadic pattern. Cultivation of N. punctiforme using high-density fermentation overrules the spatial control and leads to a pronounced upregulation of more than 50% of biosynthetic gene clusters. Our data suggest that a combination of autocrine factors, a high CO2 level, and high light account for the upregulation of individual pathways. Our overarching study not only sheds light on the strategies of filamentous cyanobacteria to share the enormous metabolic burden connected with the production of specialized molecules but provides an avenue for the genome-based discovery of natural products in multicellular cyanobacteria as exemplified by the discovery of highly unusual variants of the tricyclic peptide microviridin.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of a monooxygenase involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: A monooxygenase encoded by the mtmOIV gene from the mithramycin gene cluster of Streptomyces argillaceus was purified 21-fold by a three-step purification procedure. This monooxygenase catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B. The enzyme was dependent on NADPH and flavin adenine dinucleotide for activity with optimal pH at 9.5, and the K(m) values for NADPH and premithramycin B were 269.22 and 23.35 micro M, respectively. The reaction catalyzed by MtmOIV yields two possible isomers of the same basic shortened aliphatic chain molecule. One of the reaction products showed important biological activity, thus highlighting the importance of the cleavage of the fourth ring of the aglycon for biological activity.	1
Title: Hydroxylations of trichothecene rings in the biosynthesis of Fusarium trichothecenes: evolution of alternative pathways in the nivalenol chemotype Abstract: Fusarium sporotrichioides genes FsTri11, FsTri13, and FsTri1 encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) responsible for hydroxylations at C-15, C-4, and C-8 of the trichothecene skeleton, respectively. However, the corresponding genes of nivalenol (NIV)-chemotype Fusarium graminearum remain to be functionally elucidated. In this study, we characterized the roles of these CYPs in NIV biosynthesis. Analyses of the metabolites of the F. graminearum Fgtri11- mutant, a disruptant of FgTri11 encoding isotrichodermin (ITD) C-15 hydroxylase, revealed a small amount of NIV-type trichothecenes suggesting that an alternative C-15 hydroxylase partially complemented FgTRI11p. In contrast, the C-7/C-8 hydroxylations depended solely on FgTRI1p, as suggested by the metabolite profiles of the Fgtri11- Fgtri1- double gene disruptant. Disruption of FgTri1 in both the wild-type and Fgtri13- mutant backgrounds revealed that FgTRI13p exhibits marginal activity toward calonectrin (CAL) and that it was the only C-4 hydroxylase. In addition, feeding experiments demonstrated that the C-4 hydroxylation of a 7-hydroxytrichothecene lacking C-8 ketone was extremely limited. The marginal activity of FgTRI13p toward CAL was advantageous for the C-7/C-8 hydroxylation steps in NIV biosynthesis, as transformation of a C-4 oxygenated trichothecene lacking C-7/C-8 modifications into NIV-type trichothecenes was quite inefficient. The significance of hydroxylation steps in the evolution of Fusarium trichothecenes is discussed.	1
Title: Structure and action of the N-oxygenase AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: Nitro groups are found in a number of bioactive compounds. Most of them arise by a stepwise mono-oxygenation of amino groups. One of the involved enzymes is AurF participating in the biosynthesis of aureothin. Its structure was established at 2.1 A resolution showing a homodimer with a binuclear manganese cluster. The enzyme preparation, which yielded the analyzed crystals, showed activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. Chain fold and cluster are homologous with ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 and related enzymes. The two manganese ions and an iron content of about 15% were established by anomalous X-ray diffraction. A comparison of the cluster with more common di-iron clusters suggested an additional histidine in the coordination sphere to cause the preference for manganese over iron. There is no oxo-bridge. The substrate p-amino-benzoate was modeled into the active center. The model is supported by mutant activity measurements. It shows the geometry of the reaction and explains the established substrate spectrum.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthetic assembly of cupriachelin, a photoreactive siderophore from the bioplastic producer Cupriavidus necator H16 Abstract: The bacterium Cupriavidus necator H16 produces a family of linear lipopeptides when grown under low iron conditions. The structural composition of these molecules, exemplified by the main metabolite cupriachelin, is reminiscent of siderophores that are excreted by marine bacteria. Comparable to marine siderophores, the ferric form of cupriachelin exhibits photoreactive properties. Exposure to UV light induces an oxidation of its peptidic backbone and a concomitant reduction of the coordinated Fe(III). Here, we report the genomics-inspired isolation and structural characterization of cupriachelin as well as its encoding gene cluster, which was identified by insertional mutagenesis. Based upon the functional characterization of adenylation domain specificity, a model for cupriachelin biosynthesis is proposed.	1
Title: Screening a Natural Product-Based Library against Kinetoplastid Parasites Abstract: Kinetoplastid parasites cause vector-borne parasitic diseases including leishmaniasis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Chagas disease. These Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impact on some of the world's lowest socioeconomic communities. Current treatments for these diseases cause severe toxicity and have limited efficacy, highlighting the need to identify new treatments. In this study, the Davis open access natural product-based library was screened against kinetoplastids (Leishmania donovani DD8, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi) using phenotypic assays. The aim of this study was to identify hit compounds, with a focus on improved efficacy, selectivity and potential to target several kinetoplastid parasites. The IC50 values of the natural products were obtained for L. donovani DD8, T. b. brucei and T. cruzi in addition to cytotoxicity against the mammalian cell lines, HEK-293, 3T3 and THP-1 cell lines were determined to ascertain parasite selectivity. Thirty-one compounds were identified with IC50 values of ≤ 10 µM against the kinetoplastid parasites tested. Lissoclinotoxin E (1) was the only compound identified with activity across all three investigated parasites, exhibiting IC50 values < 5 µM. In this study, natural products with the potential to be new chemical starting points for drug discovery efforts for kinetoplastid diseases were identified.	0
Title: In situ activity of NAC11-7 roseobacters in coastal waters off the Chesapeake Bay based on ftsZ expression Abstract: Determining in situ growth rates for specific bacterioplankton is of critical importance to understanding their contributions to energy and matter flow in the Ocean. Quantifying expression of genes central to cell division is a plausible approach for obtaining these measurements. In order to test this approach's assumptions, a quantitative PCR assay targeting the cell division gene ftsZ in the ubiquitous NAC11-7 group of the Rhodobacterales order of marine bacteria was developed. ftsZ genes and their corresponding mRNAs were measured in diel in situ samples and in parallel on-deck incubations. Strong correlations between ftsZ expression and gene abundance (R-squared = 0.62) were observed in situ. Rapid changes in NAC11-7 ftsZ gene copies suggested that different populations from different water types were sampled with a significant positive correlation between ftsZ expression and water temperature (R-squared = 0.68, P < 0.001). An outlier to this trend occurred at a single time point (9:00), which was remarkably consistent with a concomitant peak in ftsZ expression in on-deck incubations, suggesting the possibility of synchronous population growth.	0
Title: Gene cluster for ferric iron uptake in Agrobacterium tumefaciens MAFF301001 Abstract: Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring a Ti plasmid causes crown gall disease in dicot plants by transferring its T-DNA into plant chromosomes. Iron acquisition plays an important role for pathogenicity in animal pathogens and several phytopathogens and for growth in the rhizosphere and on plant surfaces. Under iron-limiting condition, bacteria produce various iron-chelating agents called siderophores. Agrobacterium strains have the diversity in producing siderophores and a certain strain produces a typical catechol-type siderophore, called agrobactin, although its biosynthesis genes have not been analyzed yet. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a functional gene cluster involved in ferric iron uptake in A. tumefaciens strain MAFF301001. Four complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found in 5-kb region of a genomic library clone 1A3. We named these genes agb, after agrobactin. agbC, agbE, agbB and agbA genes were identified in this order, and narrow intergenic spaces suggested that these genes constitute an operon. Predicted agb gene products and their phylogenetic analysis showed sequence similarity with enzymes which are involved in ferric iron uptake in other bacteria. Southern hybridization analysis clearly indicated the location of agb genes on the linear chromosome in strain MAFF301001 but the complete lack in another A. tumefaciens strain C58. Mutation analysis of agbB revealed that it is essential for growth and production of catechol compounds in iron-limiting medium.	1
Title: Endophenazines A-D, new phenazine antibiotics from the athropod associated endosymbiont Streptomyces anulatus II. Structure elucidation Abstract: A detailed screening of the secondary metabolite pattern produced by different athropod associated strains of the species Streptomyces anulatus resulted in the isolation and structure elucidation of the endophenazines A-D (2, 4-6). The structures were assigned by spectroscopic methods and chemical transformations. 4 represents a chromophoric system based on a phenazin-7-one, 5 and 6 are new 5,10-dihydrophenazine derivatives.	1
Title: Stress-responsive systems set specific limits to the overproduction of membrane proteins in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Essential membrane proteins are generally recognized as relevant potential drug targets due to their exposed localization in the cell envelope. Unfortunately, high-level production of membrane proteins for functional and structural analyses is often problematic. This is mainly due to their high overall hydrophobicity. To develop new concepts for membrane protein overproduction, we investigated whether the biogenesis of overproduced membrane proteins is affected by stress response-related proteolytic systems in the membrane. For this purpose, the well-established expression host Bacillus subtilis was used to overproduce eight essential membrane proteins from B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The results show that the sigma(W) regulon (responding to cell envelope perturbations) and the CssRS two-component regulatory system (responding to unfolded exported proteins) set critical limits to membrane protein production in large quantities. The identified sigW or cssRS mutant B. subtilis strains with significantly improved capacity for membrane protein production are interesting candidate expression hosts for fundamental research and biotechnological applications. Importantly, our results pinpoint the interdependent expression and function of membrane-associated proteases as key parameters in bacterial membrane protein production.	0
Title: The calicheamicin gene cluster and its iterative type I enediyne PKS Abstract: The enediynes exemplify nature's ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Development of a High-Throughput, In Vivo Selection Platform for NADPH-Dependent Reactions Based on Redox Balance Principles Abstract: Bacteria undergoing anaerobic fermentation must maintain redox balance. In vivo metabolic evolution schemes based on this principle have been limited to targeting NADH-dependent reactions. Here, we developed a facile, specific, and high-throughput growth-based selection platform for NADPH-consuming reactions in vivo, based on an engineered NADPH-producing glycolytic pathway in Escherichia coli. We used the selection system in the directed evolution of a NADH-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii toward utilization of NADPH. Through one round of selection, we obtained multiple enzyme variants with superior NADPH-dependent activities and protein expression levels; these mutants may serve as important tools in biomanufacturing d-lactate as a renewable polymer building block. Importantly, sequence analysis and computational protein modeling revealed that diverging evolutionary paths during the selection resulted in two distinct cofactor binding modes, which suggests that the high throughput of our selection system allowed deep searching of protein sequence space to discover diverse candidates en masse.	0
Title: From Stable PH-Ylides to α-Carbanionic Phosphines as Ligands for Zwitterionic Catalysts Abstract: Although ylides are commonly used reagents in organic synthesis, the parent methylphosphine MePH2 only exists in its phosphine form in the condensed phase. Its ylide tautomer H3 P+ -CH2 - is considerably higher in energy. Here, we report on the formation of bis(sulfonyl)methyl-substituted phosphines of the type (RO2 S)2 C(H)-PR2, which form stable PH ylides under ambient conditions, amongst the first examples of an acyclic phosphine which only exists in its PH ylide form. Depending on the exact substitution pattern the phosphines form an equilibrium between the PH ylide and the phosphine form or exist as one of both extremes. These phosphines were found to be ideal starting systems for the facile formation of α-carbanionic phosphines. The carbanion-functionalization leads to a switch from electron-poor to highly electron-rich phosphines with strong donor abilities and high basicities. Thus, the phosphines readily react with different electrophiles exclusively at the phosphorus atom and not at the carbanionic center. Furthermore, the anionic nature of the phosphines allows the formation of zwitterionic complexes as demonstrated by the isolation of a gold(I) complex with a cationic metal center. The cationic gold center allows for catalytic activity in the hydroamination of alkyne without requiring a further activation step.	0
Title: A gene located downstream of the clavulanic acid gene cluster in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 encodes a putative response regulator that affects clavulanic acid production Abstract: Three open reading frames denoted as orf21, orf22, and orf23 were identified from downstream of the currently recognized gene cluster for clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064. The new orfs were annotated after in silico analysis as genes encoding a putative sigma factor, a sensor kinase, and a response regulator. The roles of the individual genes were explored by disruption of the corresponding orfs, and the morphological and antibiotic production phenotypes of the resulting mutants were compared. In orf21 and orf22 mutants, no growth or morphological differences were noted, but modest reduction of cephamycin C (orf21), or both cephamycin C and clavulanic acid production (orf22) compared with wild-type, were observed. In orf23 mutant, cell growth and sporulation was retarded, and clavulanic acid and cephamycin C production were reduced to 40 and 47% of wild-type levels, respectively. Conversely, overexpression of orf23 caused precocious hyperproduction of spores on solid medium, and antibiotic production was increased above the levels seen in plasmid control cultures. Transcriptional analyses were also carried out on orf23 and showed that mutation had little effect on transcription of genes associated with the early stages of cephamycin C or clavulanic acid production but transcription of claR, which regulates the late stages of clavulanic acid production, was reduced in orf23 mutants. These observations suggest that the orf23 product may enable S. clavuligerus to respond to environmental changes by altering cell growth and differentiation. In addition, the effects of ORF23 on growth might indirectly regulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as clavulanic acid and cephamycin C.	1
Title: Curcuminoids block TGF-β signaling in human breast cancer cells and limit osteolysis in a murine model of breast cancer bone metastasis Abstract: Effects of curcuminoids on breast cancer cell secretion of the bone-resorptive peptide parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and on lytic breast cancer bone metastasis were evaluated. In vitro, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion was inhibited by curcuminoids (IC50 = 24 μM) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells independent of effects on cell growth inhibition. Effects on TGF-β signaling revealed decreases in phospho-Smad2/3 and Ets-1 protein levels with no effect on p-38 MAPK-mediated TGF-β signaling. In vivo, mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells into the left cardiac ventricle and treated ip every other day with curcuminoids (25 or 50 mg/kg) for 21 days. Osteolytic bone lesion area was reduced up to 51% (p < 0.01). Consistent with specific effects on bone osteolysis, osteoclast number at the bone-tumor interface was reduced up to 53% (p < 0.05), while tumor area within bone was unaltered. In a separate study, tumor mass in orthotopic mammary xenografts was also unaltered by treatment. These data suggest that curcuminoids prevent TGF-β induction of PTHrP and reduce osteolytic bone destruction by blockade of Smad signaling in breast cancer cells.	0
Title: A two-step sulfation in antibiotic biosynthesis requires a type III polyketide synthase Abstract: Caprazamycins (CPZs) belong to a group of liponucleoside antibiotics inhibiting the bacterial MraY translocase, an essential enzyme involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We have recently identified analogs that are decorated with a sulfate group at the 2″-hydroxy of the aminoribosyl moiety, and we now report an unprecedented two-step sulfation mechanism during the biosynthesis of CPZs. A type III polyketide synthase (PKS) known as Cpz6 is used in the biosynthesis of a group of new triketide pyrones that are subsequently sulfated by an unusual 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-dependent sulfotransferase (Cpz8) to yield phenolic sulfate esters, which serve as sulfate donors for a PAPS-independent arylsulfate sulfotransferase (Cpz4) to generate sulfated CPZs. This finding is to our knowledge the first demonstration of genuine sulfate donors for an arylsulfate sulfotransferase and the first report of a type III PKS to generate a chemical reagent in bacterial sulfate metabolism.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of Streptomyces galilaeus aclacinomycins polyketide synthase (PKS) cluster Abstract: We have cloned and sequenced polyketide synthase (PKS) genes from the aclacinomycin producer Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31,615. The sequenced 13.5-kb region contained 13 complete genes. Their organization as well as their protein sequences showed high similarity to those of other type II PKS genes. The continuous region included the genes for the minimal PKS, consisting of ketosynthase I (aknB), ketosynthase II (aknC), and acyl carrier protein (aknD). These were followed by the daunomycin dpsC and dpsD homologues (aknE2 and F, respectively), which are rare in type II PKS clusters. They are associated with the unusual starter unit, propionate, used in the biosynthesis of aklavinone, a common precursor of aclacinomycin and daunomycin. Accordingly, when aclacinomycins minimal PKS genes were substituted for those of nogalamycin in the plasmid carrying genes for auramycinone biosynthesis, aklavinone was produced in the heterologous hosts. In addition to the minimal PKS, the cloned region included the PKS genes for polyketide ketoreductase (aknA), aromatase (aknE1) and oxygenase (aknX), as well as genes putatively encoding an aklanonic acid methyl transferase (aknG) and an aklanonic acid methyl ester cyclase (aknH) for post-polyketide steps were found. Moreover, the region carried genes for an activator (aknI), a glycosyl transferase (aknK) and an epimerase (aknL) taking part in deoxysugar biosynthesis.	1
Title: Programming in situ immunofluorescence intensities through interchangeable reactions of dynamic DNA complexes Abstract: The regulation of antibody reporting intensities is critical to various in situ fluorescence-imaging analyses. Although such control is often necessary to visualize sparse molecular targets, the ability to tune marker intensities is also essential for highly multiplexed imaging strategies in which marker reporting levels must be tuned both to optimize dynamic detection ranges and to minimize crosstalk between different signals. Existing chemical amplification approaches generally lack such control. Here, we demonstrate that linear and branched DNA complexes can be designed to function as interchangeable building blocks that can be assembled into organized, fluorescence-reporting complexes. We show that the ability to program DNA-strand-displacement reactions between these complexes offers new opportunities to deterministically tune the number of dyes that are coupled to individual antibodies in order both to increase and controllably balance marker reporting levels within fixed cells.	0
Title: Unusual acetylation-dependent reaction cascade in the biosynthesis of the pyrroloindole drug physostigmine Abstract: Physostigmine is a parasympathomimetic drug used to treat a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Because of its potent biological activity and unique pyrroloindole skeleton, physostigmine has been the target of many organic syntheses. However, the biosynthesis of physostigmine has been relatively understudied. In this study, we identified a biosynthetic gene cluster for physostigmine by genome mining. The 8.5 kb gene cluster encodes eight proteins (PsmA-H), seven of which are required for the synthesis of physostigmine from 5-hydroxytryptophan, as shown by in vitro total reconstitution. Further genetic and enzymatic studies enabled us to delineate the biosynthetic pathway for physostigmine. The pathway features an unusual reaction cascade consisting of highly coordinated methylation and acetylation/deacetylation reactions.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the β-methylarginine residue of peptidyl nucleoside arginomycin in Streptomyces arginensis NRRL 15941 Abstract: The peptidyl nucleoside arginomycin is active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi but displays much lower toxicity to mice than its analog blasticidin S. It features a rare amino acid, β-methylarginine, which is attached to the deoxyhexose moiety via a 4'-aminoacyl bond. We here report cloning of the complete biosynthetic gene cluster for arginomycin from Streptomyces arginensis NRRL 15941. Among the 14 putative essential open reading frames, argM, encoding an aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), and adjacent argN, encoding an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, are coupled to catalyze arginine and yield β-methylarginine in Escherichia coli. Purified ArgM can transfer the α-amino group of l-arginine to α-ketoglutaric acid to give glutamate and thereby converts l-arginine to 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoic acid, which is methylated at the C-3 position by ArgN to form 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid. Iteratively, ArgM specifically catalyzes transamination from the donor l-aspartate to the resulting 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, generating β-methylarginine. The complete and concise biosynthetic pathway for the rare and bioactive amino acid revealed by this study may pave the way for the production of β-methylarginine either by enzymatic conversion or by engineered living cells.	1
Title: An endopolygalacturonase from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum induces calcium-mediated signaling and programmed cell death in soybean cells Abstract: A basic endopolygalacturonase (PG) isoform, produced early by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum when infecting soybean seedlings, was used to examine the signaling role of the enzyme in aequorin-expressing soybean cells. A cytosolic Ca2+ elevation was induced, with a rapid increase (phase 1) and a very slow decrease (phase 2) of Ca2+ concentration, indicating the involvement of Ca2+ ions in PG signaling. Within 1 h of PG-cell contact a remarkable level of cell death was recorded, significantly higher than the control cell culture turnover. The observed morphological and biochemical changes were indicative of the activation of programmed cell death; in particular, cytochrome c release in the cytoplasm and activation of both caspase 9-like and caspase 3-like proteases were found. When a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) and the PG were simultaneously applied to cells, both the Ca2+ increase and cell death were annulled. The possible roles of prolonged sustained cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in inducing cell death and of the PG-PGIP interaction in preventing PG signaling are discussed.	0
Title: Deciphering the biosynthesis pathway of the antitumor thiocoraline from a marine actinomycete and its expression in two streptomyces species Abstract: Thiocoraline is a thiodepsipeptide antitumor compound produced by two actinomycetes Micromonospora sp. ACM2-092 and Micromonospora sp. ML1, isolated from two marine invertebrates (a soft coral and a mollusc) found of the Indian Ocean coast of Mozambique. By using oligoprimers derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) consensus sequences, six PCR fragments containing putative NRPS adenylation domains were amplified from the chromosome of Micromonospora sp. ML1. Insertional inactivation of each adenylation domain showed that two of them generated nonproducing mutants, thereby indicating that these domains were involved in thiocoraline biosynthesis. Sequencing of a 64.6 kbp DNA region revealed the presence of 36 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and two incomplete ones. Heterologous expression of a region of about 53 kbp, containing 26 of the ORFs, in Streptomyces albus and S. lividans led to the production of thiocoraline in these streptomycetes. Surprisingly, the identified gene cluster contains more NRPS modules than expected on the basis of the number of amino acids of thiocoraline. TioR and TioS would most probably constitute the NRPS involved in the biosynthesis of the thiocoraline backbone, according to the colinearity of the respective modules. It is proposed that two other NRPSs, TioY and TioZ, could be responsible for the biosynthesis of a small peptide molecule which could be involved in regulation of the biosynthesis of thicoraline in Micromonospora sp. ML1. In addition, a pathway is proposed for the biosynthesis of the unusual starter unit, 3-hydroxy-quinaldic acid.	1
Title: Glycosyl Cross-Coupling of Anomeric Nucleophiles: Scope, Mechanism, and Applications in the Synthesis of Aryl C-Glycosides Abstract: Stereoselective manipulations at the C1 anomeric position of saccharides are one of the central goals of preparative carbohydrate chemistry. Historically, the majority of reactions forming a bond with anomeric carbon has focused on reactions of nucleophiles with saccharide donors equipped with a leaving group. Here, we describe a novel approach to stereoselective synthesis of C-aryl glycosides capitalizing on the highly stereospecific reaction of anomeric nucleophiles. First, methods for the preparation of anomeric stannanes have been developed and optimized to afford both anomers of common saccharides in high anomeric selectivities. We established that oligosaccharide stannanes could be prepared from monosaccharide stannanes via O-glycosylation with Schmidt-type donors, glycal epoxides, or under dehydrative conditions with C1 alcohols. Second, we identified a general set of catalytic conditions with Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol%) and a bulky ligand (JackiePhos, 10 mol%) controlling the β-elimination pathway. We demonstrated that the glycosyl cross-coupling resulted in consistently high anomeric selectivities for both anomers with mono- and oligosaccharides, deoxysugars, saccharides with free hydroxyl groups, pyranose, and furanose substrates. The versatility of the glycosyl cross-coupling reaction was probed in the total synthesis of salmochelins (siderophores) and commercial anti-diabetic drugs (gliflozins). Combined experimental and computational studies revealed that the β-elimination pathway is suppressed for biphenyl-type ligands due to the shielding of Pd(II) by sterically demanding JackiePhos, whereas smaller ligands, which allow for the formation of a Pd-F complex, predominantly result in a glycal product. Similar steric effects account for the diminished rates of cross-couplings of 1,2-cis C1-stannanes with aryl halides. DFT calculations also revealed that the transmetalation occurs via a cyclic transition state with retention of configuration at the anomeric position. Taken together, facile access to both anomers of various glycoside nucleophiles, a broad reaction scope, and uniformly high transfer of anomeric configuration make the glycosyl cross-coupling reaction a practical tool for the synthesis of bioactive natural products, drug candidates, allowing for late-stage glycodiversification studies with small molecules and biologics.	0
Title: Genome sequencing and secondary metabolism of the postharvest pathogen Penicillium griseofulvum Abstract: Background:                       Penicillium griseofulvum is associated in stored apples with blue mould, the most important postharvest disease of pome fruit. This pathogen can simultaneously produce both detrimental and beneficial secondary metabolites (SM). In order to gain insight into SM synthesis in P. griseofulvum in vitro and during disease development on apple, we sequenced the genome of P. griseofulvum strain PG3 and analysed important SM clusters.                  Results:                       PG3 genome sequence (29.3 Mb) shows that P. griseofulvum branched off after the divergence of P. oxalicum but before the divergence of P. chrysogenum. Genome-wide analysis of P. griseofulvum revealed putative gene clusters for patulin, griseofulvin and roquefortine C biosynthesis. Furthermore, we quantified the SM production in vitro and on apples during the course of infection. The expression kinetics of key genes of SM produced in infected apple were examined. We found additional SM clusters, including those potentially responsible for the synthesis of penicillin, yanuthone D, cyclopiazonic acid and we predicted a cluster putatively responsible for the synthesis of chanoclavine I.                  Conclusions:                       These findings provide relevant information to understand the molecular basis of SM biosynthesis in P. griseofulvum, to allow further research directed to the overexpression or blocking the synthesis of specific SM.	1
Title: The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop increases the frequency of apoptosis in the female germline cells of Drosophila melanogaster Abstract: Background:                       Wolbachia are bacterial endosymbionts of many arthropod species in which they manipulate reproductive functions. The distribution of these bacteria in the Drosophila ovarian cells at different stages of oogenesis has been amply described. The pathways along which Wolbachia influences Drosophila oogenesis have been, so far, little studied. It is known that Wolbachia are abundant in the somatic stem cell niche of the Drosophila germarium. A checkpoint, where programmed cell death, or apoptosis, can occur, is located in region 2a/2b of the germarium, which comprises niche cells. Here we address the question whether or not the presence of Wolbachia in germarium cells can affect the frequency of cyst apoptosis in the checkpoint.                  Results:                       Our current fluorescent microscopic observations showed that the wMel and wMelPop strains had different effects on female germline cells of D. melanogaster. The Wolbachia strain wMel did not affect the frequency of apoptosis in cells of the germarium. The presence of the Wolbachia strain wMelPop in the D. melanogasterw1118 ovaries increased the number of germaria where cells underwent apoptosis in the checkpoint. Based on the appearance in the electron microscope, there was no difference in morphological features of apoptotic cystocytes between Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies. Bacteria with normal ultrastructure and large numbers of degenerating bacteria were found in the dying cyst cells.                  Conclusions:                       Our current study demonstrated that the Wolbachia strain wMelPop affects the egg chamber formation in the D. melanogaster ovaries. This led to an increase in the number of germaria containing apoptotic cells. It is suggested that Wolbachia can adversely interfere either with the cystocyte differentiation into the oocyte or with the division of somatic stem cells giving rise to follicle cells and, as a consequence, to improper ratio of germline cells to follicle cells and, ultimately, to apoptosis of cysts. There was no similar adverse effect in D. melanogaster Canton S infected with the Wolbachia strain wMel. This was taken to mean that the observed increase in frequency of apoptosis was not the general effect of Wolbachia on germline cells of D. melanogaster, it was rather induced by the virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop.	0
Title: Mimicry of a Non-ribosomally Produced Antimicrobial, Brevicidine, by Ribosomal Synthesis and Post-translational Modification Abstract: The group of bacterial non-ribosomally produced peptides (NRPs) forms a rich source of antibiotics, such as daptomycin, vancomycin, and teixobactin. The difficulty of functionally expressing and engineering the corresponding large biosynthetic complexes is a bottleneck in developing variants of such peptides. Here, we apply a strategy to synthesize mimics of the recently discovered antimicrobial NRP brevicidine. We mimicked the molecular structure of brevicidine by ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) synthesis, introducing several relevant modifications, such as dehydration and thioether ring formation. Following this strategy, in two rounds peptides were engineered in vivo, which showed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria susceptible to wild-type brevicidine. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a strategy to structurally and functionally mimic NRPs by employing the synthesis and post-translational modifications typical for RiPPs. This enables the future generation of large genetically encoded peptide libraries of NRP-mimicking structures to screen for antimicrobial activity against relevant pathogens.	0
Title: Pseudomycoicidin, a Class II Lantibiotic from Bacillus pseudomycoides Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides with substantial posttranslational modifications. They are characterized by the unique amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, which are introduced by dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and linkage of the resulting dehydrated amino acids with Cys residues. BLAST searches using the mersacidin biosynthetic enzyme (MrsM) in the NCBI database revealed a new class II lantibiotic gene cluster in Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442. Production of an antimicrobial substance with activity against Gram-positive bacteria was detectable in a cell wash extract of this strain. The substance was partially purified, and mass spectrometric analysis predicted a peptide of 2,786 Da in the active fraction. In order to characterize the putative lantibiotic further, heterologous expression of the predicted biosynthetic genes was performed in Escherichia coli. Coexpression of the prepeptide (PseA) along with the corresponding modification enzyme (PseM) resulted in the production of a modified peptide with the corresponding mass, carrying four out of eight possible dehydrations and supporting the presence of four thioether and one disulfide bridge. After the proteolytic removal of the leader, the core peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity. In conclusion, pseudomycoicidin is a novel lantibiotic with antimicrobial activity that was heterologously produced in E. coli.	1
Title: Cytochrome P450 homolog is responsible for C-N bond formation between aglycone and deoxysugar in the staurosporine biosynthesis of Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 Abstract: The staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 consists of 15 sta genes. In the cluster, it was predicted that staN, which shows high similarity to cytochrome P450 is involved in C-N bond formation between the nitrogen at N-12 of aglycone and the carbon at C-5' of deoxysugar. The staN disruptant produced holyrine A instead of staurosporine. The structure of holyrine A is aglycone linking to 2,3,6-trideoxy-3-aminoaldohexose between N-13 and C-1' of deoxysugar. Holyrine A was converted to staurosporine by the staD disruptant. These results indicate that StaN, cytochrome P450 is responsible for C-N bond formation. This is the first example of C-N bond formation catalyzed by cytochrome P450. In addition, holyrine A was confirmed to be an intermediate of staurosporine biosynthesis, which suggests that the N- and O-methylation at C-3' and C-4' takes place after the formation of the C-N bond between C-5' and N-12 in the biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Discovery of Druggability-Improved Analogues by Investigation of the LL-D49194α1 Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of antitumor antibiotic LL-D49194α1 (LLD) was identified and comparatively analyzed with that of trioxacarcins. The tailoring genes encoding glycosyltransferase, methyltransferase and cytochrome P450 were systematically deleted, which led to the discovery of eight compounds from the mutants. Preliminary pharmaceutical evaluation revealed two intermediates exhibiting higher cytotoxicity, stability and solubility. These results highlighted the modification pathway for LLD biosynthesis, and provided highly potent, structurally simplified "unnatural" natural products with improved druggability.	1
Title: MoMip11, a MoRgs7-interacting protein, functions as a scaffolding protein to regulate cAMP signaling and pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae has eight regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) and RGS-like proteins (MoRgs1 to MoRgs8) that exhibit both distinct and shared regulatory functions in the growth, differentiation and pathogenicity of the fungus. We found MoRgs7 with a unique RGS-seven transmembrane (7-TM) domain motif is localized to the highly dynamic tubule-vesicular compartments during early appressorium differentiation followed by gradually degradation. To explore whether this involves an active signal perception of MoRgs7, we identified a Gbeta-like/RACK1 protein homolog in M. oryzae MoMip11 that interacts with MoRgs7. Interestingly, MoMip11 selectively interacted with several components of the cAMP regulatory pathway, including Gα MoMagA and the high-affinity phosphodiesterase MoPdeH. We further showed that MoMip11 promotes MoMagA activation and suppresses MoPdeH activity thereby upregulating intracellular cAMP levels. Moreover, MoMip11 is required for the response to multiple stresses, a role also shared by Gbeta-like/RACK1 adaptor proteins. In summary, we revealed a unique mechanism by which MoMip11 links MoRgs7 and G-proteins to reugulate cAMP signaling, stress responses and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. Our studies revealed the multitude of regulatory networks that govern growth, development and pathogenicity in this important causal agent of rice blast.	0
Title: The tallysomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC 31158 unveiling new insights into the biosynthesis of the bleomycin family of antitumor antibiotics Abstract: The tallysomycins (TLMs) belong to the bleomycin (BLM) family of antitumor antibiotics. The BLM biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned and characterized previously from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC 15003, but engineering BLM biosynthesis for novel analogs has been hampered by the lack of a genetic system for S. verticillus. We now report the cloning and sequencing of the TLM biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC 31158 and the development of a genetic system for S. hindustanus, demonstrating the feasibility to manipulate TLM biosynthesis in S. hindustanus by gene inactivation and mutant complementation. Sequence analysis of the cloned 80.2 kb region revealed 40 open reading frames (ORFs), 30 of which were assigned to the TLM biosynthetic gene cluster. The TLM gene cluster consists of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding nine NRPS modules, a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one PKS module, genes encoding seven enzymes for deoxysugar biosynthesis and attachment, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis, resistance, and regulatory proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in TLM biosynthesis was confirmed by inactivating the tlmE glycosyltransferase gene to generate a TLM non-producing mutant and by restoring TLM production to the DeltatlmE::ermE mutant strain upon expressing a functional copy of tlmE. The TLM gene cluster is highly homologous to the BLM cluster, with 25 of the 30 ORFs identified within the two clusters exhibiting striking similarities. The structural similarities and differences between TLM and BLM were reflected remarkably well by the genes and their organization in their respective biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Manipulation of pathway regulation in Streptomyces globisporus for overproduction of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: Manipulation of pathway regulation is an efficient strategy to increase specific secondary metabolite production. In this study, we successfully improved the production of both the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 and a heptaene, an early metabolite of the C-1027 pathway, by manipulating the three regulatory genes, sgcR1, sgcR2 and sgcR3, within the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster. SgcR3 has previously been established as an activator, and we now propose that SgcR1 and SgcR2 are also positive regulators based on their upregulation effects on titer and/or timing of heptaene and C-1027 production in Streptomyces globisporus. Specifically, overexpression of sgcR1 significantly improved the production of heptaene (about fivefold) and C-1027 (two- to threefold) compared with the wild-type strain. However, the titers of heptaene and C-1027 were not increased by overexpressing all the three activators together, underscoring the complexity of C-1027 biosynthetic pathway regulation. The possibility of exploiting the heptaene as a readily identifiable and unique indicator for rapidly detecting enediyne production was also assessed.	1
Title: Eradicating Bacterial Persisters with Combinations of Strongly and Weakly Metabolism-Dependent Antibiotics Abstract: The vast majority of bactericidal antibiotics display poor efficacy against bacterial persisters, cells that are in a metabolically repressed state. Molecules that retain their bactericidal functions against such bacteria often display toxicity to human cells, which limits treatment options for infections caused by persisters. Here, we leverage insight into metabolism-dependent bactericidal antibiotic efficacy to design antibiotic combinations that sterilize both metabolically active and persister cells, while minimizing the antibiotic concentrations required. These rationally designed antibiotic combinations have the potential to improve treatments for chronic and recurrent infections.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the cyclitol moiety of pyralomicin 1a in Nonomuraea spiralis MI178-34F18 Abstract: The biosynthetic pathway leading to the cyclitol moiety of pyralomicin 1a (1) in Nonomuraea spiralis MI178-34F18 has been studied using a series of 2H-labeled potential precursors. The results demonstrate that 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (7), a common precursor for acarbose (4) and validamycin A (5) biosynthesis, is an immediate precursor of pyralomicin 1a. 5-epi-Valiolone (8) was also incorporated into 1, albeit less efficiently than 7. Other potential intermediates, such as valiolone (9), valienone (10), valienol (11), 1-epi-valienol (12), 5-epi-valiolol (13), and 1-epi-5-epi-valiolol (14) were not incorporated into pyralomicin 1a. To explain this surprising observation, it is proposed that either 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (7) is specifically activated (e.g., to its phosphate) and that the further transformations take place on activated intermediates (which can not be generated directly from their unactivated counterparts), or that the transformation of 7 into 1 involves a substrate-channeling mechanism in which enzyme-bound intermediates are directly transferred from one enzyme active site to the next in a multi-enzyme complex.	1
Title: A Papaver somniferum 10-gene cluster for synthesis of the anticancer alkaloid noscapine Abstract: Noscapine is an antitumor alkaloid from opium poppy that binds tubulin, arrests metaphase, and induces apoptosis in dividing human cells. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway will enable improvement in the commercial production of noscapine and related bioactive molecules. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the exclusive expression of 10 genes encoding five distinct enzyme classes in a high noscapine-producing poppy variety, HN1. Analysis of an F(2) mapping population indicated that these genes are tightly linked in HN1, and bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing confirmed that they exist as a complex gene cluster for plant alkaloids. Virus-induced gene silencing resulted in accumulation of pathway intermediates, allowing gene function to be linked to noscapine synthesis and a novel biosynthetic pathway to be proposed.	1
Title: New insights into the echinocandins and other fungal non-ribosomal peptides and peptaibiotics Abstract: Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a primary modality for fungal peptidic natural product assembly and are responsible for some of the best known, most useful, and most destructive fungal metabolites. Through genome sequencing and computer-assisted recognition of modular motifs of catalytic domains, one can now confidently identify most NRPS biosynthetic genes of a fungal strain. The biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for two of the most important classes of NRP fungal derived drugs, cyclosporine and the echinocandins, have been recently characterized by genomic sequencing and annotation. Complete biosynthetic gene clusters for the pneumocandins and echinocandins have been mapped at the genetic level and functionally characterized to some extent. Genomic sequencing of representative strains of most of the variants in the echinocandin family, including the wild-type of the three fungal strains employed for industrial-scale production of caspofungin, micafungin and anidulofungin, has enabled characterization of the basic architecture of the echinocandin NRPS pathways. A comparative analysis of how pathway genes cause variations in lipoinitiation, biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acids, amino acid substitutions, and hydroxylations and sulfonations of the core peptide and contribute to the molecular diversity of the family is presented. We also review new information on the natural functions of NRPs, the differences between fungal and bacterial NRPSs, and functional characterization of selected NRPS gene clusters. Continuing discovery of the new fungal nonribosomal peptides has contributed new structural diversity and potential insights into their biological functions among other natural peptides and peptaibiotics. We therefore provide an update on new peptides, depsipeptides and peptaibols discovered in the Fungi since 2009.	1
Title: PCR-Independent Method of Transformation-Associated Recombination Reveals the Cosmomycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in an Ocean Streptomycete Abstract: The transformation-associated recombination cloning methodology facilitates the genomic capture and heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We have streamlined this procedure by introduction of synthetic DNA gene blocks for the efficient capture of BGCs. We show the successful capture and expression of the aromatic polyketide antitumor agent cosmomycin from streptomycete bacteria and the discovery of new cosmomycin analogues by mass spectral molecular networking.	1
Title: Actinopolysporins A-C and tubercidin as a Pdcd4 stabilizer from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600 Abstract: Our current natural product program utilizes new actinomycetes originating from unexplored and underexplored ecological niches, employing cytotoxicity against a selected panel of cancer cell lines as the preliminary screen to identify hit strains for natural product dereplication, followed by mechanism-based assays of the purified natural products to discover potential anticancer drug leads. Three new linear polyketides, actinopolysporins A (1), B (2), and C (3), along with the known antineoplastic antibiotic tubercidin (4), were isolated from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600, and the structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. All four compounds were assayed for their ability to stabilize the tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), which is known to antagonize critical events in oncogenic pathways. Only 4 significantly inhibited proteasomal degradation of a model Pdcd4-luciferase fusion protein, with an IC50 of 0.88±0.09 μM, unveiling a novel biological activity for this well-studied natural product.	0
Title: DKxanthene biosynthesis--understanding the basis for diversity-oriented synthesis in myxobacterial secondary metabolism Abstract: The DKxanthenes are a family of yellow pigments which play a critical role in myxobacterial development. Thirteen unique structures from Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 differ in the length of their characteristic polyene functionality, as well as the extent of methyl branching. We aimed to understand the mechanistic basis for this "molecular promiscuity" by analyzing the gene cluster in DK1622, and comparing it to the DKxanthene biosynthetic locus in a second myxobacterium, Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, which produces a more limited range of compounds. While the core biosynthetic machinery is highly conserved, M. xanthus contains a putative asparagine hydroxylase function which is not present in S. aurantiaca. This observation accounts, in part, for the significantly larger metabolite family in M. xanthus. Detailed analysis of the encoded hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line provides direct evidence for the mechanism underlying the variable polyene length and the observed pattern of methyl functionalities.	1
Title: Towards understanding the biosynthetic pathway for ustilaginoidin mycotoxins in Ustilaginoidea virens Abstract: Ustilaginoidins, toxic to plants, animals and human, are one of major types of mycotoxins produced by Ustilaginoidea virens. In this study, a gene cluster containing the polyketide synthase gene UvPKS1 was analysed via gene replacement and biochemical studies to determine ustilaginoidin biosynthetic pathway in U. virens. UvPKS1 was first proven to be responsible for the first step of ustilaginoidin biosynthesis, since neither ustilaginoidin derivatives nor intermediates were produced when UvPKS1 was deleted. Replacement of ugsO greatly reduced ustilaginoidin production but increased the ratios of dehydrogenated/hydrogenated ustilagioidin derivatives. The enhanced growth rate of the ΔugsO mutant indicates that accumulation of certain ustilaginoidin derivatives may adversely affect mycelial growth in U. virens. Deletion of ugsT encoding a putative MFS transporter disrupted the ability to generate ustilaginoidins. The ustilaginoidin derivatives produced in the ΔugsJ mutant all lack C3-methyl, indicating that UgsJ is responsible for C3-methylation. Only monomeric intermediates, such as 3-methyl-dihydro-nor-rubrofusarin, but no ustilaginoidin derivatives were generated in the ΔugsL mutant, indicating that UgsL is responsible for the dimerization of nor-rubrofusarin derivatives to produce ustilaginoidins. However, ugsR2 deletion had no dramatic effect on ustilaginoidin biosynthesis. Together, biochemical analyses with bioinformatics and chemoinformatics uncover a multiple-step enzyme-catalysed pathway for ustilaginoidin biosynthesis in U. virens.	1
Title: Cross-linking of a growth hormone releasing factor-binding protein in anterior pituitary cells Abstract: Growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary and is related to the peptides of the glucagon/secretin family. Although the mechanism of action of this hormone has been studied in considerable detail, little is known concerning the GRF receptor itself. We have attempted to label the GRF receptor by chemically coupling the 125I-GRF analog [His1, Nle27]-hGRF(1-32)-NH2 (GRFa) (where Nle is norleucine) to plated rat anterior pituitary cells with the protein cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (0.1 mM). Verification of biological activity of the 125I-GRFa was confirmed prior to the cross-linking experiments using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Whole cell extracts prepared from the cross-linked cells were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Four bands of 72, 50, 30, and 26 kDa were detected in autoradiograms from cells exposed to the labeled analog for 20 min (22 degrees C) followed by exposure to DSS for 2 min. The 72-kDa band was interpreted to be bovine serum albumin, which was used as a carrier in initial studies. The 50- and 30-kDa bands were very faint and probably represent nonspecific binding sites since they were unchanged in the presence of excess unlabeled GRFa. The 26-kDa band was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled rat GRF, GRFa, and to a lesser extent by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It is unlikely, however, that GRFa was acting at a VIP receptor since the labeled analog did not induce prolactin secretion (VIP is a prolactin secretagogue). GRFa also increased cellular cAMP to levels similar to GRF and greater than VIP. Autoradiographs from gels run under nonreducing conditions revealed the 26-kDa band as the major species, indicating that, if a polymeric form of this binding protein exists, it does not involve disulfide linkages. Thus, the best candidate for the putative GRF receptor is the 26-kDa band. We have further demonstrated that the higher concentrations of DSS used previously (5 mM) result in diffuse autoradiograms with multiple bands, suggesting that caution should be exercised when interpreting cross-linking data under these conditions.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression Guides Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Chuangxinmycin, an Indole Alkaloid Antibiotic Abstract: The indole alkaloid antibiotic chuangxinmycin, from Actinobacteria Actinoplanes tsinanensis, containing a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2- cd]indole scaffold, is a potent and selective inhibitor of bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. The chuangxinmycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by in silico analysis of the genome sequence, then verified by heterologous expression. Systemic gene inactivation and intermediate identification determined the minimum set of genes for unique thiopyrano[4,3,2- cd]indole formation and the concerted action of a radical S-adenosylmethionine protein plus an unknown protein for addition of the 3-methyl group. These findings set a solid foundation for comprehensively investigating the biosynthesis, optimizing yield, and generating new analogues of chuangxinmycin.	1
Title: Diversity of family GH46 chitosanases in Kitasatospora setae KM-6054 Abstract: The genome of Kitasatospora setae KM-6054, a soil actinomycete, has three genes encoding chitosanases belonging to GH46 family. The genes (csn1-3) were cloned in Streptomyces lividans and the corresponding enzymes were purified from the recombinant cultures. The csn2 clone yielded two proteins (Csn2BH and Csn2H) differing by the presence of a carbohydrate-binding domain. Sequence analysis showed that Csn1 and Csn2H were canonical GH46 chitosanases, while Csn3 resembled chitosanases from bacilli. The activity of the four chitosanases was tested in a variety of conditions and on diverse chitosan forms, including highly N-deacetylated chitosan or chitosan complexed with humic or polyphosphoric acid. Kinetic parameters were also determined. These tests unveiled the biochemical diversity among these chitosanases and the peculiarity of Csn3 compared with the other three enzymes. The observed biochemical diversity is discussed based on structural 3D models and sequence alignment. This is a first study of all the GH46 chitosanases produced by a single microbial strain.	0
Title: Characterization of the function of the ver-1A and ver-1B genes, involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus Abstract: The ver-1A gene was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined as part of a previous study on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus SU-1. A second copy of this gene, ver-1B, was tentatively identified in this fungal strain. In this study, ver-1B was cloned by screening an A. parasiticus cosmid library with a ver-1A probe. The nucleotide sequence of ver-1B was determined. The predicted amino acid sequence of ver-1B had 95% identity with ver-1A. A translational stop codon, found in the ver-1B gene coding region, indicated that it encodes a truncated polypeptide. To confirm the function of the ver-1 genes in AFB1 synthesis, a plasmid (pDV-VA) was designed to disrupt ver-1A and/or ver-1B by transformation of the AFB1 producer A. parasiticus NR-1. One disruptant, VAD-102, which accumulated the pathway intermediate versicolorin A was obtained. Southern hybridization analysis of VAD-102 revealed that ver-1A but not ver-1B was disrupted. A functional ver-1A gene was transformed back into strain VAD-102. Transformants which received ver-1A produced AFB1, confirming that ver-1A is the only functional ver-1 gene in A. parasiticus SU-1 and that its gene product is involved in the conversion of versicolorin A to sterigmatocystin in AFB1 biosynthesis. A duplicated chromosomal region (approximately 12 kb) was identified upstream from ver-1A and ver-1B by Southern hybridization analysis. This duplicated region contained the aflR gene, which is proposed to be one regulator of AFB1, synthesis. A similar gene duplication was also identified in several other strains of A. parasiticus.	1
Title: Blocks in the pseudouridimycin pathway unlock hidden metabolites in the Streptomyces producer strain Abstract: We report a metabolomic analysis of Streptomyces sp. ID38640, a soil isolate that produces the bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor pseudouridimycin. The analysis was performed on the wild type, on three newly constructed and seven previously reported mutant strains disabled in different genes required for pseudouridimycin biosynthesis. The results indicate that Streptomyces sp. ID38640 is able to produce, in addition to lydicamycins and deferroxiamines, as previously reported, also the lassopeptide ulleungdin, the non-ribosomal peptide antipain and the osmoprotectant ectoine. The corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters were readily identified in the strain genome. We also detected the known compound pyridindolol, for which we propose a previously unreported biosynthetic gene cluster, as well as three families of unknown metabolites. Remarkably, the levels of most metabolites varied strongly in the different mutant strains, an observation that enabled detection of metabolites unnoticed in the wild type. Systematic investigation of the accumulated metabolites in the ten different pum mutants identified shed further light on pseudouridimycin biosynthesis. We also show that several Streptomyces strains, able to produce pseudouridimycin, have distinct genetic relationship and metabolic profile with ID38640.	1
Title: Genome mining and genetic analysis of cypemycin biosynthesis reveal an unusual class of posttranslationally modified peptides Abstract: Posttranslational modification of amino acids confers a range of structural features and activities on ribosomally synthesized peptides, many of which have potent antimicrobial or other biological activities. Cypemycin is an extensively modified linear peptide produced by Streptomyces sp. OH-4156 with potent in vitro activity against mouse leukemia cells. Cypemycin does not contain lanthionine bridges but exhibits some of the structural features of lantibiotics, notably dehydrated threonines (dehydrobutyrines) and a C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine. Consequently it was classified as a member of the lantibiotic family of posttranslationally modified peptides. Cypemycin also possesses two L-allo-isoleucine residues and an N-terminal N,N-dimethylalanine, both unique amino acid modifications. We identified and heterologously expressed the cypemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and performed a mutational analysis of each individual gene. We show that even the previously described modifications are carried out by unusual enzymes or via a modification pathway unrelated to lantibiotic biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the widespread occurrence of cypemycin-like gene clusters within the bacterial kingdom and in the Archaea. Cypemycin is the founding member of an unusual class of posttranslationally modified ribosomally synthesized peptides, the linaridins.	1
Title: Stable high level expression of the violacein indolocarbazole anti-tumour gene cluster and the Streptomyces lividans amyA gene in E. coli K12 Abstract: Previous studies showed that when pPSX-vioABCDE was used to transform E. coli K12 DH5alpha the strain retained the plasmid even after 100 generations of unselected growth but produced a low level of the anti-tumour antibiotic violacein. Markedly higher levels of violacein synthesis were obtained from E. coli K12 DH5alpha pUC18-vioABCDE and Sphingomonas sp. JMP4092 pPSX-vioABCDE. Unfortunately, both strains were extremely unstable regardless of presence or absence of antibiotic selection to retain the plasmid. The current study was undertaken to determine if strains of E. coli K12 could be isolated which stably over produce violacein. When a range of E. coli K12 strains were transformed with pPSX-vioABCDE, most produced small amounts of violacein. However, a small number of related strains of E. coli K12 JM101, JM105 and JM109 not only over-produced violacein, but also maintained the high stability. In addition, E. coli K12 JM109 strongly expressed an alpha amylase gene (amyA) from Streptomyces lividans indicating that the S. lividans amyA promoter is highly active in E. coli K12 JM109. In another set of experiments, a violacein overproduction mutation (opv-1) of the plasmid pPSX-vioABCDE was isolated which enabled E. coli K12 DH5alpha to overproduce violacein while retaining high stability. The plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1 possesses a single base pair deletion in the promoter region of the violacein operon. By combining the over producing strain E. coli K12 JM109 and the over producing plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1, a stable hyper producing strain (E. coli K12 JM109 pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1) was constructed. Finally, two additional stable vectors, pPSX10 and pPSX20, were constructed to facilitate subcloning and functional analysis studies.	1
Title: The structure of L-tyrosine 2,3-aminomutase from the C-1027 enediyne antitumor antibiotic biosynthetic pathway Abstract: The SgcC4 l-tyrosine 2,3-aminomutase (SgTAM) catalyzes the formation of (S)-beta-tyrosine in the biosynthetic pathway of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027. SgTAM is homologous to the histidine ammonia lyase family of enzymes whose activity is dependent on the methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) cofactor. Unlike the lyase enzymes, SgTAM catalyzes additional chemical transformations resulting in an overall stereospecific 1,2-amino shift in the substrate l-tyrosine to generate (S)-beta-tyrosine. Previously, we provided kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis data supporting the presence of MIO in the active site of SgTAM [Christenson, S. D.; Wu, W.; Spies, A.; Shen, B.; and Toney, M. D. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 12708-12718]. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of an MIO-containing aminomutase, SgTAM, and confirm the structural homology of SgTAM to ammonia lyases. Comparison of the structure of SgTAM to the l-tyrosine ammonia lyase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides provides insight into the structural basis for aminomutase activity. The results show that SgTAM has a closed active site well suited to retain ammonia and minimize the formation of lyase elimination products. The amino acid determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis can be predicted from the structure, setting the framework for detailed mechanistic investigations.	1
Title: Prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance and mutations in the gyrA, parC and parE genes of Riemerella anatipestifer isolated from ducks in China Abstract: Background:                       Riemerella anatipestifer is one of the most serious infectious disease-causing pathogens in the duck industry. Drug administration is an important method for prevention and treatment of infection in duck production, leading to widespread drug resistance in R. anatipestifer.                  Methods:                       For a total of 162 isolates of R. anatipestifer, the MICs were determined for a quinolone antimicrobial agent, namely, nalidixic acid, and three fluoroquinolones, namely, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and ofloxacin. The gyrA, parC, and parE gene fragments were amplified by PCR to identify the mutation sites in these strains. Site-directed mutants with mutations that were detected at a high frequency in vivo were constructed (hereafter referred to as site-directed in vivo mutants), and the MICs of these four drugs for these strains were determined.                  Results:                       In total, 100, 97.8, 99.3 and 97.8% of the 137 R. anatipestifer strains isolated between 2013 and 2018 showed resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and ofloxacin, respectively. The high-frequency mutation sites were detected in a total of 162 R. anatipestifer strains, such as Ser83Ile and Ser83Arg, which are two types of substitution mutations of amino acid 83 in GyrA; Val799Ala and Ile811Val in ParC; and Val357Ile, His358Tyr, and Arg541Lys in ParE. MIC analysis results for the site-directed in vivo mutants showed that the strains with only the Ser83Ile mutation in GyrA exhibited an 8-16-fold increase in MIC values, and all mutants showed resistance to ampicillin and ceftiofur.                  Conclusions:                       The resistance of R. anatipestifer to quinolone agents is a serious problem. Amino acid 83 in GyrA is the major target mutation site for the fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism of R. anatipestifer.	0
Title: Inactivation of Escherichia coli Cells in Aqueous Solution by Atmospheric-Pressure N2, He, Air, and O2 Microplasmas Abstract: Atmospheric-pressure N2, He, air, and O2 microplasma arrays have been used to inactivate Escherichia coli cells suspended in aqueous solution. Measurements show that the efficiency of inactivation of E. coli cells is strongly dependent on the feed gases used, the plasma treatment time, and the discharge power. Compared to atmospheric-pressure N2 and He microplasma arrays, air and O2 microplasma arrays may be utilized to more efficiently kill E. coli cells in aqueous solution. The efficiencies of inactivation of E. coli cells in water can be well described by using the chemical reaction rate model, where reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in the inactivation process. Analysis indicates that plasma-generated reactive species can react with E. coli cells in water by direct or indirect interactions.	0
Title: Novel compounds produced by Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433 engineered mutants altered in the biosynthesis of streptolydigin Abstract: Streptolydigin is a tetramic acid antibiotic produced by Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433 and involving a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system in its biosynthesis. The streptolydigin amino-acid precursor, 3-methylaspartate, has been proposed to be condensed to the polyketide portion of the molecule by a NRPS composed by three enzymes (SlgN1, SlgN2 and SlgL). On the other hand, biosynthesis of the polyketide moiety involves the participation of cytochrome P450 SlgO2 for the correct cyclization of the characteristic bicyclic ketal. Independent disruption of slgN1, slgN2, slgL or slgO2 resulted in S. lydicus mutants unable to produce the antibiotic thus confirming the involvement of these genes in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. These mutants did not accumulate any streptolydigin biosynthesis intermediate or shunt product derived from early polyketides released from the PKS. However, they produced three novel compounds identified as 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-3-chloro-benzoic acid, 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-3-hydroxy-benzoic acid and 4-(2-carboxy-propylamino)-benzoic acid, which were designated as christolane A, christolane B and christolane C, respectively. These compounds have been shown to exert some antibiotic activity.	1
Title: Efficient synthesis of 3H-indoles enabled by the lead-mediated α-arylation of β-ketoesters or γ-lactams using aryl azides Abstract: The development of a lead-mediated α-arylation reaction between aryl azides and β-ketoesters or γ-lactams that facilitates the formation of 3H-indoles is disclosed. Twenty-five examples are included which demonstrate the generality of this reaction to access aryl azides bearing tetrasubstituted o-alkyl substituents. When paired with a Staudinger reduction, this reaction streamlines the synthesis of functionalized 3H-indoles.	0
Title: The contribution of syringopeptin and syringomycin to virulence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain B301D on the basis of sypA and syrB1 biosynthesis mutant analysis Abstract: Sequencing of an approximately 3.9-kb fragment downstream of the syrD gene of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain B301D revealed that this region, designated sypA, codes for a peptide synthetase, a multifunctional enzyme involved in the thiotemplate mechanism of peptide biosynthesis. The translated protein sequence encompasses a complete amino acid activation module containing the conserved domains characteristic of peptide synthetases. Analysis of the substrate specificity region of this module indicates that it incorporates 2,3-dehydroaminobutyric acid into the syringopeptin peptide structure. Bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography data confirmed that disruption of the sypA gene in strain B301D resulted in the loss of syringopeptin production. The contribution of syringopeptin and syringomycin to the virulence of P. syringae pv. syringae strain B301D was examined in immature sweet cherry with sypA and syrB1 synthetase mutants defective in the production of the two toxins, respectively. Syringopeptin (sypA) and syringomycin (syrB1) mutants were reduced in virulence 59 and 26%, respectively, compared with the parental strain in cherry, whereas the syringopeptin-syringomycin double mutant was reduced 76% in virulence. These data demonstrate that syringopeptin and syringomycin are major virulence determinants of P. syringae pv. syringae.	1
Title: Insights into the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide and antibiotics through the structures of two retaining glycosyltransferases from family GT4 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the synthesis of the myriad glycoconjugates that are central to life. One of the largest families is GT4, which contains several enzymes of therapeutic significance, exemplified by WaaG and AviGT4. WaaG catalyses a key step in lipopolysaccharide synthesis, while AviGT4, produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes, contributes to the synthesis of the antibiotic avilamycin A. Here we present the crystal structure of both WaaG and AviGT4. The two enzymes contain two "Rossmann-like" (beta/alpha/beta) domains characteristic of the GT-B fold. Both recognition of the donor substrate and the catalytic machinery is similar to other retaining GTs that display the GT-B fold. Structural information is discussed with respect to the evolution of GTs and the therapeutic significance of the two enzymes.	1
Title: Purification, characterization and synergism in autolysis of a group of 1,3-β-glucan hydrolases from the pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies Abstract: Using a combined chromatography method, we simultaneously purified three protein fractions (II-2, II-3 and II-4) with 1,3-β-glucanase activity from extraction of pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies. MALDI-TOF/TOF amino acid sequencing showed that these three fractions matched a putative exo-1,3-β-glucanase, a putative glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase and a putative glycosyl hydrolase family 16 protein annotated in the C. cinerea genome, respectively; however, they were characterized as a 1,3-β-glucosidase, an exo-1,3-β-glucanase and an endo-1,3-β-glucanase, respectively, by analysis of their substrate specificities and modes of action. This study explored how these three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases synergistically acted on laminarin: the endo-1,3-β-glucanase hydrolysed internal glycosidic bonds of laminarin to generate 1,3-β-oligosaccharides of various lengths, the exo-1,3-β-glucanase cleaved the longer-chain laminarioligosaccharides into short-chain disaccharides, laminaribiose and gentiobiose, and the 1,3-β-glucosidase further hydrolysed laminaribiose to glucose. The remaining gentiobiose must be hydrolysed by other 1,6-β-glucosidases. Therefore, the endo-1,3-β-glucanase, exo-1,3-β-glucanase and 1,3-β-glucosidase may act synergistically to completely degrade the 1,3-β-glucan backbone of the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis. These three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases share a similar optimum pH and optimum temperature, supporting the speculation that these enzymes work together under the same conditions to degrade 1,3-β-glucan in the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis.	0
Title: Combined intravenous and intraventricular administration of colistin methanesulfonate in critically ill patients with central nervous system infection Abstract: Colistin pharmacokinetics were prospectively studied after intravenous administration of colistin methanesulphonate in critically ill patients without central nervous system infection (controls, n = 5) and in patients with external ventricular drain-associated ventriculitis after intravenous administration (EVDViv, n = 3) or combined intravenous/intraventricular administration (EVDVcomb, n = 4). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum colistin concentration ratios were higher in EVDViv than in control patients (11% versus 7%, P ≤ 0.05) and in EVDVcomb compared to all other patients (P < 0.0001). CSF colistin concentrations above the MIC of 0.5 μg/ml were achieved only in EVDVcomb patients.	0
Title: Selective N1/N4 1,4-Cycloaddition of 1,2,4,5-Tetrazines Enabled by Solvent Hydrogen Bonding Abstract: An unprecedented 1,4-cycloaddition (vs 3,6-cycloaddition) of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines is described with preformed or in situ generated aryl-conjugated enamines promoted by the solvent hydrogen bonding of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) that is conducted under mild reaction conditions (0.1 M HFIP, 25 °C, 12 h). The reaction constitutes a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition across the two nitrogen atoms (N1/N4) of the 1,2,4,5-tetrazine followed by a formal retro [4 + 2] cycloaddition loss of a nitrile and aromatization to generate a 1,2,4-triazine derivative. The factors that impact the remarkable change in the reaction mode, optimization of reaction parameters, the scope and simplification of its implementation through in situ enamine generation from aldehydes and ketones, the reaction scope for 3,6-bis(thiomethyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, a survey of participating 1,2,4,5-tetrazines, and key mechanistic insights into this reaction are detailed. Given its simplicity and breath, the study establishes a novel method for the simple and efficient one-step synthesis of 1,2,4-triazines under mild conditions from readily accessible starting materials. Whereas alternative protic solvents (e.g., MeOH vs HFIP) provide products of the conventional 3,6-cycoladdition, the enhanced hydrogen bonding capability of HFIP uniquely results in promotion of the unprecedented formal 1,4-cycloaddition. As such, the studies represent an example of not just an enhancement in the rate or efficiency of a heterocyclic azadiene cycloaddition by hydrogen bonding catalysis but also the first to alter the mode (N1/N4 vs C3/C6) of cycloaddition.	0
Title: Insights into the Unique Phosphorylation of the Lasso Peptide Paeninodin Abstract: Lasso peptides are a new class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides and thus far are only isolated from proteo- and actinobacterial sources. Typically, lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters encode enzymes for biosynthesis and export but not for tailoring. Here, we describe the isolation of the novel lasso peptide paeninodin from the firmicute Paenibacillus dendritiformis C454 and reveal within its biosynthetic cluster a gene encoding a kinase, which we have characterized as a member of a new class of lasso peptide-tailoring kinases. By employing a wide variety of peptide substrates, it was shown that this novel type of kinase specifically phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residue while ignoring those located elsewhere. These experiments also reveal that no other recognition motif is needed for efficient enzymatic phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine. Furthermore, through comparison with homologous HPr kinases and subsequent mutational analysis, we confirmed the essential catalytic residues. Our study reveals how lasso peptides are chemically diversified and sets the foundation for rational engineering of these intriguing natural products.	1
Title: An Update on Candida tropicalis Based on Basic and Clinical Approaches Abstract: Candida tropicalis has emerged as one of the most important Candida species. It has been widely considered the second most virulent Candida species, only preceded by C. albicans. Besides, this species has been recognized as a very strong biofilm producer, surpassing C. albicans in most of the studies. In addition, it produces a wide range of other virulence factors, including: adhesion to buccal epithelial and endothelial cells; the secretion of lytic enzymes, such as proteinases, phospholipases, and hemolysins, bud-to-hyphae transition (also called morphogenesis) and the phenomenon called phenotypic switching. This is a species very closely related to C. albicans and has been easily identified with both phenotypic and molecular methods. In addition, no cryptic sibling species were yet described in the literature, what is contradictory to some other medically important Candida species. C. tropicalis is a clinically relevant species and may be the second or third etiological agent of candidemia, specifically in Latin American countries and Asia. Antifungal resistance to the azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins has already been described. Apart from all these characteristics, C. tropicalis has been considered an osmotolerant microorganism and this ability to survive to high salt concentration may be important for fungal persistence in saline environments. This physiological characteristic makes this species suitable for use in biotechnology processes. Here we describe an update of C. tropicalis, focusing on all these previously mentioned subjects.	0
Title: A pathway-specific transcriptional activator regulates late steps of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A Streptomyces clavuligerus gene (designated claR) located downstream from the gene encoding clavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster is involved in regulation of the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Nucleotide sequence analysis and database searching of ClaR identified a significant similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif (HTH) region of LysR transcriptional regulators. A gene replacement mutant disrupted in claR was unable to produce clavulanic acid, suggesting that claR is essential for clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the accumulation of clavaminic acid in the claR mutant suggested that ClaR regulates the late steps in the clavulanic acid pathway, i.e. those involved in the conversion of clavaminic acid to clavulanic acid. Transcriptional analysis using RNA isolated from the wild type and the claR mutant showed that the expression of the putative late genes, but not the early genes, was regulated by ClaR. High-resolution S1 nuclease analysis of claR suggested that it is expressed as a monocistronic transcript and also as a bicistronic transcript along with the late gene orf-9. The transcription start site of the monocistronic claR transcript was identified as a C residue 155 nucleotides upstream from the claR start codon.	1
Title: Structure and regulation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase genes from the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 Abstract: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; DHA) have been shown to be of major importance in the promotion of cardiovascular health, proper human development and the prevention of some cancers. A high proportion of bacterial isolates from low-temperature and high-pressure marine environments produce EPA or DHA. This paper presents the sequence of a 33 kbp locus from the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 which includes four of the five genes required for EPA biosynthesis. As with other bacterial pfa (polyunsaturated fatty acid) genes, the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the SS9 genes reveal large multidomain proteins that are likely to catalyse EPA biosynthesis by a novel polyketide synthesis mechanism. RNase protection experiments separated the SS9 pfa genes into two transcriptional units, pfaA-C and pfaD. The pfaA transcriptional start site was identified. Cultivation at elevated hydrostatic pressure or reduced temperature did not increase pfa gene expression despite the resulting increase in percentage composition of EPA under these conditions. However, a regulatory mutant was characterized which showed both increased expression of pfaA-D and elevated EPA percentage composition. This result suggests that a regulatory factor exists which coordinates pfaA-D transcription. Additional consideration regarding the activities required for PUFA synthesis is provided together with comparative analyses of bacterial pfa genes and gene products.	1
Title: Recognition of individual genes in a single bacterial cell by fluorescence in situ hybridization--RING-FISH Abstract: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes is a standard method for identification of microorganisms in environmental samples. Apart from its value as a phylogenetic marker ribosomal RNA has always been the favoured target molecule for FISH because of its abundance in all cells, whereas plasmids and DNA were regarded as unsuitable targets because of their low copy number. Here we present an improved FISH technique, which is based on polynucleotide probes. It goes beyond the detection of high copy intracellular nucleic acids such as rRNA (up to 10(4)-10(5) copies per cell) and allows for the first time the in situ detection of individual genes or gene fragments on plasmids (10(1)-10(3) copies per cell) and chromosomal DNA (<10 copies per cell) in a single cell. Using E. coli as model organism we were able to detect in situ cells harbouring the antibiotic resistance gene beta lactamase on high, medium and low copy plasmids as well as the chromosomal encoded housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, we detected the prepilin peptidase gene xpsO in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in situ. Because of the characteristic hybridization signal obtained with this method--a halo-like, ring-shaped concentration of fluorescence in the cell periphery--we coined the term RING-FISH (recognition of individual genes) to differentiate it from conventional FISH.	0
Title: Cloning and analysis of the planosporicin lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster of Planomonospora alba Abstract: The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has renewed focus on natural products with antimicrobial properties. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics that are posttranslationally modified to introduce (methyl)lanthionine bridges. Actinomycetes are renowned for their ability to produce a large variety of antibiotics, many with clinical applications, but are known to make only a few lantibiotics. One such compound is planosporicin produced by Planomonospora alba, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive pathogens. Planosporicin is a type AI lantibiotic structurally similar to those which bind lipid II, the immediate precursor for cell wall biosynthesis. The gene cluster responsible for planosporicin biosynthesis was identified by genome mining and subsequently isolated from a P. alba cosmid library. A minimal cluster of 15 genes sufficient for planosporicin production was defined by heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. strain ATCC 39727, while deletion of the gene encoding the precursor peptide from P. alba, which abolished planosporicin production, was also used to confirm the identity of the gene cluster. Deletion of genes encoding likely biosynthetic enzymes identified through bioinformatic analysis revealed that they, too, are essential for planosporicin production in the native host. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that the planosporicin gene cluster is transcribed in three operons. Expression of one of these, pspEF, which encodes an ABC transporter, in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) conferred some degree of planosporicin resistance on the heterologous host. The inability to delete these genes from P. alba suggests that they play an essential role in immunity in the natural producer.	1
Title: Synthesis of ent-BE-43547A1 reveals a potent hypoxia-selective anticancer agent and uncovers the biosynthetic origin of the APD-CLD natural products Abstract: Tumour hypoxia is speculated to be a key driver of therapeutic resistance and metastatic dissemination. Consequently, the discovery of new potent agents that selectively target the hypoxic cell population may reveal new and untapped antitumour mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the BE-43547 subclass of the APD-CLD (amidopentadienoate-containing cyclolipodepsipeptides) natural products possesses highly hypoxia-selective growth-inhibitory activity against pancreatic cancer cells. To enable this discovery, we have developed the first synthesis of the BE-43547-macrocyclic scaffold in 16 steps (longest linear sequence), which also allowed access to the full panel of relative stereoisomers and ultimately to the assignment of stereochemical configuration. Discrepancies between the spectroscopic signatures of the synthetic compounds with that originally reported for the BE-43547 members stimulated us to re-isolate the natural product from a BE-43547-producing microorganism during which we elucidated the biosynthetic gene clusters for the BE-43547 family as well as for all other known APD-CLDs. Our studies underline the exciting possibilities for the further development of the anticancer activities of these natural products.	1
Title: Fluorescence imaging of single-copy DNA sequences within the human genome using PNA-directed padlock probe assembly Abstract: We present an approach for fluorescent in situ detection of short, single-copy sequences within genomic DNA in human cells. The single-copy sensitivity and single-base specificity of our method is achieved due to the combination of three components. First, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe locally opens a chosen target site, which allows a padlock DNA probe to access the site and become ligated. Second, rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates thousands of single-stranded copies of the target sequence. Finally, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to visualize the amplified DNA. We validate this technique by successfully detecting six single-copy target sites on human mitochondrial and autosomal DNA. We also demonstrate the high selectivity of this method by detecting X- and Y-specific sequences on human sex chromosomes and by simultaneously detecting three sequence-specific target sites. Finally, we discriminate two target sites that differ by 2 nt. The PNA-RCA-FISH approach is a distinctive in situ hybridization method capable of multitarget visualization within human chromosomes and nuclei that does not require DNA denaturation and is extremely sequence specific.	0
Title: Specific small molecule inhibitors of Skp2-mediated p27 degradation Abstract: In the ubiquitin proteasome system, the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2 and its accessory protein, Cks1, promote proliferation largely by inducing the degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27. Overexpression of Skp2 in human cancers correlates with poor prognosis, and deregulation of SCF-Skp2-Cks1 promotes tumorigenesis in animal models. We identified small molecule inhibitors specific to SCF-Skp2 activity using in silico screens targeted to the binding interface for p27. These compounds selectively inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 degradation by reducing p27 binding through key compound-receptor contacts. In cancer cells, the compounds induced p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promoted cell-type-specific blocks in the G1 or G2/M phases. Designing SCF-Skp2-specific inhibitors may be a novel strategy to treat cancers dependent on the Skp2-p27 axis.	0
Title: Appendage-mediated surface adherence of Sulfolobus solfataricus Abstract: Attachment of microorganisms to surfaces is a prerequisite for colonization and biofilm formation. The hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus was able to attach to a variety of surfaces, such as glass, mica, pyrite, and carbon-coated gold grids. Deletion mutant analysis showed that for initial attachment the presence of flagella and pili is essential. Attached cells produced extracellular polysaccharides containing mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Genes possibly involved in the production of the extracellular polysaccharides were identified.	0
Title: Agrobacterium-mediated disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene in the invertebrate pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae reveals a peptide spore factor Abstract: Numerous secondary metabolites have been isolated from the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, but the roles of these compounds as virulence factors in disease development are poorly understood. We targeted for disruption by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NPS) gene, MaNPS1. Four of six gene disruption mutants identified were examined further. Chemical analyses showed the presence of serinocyclins, cyclic heptapeptides, in the extracts of conidia of control strains, whereas the compounds were undetectable in DeltaManps1 mutants treated identically or in other developmental stages, suggesting that MaNPS1 encodes a serinocyclin synthetase. Production of the cyclic depsipeptide destruxins, M. anisopliae metabolites also predicted to be synthesized by an NPS, was similar in DeltaManps1 mutant and control strains, indicating that MaNPS1 does not contribute to destruxin biosynthesis. Surprisingly, a MaNPS1 fragment detected DNA polymorphisms that correlated with relative destruxin levels produced in vitro, and MaNPS1 was expressed concurrently with in vitro destruxin production. DeltaManps1 mutants exhibited in vitro development and responses to external stresses comparable to control strains. No detectable differences in pathogenicity of the DeltaManps1 mutants were observed in bioassays against beet armyworm and Colorado potato beetle in comparison to control strains. This is the first report of targeted disruption of a secondary metabolite gene in M. anisopliae, which revealed a novel cyclic peptide spore factor.	1
Title: A Crh-specific function in carbon catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Carbon catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by phosphorylation of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system intermediate HPr at a serine residue catalyzed by HPr kinase. The orthologous protein Crh functions in a similar way, but, unlike HPr, it is not functional in carbohydrate uptake. A specific function for Crh is not known. The role of HPr and Crh in repressing the citM gene encoding the Mg(2+)-citrate transporter was investigated during growth of B. subtilis on different carbon sources. In glucose minimal medium, full repression was supported by both HPr and Crh. Strains deficient in Crh or the regulatory function of HPr revealed the same repression as the wild-type strain. In contrast, in a medium containing succinate and glutamate, repression was specifically mediated via Crh. Repression was relieved in the Crh-deficient strain, but still present in the HPr mutant strain. The data are the first demonstration of a Crh-specific function in B. subtilis and suggest a role for Crh in regulation of expression during growth on substrates other than carbohydrates.	0
Title: [Cloning, expression and characterization of the nucleotidylyltransferase gene-amiE in amicetin biosynthesis] Abstract: Objective:                       The aim of this study is to clone and express the nucleotidylytransferase encoding gene-amiE from the biosynthetic gene cluster of amicetin, a disaccharide nucleoside antibiotic, and to characterize AmiE in vitro.                  Methods:                       The amiE, encoding a nucleotidylytransferase of 257 amino acid, was PCR amplified and cloned into pET28a, resulting in the plasmid pCSG4001, which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expressing N-(His)6-tag AmiE. The recombinant AmiE was purified by affinity chromatography via AKTA Purifier 10 system. The AmiE-catalyzed reactions were performed using TTP (or UTP) and glucose-1-phosphate as substrates. The enzyme assays were analyzed by HPLC; the substrate flexibility of AmiE was probed with three unnatural sugars-1-phosphate, including galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate.                  Results:                       The N-(His)6-tag AmiE was expressed in E. coli in soluble form and was successfully purified via Ni2+ mediated affinity chromatography; in vitro biochemical experiments showed that AmiE could convert glucose-1-phosphate into TDP-glucose (or UDP-glucose) in the presence of TTP (or UTP). However, galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate were not substrates of AmiE.                  Conclusion:                       The amiE was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the purified AmiE was biochemically confirmed to be a nucleotylyltransferase in amicetin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: New Insights into the Biosynthesis of Fosfazinomycin Abstract: The biosynthetic origin of a unique hydrazide moiety in the phosphonate natural product fosfazinomycin is unknown. This study presents the activities of five proteins encoded in its gene cluster. The flavin dependent oxygenase FzmM catalyses the oxidation of L-Asp to N-hydroxy-Asp. When FzmL is added, fumarate is produced in addition to nitrous acid. The adenylosuccinate lyase homolog FzmR eliminates acetylhydrazine from N-acetylhydrazinosuccinate, which in turn is the product of FzmQ-catalysed acetylation of hydrazinosuccinate. Collectively, these findings suggest a path to N-acetylhydrazine from L-Asp. The incorporation of nitrogen from L-Asp into fosfazinomycin was confirmed by isotope labelling studies. Installation of the N-terminal Val of fosfazinomycin is catalysed by FzmI in a Val-tRNA dependent process.	1
Title: The transcription factor NF-kappaB/p50 interacts with the blk gene during B cell activation Abstract: The B cell-specific transcription factor Pax-5 has been shown previously to interact with the promoter of the blk gene in vitro. blk encodes a tyrosine kinase associated with the B cell receptor, which is expressed during the early but not the final stages of B cell development. To investigate whether Pax-5 regulates expression of the blk gene in vivo during B cell development and/or activation, Pax-5a was overexpressed in B cell lines. Increases in blk promoter activity using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene system suggested a role for Pax-5a as a transcriptional activator. Subsequent site-specific mutagenesis studies showed that mutations of the Pax-5 binding site on blk significantly alter promoter activity, although results suggested that other factors could bind to this region as well. Using mobility shift assays, we detected an inducible transcription factor that interacts strongly with a sequence overlapping the Pax-5 site on the blk promoter and identified this as a homodimer of NF-kappaB/p50, a member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors. This factor was present at high levels in lipopolysaccharide-activated normal B cells and in plasma cell lines but either at low levels or undetectable levels in resting normal B cells or pre-B or mature B cell lines. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide induction of a pre-B cell line (703/Z) induced a complex that contained both NF-kappaB/p50 and p65. These studies suggest that different NF-kappaB complexes are able to interact with a sequence overlapping the Pax-5 site on the blk promoter and that the relative levels of "bound" factor influence levels of blk expression. Since p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers of the NF-kappaB complex should have opposing effects on blk transcription, this could provide a mechanism to differentially regulate blk expression during B cell development and activation.	0
Title: A gene determining a new member of the SARP family contributes to transcription of genes for the synthesis of the angucycline polyketide auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: Three regulators, Aur1P, Aur1R and a SARP-family Aur1PR3, have been previously found to control expression of the aur1 cluster for the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Here, we describe an additional regulatory gene, aur1PR4, encoding a homologue from the SARP-family regulators. Its role in auricin regulation was confirmed by its disruption that dramatically affected auricin production. However, transcription from the aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of 22 auricin biosynthetic genes, was not substantially affected in the Δaur1PR4 mutant. A new promoter, sa13p, directing transcription of four putative auricin tailoring genes, was found to be dependent on aur1PR4. Moreover, analysis of the sa13p promoter region revealed the presence of three heptameric repeat sequences corresponding to putative SARP-binding sites. Expression of aur1PR4 is directed by a single promoter, aur1PR4p, which is induced after entry into stationary phase. Transcription from aur1PR4p was absent in a S. aureofaciens Δaur1P mutant strain, and Aur1P was shown to bind specifically to the aur1PR4p promoter. These results indicate a complex network of regulation of the auricin gene cluster. Both Aur1P and Aur1PR3 are involved in regulation of the core aur1A-U biosynthetic genes, and Aur1PR4 in regulation of putative auricin tailoring genes.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of colabomycin E, a new manumycin-family metabolite, involves an unusual chain-length factor Abstract: Colabomycin E is a new member of the manumycin-type metabolites produced by the strain Streptomyces aureus SOK1/5-04 and identified by genetic screening from a library of streptomycete strains. The structures of colabomycin E and accompanying congeners were resolved. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Streptomyces lividans. Bioinformatic analysis and mutagenic studies identified components of the biosynthetic pathway that are involved in the formation of both polyketide chains. Recombinant polyketide synthases (PKSs) assembled from the components of colabomycin E and asukamycin biosynthetic routes catalyzing the biosynthesis of "lower" carbon chains were constructed and expressed in S. aureus SOK1/5-04 ΔcolC11-14 deletion mutant. Analysis of the metabolites produced by recombinant strains provided evidence that in both biosynthetic pathways the length of the lower carbon chain is controlled by an unusual chain-length factor supporting biosynthesis either of a triketide in asukamycin or of a tetraketide in colabomycin E. Biological activity assays indicated that colabomycin E significantly inhibited IL-1β release from THP-1 cells and might thus potentially act as an anti-inflammatory agent.	1
Title: The fungal gene cluster for biosynthesis of the antibacterial agent viriditoxin Abstract: Background:                       Viriditoxin is one of the 'classical' secondary metabolites produced by fungi and that has antibacterial and other activities; however, the mechanism of its biosynthesis has remained unknown.                  Results:                       Here, a gene cluster (vdt) responsible for viriditoxin synthesis was identified, via a bioinformatics analysis of the genomes of Paecilomyces variotii and Aspergillus viridinutans that both are viriditoxin producers. The function of the eight-membered gene cluster of P. variotii was characterized by targeted gene disruptions, revealing the roles of each gene in the synthesis of this molecule and establishing its biosynthetic pathway, which includes a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase catalyzed reaction. Additionally, a predicted catalytically-inactive hydrolase was identified as being required for the stereoselective biosynthesis of (M)-viriditoxin. The subcellular localizations of two proteins (VdtA and VdtG) were determined by fusing these proteins to green fluorescent protein, to establish that at least two intracellular structures are involved in the compartmentalization of the synthesis steps of this metabolite.                  Conclusions:                       The predicted pathway for the synthesis of viriditoxin was established by a combination of genomics, bioinformatics, gene disruption and chemical analysis processes. Hence, this work reveals the basis for the synthesis of an understudied class of fungal secondary metabolites and provides a new model species for understanding the synthesis of biaryl compounds with a chiral axis.	1
Title: Comparison of genetic maps for two Leptospira interrogans serovars provides evidence for two chromosomes and intraspecies heterogeneity Abstract: Genetic maps were constructed for Leptospira interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona. Previously we independently constructed physical maps of the genomes for these two serovars. The genomes of both serovars consist of a large replicon (4.4 to 4.6 Mb) and a small replicon (350 kb). Genes were localized on the physical maps by using Southern blot analysis with specific probes. Among the probes used were genes encoding a variety of essential enzymes and genes usually found near bacterial chromosomal replication origins. Most of the essential genes are on the larger replicon of each serovar. However, the smaller replicons of both serovars contain the asd gene. The asd gene encodes aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential in amino acid and cell wall biosyntheses. The finding that both L. interrogans replicons contain essential genes suggests that both replicons are chromosomes. Comparison of the genetic maps of the larger replicons of the two serovars showed evidence of large rearrangements. These data show that there is considerable intraspecies heterogeneity in L. interrogans.	0
Title: Functional Genome Mining for Metabolites Encoded by Large Gene Clusters through Heterologous Expression of a Whole-Genome Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Library in Streptomyces spp Abstract: Genome sequencing projects in the last decade revealed numerous cryptic biosynthetic pathways for unknown secondary metabolites in microbes, revitalizing drug discovery from microbial metabolites by approaches called genome mining. In this work, we developed a heterologous expression and functional screening approach for genome mining from genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries in Streptomyces spp. We demonstrate mining from a strain of Streptomyces rochei, which is known to produce streptothricins and borrelidin, by expressing its BAC library in the surrogate host Streptomyces lividans SBT5, and screening for antimicrobial activity. In addition to the successful capture of the streptothricin and borrelidin biosynthetic gene clusters, we discovered two novel linear lipopeptides and their corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster, as well as a novel cryptic gene cluster for an unknown antibiotic from S. rochei This high-throughput functional genome mining approach can be easily applied to other streptomycetes, and it is very suitable for the large-scale screening of genomic BAC libraries for bioactive natural products and the corresponding biosynthetic pathways.                  Importance:                       Microbial genomes encode numerous cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters for unknown small metabolites with potential biological activities. Several genome mining approaches have been developed to activate and bring these cryptic metabolites to biological tests for future drug discovery. Previous sequence-guided procedures relied on bioinformatic analysis to predict potentially interesting biosynthetic gene clusters. In this study, we describe an efficient approach based on heterologous expression and functional screening of a whole-genome library for the mining of bioactive metabolites from Streptomyces The usefulness of this function-driven approach was demonstrated by the capture of four large biosynthetic gene clusters for metabolites of various chemical types, including streptothricins, borrelidin, two novel lipopeptides, and one unknown antibiotic from Streptomyces rochei Sal35. The transfer, expression, and screening of the library were all performed in a high-throughput way, so that this approach is scalable and adaptable to industrial automation for next-generation antibiotic discovery.	1
Title: A high-throughput screen for chemical inhibitors of exocytic transport in yeast Abstract: Most of the components of the membrane and protein traffic machinery were discovered by perturbing their functions, either with bioactive compounds or by mutations. However, the mechanisms responsible for exocytic transport vesicle formation at the Golgi and endosomes are still largely unknown. Both the exocytic traffic routes and the signaling pathways that regulate these routes are highly complex and robust, so that defects can be overcome by alternate pathways or mechanisms. A classical yeast genetic screen designed to account for the robustness of the exocytic pathway identified a novel conserved gene, AVL9, which functions in late exocytic transport. We now describe a chemical-genetic version of the mutant screen, in which we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen of a large compound library and identified novel small-molecule secretory inhibitors. To maximize the number and diversity of our hits, the screen was performed in a pdr5Delta snq2Delta mutant background, which lacks two transporters responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance. However, we found that deletion of both transporters reduced the fitness of our screen strain, whereas the pdr5Delta mutation had a relatively small effect on growth and was also the more important transporter mutation for conferring sensitivity to our hits. In this and similar chemical-genetic yeast screens, using just a single pump mutation might be sufficient for increasing hit diversity while minimizing the physiological effects of transporter mutations.	0
Title: G-Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects Abstract: White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G-quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G→T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild-type sequence into a three-tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1 : 3 : 1 and a minor 1 : 2 : 2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1 : 3 : 1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.	0
Title: Unusual structure-energy correlations in intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction transition states Abstract: Detailed analysis of calculated data from an experimental/computational study of intramolecular furan Diels-Alder reactions has led to the unusual discovery that the mean contraction of the newly forming C-C σ-bonds from the transition state to the product shows a linear correlation with both reaction Gibbs free energies and reverse energy barriers. There is evidence for a similar correlation in other intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions involving non-aromatic dienes. No such correlation is found for intermolecular Diels-Alder reactions.	0
Title: Ligand-Enabled γ-C(sp3)-H Activation of Ketones Abstract: We report the first example of Pd(II)-catalyzed γ-C(sp3)-H activation of ketones directed by a practical 2,2-dimethyl aminooxyacetic acid auxiliary. 2-Pyridone ligands are identified to enable C(sp3)-H activation for the first time. A rare six-membered palladacycle intermediate is isolated and characterized to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Both (hetero)arylation and vinylation of γ-C(sp3)-H bonds are demonstrated. Sequential β- and γ-C(sp3)-H (hetero)arylation of muscone showcases the utility of this method for late-stage diversification. A convenient Mn(II)-catalyzed auxiliary removal is also developed to further underscore the practicality of this transformation.	0
Title: Highly water-soluble neutral BODIPY dyes with controllable fluorescence quantum yields Abstract: A series of novel highly water-soluble neutral BODIPY dyes have been obtained by functionalization of BODIPY dyes with branched oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether groups at positions 8, 2 and 6 or 4 and 4'. Use of an ortho-substituent group of branched oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether on the meso-phenyl ring of BODIPY dyes and replacement of the fluorine atoms of BODIPY dyes at positions 4 and 4' with methyloxy or ethynyl subunits significantly enhance fluorescence quantum yields of BODIPY dyes.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the tetrocarcin A gene cluster from Micromonospora chalcea NRRL 11289 reveals a highly conserved strategy for tetronate biosynthesis in spirotetronate antibiotics Abstract: Tetrocarcin A (TCA), produced by Micromonospora chalcea NRRL 11289, is a spirotetronate antibiotic with potent antitumor activity and versatile modes of action. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of TCA was cloned and localized to a 108-kb contiguous DNA region. In silico sequence analysis revealed 36 putative genes that constitute this cluster (including 11 for unusual sugar biosynthesis, 13 for aglycone formation, and 4 for glycosylations) and allowed us to propose the biosynthetic pathway of TCA. The formation of D-tetronitrose, L-amicetose, and L-digitoxose may begin with D-glucose-1-phosphate, share early enzymatic steps, and branch into different pathways by competitive actions of specific enzymes. Tetronolide biosynthesis involves the incorporation of a 3-C unit with a polyketide intermediate to form the characteristic spirotetronate moiety and trans-decalin system. Further substitution of tetronolide with five deoxysugars (one being a deoxynitrosugar) was likely due to the activities of four glycosyltransferases. In vitro characterization of the first enzymatic step by utilization of 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as the substrate and in vivo cross-complementation of the bifunctional fused gene tcaD3 (with the functions of chlD3 and chlD4) to Delta chlD3 and Delta chlD4 in chlorothricin biosynthesis supported the highly conserved tetronate biosynthetic strategy in the spirotetronate family. Deletion of a large DNA fragment encoding polyketide synthases resulted in a non-TCA-producing strain, providing a clear background for the identification of novel analogs. These findings provide insights into spirotetronate biosynthesis and demonstrate that combinatorial-biosynthesis methods can be applied to the TCA biosynthetic machinery to generate structural diversity.	1
Title: DNA polymorphism analysis of Brucella lipopolysaccharide genes reveals marked differences in O-polysaccharide biosynthetic genes between smooth and rough Brucella species and novel species-specific markers Abstract: Background:                       The lipopolysaccharide is a major antigen and virulence factor of Brucella, an important bacterial pathogen. In smooth brucellae, lipopolysaccharide is made of lipid A-core oligosaccharide and N-formylperosamine O-polysaccharide. B. ovis and B. canis (rough species) lack the O-polysaccharide.                  Results:                       The polymorphism of O-polysaccharide genes wbkE, manA(O-Ag), manB(O-Ag), manC(O-Ag), wbkF and wbkD) and wbo (wboA and wboB), and core genes manB(core) and wa** was analyzed. Although most genes were highly conserved, species- and biovar-specific restriction patterns were found. There were no significant differences in putative N-formylperosamyl transferase genes, suggesting that Brucella A and M serotypes are not related to specific genes. In B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti (both smooth), manB(O-Ag) carried an IS711, confirming its dispensability for perosamine synthesis. Significant differences between smooth and rough species were found in wbkF and wbkD, two adjacent genes putatively related to bactoprenol priming for O-polysaccharide polymerization. B. ovis wbkF carried a frame-shift and B. canis had a long deletion partially encompassing both genes. In smooth brucellae, this region contains two direct repeats suggesting the deletion mechanism.                  Conclusion:                       The results define species and biovar markers, confirm the dispensability of manB(O-Ag) for O-polysaccharide synthesis and contribute to explain the lipopolysaccharide structure of rough and smooth Brucella species.	0
Title: Genetically engineered Fusarium as a tool to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on initiation of trichothecene biosynthesis Abstract: Fusarium graminearum was engineered for expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (egfp) as a reporter regulated in a manner similar to Tri5, a key pathway gene in trichothecene biosynthesis. Using the transgenic fungus, it was found that the reporter gene was induced to express in aerial hyphae developed on trichothecene noninducing medium YG solidified by agar. Unexpectedly, the transcriptional activation of egfp was markedly suppressed by adding NaCl that does not significantly affect fungal growth. As suggested by these findings, wild-type F. graminearum that formed aerial hyphae on YG agar plates produced trichothecenes and the production was effectively suppressed by adding 1% NaCl to the agar. To evaluate the effects of abiotic stress on the expression of trichothecene biosynthesis (Tri) genes, a sensitive plate assay was established using GYEP medium (which very weakly induces trichothecene production) solidified with gellan gum. Using this assay, triazole fungicides were shown to cause transcriptional activation of egfp at sublethal concentrations. Indeed, trichothecene production significantly increased when F. graminearum was grown in rice medium (which moderately induces trichothecene) amended with low doses of tebuconazole. The real-time monitoring system described here may help predict the risks of trichothecene contamination by the fungus under various environmental conditions.	1
Title: Effects of DNA adduct structure and sequence context on strand opening of repair intermediates and incision by UvrABC nuclease Abstract: DNA damage recognition of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in Escherichia coli is achieved by at least two steps. In the first step, a helical distortion is recognized, which leads to a strand opening at the lesion site. The second step involves the recognition of the type of chemical modification in the single-stranded region of DNA during the processing of the lesions by UvrABC. In the current work, by comparing the efficiencies of UvrABC incision of several types of different DNA adducts, we show that the size and position of the strand opening are dependent on the type of DNA adducts. Optimal incision efficiency for the C8-guanine adducts of 2-aminofluorene (AF) and N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) was observed in a bubble of three mismatched nucleotides, whereas the same for C8-guanine adduct of 1-nitropyrene and N(2)-guanine adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) was noted in a bubble of six mismatched nucleotides. This suggests that the size of the aromatic ring system of the adduct might influence the extent and number of bases associated with the opened strand region catalyzed by UvrABC. We also showed that the incision efficiency of the AF or AAF adduct was affected by the neighboring DNA sequence context, which, in turn, was the result of differential binding of UvrA to the substrates. The sequence context effect on both incision and binding disappeared when a bubble structure of three bases was introduced at the adduct site. We therefore propose that these effects relate to the initial step of damage recognition of DNA structural distortion. The structure-function relationships in the recognition of the DNA lesions, based on our results, have been discussed.	0
Title: Micromonohalimanes A and B: Antibacterial Halimane-Type Diterpenoids from a Marine Micromonospora Species Abstract: Despite the fact that actinomycetes harbor the genetic potential to produce terpenes, terpenoid natural products tend to be a rare occurrence in fermentation broths. Here we report two new halimane-type diterpenoids, micromonohalimanes A (1) and B (2), that were isolated from a Micromonospora sp. cultivated from the marine ascidian Symplegma brakenhielmi. This is the first report of the halimane-type diterpenoids from Micromonospora. The structures were determined using spectroscopic methods including X-ray crystallography to establish the absolute configuration. Micromonohalimane B demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	0
Title: The cryo-EM structure of a γ-TuSC elucidates architecture and regulation of minimal microtubule nucleation systems Abstract: The nucleation of microtubules from αβ-tubulin subunits is mediated by γ-tubulin complexes, which vary in composition across organisms. Aiming to understand how de novo microtubule formation is achieved and regulated by a minimal microtubule nucleation system, we here determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the heterotetrameric γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC) from C. albicans at near-atomic resolution. Compared to the vertebrate γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), we observed a vastly remodeled interface between the SPC/GCP-γ-tubulin spokes, which stabilizes the complex and defines the γ-tubulin arrangement. The relative positioning of γ-tubulin subunits indicates that a conformational rearrangement of the complex is required for microtubule nucleation activity, which follows opposing directionality as predicted for the vertebrate γ-TuRC. Collectively, our data suggest that the assembly and regulation mechanisms of γ-tubulin complexes fundamentally differ between the microtubule nucleation systems in lower and higher eukaryotes.	0
Title: Effects of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene knockouts on erythromycin production in carbohydrate-based and oil-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: In carbohydrate-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, a polar knockout of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) gene, mutB, improved erythromycin production an average of 126% (within the range of 102-153% for a 0.95 confidence interval). In oil-based fermentations, where erythromycin production by the wild-type strain averages 184% higher (141-236%, 0.95 CI) than in carbohydrate-based fermentations, the same polar knockout in mutB surprisingly reduced erythromycin production by 66% (53-76%, 0.95 CI). A metabolic model is proposed where in carbohydrate-based fermentations MCM acts as a drain on the methylmalonyl-CoA metabolite pool, and in oil-based fermentations, MCM acts in the reverse direction to fill the methylmalonyl-CoA pool. Therefore, the model explains, in part, how the well-known oil-based process improvement for erythromycin production operates at the biochemical level; furthermore, it illustrates how the mutB erythromycin strain improvement mutation operates at the genetic level in carbohydrate-based fermentations.	1
Title: Analysis of the conserved acidic residues in the regulatory domain of PhoB Abstract: The PhoB protein from Escherichia coli is a member of the two-component signal transduction pathway that controls an adaptive response to limiting phosphate. Activation involves its phosphorylation on a conserved aspartate. Site-directed mutations were introduced at conserved acidic residues. The E9D, D10E, D10N, E11A, E11D and E11Q mutants were each able to induce alkaline phosphatase under low phosphate growth conditions whereas the E9A, D10A, D53A, D53E and D53N could not. The E9Q mutant was constitutively active. Phosphorylation assays showed that only the E9D, E11A, E11Q and E11D mutants were phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate. Most mutants also displayed defects in magnesium binding.	0
Title: Heterologous characterization of mechercharmycin A biosynthesis reveals alternative insights into post-translational modifications for RiPPs Abstract: Mechercharmycin A (MCM-A) is a marine natural product belonging to a family of polyazole cyclopeptides with remarkable bioactivities and unique structures. Identification, heterologous expression, and genetic characterizations of the MCM biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis revealed that it is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) possessing complex with distinctive modifications. Based on this heterologous expression system, two MCM analogs with comparable antitumor activity are generated by engineering the biosynthetic pathway. Combinatorial co-production of a precursor peptide with different modifying enzymes in Escherichia coli identifies a different timing of modifications, showing that a tRNAGlu-dependent highly regioselective dehydration is the first modification step, followed by polyazole formation through heterocyclization and dehydrogenation in an N- to C-terminal direction. Therefore, a rational biosynthetic pathway of MCMs is proposed, which unveils a subfamily of azol(in)e-containing RiPPs and sets the stage for further investigations of the enzymatic mechanism and synthetic biology.	1
Title: The Cremeomycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Encodes a Pathway for Diazo Formation Abstract: Diazo groups are found in a range of natural products that possess potent biological activities. Despite longstanding interest in these metabolites, diazo group biosynthesis is not well understood, in part because of difficulties in identifying specific genes linked to diazo formation. Here we describe the discovery of the gene cluster that produces the o-diazoquinone natural product cremeomycin and its heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans. We used stable isotope feeding experiments and in vitro characterization of biosynthetic enzymes to decipher the order of events in this pathway and establish that diazo construction involves late-stage N-N bond formation. This work represents the first successful production of a diazo-containing metabolite in a heterologous host, experimentally linking a set of genes with diazo formation.	1
Title: Properties of lanK-based regulatory circuit involved in landomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 Abstract: LanK is TetR-like regulatory protein recently shown to regulate the export and glycosylation of landomycins in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136. Here, several properties of the lanK-mediated regulation were deciphered. LanK seems to function as oligomer as evident from experiments in vitro. In vivo, it is able to recognize various landomycins with altered aglycon structure and the minimal concentration of landomycin A sensed by LanK lies in low nanomolar range. Coexpression studies showed that the positive regulatory gene lanI upregulates lanK-dependent lan genes once the negative LanK-regulation is cancelled. Gene lanK can be useful for the construction of biosensor strains for sensitive and specific identification of producers of landomycin-like molecules with long glycosidic chains.	1
Title: The E1 functional epitope of the human interferon gamma is a nuclear targeting signal-like element. Mapping of the E1 epitope Abstract: Eight neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the human interferon gamma (HuIFN-gamma) that were classified in the E1 epitope group were mapped by the synthetic peptide approach. A set of 136 octapeptide homologs of the 143-residue primary sequence of the HuIFN-gamma, each one with a 7-residue sequence overlap with successive peptide, was synthesized. Based on the similar reactivity patterns of all the mAbs with this set of synthetic peptides, the E1 functional epitope was localized to residues 84-94 on the HuIFN-gamma. The epitope sequence is: Ser-Asn-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Asp-Asp-Phe-Gln-Lys. The fact that eight independently isolated mAbs binding to the same domain can neutralize the HuIFN-gamma activity suggests that the E1 domain must be at or adjacent to a functional site. Within this domain is a sequence element, Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg, that resembles the nuclear location signals known to effect the intracellular transportation of a number of nuclear proteins, such as the large tumor antigen (T antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus and steroid hormone receptors. This observation suggests that the HuIFN-gamma molecule and/or its complex with the receptor must function in the nucleus to effect transcription regulation that results in the various biological activities. The signal for that intracellular transportation must be provided by the HuIFN-gamma molecule.	0
Title: Reverse β-oxidation pathways for efficient chemical production Abstract: Microbial production of fuels, chemicals, and materials has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a sustainable bioeconomy. While synthetic biology allows readjusting of native metabolic pathways for the synthesis of desired products, often these native pathways do not support maximum efficiency and are affected by complex regulatory mechanisms. A synthetic or engineered pathway that allows modular synthesis of versatile bioproducts with minimal enzyme requirement and regulation while achieving high carbon and energy efficiency could be an alternative solution to address these issues. The reverse β-oxidation (rBOX) pathways enable iterative non-decarboxylative elongation of carbon molecules of varying chain lengths and functional groups with only four core enzymes and no ATP requirement. Here, we describe recent developments in rBOX pathway engineering to produce alcohols and carboxylic acids with diverse functional groups, along with other commercially important molecules such as polyketides. We discuss the application of rBOX beyond the pathway itself by its interfacing with various carbon-utilization pathways and deployment in different organisms, which allows feedstock diversification from sugars to glycerol, carbon dioxide, methane, and other substrates.	0
Title: Therapeutic effect of SF-2103A, a novel carbapenem antibiotic, in combination with cefotaxime, cefoperazone and other cephalosporins Abstract: Combinations of SF-2103A with cefotaxime, cefoperazone or cefazolin showed synergistic efficacy at a wide range of combination ratios against experimental infection in mice due to Proteus vulgaris GN76/C-1, producing type Ic cephalosporinase, Escherichia coli No. 29/36 RGN823, producing type IIIa (TEM-2) penicillinase and E. coli GN206, producing type Ib cephalosporinase. These effects by SF-2103A were greater than those seen with sulbactam. The in vitro and in vivo synergistic activities were roughly correlated. Potent in vivo activity of SF-2103A was related to good pharmacokinetic properties, with blood half-life of 30 minutes and urinary recovery of 55.2% after parenteral administration to rats. Furthermore, SF-2103A was stable to rat kidney homogenate. The high stability of SF-2103A in aqueous and biological media was correlated with the sulfonate group at C-3.	0
Title: Redesigning enzymes based on adaptive evolution for optimal function in synthetic metabolic pathways Abstract: Nature has balanced most metabolic pathways such that no one enzyme in the pathway controls the flux through that pathway. However, unnatural or nonnative, constructed metabolic pathways may have limited product flux due to unfavorable in vivo properties of one or more enzymes in the pathway. One such example is the mevalonate-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that we previously reconstructed in Escherichia coli. We have used a probable mechanism of adaptive evolution to engineer the in vivo properties of two enzymes (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [tHMGR] and many terpene synthases) in this pathway and thereby eliminate or minimize the bottleneck created by these inefficient or nonfunctional enzymes. Here, we demonstrate how we significantly improved the productivity (by approximately 1000 fold) of this reconstructed biosynthetic pathway using this strategy. We anticipate that this strategy will find broad applicability in the functional construction (or reconstruction) of biological pathways in heterologous hosts.	0
Title: Reciprocal Regulation of ERα and ERβ Stability and Activity by Diptoindonesin G Abstract: ERβ is regarded as a "tumor suppressor" in breast cancer due to its anti-proliferative effects. However, unlike ERα, ERβ has not been developed as a therapeutic target in breast cancer due to loss of ERβ in aggressive cancers. In a small-molecule library screen for ERβ stabilizers, we identified Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), which significantly increases ERβ protein stability while decreasing ERα protein levels. Dip G enhances the transcription and anti-proliferative activities of ERβ, while attenuating the transcription and proliferative effects of ERα. Further investigation revealed that instead of targeting ER, Dip G targets the CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase shared by ERα and ERβ. Thus, Dip G is a dual-functional moiety that reciprocally controls ERα and ERβ protein stability and activities via an indirect mechanism. The ERβ stabilization effects of Dip G may enable the development of ERβ-targeted therapies for human breast cancers.	0
Title: A TR-FRET-based functional assay for screening activators of CARM1 Abstract: Epigenetics is an emerging field that demands selective cell-permeable chemical probes to perturb, especially in vivo, the activity of specific enzymes involved in modulating the epigenetic codes. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a coactivator of estrogen receptor α (ERα), the main target in human breast cancer. We previously showed that twofold overexpression of CARM1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells increased the expression of ERα-target genes involved in differentiation and reduced cell proliferation, thus leading to the hypothesis that activating CARM1 by chemical activators might be therapeutically effective in breast cancer. Selective, potent, cell-permeable CARM1 activators will be essential to test this hypothesis. Here we report the development of a cell-based, time-resolved (TR) FRET assay that uses poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) methylation to monitor cellular activity of CARM1. The LanthaScreen TR-FRET assay uses MCF7 cells expressing GFP-PABP1 fusion protein through BacMam gene delivery system, methyl-PABP1 specific antibody, and terbium-labeled secondary antibody. This assay has been validated as reflecting the expression and/or activity of CARM1 and optimized for high throughput screening to identify CARM1 allosteric activators. This TR-FRET platform serves as a generic tool for functional screening of cell-permeable, chemical modulators of CARM1 for elucidation of its in vivo functions.	0
Title: Transcriptional Differences Guided Discovery and Genetic Identification of Coprogen and Dimerumic Acid Siderophores in Metarhizium robertsii Abstract: Siderophores are small molecular iron chelators and participate in the multiple cellular processes in fungi. In this study, biosynthesis gene clusters of coprogens and dimerumic acids were identified by transcriptional level differences of genes related to iron deficiency conditions in Metarhizium robertsii. This leads to the characterization of new coprogen metachelin C (1) and five known siderophores metachelin A (2), metachelin A-CE (3), metachelin B (4), dimerumic acid 11-mannoside (5), and dimerumic acid (6). The structure of metachelin C (1) was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and HR-ESI-MS analysis. Genetic deletions of mrsidA, and mrsidD abolished the production of compounds 1-6 that implied their involvement in the biosynthesis of coprogen and dimerumic acid. Interestingly, NRPS gene mrsidD is responsible for biosynthesis of both coprogen and dimerumic acid, thus we proposed plausible biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of coprogen and dimerumic acid siderophores. Therefore, our study provides the genetic basis for understanding the biosynthetic pathway of coprogen and dimerumic acid in Metarhizium robertsii.	1
Title: Production of High Amounts of Hepatotoxin Nodularin and New Protease Inhibitors Pseudospumigins by the Brazilian Benthic Nostoc sp. CENA543 Abstract: Nostoc is a cyanobacterial genus, common in soils and a prolific producer of natural products. This research project aimed to explore and characterize Brazilian cyanobacteria for new bioactive compounds. Here we report the production of hepatotoxins and new protease inhibitors from benthic Nostoc sp. CENA543 isolated from a small, shallow, saline-alkaline lake in the Nhecolândia, Pantanal wetland area in Brazil. Nostoc sp. CENA543 produces exceptionally high amounts of nodularin-R. This is the first free-living Nostoc that produces nodularin at comparable levels as the toxic, bloom-forming, Nodularia spumigena. We also characterized pseudospumigins A-F, which are a novel family of linear tetrapeptides. Pseudospumigins are structurally related to linear tetrapeptide spumigins and aeruginosins both present in N. spumigena but differ in respect to their diagnostic amino acid, which is Ile/Leu/Val in pseudospumigins, Pro/mPro in spumigins, and Choi in aeruginosins. The pseudospumigin gene cluster is more similar to the spumigin biosynthetic gene cluster than the aeruginosin gene cluster. Pseudospumigin A inhibited trypsin (IC50 4.5 μM after 1 h) in a similar manner as spumigin E from N. spumigena but was almost two orders of magnitude less potent. This study identifies another location and environment where the hepatotoxic nodularin has the potential to cause the death of eukaryotic organisms.	1
Title: Identification and heterologous expression of the actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Actinoallolides are anti-trypanosomal macrolides isolated from the secondary metabolites of two endophytic actinomycete strains, Actinoallomurus fulvus MK10-036 and K09-0307. A putative actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster was predicted from the genome sequence of the strain K09-0307. The gene cluster spans a contiguous 53 kb DNA region that comprises seven genes encoding three PKSs (aalA1, aalA2, and aalA3), cytochrome P450 (aalB), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (aalC), crotonyl-CoA reductase (aalD), and TetR family regulator (aalR). The entire gene cluster was cloned into a plasmid pYIK1 by assembling DNA fragments, which were obtained from two cosmids containing left and right parts of the gene cluster. Following the introduction of an ermE* promoter at 100bp upstream from the start codon of aalA1, the gene cluster was introduced into Streptomyces coelicolor M1152. Subsequent LC-MS analysis revealed production of actinoallolide A in the culture broth. Thus, the actinoallolide biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by heterologous expression in Streptomyces.	1
Title: A repressor-antirepressor pair links two loci controlling light-induced carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The light-inducible carB operon encodes all but one of the structural genes for carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus. It is transcriptionally controlled by two proteins expressed from two unlinked genetic loci: CarS from the light-inducible carQRS operon, and CarA from the light-independent carA operon. CarA represses transcription from the carB promoter (P(B)) in the dark, and CarS counteracts this on illumination. The CarA sequence revealed a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif of the type found in bacterial MerR transcriptional factors, whereas CarS contains no known DNA-binding motif. Here, we examine the molecular interplay between CarA and CarS. We demonstrate the following. (i) Whereas CarS exhibits no DNA binding in vitro, CarA binds specifically to a region encompassing P(B) to form at least two distinct complexes. (ii) A palindrome located between positions -46 and -63 relative to the transcription start point is essential but not sufficient for the formation of the two CarA-DNA complexes observed. (iii) CarS abrogates the specific DNA binding of CarA. CarA is therefore a repressor and CarS an antirepressor. (iv) CarS physically interacts with CarA; thus, the functional interaction between them is mediated by protein-protein interactions.	1
Title: Tn21-specific structures in gram-negative bacteria from clinical isolates Abstract: A total of 807 gram-negative clinical isolates were treated with five different probes: intragenic segments for the transposase gene tnpA; the resolvase gene tnpR; the modulator of the resolvase, tnpM; the integraselike factor gene tnpI; and a 20-mer oligonucleotide for the recombinational site of action for the integrase. A total of 8% of the isolates hybridized with all five Tn21-related probes, and another 11% represented transposons in which one or more of the tested genes were missing. This 11% included groups whose descriptions have been published as well as groups that have not yet been described. The not-yet-described groups include various deletion products and some precursor structures, as is predicted for the evolution of Tn21-like transposons. The integration system appears to be coupled with Tn21-like structures and yet independent from these structures, implying an independent evolution of this system from Tn21-like transposons. The structures were found with similar incidence levels in all species tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which a novel separate family of class II transposons has been described before.	0
Title: A chemical and genetic approach to the mode of action of fumagillin Abstract: Previous mode of action studies identified methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2) as the target of the antiangiogenic natural product fumagillin and its drug candidate analog, TNP-470. We report here that TNP-470-mediated MetAP-2 inhibition blocks noncanonical Wnt signaling, which plays a critical role in development, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this finding, antisense MetAP-2 morpholino oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish embryos phenocopies gastrulation defects seen in noncanonical Wnt5 loss-of-function zebrafish mutants. MetAP-2 inhibition or depletion blocks signaling downstream of the Wnt receptor Frizzled, but upstream of Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II, RhoA, and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase. Moreover, we demonstrate that TNP-470 does not block the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Thus, TNP-470 selectively regulates noncanonical over canonical Wnt signaling and provides a unique means to explore and dissect the biological systems mediated by these pathways.	0
Title: Structural Studies Provide New Insights into the Role of Lysine Acetylation on Substrate Recognition by CARM1 and Inform the Design of Potent Peptidomimetic Inhibitors Abstract: The dynamic interplay of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin provides a communication system for the regulation of gene expression. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role that such crosstalk between PTMs plays in chromatin recognition. In this study, (bio)chemical and structural approaches were applied to specifically probe the impact of acetylation of Lys18 in the histone H3 tail peptide on peptide recognition by the protein methyltransferase coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Peptidomimetics that recapitulate the transition state of protein arginine N-methyltransferases, were designed based on the H3 peptide wherein the target Arg17 was flanked by either a free or an acetylated lysine. Structural studies with these peptidomimetics and the catalytic domain of CARM1 provide new insights into the binding of the H3 peptide within the enzyme active site. While the co-crystal structures reveal that lysine acetylation results in minor conformational differences for both CARM1 and the H3 peptide, acetylation of Lys18 does lead to additional interactions (Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) and likely reduces the cost of desolvation upon binding, resulting in increased affinity. Informed by these findings a series of smaller peptidomimetics were also prepared and found to maintain potent and selective CARM1 inhibition. These findings provide new insights both into the mechanism of crosstalk between arginine methylation and lysine acetylation as well as towards the development of peptidomimetic CARM1 inhibitors.	0
Title: Leinamycin biosynthesis revealing unprecedented architectural complexity for a hybrid polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase Abstract: A 135,638 bp DNA region that encompasses the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140. The boundaries of the lnm cluster were defined by systematic inactivation of open reading frames within the sequenced region. The lnm cluster spans 61.3 kb of DNA and consists of 27 genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS), hybrid NRPS-PKS, resistance, regulatory, and tailoring enzymes, as well as proteins of unknown function. A model for LNM biosynthesis is proposed, central to which is the LNM hybrid NRPS-PKS megasynthetase consisting of discrete (LnmQ and LnmP) and modular (LnmI) NRPS, acyltransferase-less PKS (LnmG, LnmI, and LnmJ), and PKS modules with unusual domain organization. These studies unveil an unprecedented architectural complexity for the LNM hybrid NRPS-PKS megasynthetase and set the stage to investigate the molecular basis for LNM biosynthesis.	1
Title: Turning Cucurbit[8]uril into a Supramolecular Nanoreactor for Asymmetric Catalysis Abstract: Chiral macromolecules have been widely used as synthetic pockets to mimic natural enzymes and promote asymmetric reactions. An achiral host, cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), was used for an asymmetric Lewis acid catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction. We achieved a remarkable increase in enantioselectivity and a large rate acceleration in the presence of the nanoreactor by using an amino acid as the chiral source. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that both the amino acid-Cu(2+) complex and the dienophile substrate are included inside the macrocyclic host cavity, suggesting that contiguity and conformational constraints are fundamental to the catalytic process and rate enhancement. These results pave the way towards new studies on asymmetric reactions catalyzed in confined achiral cavities.	0
Title: The non-ribosomal assembly and frequent occurrence of the protease inhibitors spumigins in the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena Abstract: Nodularia spumigena is a filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium that forms toxic blooms in brackish water bodies worldwide. Spumigins are serine protease inhibitors reported from a single strain of N. spumigena isolated from the Baltic Sea. These linear tetrapeptides contain non-proteinogenic amino acids including a C-terminal alcohol derivative of arginine. However, very little is known about these compounds despite the ecological importance of N. spumigena. We show that spumigins are assembled by two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encoded in a 21 kb biosynthetic gene cluster. The compact non-ribosomal peptide synthetase features a reductive loading and release mechanism. Our analyses demonstrate that the bulk of spumigins produced by N. spumigena are released as peptide aldehydes in contrast to earlier findings. The main spumigin E variant contains an argininal residue and is a potent trypsin inhibitor. Spumigins were present in all of the N. spumigena strains isolated from the Baltic Sea and comprised up to 1% of the dry weight of the cyanobacterium. Our results demonstrate that bloom-forming N. spumigena strains produce a cocktail of enzyme inhibitors, which may explain in part the ecological success of this cyanobacterium in brackish water bodies worldwide.	1
Title: Two alternative starter modules for the non-ribosomal biosynthesis of specific anabaenopeptin variants in Anabaena (Cyanobacteria) Abstract: Anabaenopeptins are a diverse family of cyclic hexapeptide protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria that contain a conserved ureido bond and D-Lys moiety. Here we demonstrate that anabaenopeptins are assembled on a nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzyme complex encoded by a 32 kb apt gene cluster in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 90. Surprisingly, the gene cluster encoded two alternative starter modules organized in separate bimodular proteins. The starter modules display high substrate specificity for L-Arg/L-Lys and L-Tyr, respectively, and allow the specific biosynthesis of different anabaenopeptin variants. The two starter modules were found also in other Anabaena strains. However, just a single module was present in the anabaenopeptin gene clusters of Nostoc and Nodularia, respectively. The organization of the apt gene cluster in Anabaena represents an exception to the established colinearity rule of linear non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.	1
Title: Facile synthesis of native and protease-resistant ubiquitylated peptides Abstract: The reversible post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins by ubiquitin regulates key cellular processes including protein degradation and gene transcription. Studies of the mechanistic roles for protein ubiquitylation require quantities of homogenously modified substrates that are typically inaccessible from natural sources or by enzymatic ubiquitylation in vitro. Therefore, we developed a facile and scalable methodology for site-specific chemical ubiquitylation. Our semisynthetic strategy utilized a temporary ligation auxiliary, 2-(aminooxy)ethanethiol, to direct ubiquitylation to specific lysine residues in peptide substrates. Mild reductive removal of the auxiliary after ligation yielded ubiquitylated peptides with the native isopeptide linkage. Alternatively, retention of the ligation auxiliary yielded protease-resistant analogues of ubiquitylated peptides. Importantly, our strategy was fully compatible with the presence of protein thiol groups, as demonstrated by the synthesis of peptides modified by the human small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 protein.	0
Title: Shared biosynthesis of the saliniketals and rifamycins in Salinispora arenicola is controlled by the sare1259-encoded cytochrome P450 Abstract: Saliniketals A and B are unusual polyketides from the marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola that inhibit ornithine decarboxylase induction. The structural similarities between the saliniketals and the ansa chain of the potent rifamycin antibiotics, which co-occur in the fermentation broth, suggest a common origin between the two compound classes. Using PCR-directed mutagenesis, chemical complementation studies, and stable isotope feeding experiments, we showed that the saliniketals are byproducts of the rifamycin biosynthetic pathway diverging at the stage of 34a-deoxyrifamycin W. Our results suggest that a single enzyme, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded by sare1259, catalyzes multiple oxidative rearrangement reactions on 34a-deoxyrifamyin W to yield both the saliniketal and rifamycin structural classes.	1
Title: Legonaridin, a new member of linaridin RiPP from a Ghanaian Streptomyces isolate Abstract: Linaridins are rare linear ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and only two, cypemycin and SGR-1832, in this family have been identified so far. Legonaridin 1 has been discovered as a new member of linaridins through chemical isolation, peptidogenomics, comprehensive 1- and 2-D NMR and advanced Marfey's analyses from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. CT34, an isolate collected from Legon, Ghana. Bioinformatics analysis of the gene cluster suggested that the biosynthesis of legonaridin 1 is different from those of cypemycin and SGR-1832. Consistent with bioinformatics and peptidogenomics analyses, 1 has a total of nine post-modifications, 8 dehydrobutyrine residues and a N,N-dimethylated N-terminus with a carboxylic acid at the C-terminus. Legonaridin 1 is structurally different from the two known linaridins comprising a new subfamily. This is the first time that NMR spectroscopy is used to establish the 2-D structure of a linaridin RiPP.	1
Title: Mechanistic insights into polycycle formation by reductive cyclization in ikarugamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Ikarugamycin is a member of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) family of natural products with diverse biological activities. The biochemical mechanisms for the formation of polycyclic ring systems in PTMs remain elusive. The enzymatic mechanism of constructing an inner five-membered ring in ikarugamycin is reported. A three-gene-cassette ikaABC from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. ZJ306 is sufficient for conferring ikarugamycin production in a heterologous host. IkaC catalyzes a reductive cyclization reaction to form the inner five-membered ring by a Michael addition-like reaction. This study provides the first biochemical evidence for polycycle formation in PTMs and suggests a reductive cyclization strategy which may be potentially applicable in general to the corresponding ring formation in other PTMs.	1
Title: Diversity of carotenoid synthesis gene clusters from environmental Enterobacteriaceae strains Abstract: Eight Enterobacteriaceae strains that produce zeaxanthin and derivatives of this compound were isolated from a variety of environmental samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains grouped with different clusters of Erwinia type strains. Four strains representing the phylogenetic diversity were chosen for further characterization, which revealed their genetic diversity as well as their biochemical diversity. The carotenoid synthesis gene clusters cloned from the four strains had three different gene organizations. Two of the gene clusters, those from strains DC416 and DC260, had the classical organization crtEXYIBZ; the gene cluster from DC413 had the rare organization crtE-idi-XYIBZ; and the gene cluster from DC404 had the unique organization crtE-idi-YIBZ. Besides the diversity in genetic organization, these genes also exhibited considerable sequence diversity. On average, they exhibited 60 to 70% identity with each other, as well as with the corresponding genes of the Pantoea type strains. The four different clusters were individually expressed in Escherichia coli, and the two idi-containing clusters gave more than fivefold-higher carotenoid titers than the two clusters lacking idi. Expression of the crtEYIB genes with and without idi confirmed the effect of increasing carotenoid titer by the type II idi gene linked with the carotenoid synthesis gene clusters.	1
Title: DNA sequence and functions of the actVI region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by DNA sequencing of 5.7 kilobase pairs at the left end of the act cluster (the so-called "actVI region"), in the order: ORFB, ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4. ORF1-4 are transcribed rightward and in the same direction as the ORFs of the actVA region which lies to the right of the actVI region, whereas ORFA and ORFB run in the opposite direction. By complementation of mutants and gene disruption of the wild type strain, the two previously genetically characterized actVI mutations were assigned to ORF1. Although disruption of ORFB and ORF4, using phi C31 derivatives, did not cause any obvious change in actinorhodin production, defects in actinorhodin synthesis were obtained by insertional inactivation of ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, or ORF3. RNA analysis within the ORF1/ORFA intergenic region showed overlapping divergent promoters, at least one of which is under the control of the actII-ORF4 gene product, the transcriptional activator of the act cluster. Data base searches with the deduced products of ORFB and ORF3 failed to show any significant similarities with other known proteins. The deduced product of ORFA strongly resembles those of genes of unknown function from Saccharopolyspora hirsuta and Streptomyces roseofulvus, located within polyketide synthase clusters. The ORF1 product strongly resembles beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases of bacteria and mammals and the ORF2 and ORF4 products resemble each other and enoyl reductases from bacteria, animals, and plants, with a highly conserved cofactor-binding domain. These findings strongly suggest that the actVI region is involved in catalyzing reduction processes that determine the two stereochemical configurations at C-3/C-15 during actinorhodin biosynthesis. A scheme is proposed for the middle steps of the biosynthesis, that is formation of the pyran ring, leading to the benzoisochromanequinone structure.	1
Title: An evidence-based knowledgebase of pulmonary arterial hypertension to identify genes and pathways relevant to pathogenesis Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a major progressive form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) with more than 4800 patients in the United States. In the last two decades, many studies have identified numerous genes associated with this disease. However, there is no comprehensive research resource for PAH or other PH types that integrates various genetic studies and their related biological information. Thus, the number of associated genes, and their strength of evidence, is unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a web-based knowledgebase could be used to develop a biological map of highly interrelated, functionally important genes in PAH. We developed the pulmonary arterial hypertension knowledgebase (PAHKB, ), a comprehensive database with a user-friendly web interface. PAHKB extracts genetic data from all available sources, including those from association studies, genetic mutation, gene expression, animal model, supporting literature, various genomic annotations, gene networks, cellular and regulatory pathways, as well as microRNAs. Moreover, PAHKB provides online tools for data browsing and searching, data integration, pathway graphical presentation, and gene ranking. In the current release, PAHKB contains 341 human PH-related genes (293 protein coding and 48 non-coding genes) curated from over 1000 PubMed abstracts. Based on the top 39 ranked PAH-related genes in PAHKB, we constructed a core biological map. This core map was enriched with the TGF-beta signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and MAPK signaling. In addition, the reconstructed map elucidates several novel cancer signaling pathways, which may provide clues to support the application of anti-cancer therapeutics to PAH. In summary, we have developed a system for the identification of core PH-related genes and identified critical signaling pathways that may be relevant to PAH pathogenesis. This system can be easily applied to other pulmonary diseases.	0
Title: Separation of Protein Crystals from Spores of Bacillus thuringiensis by Ludox Gradient Centrifugation Abstract: A method is described for the purification of Bacillus thuringiensis protein crystals by Ludox gradient centrifugation. This method is simple, inexpensive, fast, and efficient compared with other techniques. It has been successfully used to purify and characterize the protein crystals from several B. thuringiensis strains.	0
Title: Structure and Inhibition of Microbiome β-Glucuronidases Essential to the Alleviation of Cancer Drug Toxicity Abstract: The selective inhibition of bacterial β-glucuronidases was recently shown to alleviate drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in mice, including the damage caused by the widely used anticancer drug irinotecan. Here, we report crystal structures of representative β-glucuronidases from the Firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Clostridium perfringens and the Proteobacterium Escherichia coli, and the characterization of a β-glucuronidase from the Bacteroidetes Bacteroides fragilis. While largely similar in structure, these enzymes exhibit marked differences in catalytic properties and propensities for inhibition, indicating that the microbiome maintains functional diversity in orthologous enzymes. Small changes in the structure of designed inhibitors can induce significant conformational changes in the β-glucuronidase active site. Finally, we establish that β-glucuronidase inhibition does not alter the serum pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its metabolites in mice. Together, the data presented advance our in vitro and in vivo understanding of the microbial β-glucuronidases, a promising new set of targets for controlling drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity.	0
Title: Molecular networking as a dereplication strategy Abstract: A major goal in natural product discovery programs is to rapidly dereplicate known entities from complex biological extracts. We demonstrate here that molecular networking, an approach that organizes MS/MS data based on chemical similarity, is a powerful complement to traditional dereplication strategies. Successful dereplication with molecular networks requires MS/MS spectra of the natural product mixture along with MS/MS spectra of known standards, synthetic compounds, or well-characterized organisms, preferably organized into robust databases. This approach can accommodate different ionization platforms, enabling cross correlations of MS/MS data from ambient ionization, direct infusion, and LC-based methods. Molecular networking not only dereplicates known molecules from complex mixtures, it also captures related analogues, a challenge for many other dereplication strategies. To illustrate its utility as a dereplication tool, we apply mass spectrometry-based molecular networking to a diverse array of marine and terrestrial microbial samples, illustrating the dereplication of 58 molecules including analogues.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of novel methylsalicylic acid synthase gene involved in the biosynthesis of isoasperlactone and asperlactone in Aspergillus westerdijkiae Abstract: Aspergillus westerdijkiae is the main producer of several biologically active polyketide metabolites including isoasperlactone and asperlactone. A 5298bp polyketide synthase gene "aomsas" has been cloned in Aspergillus westerdijkiae by using gene walking approach and RACE-PCR. The predicted amino acid sequence of aomsas shows an identity of 40-56% with different methylsalicylic acid synthase genes found in Byssochlamys nivea, P. patulum, A. terreus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes. Based on the reverse transcription PCR and kinetic secondary metabolites production studies, aomsas expression was found to be associated with the biosynthesis of isoasperlactone and asperlactone. Moreover an aomsas knockout mutant "aoDeltamsas" of A. westerdijkiae, not only lost the capacity to produce isoasperlactone and asperlactone, but also 6-methylsalicylic acid. The genetically complemented mutant ao+msas restored the biosynthesis of all the missing metabolites. Chemical complementation through the addition of 6-methylsalicylic acid, aspyrone and diepoxide to growing culture of aoDeltamsas mutant revealed that these compounds play intermediate roles in the biosynthesis of asperlactone and isoasperlactone.	1
Title: Characterization of glycosylation sites of the epidermal growth factor receptor Abstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). In this study of the human EGF receptor naturally expressed in A431 cells, the glycosylation sites of the full-length, membrane-bound receptor and of a secreted form of the receptor were characterized by mass spectrometry. Our data show that the naturally expressed human EGF receptor is fully glycosylated on eight of the 11 canonical sites; two of the sites are not glycosylated, and one is partially glycosylated, a pattern of site-usage similar but not identical to those reported for the recombinant human EGF receptor heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We also confirm the partial glycosylation of an atypical NNC site first identified in the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We show that an additional canonical site in the secreted form of the receptor is fully glycosylated. While the pattern of glycosylation is the same for the sites shared by the full-length and the secreted forms of the receptor, the oligosaccharides of the full-length receptor are more extensively processed. Finally, we provide evidence that in addition to the known secreted form of the receptor, a proteolytic cleavage product of the receptor corresponding to the full extracytoplasmic, ligand-binding domain is present in the conditioned medium.	0
Title: Evolution of Chemical Diversity in Echinocandin Lipopeptide Antifungal Metabolites Abstract: The echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that includes caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Gene clusters encoding most of the structural complexity of the echinocandins provided a framework for hypotheses about the evolutionary history and chemical logic of echinocandin biosynthesis. Gene orthologs among echinocandin-producing fungi were identified. Pathway genes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), were analyzed phylogenetically to address the hypothesis that these pathways represent descent from a common ancestor. The clusters share cooperative gene contents and linkages among the different strains. Individual pathway genes analyzed in the context of similar genes formed unique echinocandin-exclusive phylogenetic lineages. The echinocandin NRPSs, along with the NRPS from the inp gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans and its orthologs, comprise a novel lineage among fungal NRPSs. NRPS adenylation domains from different species exhibited a one-to-one correspondence between modules and amino acid specificity that is consistent with models of tandem duplication and subfunctionalization. Pathway gene trees and Ascomycota phylogenies are congruent and consistent with the hypothesis that the echinocandin gene clusters have a common origin. The disjunct Eurotiomycete-Leotiomycete distribution appears to be consistent with a scenario of vertical descent accompanied by incomplete lineage sorting and loss of the clusters from most lineages of the Ascomycota. We present evidence for a single evolutionary origin of the echinocandin family of gene clusters and a progression of structural diversification in two fungal classes that diverged approximately 290 to 390 million years ago. Lineage-specific gene cluster evolution driven by selection of new chemotypes contributed to diversification of the molecular functionalities.	1
Title: The human splicing factor ASF/SF2 can specifically recognize pre-mRNA 5' splice sites Abstract: ASF/SF2 is a human protein previously shown to function in in vitro pre-mRNA splicing as an essential factor necessary for all splices and also as an alternative splicing factor, capable of switching selection of 5' splice sites. To begin to study the protein's mechanism of action, we have investigated the RNA binding properties of purified recombinant ASF/SF2. Using UV crosslinking and gel shift assays, we demonstrate that the RNA binding region of ASF/SF2 can interact with RNA in a sequence-specific manner, recognizing the 5' splice site in each of two different pre-mRNAs. Point mutations in the 5' splice site consensus can reduce binding by as much as a factor of 100, with the largest effects observed in competition assays. These findings support a model in which ASF/SF2 aids in the recognition of pre-mRNA 5' splice sites.	0
Title: Heterologous Biosynthesis of Fungal Indole Sesquiterpene Sespendole Abstract: Indole sesquiterpene sespendole, which has been isolated from the filamentous fungus Pseudobotrytis terrestris FKA-25, is a specific inhibitor of lipid droplet synthesis in mouse macrophages. The biosynthetic pathway that involves genes encoding six enzymes (spdEMBQHJ) was elucidated through heterologous expression of spd genes in Aspergillus oryzae, biotransformation experiments, and in vitro enzymatic reactions with a recombinant protein, thereby revealing the mechanism underlying the characteristic modification on the indole ring, catalyzed by a set of prenyltransferase (SpdE)/cytochrome P450 (SpdJ) enzymes. Functional analysis of the homologous genes encoding these enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lolitrem allowed a biosynthetic pathway for the bicyclic ring skeleton fused to the indole ring to be proposed.	1
Title: Heterologous Production of Fungal Maleidrides Reveals the Cryptic Cyclization Involved in their Biosynthesis Abstract: Fungal maleidrides are an important family of bioactive secondary metabolites that consist of 7, 8, or 9-membered carbocycles with one or two fused maleic anhydride moieties. The biosynthesis of byssochlamic acid (a nonadride) and agnestadride A (a heptadride) was investigated through gene disruption and heterologous expression experiments. The results reveal that the precursors for cyclization are formed by an iterative highly reducing fungal polyketide synthase supported by a hydrolase, together with two citrate-processing enzymes. The enigmatic ring formation is catalyzed by two proteins with homology to ketosteroid isomerases, and assisted by two proteins with homology to phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins.	1
Title: Frankobactin Metallophores Produced by Nitrogen-Fixing Frankia Actinobacteria Function in Toxic Metal Sequestration Abstract: A series of new metallophores, referred to as frankobactins, were extracted from cultures of the symbiotic and nitrogen-fixing actinobacterium Frankia sp. CH37. Structure elucidation revealed a 2-hydroxyphenyl-substituted oxazoline core and a chain composed of five proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids, suggesting nonribosomal peptide synthesis as the biosynthetic origin. By whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and comparison with other Frankia strains, the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis was detected. Spectrophotometric titration of frankobactin with Fe(III) and Cu(II) and mass spectrometry established the 1:1 (metal:frankobactin) coordination. Uptake experiments suggested that frankobactin A1 (1) did not serve to recruit iron, but to detoxify Cu(II). As frankobactin A1 prevents the cellular entry of Cu(II), it could play a crucial role in the symbiosis of Frankia sp. and its host in the reclamation of copper-contaminated soil.	1
Title: iso-Migrastatin, migrastatin, and dorrigocin production in Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 is governed by a single biosynthetic machinery featuring an acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthase Abstract: iso-Migrastatin and related glutarimide-containing polyketides are potent inhibitors of tumor cell migration and their implied potential as antimetastatic agents for human cancers has garnered significant attention. Genome scanning of Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 unveiled two candidate gene clusters (088D and mgs); each encodes acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases commensurate with iso-migrastatin biosynthesis. Both clusters were inactivated by lambda-RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis in S. platensis; iso-migrastatin production was completely abolished in the DeltamgsF mutant SB11012 strain, whereas inactivation of 088D-orf7 yielded the SB11006 strain that exhibited no discernible change in iso-migrastatin biosynthesis. These data indicate that iso-migrastatin production is governed by the mgs cluster. Systematic gene inactivation allowed determination of the precise boundaries of the mgs cluster and the essentiality of the genes within the mgs cluster in iso-migrastatin production. The mgs cluster consists of 11 open reading frames that encode three acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases (MgsEFG), one discrete acyltransferase (MgsH), a type II thioesterase (MgsB), three post-PKS tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK), two glutarimide biosynthesis enzymes (MgsCD), and one regulatory protein (MgsA). A model for iso-migrastatin biosynthesis is proposed based on functional assignments derived from bioinformatics and is further supported by the results of in vivo gene inactivation experiments.	1
Title: Computer analysis of Staphylococcus aureus phage typing data from 1957 to 1975, citing epidemiological trends and natural evolution within the phage typing system Abstract: Computer analysis of Staphylococcus aureus phage ty ping data collected for over 18 years in a large research hospital showed a drastic decrease in the number of hospital epidemic strains. Phage lysis patterns gradually modified from those of earlier years and were a reflection of changes within the S. aureus reservoir, and not within the typing phages, since the typing phages were used from stable lyophilized stocks. There was increasing cross-lysis of S. aureus strains by phages of lytic groups I, II, and III, such that this grouping was no longer epidemiologically valid. A 61% increase in unique strains occurred from the period 1957 to 1975. Disappearance of the widely recognized epidemic strains was followed by a proliferation of unique strains with individual phage patterns. These increased from 38% in the period 1957 to 1962 to 62% in the period 1969 to 1975, indicating a trend toward a "one patient-one strain" situation. Nontypable strains decreased in more recent years from 16% (1957 to 1975) to 7% in 1978, following introduction of phages 94, 96, 292, and D-11. Pandemic S. aureus strain 80/81 first appeared in this hospital in 1959, 5 years after it was first reported in the United States. Strain 80/81 disappeared from the hospital in 1963, partly due to the advent of methicillin.	0
Title: Discovery and Elucidation of the Biosynthesis of Aspernidgulenes: Novel Polyenes from Aspergillus Nidulans by Using Serial Promoter Replacement Abstract: Through serial promoter exchanges, we isolated several novel polyenes, the aspernidgulenes, from Aspergillus nidulans and uncovered their succinct biosynthetic pathway involving only four enzymes. An enoyl reductase (ER)-less highly reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) putatively produces a 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone polyene, which undergoes bisepoxidation, epoxide ring opening, cyclization, and hydrolytic cleavage by three tailoring enzymes to generate aspernidgulene A1 and A2. Our findings demonstrate the prowess of fungal-tailoring enzymes to transform a polyketide scaffold concisely and efficiently into complex structures. Moreover, comparison with citreoviridin and aurovertin biosynthesis suggests that methylation of the α-pyrone hydroxy group by methyltransferase (CtvB or AurB) is the branching point at which the biosynthesis of these two classes of compounds diverge. Therefore, scanning for the presence or absence of the gatekeeping α-pyrone methyltransferase gene in homologous clusters might be a potential way to classify the product bioinformatically as belonging to methylated α-pyrone polyenes or polyenes containing rings derived from the cyclization of the unmethylated 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone, such as 2,3-dimethyl-γ-lactone and oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.	1
Title: Genome Mining and Activation of a Silent PKS/NRPS Gene Cluster Direct the Production of Totopotensamides Abstract: A 92 kb silent hybrid polyketide and nonribosomal peptide gene cluster in marine-derived Streptomyces pactum SCSIO 02999 was activated by genetically manipulating the regulatory genes, including the knockout of two negative regulators (totR5 and totR3) and overexpression of a positive regulator totR1, to direct the production of the known totopotensamides (TPMs) A (1) and B (3) and a novel sulfonate-containing analogue TPM C (2). Inactivation of totG led to accumulation of TPM B (3) lacking the glycosyl moiety, which indicated TotG as a dedicated glycosyltransferase in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2.	1
Title: Calcitroic Acid-A Review Abstract: Calcitroic acid was isolated and characterized almost four decades ago, but little is known about this important vitamin D metabolite. Four reported synthetic strategies to generate calcitroic acid are presented that highlight the scientific progress in the field of chemistry directed to vitamin D analog synthesis. The most recent synthesis described the generation of calcitroic acid with an overall yield of 12.8% in 13 steps. The endogenous formation of calcitroic acid has been demonstrated in perfused rat kidney using 24,25,26,27-tetranor-1,23(OH)2D3. Although, the majority of vitamin D metabolism is mediated by 24-hydoxylase (CYP24A1), it is not clear why the formation of calcitroic acid was not observed in the presence of recombinant CYP24A1 enzyme. Furthermore, it is not known if enzyme 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) can convert calcioic acid into calcitroic acid. In addition to the lack of research investigating the endogenous formation of calcitroic acid, the physiological role of calcitroic acid remains unknown. Only a few reports mentioned the biological activity of calcitroic acid in connection with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). When administered subcutaneously, calcitroic acid has anthracitic properties and elevates calcium blood levels when administered intravenously. In vitro, calcitroic acid at higher concentrations has been shown to bind VDR and induce gene transcription. However, these studies were not carried out in cells derived from target organs of calcitroic acid such as kidney, liver, and intestine. We can conclude that our current knowledge of calcitroic acid is limited, and more studies are needed to identify its physiological role.	0
Title: Long-chain N-acyltyrosine synthases from environmental DNA Abstract: The heterologous expression of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples (environmental DNA [eDNA]) in easily cultured hosts provides access to natural products produced by previously inaccessible microorganisms. When eDNA cosmid libraries were screened in Escherichia coli for antibacterially active clones, long-chain N-acyltyrosine-producing clones were found in every eDNA library. These apparently common natural products have not been previously described from screening extracts of cultured bacteria for biologically active natural products. Of the 11 long-chain N-acyl amino acid synthases (NASs) that were characterized, 10 are unique sequences. A predicted protein of previously unknown function from Nitrosomonas europaea, a gram-negative nitrifying beta-proteobacterium, is 14 to 37% identical to eDNA NASs. When cloned into E. coli, this open reading frame confers the production of long-chain N-acyltyrosines to the host and is therefore the first NAS from a cultured bacterium to be functionally characterized. Understanding the role that long-chain N-acyl amino acids play in soil microbial communities should now be feasible with the identification of a cultured organism that has the genetic capacity to produce these compounds.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of NaCl-sensitive mutants of Caulobacter crescentus Abstract: An attempt to characterize Caulobacter crescentus genes important for the response to high concentrations of NaCl was initiated by the isolation of mutants defective in survival in the presence of 85 mM NaCl. A transposon Tn5 library was screened, and five strains which contained different genes disrupted by the transposon were isolated. Three of the mutants had the Tn5 in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, one had the Tn5 in the nhaA gene, which encodes a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, and one had the Tn5 in the ppiD gene, which encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. All the mutant strains showed severe growth arrest in the presence of 85 mM NaCl, but only the nhaA mutant showed decreased viability under these conditions. All the mutants except the nhaA mutant showed a slightly reduced viability in the presence of 40 mM KCl, but all the strains showed a more severe reduction in viability in the presence of 150 mM sucrose, suggesting that they are defective in responding to osmotic shock. The promoter regions of each disrupted gene were cloned in lacZ reporter vectors, and the pattern of expression in response to NaCl and sucrose was determined; this showed that both agents induced ppiD and nhaA gene expression but did not induce the other genes. Furthermore, the ppiD gene was not induced by heat shock, indicating that it does not belong to the sigma(32) regulon, as opposed to what was observed for its Escherichia coli homolog.	0
Title: The biosynthetic genes for disorazoles, potent cytotoxic compounds that disrupt microtubule formation Abstract: Disorazoles are polyketides produced by the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce12. Their mode of action is to inhibit tubulin polymerization and destabilize microtubules. Using transposon mutagenesis, two mutant strains were identified that produced no disorazoles. Sequencing the DNA flanking the insertions revealed a polyketide synthase gene cluster that would encode three polypeptides, DszA, DszB, and DszC, with DszC containing both nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase modules. The disorazole polyketide synthase modules lack an acyltransferase domain. Instead, a separate gene, dszD, encodes an AT protein, thus revealing that the disorazole gene cluster falls into the trans-AT Type I family of PKS enzymes.	1
Title: Antibacterial and synergy of berberines with antibacterial agents against clinical multi-drug resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Abstract: Antibacterial activity of berberine (Ber) and 8-acetonyl-dihydroberberine (A-Ber) alone and combined uses with antibacterial agents ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), cefazolin (CFZ) and levofloxacin (LEV) was studied on 10 clinical isolates of SCCmec III type methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Susceptibility to each agent alone was tested using a broth microdilution method and the chequerboard and time-kill tests for the combined evaluations, respectively. The alone MICs/MBCs (μg/mL) ranges were 32-128/64-256 (Ber) and 32-128/128-512 (A-Ber). Significant synergies were observed for the Ber (A-Ber)/AZM and Ber (A-Ber)/LEV combinations against 90% of the tested MRSA strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) values ranged from 0.188 to 0.500. An additivity result was also observed for the Ber/AZM combination by time-kill curves. These results demonstrated for the first time that Ber and A-Ber enhanced the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of AZM and LEV to a same extent, which had potential for further investigation in combinatory therapeutic applications of patients infected with MRSA.	0
Title: Recognition of platinum-DNA damage by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Abstract: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was recently identified as a platinum-DNA damage response protein. To investigate the properties of binding of PARP-1 to different platinum-DNA adducts in greater detail, biotinylated DNA probes containing a site-specific cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) or 1,3-d(GpTpG) intrastrand cross-link or a cisplatin 5'-GC/5'-GC interstrand cross-link (ICL) were utilized in binding assays with cell-free extracts (CFEs) in vitro. The activated state of PARP-1 was generated by treatment of cells with a DNA-damaging agent or by addition of NAD(+) to CFEs. PARP-1 binds with a higher affinity to cisplatin-damaged DNA than to undamaged DNA, and the amount of protein that binds to the most common cisplatin-DNA cross-link, 1,2-d(GpG), is greater than the amount that binds to other types of cisplatin-DNA cross-links. Both DNA damage-activated PARP-1 and unactivated PARP-1 bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA, and both automodified PARP-1 and cleaved PARP-1 bind to cisplatin-DNA lesions. The role of poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) in mediating binding of PARP-1 to platinum damage was further investigated. The extent of binding of PARP-1 to the cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link decreases upon automodification, and overactivated PARP-1 loses its affinity for the cross-link. Elimination of pADPr facilitates binding of PARP-1 to the cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link. PARP-1 also binds to DNA damaged by other platinum compounds, including oxaliplatin and pyriplatin, indicating protein affinity for the damage in an adduct-specific manner rather than recognition of distorted DNA. Our results reveal the unique binding properties for binding of PARP-1 to platinum-DNA damage, providing insights into, and a better understanding of, the cellular response to platinum-based anticancer drugs.	0
Title: Serine protease acylation proceeds with a subtle re-orientation of the histidine ring at the tetrahedral intermediate Abstract: The acylation mechanism of a prototypical serine protease trypsin and its complete free energy reaction profile have been determined by Born-Oppenheimer ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations with umbrella sampling.	0
Title: Structural basis for specific, high-affinity tetracycline binding by an in vitro evolved aptamer and artificial riboswitch Abstract: The tetracycline aptamer is an in vitro selected RNA that binds to the antibiotic with the highest known affinity of an artificial RNA for a small molecule (Kd approximately 0.8 nM). It is one of few aptamers known to be capable of modulating gene expression in vivo. The 2.2 A resolution cocrystal structure of the aptamer reveals a pseudoknot-like fold formed by tertiary interactions between an 11 nucleotide loop and the minor groove of an irregular helix. Tetracycline binds within this interface as a magnesium ion chelate. The structure, together with previous biochemical and biophysical data, indicates that the aptamer undergoes localized folding concomitant with tetracycline binding. The three-helix junction, h-shaped architecture of this artificial RNA is more complex than those of most aptamers and is reminiscent of the structures of some natural riboswitches.	0
Title: Pedein A and B: production, isolation, structure elucidation and biological properties of new antifungal cyclopeptides from Chondromyces pediculatus (Myxobacteria) Abstract: Two new secondary metabolites, named pedein A and B, were isolated from the cell mass of the myxobacterium Chondromyces pediculatus. Their planar structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, in particular 2D NMR as 24-membered cyclic hexapeptides composed of a variable tryptophan residue, glycine, sarcosine and three unusual hydroxy beta- and gamma-amino acids. The main component, pedein A, strongly inhibited the growth of yeasts and fungi, induced hemolysis of erythrocytes, and caused changes in membrane permeability of Rhodotorula glutinis. The structures of the pedeins are closely related to the large family of the microsclerodermins, which have been isolated from lithistid sponges of Microscleroderma and Theonella species.	1
Title: A minimized designer protein for facile biofabrication of ZnS:Mn immuno-quantum dots Abstract: A minimized protein consisting of a linear ZnS-binding peptide fused to an antibody-binding domain supports the one-step aqueous synthesis of Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystals that exhibit smaller size, brighter fluorescence and improved antibody-binding relative to those made with the original designer protein.	0
Title: "Frizzy" mutants: a new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants of Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: During fruiting-body formation in Myxococcus xanthus, cells aggregate into raised mounds, where they sporulate. A new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants was identified within a collection of nonfruiting mutants of M. xanthus. The mutants failed to aggregate into discrete mounds, but rather aggregated into "frizzy" filaments. Many cells within the filaments sporulated normally. Pairwise mixtures of representative frizzy mutants were unable to stimulate each other to aggregate normally. Two strains of M. xanthus were isolated which contained transposon Tn5 insertions mapping near one frizzy mutation. A search through 36 mutants exhibiting the frizzy phenotype showed that all were linked to the same Tn5 insertion sites. Three-factor cross-analysis of 22 of these mutants allowed the mapping of these mutations into many loci. The localization of Tn5 inserts adjacent to this region make possible further manipulation of these genes.	0
Title: Engineering Thermotoga maritima β-glucosidase for improved alkyl glycosides synthesis by site-directed mutagenesis Abstract: Alkyl glycosides are well-characterized nonionic surfactants, and can be prepared by transglycosylation reactions with retaining GH1 glycosidases being normally used for this purpose. The produced alkyl glycosides can also be hydrolyzed by the glycosidase, and hence, the yields of alkyl glycosides can be too low for industrial use. To improve the transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio for a β-glucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (TmBglA) for the synthesis of alkyl glycoside, six mutants (N222F, N223C, N223Q, G224A, Y295F, and F414S) were produced. N222F, N223C, N223Q, G224A improved catalytic activity, F295Y and F414S are hydrolytically crippled with p-nitrophenol-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as substrate with an 85 and 70-fold decrease in apparent kcat, respectively; N222F shows the highest kcat/km value for pNPG. The substrate selectivity altered from pNPG to pNP-β-d-fucoside for N222F, F295Y, and F414S and from cellubiose to gentiobiose for N222F and F414S. Using pNPG (34 mM) and hexanol 80% (vol/vol), N222F, Y295F, and F414S synthesized hexyl-β-glycoside (HG) yields of 84.7%, 50.9%, and 54.1%, respectively, HG increased from 14.49 (TmBglA) to 22.8 mM (N222F) at 2 hr by 57.42%. However, this higher transglycosylation effect depended on that three mutants creates an environment more suited for hexanol in the active site pocket, and consequently suppressed its HG hydrolysis.	0
Title: AvrXa10 contains an acidic transcriptional activation domain in the functionally conserved C terminus Abstract: The avrXa10 gene of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, is a member of the avrBs3 avirulence gene family and directs the elicitation of resistance in a gene-for-gene manner on rice lines carrying the resistance gene Xa10. The carboxyl (C) terminus of AvrXa10 has a previously undescribed domain that is structurally similar to the acidic activation domain of many eukaryotic transcription factors in addition to three nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences. Removal of the C-terminal 38 codons containing the putative activation domain, but retaining the NLS sequences, was concomitant with the loss of avirulence activity. The C-terminal coding regions of avrBs3 and avrXa7 can be replaced by the corresponding region of avrXa10, and the genes retained specificity for the resistance genes Bs3 in pepper and Xa7 in rice, respectively. The avrBs3 and avrXa7 avirulence activities of the hybrid genes were also lost upon removal of the terminal 38 codons. When fused to the coding sequence of the Gal4 DNA binding domain, AvrXa10 activated transcription in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. Removal of the carboxyl region severely reduced transcriptional activation. AvrXa10 would have to be localized to the host cell nucleus to function autonomously in transcriptional activation. Consistent with this requirement, mutations in all three NLS sequences of avrXa10 caused a loss in avirulence activity. The findings demonstrate the requirement of the C terminus for AvrXa10 function and the potential for the members of this family of avirulence gene products to enter the host nucleus and alter host transcription.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of thuggacins in myxobacteria: comparative cluster analysis reveals basis for natural product structural diversity Abstract: The thuggacins are macrolide antibiotics that are active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Distinct variants of these structures are produced by the myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum So ce895 and Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, which differ in side chain structure and modification by hydroxylation. We report here a comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters in these strains, which reveals the mechanistic basis for this architectural diversity. Although the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide cores of the molecules are highly similar, the underlying biosynthetic machineries exhibit an unexpected degree of divergence. Furthermore, the S. cellulosum gene cluster contains a crotonyl-CoA reductase (CCR) homolog not present in C. crocatus, which likely participates in assembling the unusual hexyl side chain of the So ce895 thuggacins, whereas the distinct hydroxylation pattern may result from variable action of a conserved FMN-dependent monooxygenase. Indeed, inactivation of the monooxygenase gene in C. crocatus resulted in production of both mono- and di-deshydroxy thuggacin derivatives, providing direct evidence for the role of this enzyme in the pathway. Finally, integration of a Tn5-derived npt promotor upstream of the thuggacin cluster in C. crocatus led to a significant increase in thuggacin production.	1
Title: polR, a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory gene, positively controls polyoxin biosynthesis in Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. asoensis Abstract: The polyoxin (POL) biosynthetic gene cluster (pol) was recently cloned from Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. asoensis. A 3.3 kb DNA fragment carrying an obvious open reading frame (polR), whose deduced product shows sequence similarity to SanG of Streptomyces ansochromogenes and PimR of Streptomyces natalensis, was revealed within the pol gene cluster. Disruption of polR abolished POL production, which could be complemented by the integration of a single copy of polR into the chromosome of the non-producing mutant. The introduction of an extra copy of polR in the wild-type strain resulted in increased production of POLs. The transcription start point (tsp) of polR was determined by S1 mapping. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments showed that PolR is required for the transcription of 18 structural genes in the pol gene cluster. Furthermore, we showed that polC and polB, the respective first genes of two putative operons (polC-polQ2 and polA-polB) consisting of 16 and 2 of these 18 genes, have similar promoter structures. Gel retardation assays indicated that PolR has specific DNA-binding activity for the promoter regions of polC and polB. Our data suggest that PolR acts in a positive manner to regulate POL production by activating the transcription of at least two putative operons in the pol gene cluster.	1
Title: Discovery of recombinases enables genome mining of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters in Burkholderiales species Abstract: Bacterial genomes encode numerous cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that represent a largely untapped source of drugs or pesticides. Mining of the cryptic products is limited by the unavailability of streamlined genetic tools in native producers. Precise genome engineering using bacteriophage recombinases is particularly useful for genome mining. However, recombinases are usually host-specific. The genome-guided discovery of novel recombinases and their transient expression could boost cryptic BGC mining. Herein, we reported a genetic system employing Red recombinases from Burkholderiales strain DSM 7029 for efficient genome engineering in several Burkholderiales species that currently lack effective genetic tools. Using specialized recombinases-assisted in situ insertion of functional promoters, we successfully mined five cryptic nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase BGCs, two of which were silent. Two classes of lipopeptides, glidopeptins and rhizomides, were identified through extensive spectroscopic characterization. This recombinase expression strategy offers utility within other bacteria species, allowing bioprospecting for potentially scalable discovery of novel metabolites with attractive bioactivities.	1
Title: Stereospecific enzymatic transformation of alpha-ketoglutarate to (2S,3R)-3-methyl glutamate during acidic lipopeptide biosynthesis Abstract: The acidic lipopeptides, including the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDA), daptomycin, and A54145, are important macrocyclic peptide natural products produced by Streptomyces species. All three compounds contain a 3-methyl glutamate (3-MeGlu) as the penultimate C-terminal residue, which is important for bioactivity. Here, biochemical in vitro reconstitution of the 3-MeGlu biosynthetic pathway is presented, using exclusively enzymes from the CDA producer Streptomyces coelicolor. It is shown that the predicted 3-MeGlu methyltransferase GlmT and its homologues DptI from the daptomycin producer Streptomyces roseosporus and LptI from the A54145 producer Streptomyces fradiae do not methylate free glutamic acid, PCP-bound glutamate, or Glu-containing CDA in vitro. Instead, GlmT, DptI, and LptI are S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent alpha-ketoglutarate methyltransferases that catalyze the stereospecific methylation of alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) leading to (3R)-3-methyl-2-oxoglutarate. Subsequent enzyme screening identified the branched chain amino acid transaminase IlvE (SCO5523) as an efficient catalyst for the transformation of (3R)-3-methyl-2-oxoglutarate into (2S,3R)-3-MeGlu. Comparison of reversed-phase HPLC retention time of dabsylated 3-MeGlu generated by the coupled enzymatic reaction with dabsylated synthetic standards confirmed complete stereocontrol during enzymatic catalysis. This stereospecific two-step conversion of alphaKG to (2S,3R)-3-MeGlu completes our understanding of the biosynthesis and incorporation of beta-methylated amino acids into the nonribosomal lipopeptides. Finally, understanding this pathway may provide new possibilities for the production of modified peptides in engineered microbes.	1
Title: Transcriptomic and physiological insights into the robustness of long filamentous cells of Methanosaeta harundinacea, prevalent in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket granules Abstract: Methanosaeta spp. are widely distributed in natural environments, and their filamentous cells contribute significantly to sludge granulation and the good performance of anaerobic reactors. A previous study indicated that Methanosaeta harundinacea 6Ac displays a quorum sensing-regulated morphological transition from short to long filaments, and more acetate is channeled into methane production in long filaments, whereas more is channeled into biomass synthesis in short filaments. Here, we performed transcriptomic and physiological analysis to gain insights into active methanogenesis in long filaments of M. harundinacea 6Ac. Both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that transcription of the genes involved in aceticlastic methanogenesis and energy metabolism was upregulated 1.2- to 10.3-fold in long filaments, while transcription of the genes for the methyl oxidative shunt was upregulated in short filaments. [2-(13)C]acetate trace experiments demonstrated that a relatively higher portion of the acetate methyl group was oxidized to CO2 in short filaments than in long filaments. The long filaments exhibited higher catalase activity and oxygen tolerance than the short ones, which is consistent with increased transcription of the oxidant-scavenging genes. Moreover, transcription of genes for cell surface structures was upregulated in the long filaments, and transmission electron microscopy revealed a thicker cell envelope in the filaments. RNA-seq determined a >2-fold upregulation of a variety of antistress genes in short filaments, like those encoding chaperones and DNA repair systems, which implies that the short filaments can be stressed. This study reveals the genetic basis for the prevalence of the long filamentous morphology of M. harundinacea cells in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket granules.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of actinorhodin and related antibiotics: discovery of alternative routes for quinone formation encoded in the act gene cluster Abstract: All known benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) biosynthetic gene clusters carry a set of genes encoding a two-component monooxygenase homologous to the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system for actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Here, we conducted molecular genetic and biochemical studies of this enzyme system. Inactivation of actVA-ORF5 yielded a shunt product, actinoperylone (ACPL), apparently derived from 6-deoxy-dihydrokalafungin. Similarly, deletion of actVB resulted in accumulation of ACPL, indicating a critical role for the monooxygenase system in C-6 oxygenation, a biosynthetic step common to all BIQ biosyntheses. Furthermore, in vitro, we showed a quinone-forming activity of the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system in addition to that of a known C-6 monooxygenase, ActVA-ORF6, by using emodinanthrone as a model substrate. Our results demonstrate that the act gene cluster encodes two alternative routes for quinone formation by C-6 oxygenation in BIQ biosynthesis.	1
Title: Isolation and identification of a thermophilic strain producing trehalose synthase from geothermal water in China Abstract: A slightly thermophilic strain, CBS-01, producing trehalose synthase (TreS), was isolated from geothermal water in this study. According to the phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rRNA gene sequence, it was identified as Meiothermus ruber. The trehalose synthase gene of Meiothermus ruber CBS-01 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The TreS gene consisted of 2,895 nucleotides, which specified a 964-amino-acid protein. This novel TreS catalyzed reversible interconversion of maltose and trehalose.	0
Title: Functional Operons in Secondary Metabolic Gene Clusters in Glarea lozoyensis (Fungi, Ascomycota, Leotiomycetes) Abstract: Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Protein-coding operons have not been reported in the Fungi even though they represent a very diverse kingdom of organisms. Here, we report a functional operon involved in the secondary metabolism of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis belonging to Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota). Two contiguous genes, glpks3 and glnrps7, encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase, respectively, are cotranscribed into one dicistronic mRNA under the control of the same promoter, and the mRNA is then translated into two individual proteins, GLPKS3 and GLNRPS7. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans shows that the GLPKS3-GLNRPS7 enzyme complex catalyzes the biosynthesis of a novel pyrrolidinedione-containing compound, xenolozoyenone (compound 1), which indicates the operon is functional. Although it is structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus has a monophylogenic origin from fungi rather than having been horizontally transferred from prokaryotes. Moreover, two additional operons, glpks28-glnrps8 and glpks29-glnrps9, were verified at the transcriptional level in the same fungus. This is the first report of protein-coding operons in a member of the Fungi.                  Importance:                       Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Three operon-like gene structures for secondary metabolism that were discovered in the filamentous fungus Glarea lozoyensis are the first examples of protein-coding operons identified in a member of the Fungi. Among them, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon is responsible for the biosynthesis of xenolozoyenone, which is a novel tetramic acid-containing compound. Although structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus did not result from horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. In addition, operonlike structures have been predicted in silico to be common in other fungi. The common occurrence and operonlike structure in fungi provide evolutionary insight and essential data for eukaryotic gene transcription.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of the thiopeptide antibiotic GE2270 from Planobispora rosea ATCC 53733 in Streptomyces coelicolor requires deletion of ribosomal genes from the expression construct Abstract: GE2270 is a thiopeptide antibiotic generated by extensive posttranslational modifications of a ribosomally generated precursor peptide. Thiopeptides are especially active against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In this study the GE2270 biosynthetic gene cluster (pbt) from Planobispora rosea ATCC 53733 was successfully expressed in the heterologous host strain Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. Notably, exconjugants containing the pbt gene cluster could only be obtained after deletion of the major part of the ribosomal genes flanking the gene cluster. This is a striking example that genes belonging to primary metabolism can prevent the successful conjugative transfer of DNA from phylogenetic distant species and thus complicate heterologous expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters. GE2270 production in the heterologous producer strain increased after introduction of the constitutive ermE* promoter upstream of the GE2270 resistance gene tuf from P. rosea. Insertion of the inducible tcp830 promoter resulted in inducible GE2270 production. When the regulatory gene pbtR was deleted, the resulting strain ceased to produce GE2270, suggesting an essential role of PbtR as a putative transcriptional activator of GE2270 expression.	1
Title: Intimate bacterial-fungal interaction triggers biosynthesis of archetypal polyketides in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungi produce numerous low molecular weight molecules endowed with a multitude of biological activities. However, mining the full-genome sequences of fungi indicates that their potential to produce secondary metabolites is greatly underestimated. Because most of the biosynthesis gene clusters are silent under laboratory conditions, one of the major challenges is to understand the physiological conditions under which these genes are activated. Thus, we cocultivated the important model fungus Aspergillus nidulans with a collection of 58 soil-dwelling actinomycetes. By microarray analyses of both Aspergillus secondary metabolism and full-genome arrays and Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrate at the molecular level that a distinct fungal-bacterial interaction leads to the specific activation of fungal secondary metabolism genes. Most surprisingly, dialysis experiments and electron microscopy indicated that an intimate physical interaction of the bacterial and fungal mycelia is required to elicit the specific response. Gene knockout experiments provided evidence that one induced gene cluster codes for the long-sought after polyketide synthase (PKS) required for the biosynthesis of the archetypal polyketide orsellinic acid, the typical lichen metabolite lecanoric acid, and the cathepsin K inhibitors F-9775A and F-9775B. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that orthologs of this PKS are widespread in nature in all major fungal groups, including mycobionts of lichens. These results provide evidence of specific interaction among microorganisms belonging to different domains and support the hypothesis that not only diffusible signals but intimate physical interactions contribute to the communication among microorganisms and induction of otherwise silent biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: Precursor-directed biosynthesis of micacocidin derivatives with activity against Mycoplasma pneumoniae Abstract: Micacocidin is a promising natural product for the treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. In the biosynthesis of this antibiotic, a fatty acid-AMP ligase (FAAL) activates the starter unit hexanoic acid as acyl-adenylate and forwards it to an iteratively acting polyketide synthase. Biochemical analysis of the FAAL revealed an extended substrate tolerance, thereby opening the door for the modification of a micacocidin residue that is barely accessible via semisynthesis. A total of six new analogues were generated by precursor-directed biosynthesis in this study and profiled against M. pneumoniae.	1
Title: Identification of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene cluster encoding the biosynthetic enzymes for assembly of the virulence-conferring siderophore mycobactin Abstract: Background:                       Many pathogenic bacteria secrete iron-chelating siderophores as virulence factors in the iron-limiting environments of their vertebrate hosts to compete for ferric iron. Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycobactins are mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptides that contain a hydroxyaryloxazoline cap and two N-hydroxyamides that together create a high-affinity site for ferric ion. The mycobactin structure is analogous to that of the yersiniabactin and vibriobactin siderophores from the bacteria that cause plague and cholera, respectively.                  Results:                       A ten-gene cluster spanning 24 kilobases of the M. tuberculosis genome, designated mbtA-J, contains the core components necessary for mycobactin biogenesis. The gene products MbtB, MbtE and MbtF are proposed to be peptide synthetases, MbtC and MbtD polyketide synthases, MbtI an isochorismate synthase that provides a salicylate activated by MbtA, and MbtG a required hydroxylase. An aryl carrier protein (ArCP) domain is encoded in mbtB, and is probably the site of siderophore chain initiation. Overproduction and purification of the mbtB ArCP domain and MbtA in Escherichia coli allowed validation of the mycobactin initiation hypothesis, as sequential action of PptT (a phosphopantetheinyl transferase) and MbtA (a salicyl-AMP ligase) resulted in the mbtB ArCP domain being activated as salicyl-S-ArCP.                  Conclusions:                       Mycobactins are produced in M. tuberculosis using a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase strategy. The mycobactin gene cluster has organizational homologies to the yersiniabactin and enterobactin synthetase genes. Enzymatic targets for inhibitor design and therapeutic intervention are suggested by the similar ferric-ion ligation strategies used in the siderophores from Mycobacteria, Yersinia and E. coli pathogens.	1
Title: The cyanobacterial metabolite nocuolin a is a natural oxadiazine that triggers apoptosis in human cancer cells Abstract: Oxadiazines are heterocyclic compounds containing N-N-O or N-N-C-O system within a six membered ring. These structures have been up to now exclusively prepared via organic synthesis. Here, we report the discovery of a natural oxadiazine nocuolin A (NoA) that has a unique structure based on 1,2,3-oxadiazine. We have identified this compound in three independent cyanobacterial strains of genera Nostoc, Nodularia, and Anabaena and recognized the putative gene clusters for NoA biosynthesis in their genomes. Its structure was characterized using a combination of NMR, HRMS and FTIR methods. The compound was first isolated as a positive hit during screening for apoptotic inducers in crude cyanobacterial extracts. We demonstrated that NoA-induced cell death has attributes of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, NoA exhibits a potent anti-proliferative activity (0.7-4.5 μM) against several human cancer lines, with p53-mutated cell lines being even more sensitive. Since cancers bearing p53 mutations are resistant to several conventional anti-cancer drugs, NoA may offer a new scaffold for the development of drugs that have the potential to target tumor cells independent of their p53 status. As no analogous type of compound was previously described in the nature, NoA establishes a novel class of bioactive secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Specific [3H]phencyclidine binding in rat central nervous system Abstract: [3H]Phencyclidine (PCP) bound specifically and with high affinity (Kd = 0.15 microM at pH 7.4) to a single saturable class of binding sites in rat brain membrane preparations. Specific binding constituted approximately 70% of total binding at 0 degrees C and 33% of total binding at 37 degrees C (at 10 nM [3H]PCP). Bound [3H]PCP could be displaced by nonradioactive PCP, a series of its derivatives, and the psychotomimetic opiate N-allylnorcyclazocine (SKF 10,047) with relative potencies that closely paralleled those determined in animal behavioral tests. Muscarinic cholinergic ligands inhibited [3H]PCP binding, but only at 0.1 mM and in rank order at variance with that for binding to muscarinic sites or for pharmacological potencies. Other drugs, including opiates other than SKF 10,047, were unable to displace specifically bound [3H]PCP at 0.1 mM. [3H]PCP binding was most enriched in crude synaptosomal subcellular fractions, and was about three times higher in hippocampus (region of highest density) than in cervical spinal cord (region of lowest density). Trypsin and Pronase reduced specific [3H]PCP binding. Thus, PCP may exert its effects on the central nervous system via binding to specific brain receptor sites.	0
Title: Identification of cyclosporin C from Amphichorda felina using a Cryptococcus neoformans differential temperature sensitivity assay Abstract: We used a temperature differential assay with the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans as a simple screening platform to detect small molecules with antifungal activity in natural product extracts. By screening of a collection extracts from two different strains of the coprophilous fungus, Amphichorda felina, we detected strong, temperature-dependent antifungal activity using a two-plate agar zone of inhibition assay at 25 and 37 °C. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) identified cyclosporin C (CsC) as the main component of the crude extract responsible for growth inhibition of C. neoformans at 37 °C. The presence of CsC was confirmed by comparison with a commercial standard. We sequenced the genome of A. felina to identify and annotate the CsC biosynthetic gene cluster. The only previously characterized gene cluster for the biosynthesis of similar compounds is that of the related immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A (CsA). The CsA and CsC gene clusters share a high degree of synteny and sequence similarity. Amino acid changes in the adenylation domain of the CsC nonribosomal peptide synthase's sixth module may be responsible for the substitution of L-threonine compared to L-α-aminobutyric acid in the CsA peptide core. This screening strategy promises to yield additional antifungal natural products with a focused spectrum of antimicrobial activity.	1
Title: New isofuranonaphthoquinones and isoindolequinones from Streptomyces sp. CB01883 Abstract: Isofuranonaphthoquinones (IFQs) and Isoindolequinones (IIQs) comprise a small family of natural products, with the latter ones are especially uncommon in nature. Here we report the discovery of seven new IFQs, IFQ A-G (1-7), and three new IIQs, IIQ A-C (8-10), along with the known anthraquinone desoxyerythrolaccin (11), from Streptomyces sp. CB01883, expanding the chemical diversity of this family of natural products. The structures of these natural products were established on the basis of their HR-ESI-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data. All compounds were assessed for antibacterial activity, with 11 and 1, 5-7 exhibiting moderate and weak activities, respectively, against several Gram-positive bacteria tested. Bioinformatics analysis of the Streptomyces sp. CB01883 genome revealed the ifq gene cluster that showed identical genetic organization, with high-sequence identity, to the ifn gene cluster recently cloned from Streptomyces sp. RI-77 and confirmed to encode the biosynthesis of two IFQs, JBIR-76 and JBIR-77. Co-isolation of IFQs with IIQs from Streptomyces sp. CB01883 and facile chemical transformation of selected IFQs to IIQs, as exemplified by 1 to 9, together with the finding of the ifq cluster that most likely only encodes IFQ biosynthesis, support the proposal that IIQs may be derived nonenzymatically from IFQs in the presence of an amine.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: Construction of deletion derivative plasmids and cloning of restriction fragments from plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of replication (ori) were used to locate the functional origin to within a DNA fragment of 296 base pairs between the genes uncB and asn. The nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium ori region was determined and compared with the Escherichia coli ori sequence. In the 296-base pair fragment, 85.8% of the bases are conserved between the two species. A nearly equal number of transition and transversion type differences, with no insertions or deletions, occurs between the two bacterial origins, such that the relatively high percentage (adenine plus thymine) of 59.5% is conserved. The 296-base pair fragment contains 14 GATC sequences, all of which are conserved. The high frequency of occurrence of GATC, which is the site of methylation under control of the dam gene, may explain in part why the bacterial ori region appears to be so highly conserved. A large number of secondary structures are possible. One such structure, with a "cloverleaf," is favored by ori nucleotide sequence comparisons and leads to potential novel macromolecular interactions.	0
Title: Amycolatopsis decaplanina sp. nov., a novel member of the genus with unusual morphology Abstract: Strain DSM 44594T, which produces the glycopeptide antibiotic decaplanin, is a member of the genus Amycolatopsis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and chemotaxonomic properties. It is the first member of this genus that is reported to form pseudosporangia, which resemble those of members of the genus Kibdelosporangium. Phylogenetically, the novel taxon is related to Amycolatopsis orientalis, Amycolatopsis lurida, Amycolatopsis azurea, Amycolatopsis japonica and Amycolatopsis keratiniphila. Morphological, cultural and physiological properties, the production of a unique glycolipid and DNA-DNA similarity of <55% with phylogenetically related strains reveal that strain DSM 44594T represents a novel species of the genus, for which the name Amycolatopsis decaplanina sp. nov. (type strain, FH 1845T=DSM 44594T=NRRL B-24209T) is proposed.	1
Title: Brucella abortus depends on pyruvate phosphate dikinase and malic enzyme but not on Fbp and GlpX fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases for full virulence in laboratory models Abstract: The brucellae are the etiological agents of brucellosis, a worldwide-distributed zoonosis. These bacteria are facultative intracellular parasites and thus are able to adjust their metabolism to the extra- and intracellular environments encountered during an infectious cycle. However, this aspect of Brucella biology is imperfectly understood, and the nutrients available in the intracellular niche are unknown. Here, we investigated the central pathways of C metabolism used by Brucella abortus by deleting the putative fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fbp and glpX), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdK), and malic enzyme (mae) genes. In gluconeogenic but not in rich media, growth of ΔppdK and Δmae mutants was severely impaired and growth of the double Δfbp-ΔglpX mutant was reduced. In macrophages, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants showed reduced multiplication, and studies with the ΔppdK mutant confirmed that it reached the replicative niche. Similarly, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants were attenuated in mice, the former being cleared by week 10 and the latter persisting longer than 12 weeks. We also investigated the glyoxylate cycle. Although aceA (isocitrate lyase) promoter activity was enhanced in rich medium, aceA disruption had no effect in vitro or on multiplication in macrophages or mouse spleens. The results suggest that B. abortus grows intracellularly using a limited supply of 6-C (and 5-C) sugars that is compensated by glutamate and possibly other amino acids entering the Krebs cycle without a critical role of the glyoxylate shunt.	0
Title: Involvement of Candida albicans pyruvate dehydrogenase complex protein X (Pdx1) in filamentation Abstract: For 50 years, physiologic studies in Candida albicans have associated fermentation with filamentation and respiration with yeast morphology. Analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of a C. albicans NDH51 mutant, known to be defective in filamentation, identified increased expression of several proteins in the respiratory pathway. Most notable was a 15-fold increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex protein X (Pdx1), an essential component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In basal salts medium with < or = 100 mM glucose as carbon source, two independent pdx1 mutants displayed a filamentation defect identical to ndh51; reintegration of one PDX1 allele restored filamentation. Concentrations of glucose < or = 100 mM did not correct the filamentation defect. Expanding on previous work, these studies suggest that increased expression of proteins extraneous to the electron transport chain compensates for defects in the respiratory pathway to maintain yeast morphology. Mitochondrial proteomics can aid in the identification of C. albicans genes not previously implicated in filamentation.	0
Title: Real-time quantitative expression studies of the zearalenone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: The estrogenic mycotoxin zearalenone (ZON) produced by some Fusarium spp. causes reproductive problems and hyperestrogenic syndromes in mammals. In an effort to elucidate the molecular pathways of ZON production, we present a comparative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression study of seven contiguous genes in the ZON biosynthetic cluster on sterile rice and during wheat and oat infection. Under ZON production on rice, the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes PKS4 and PKS13, alcohol oxidase FG12056 gene, and transcriptional regulator FG02398 gene showed similarly upregulated patterns, whereas the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NPS) FG02394, the K(+) channel beta subunit FG12015, and the protein kinase FG02399 displayed a variant pattern. During the same time period under wheat infection when no ZON was produced, the PKS genes and the NPS were downregulated relative to rice whereas the K(+) channel beta subunit gene FG12015 was markedly upregulated, suggesting that it may play a role in the infection process. This is the first expression study of ZON biosynthetic genes in planta. The results give insight into the regulation and activities of the ZON gene cluster under different experimental systems and suggest a connection between ZON and a K(+) channel that could reveal a novel function for ZON in Fusarium spp.	1
Title: Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: In deoxyribonucleic acid of Rhizobium trifolii centrifuged in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium was found a sattelite peak containing covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid. The plasmid had a molecular weight of about 64 x 10(6) shown by sedimentation in sucrose gradients and electron microscopy.	0
Title: Genomic-driven discovery of an amidinohydrolase involved in the biosynthesis of mediomycin A Abstract: Clethramycin (1) and mediomycin A (2) belong to the linear polyene polyketide (LPP) family of antibiotics that exhibit potent antifungal activity. Structural similarities exist between 1 and 2, except that 2 contains an amino moiety substituted for the guanidino moiety. Herein, the draft genome sequence of Streptomyces mediocidicus ATCC23936, a strain which produces both 1 and 2, was obtained through de novo sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome revealed a clethramycin (cle) gene cluster that contained 25 open reading frames (orfs). However, amidinohydrolase for 2 formation was not found in the cle gene cluster. Further genomic analysis revealed an amidinohydrolase MedX, which can hydrolyse the guanidino form (1) into the amino form (2) via heterologous co-expression of the cle cluster in Streptomyces lividans or by in vitro catalysis. These results also suggest the feasibility of engineering novel LPPs for drug discovery by manipulating the biosynthetic machinery of S. mediocidicus.	1
Title: Transcriptional regulation by small RNAs at sequences downstream from 3' gene termini Abstract: Transcriptome studies reveal many noncoding transcripts overlapping 3' gene termini. The function of these transcripts is unknown. Here we have characterized transcription at the progesterone receptor (PR) locus and identified noncoding transcripts that overlap the 3' end of the gene. Small RNAs complementary to sequences beyond the 3' terminus of PR mRNA modulated expression of PR, recruited argonaute 2 to a 3' noncoding transcript, altered occupancy of RNA polymerase II, induced chromatin changes at the PR promoter and affected responses to physiological stimuli. We found that the promoter and 3' terminal regions of the PR locus are in close proximity, providing a potential mechanism for RNA-mediated control of transcription over long genomic distances. These results extend the potential for small RNAs to regulate transcription to target sequences beyond the 3' termini of mRNA.	0
Title: Linking secondary metabolites to gene clusters through genome sequencing of six diverse Aspergillus species Abstract: The fungal genus of Aspergillus is highly interesting, containing everything from industrial cell factories, model organisms, and human pathogens. In particular, this group has a prolific production of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs). In this work, four diverse Aspergillus species (A. campestris, A. novofumigatus, A. ochraceoroseus, and A. steynii) have been whole-genome PacBio sequenced to provide genetic references in three Aspergillus sections. A. taichungensis and A. candidus also were sequenced for SM elucidation. Thirteen Aspergillus genomes were analyzed with comparative genomics to determine phylogeny and genetic diversity, showing that each presented genome contains 15-27% genes not found in other sequenced Aspergilli. In particular, A. novofumigatus was compared with the pathogenic species A. fumigatus This suggests that A. novofumigatus can produce most of the same allergens, virulence, and pathogenicity factors as A. fumigatus, suggesting that A. novofumigatus could be as pathogenic as A. fumigatus Furthermore, SMs were linked to gene clusters based on biological and chemical knowledge and analysis, genome sequences, and predictive algorithms. We thus identify putative SM clusters for aflatoxin, chlorflavonin, and ochrindol in A. ochraceoroseus, A. campestris, and A. steynii, respectively, and novofumigatonin, ent-cycloechinulin, and epi-aszonalenins in A. novofumigatus Our study delivers six fungal genomes, showing the large diversity found in the Aspergillus genus; highlights the potential for discovery of beneficial or harmful SMs; and supports reports of A. novofumigatus pathogenicity. It also shows how biological, biochemical, and genomic information can be combined to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of specific SMs.	1
Title: Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov., a novel actinomycete that produces kigamicins Abstract: The taxonomic position of seven soil actinomycetes provisionally assigned to the genus Amycolatopsis was established in a polyphasic study. The isolates, which had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, had closest similarity to the type strain of Amycolatopsis orientalis. A representative isolate, strain GY080T, had chemotaxonomic properties that were typical of the genus Amycolatopsis and could be distinguished from the type strain of A. orientalis using DNA-DNA relatedness data. All of the isolates shared a phenotypic profile that distinguished them from representatives of phylogenetically closely related species. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis showed that the isolates formed a homogeneous group that was distinctly separate from single-membered groups consisting of representative Amycolatopsis type strains, including that of A. orientalis. Based on the combined genotypic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the seven isolates be classified as representatives of a novel species for which the name Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GY080T (=DSM 45072T=NCIMB 14277T).	1
Title: Stereochemical determination and complex biosynthetic assembly of etnangien, a highly potent RNA polymerase inhibitor from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum Abstract: A potent novel analogue of the natural macrolide antibiotic etnangien, a structurally unique RNA polymerase inhibitor from myxobacteria, is reported. It may be readily obtained from fermentation broths of Sorangium cellulosum and shows high antibiotic activity, comparable to that of etnangien. However, it is much more readily available than the notoriously labile authentic natural product itself. Importantly, it is stable under neutral conditions, allowing for elaborate NMR measurements for assignment of the 12 hydroxyl- and methyl-bearing stereogenic centers. The full absolute and relative stereochemistries of these complex polyketides were determined by a combination of extensive high-field NMR studies, including J-based configuration analysis, molecular modeling, and synthetic derivatization in combination with an innovative method based on biosynthetic studies of this polyketide which is also presented here. A first look into the solution conformation and 3D structure of these promising macrolide antibiotics is reported. Finally, the complete biosynthetic gene cluster was analyzed in detail, revealing a highly unusual and complex trans-AT type polyketide biosynthesis, which does not follow colinearity rules, most likely performs programmed iteration as well as module skipping, and exhibits HMG-CoA box-directed methylation.	1
Title: Pd(II)-Catalyzed Enantioselective γ-C(sp3)-H Functionalizations of Free Cyclopropylmethylamines Abstract: Prized for their ability to reliably forge stereocenters with precise regiocontrol from simple and abundant starting materials, substrate-directable enantioselective reactions are widely used in modern organic synthesis. As such, enantioselective C(sp3)-H functionalization reactions directed by innate functional groups could provide new routes to introduce molecular complexity within the inert hydrocarbon moiety, but to date this approach has been met with little success. While free primary aliphatic amines are common, versatile intermediates in synthesis, they are traditionally unreactive in C(sp3)-H activation reactions. Herein we report the Pd-catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)-H functionalization of free aliphatic amines (cyclopropylmethylamines) enabled by a chiral bidentate thioether ligand. This ligand's privileged bidentate coordination mode and thioether motif favor the generation of the requisite mono(amine)-Pd(II) intermediate, thus enabling the enantioselective C-H activation of free amines. The resulting C-Pd(II) species could engage in either Pd(II)/Pd(IV) or Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalytic cycles, enabling access to a diverse range of products through (hetero)arylation, carbonylation, and olefination reactions. Consequently, this versatile reactivity offers medicinal chemists a general strategy to rapidly prepare and functionalize biologically relevant amines.	0
Title: Comparative Transcriptomics Reveals Distinct Gene Expressions of a Model Ciliated Protozoa Feeding on Bacteria-Free Medium, Digestible, and Digestion-Resistant Bacteria Abstract: Bacterivory is an important ecological function of protists in natural ecosystems. However, there are diverse bacterial species resistant to protistan digestion, which reduces the carbon flow to higher trophic levels. So far, a molecular biological view of metabolic processes in heterotrophic protists during predation of bacterial preys of different digestibility is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the growth performance a ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila cultivated in a bacteria-free Super Proteose Peptone (SPP) medium (control), and in the media mixed with either a digestion-resistant bacterial species (DRB) or a digestible strain of E. coli (ECO). We found the protist population grew fastest in the SPP and slowest in the DRB treatment. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that there were indeed non-digested, viable bacteria in the ciliate cells fed with DRB, but none in other treatments. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq data showed that, relative to the control, 637 and 511 genes in T. thermophila were significantly and differentially expressed in the DRB and ECO treatments, respectively. The protistan expression of lysosomal proteases (especially papain-like cysteine proteinases), GH18 chitinases, and an isocitrate lyase were upregulated in both bacterial treatments. The genes encoding protease, glycosidase and involving glycolysis, TCA and glyoxylate cycles of carbon metabolic processes were higher expressed in the DRB treatment when compared with the ECO. Nevertheless, the genes for glutathione metabolism were more upregulated in the control than those in both bacterial treatments, regardless of the digestibility of the bacteria. The results of this study indicate that not only bacterial food but also digestibility of bacterial taxa modulate multiple metabolic processes in heterotrophic protists, which contribute to a better understanding of protistan bacterivory and bacteria-protists interactions on a molecular basis.	0
Title: CuH-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamidation of Vinylarenes Abstract: A CuH-catalyzed enantioselective hydroamidation reaction of vinylarenes has been developed using readily accessible 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones as electrophilic amidating reagents. This method provides a straightforward and efficient approach to synthesize chiral amides in good yields with high levels of enantiopurity under mild conditions. Moreover, this transformation tolerates substrates bearing a broad range of functional groups.	0
Title: The genetic organisation of the capsule biosynthesis region of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1, 6, 7, and 12 Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the organisation of the genes (cps) involved in biosynthesis the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes 6, 7, and 12 and to compare these to the corresponding genes previously described in other A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes. In serotypes 6 and 7 the sequenced DNA regions comprised five and four open reading frames, respectively, designated cps6ABCDE and cps7ABCD, whereas the sequenced DNA region in serotype 12 comprised only two open reading frames designated cps12AB. At the amino acid level, CpsA, CpsB, and CpsC of A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 contained a high degree of homology. At the amino acid level Cps6D revealed a high degree of homology to Cps8D, whereas Cps7D contained a high degree of homology to the Cps2D. The deduced gene product of the partially sequenced cps6E gene showed no homology to any deduced gene products of any cps genes of A. pleuropneumoniae investigated so far. None of the deduced gene products of the cps genes involved in encapsulation of A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 revealed homology to the deduced gene products of the cps genes of serotypes 1, 5A, and 12. For some genes, a local homology was found to genes probably involved in teichoic acid synthesis in other bacteria. The results obtained revealed a high degree of homology among the genes involved in CPS biosynthesis for serotypes 2, 6, 7, and 8 and a different group of homologous cps genes for serotypes 1 and 12. In some serotype 7 strains, including the serotype 7 reference strain, WF83, the cps genes were not located adjacent to the genes responsible for CPS export (cpx), probably due to genetic rearrangements.	1
Title: Forming quasicrystals by monodisperse soft core particles Abstract: In traditional approaches to form quasicrystals, multiple competing length scales involved in particle size, shape, or interaction potential are believed to be necessary. It is unexpected that quasicrystals can be formed by monodisperse, isotropic particles interacting via a simple potential that does not contain explicit multiple length scales to stabilize quasicrystals. Here, we report the surprising finding of the formation of such quasicrystals in high-density systems of soft-core particles. Although there are length scales naturally introduced in our model systems, they do not establish the quasicrystalline order. In two dimensions, we find not only dodecagonal but also octagonal quasicrystals, which have not been found yet in soft quasicrystals. In such unexpected quasicrystals, particles tend to form pentagons, which are essential elements to develop the quasicrystalline order. Our findings thus pave an unexpected and simple way to form quasicrystals and pose a challenge for theoretical understanding of quasicrystals.	0
Title: Measurement of endothelial cell free radical generation: evidence for a central mechanism of free radical injury in postischemic tissues Abstract: Oxygen free radicals have been demonstrated to be important mediators of postischemic reperfusion injury in a broad variety of tissues; however, the cellular source of free radical generation is still unknown. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate that bovine endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation become potent generators of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A prominent DMPO-OH signal aN = aH = 14.9 G is observed on reoxygenation after 45 min of anoxic incubation. Quantitative measurements of this free radical generation and the time course of radical generation are performed. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase totally abolish this radical signal, suggesting that O2 is sequentially reduced from O2-. to H2O2 to OH.. Addition of ethanol resulted in trapping of the ethoxy radical, further confirming the generation of OH.. Endothelial radical generation was shown to cause cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake. Radical generation was partially inhibited and partially scavenged by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Marked inhibition of radical generation was observed with the potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, conditions observed in ischemic and reperfused tissues, generate a burst of superoxide-derived hydroxyl free radicals that in turn cause cell injury and cell death. Most of this free radical generation appears to be from the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Thus, endothelial cell free radical generation may be a central mechanism of cellular injury in postischemic tissues.	0
Title: Solution structure of the cap-independent translational enhancer and ribosome-binding element in the 3' UTR of turnip crinkle virus Abstract: The 3(') untranslated region (3(') UTR) of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genomic RNA contains a cap-independent translation element (CITE), which includes a ribosome-binding structural element (RBSE) that participates in recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit. In addition, a large symmetric loop in the RBSE plays a key role in coordinating the incompatible processes of viral translation and replication, which require enzyme progression in opposite directions on the viral template. To understand the structural basis for the large ribosomal subunit recruitment and the intricate interplay among different parts of the molecule, we determined the global structure of the 102-nt RBSE RNA using solution NMR and small-angle x-ray scattering. This RNA has many structural features that resemble those of a tRNA in solution. The hairpins H1 and H2, linked by a 7-nucleotide linker, form the upper part of RBSE and hairpin H3 is relatively independent from the rest of the structure and is accessible to interactions. This global structure provides insights into the three-dimensional layout for ribosome binding, which may serve as a structural basis for its involvement in recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit and the switch between viral translation and replication. The experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of a functional element in the 3(') UTR of an RNA from any organism has not been previously reported. The RBSE structure represents a prototype structure of a new class of RNA structural elements involved in viral translation/replication processes.	0
Title: Involvement of the osmosensor histidine kinase and osmotic stress-activated protein kinases in the regulation of secondary metabolism in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: Fusarium graminearum produces trichothecenes in aerial hyphae, a process which is markedly suppressed by NaCl without a significant effect on fungal growth. Here we report on the involvement of kinases of the two-component osmotic signal transduction pathway in the regulation of secondary metabolism in F. graminearum. While a deletion null mutant of FgOs1 (encoding the osmosensor histidine kinase) (deltaFgOs1) produced a reduced amount of the red pigment aurofusarin and was unaltered in its ability to produce trichothecenes, deletion null mutants of FgOs4 (encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; MAPKKK), FgOs5 (MAPKK), and FgOs2 (MAPK) showed markedly enhanced pigmentation and failed to produce trichothecenes in aerial hyphae. Also, the transcript levels of PKS12 and GIP2 (aurofusarin biosynthetic pathway and regulatory genes, respectively) were significantly enhanced in the deltaFgOs4, deltaFgOs5, and deltaFgOs2 mutants and were reduced in the deltaFgOs1 mutant. In addition, expression of Tri4 and Tri6 (trichothecene biosynthetic pathway and regulatory genes) and production of trichothecenes in rice medium were markedly reduced in the former three protein kinase mutants. This is the first report demonstrating the involvement of a MAPK in the regulation of secondary metabolism.	1
Title: Optimizing natural products by biosynthetic engineering: discovery of nonquinone Hsp90 inhibitors Abstract: A biosynthetic medicinal chemistry approach was applied to the optimization of the natural product Hsp90 inhibitor macbecin. By genetic engineering, mutants have been created to produce novel macbecin analogues including a nonquinone compound (5) that has significantly improved binding affinity to Hsp90 (Kd 3 nM vs 240 nM for macbecin) and reduced toxicity (MTD > or = 250 mg/kg). Structural flexibility may contribute to the preorganization of 5 to exist in solution in the Hsp90-bound conformation.	1
Title: Investigations of two bidirectional carbon monoxide dehydrogenases from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans by protein film electrochemistry Abstract: Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyse the reversible conversion between CO and CO2 . Several small molecules or ions are inhibitors and probes for different oxidation states of the unusual [Ni-4 Fe-4 S] cluster that forms the active site. The actions of these small probes on two enzymes-CODH ICh and CODH IICh -produced by Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans have been studied by protein film voltammetry to compare their behaviour and to establish general characteristics. Whereas CODH ICh is, so far, the better studied of the two isozymes in terms of its electrocatalytic properties, it is CODH IICh that has been characterised by X-ray crystallography. The two isozymes, which share 58.3% sequence identity and 73.9% sequence similarity, show similar patterns of behaviour with regard to selective inhibition of CO2 reduction by CO (product) and cyanate, potent and selective inhibition of CO oxidation by cyanide, and the action of sulfide, which promotes oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. For both isozymes, rates of binding of substrate analogues CN(-) (for CO) and NCO(-) (for CO2 ) are orders of magnitude lower than turnover, a feature that is clearly revealed through hysteresis of cyclic voltammetry. Inhibition by CN(-) and CO is much stronger for CODH IICh than for CODH ICh, a property that has relevance for applying these enzymes as model catalysts in solar-driven CO2 reduction.	0
Title: Amphotericin biosynthesis in Streptomyces nodosus: deductions from analysis of polyketide synthase and late genes Abstract: Background:                       The polyene macrolide amphotericin B is produced by Streptomyces nodosus ATCC14899. Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal antibiotic and has activity against some viruses, protozoans and prions. Treatment of systemic fungal infections with amphotericin B is complicated by its low water-solubility and side effects which include severe nephrotoxicity. Analogues with improved properties could be generated by manipulating amphotericin biosynthetic genes in S. nodosus.                  Results:                       A large polyketide synthase gene cluster was cloned from total cellular DNA of S. nodosus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 113193 bp of this region revealed six large polyketide synthase genes as well as genes for two cytochrome P450 enzymes, two ABC transporter proteins, and genes involved in biosynthesis and attachment of mycosamine. Phage KC515-mediated gene disruption was used to show that this region is involved in amphotericin production.                  Conclusions:                       The availability of these genes and the development of a method for gene disruption and replacement in S. nodosus should allow production of novel amphotericins. A panel of analogues could lead to identification of derivatives with increased solubility, improved biological activity and reduced toxicity.	1
Title: Synthesis of sultam scaffolds via intramolecular oxa-Michael and diastereoselective Baylis-Hillman reactions Abstract: A divergent synthetic approach to new sultams utilizing intramolecular oxa-Michael and Baylis-Hillman reactions of readily prepared vinyl sulfonamides and suitably protected amino alcohols, is reported. A variety of seven- and eight-membered ring sultam scaffolds were synthesized using oxa-Michael pathways, whereas both five- and six-membered rings were synthesized using Baylis-Hillman methods. Baylis-Hillman reactions proceed with good to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity, and oxa-Michael reactions leading to eight-membered ring sultams provide empirical evidence validating 8- endo-trig cyclization pathways.	0
Title: The expanding roles and mechanisms of G protein-mediated presynaptic inhibition Abstract: Throughout the past five decades, tremendous advancements have been made in our understanding of G protein signaling and presynaptic inhibition, many of which were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry under the tenure of Herb Tabor as Editor-in-Chief. Here, we identify these critical advances, including the formulation of the ternary complex model of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and the discovery of Gβγ as a critical signaling component of the heterotrimeric G protein, along with the nature of presynaptic inhibition and its physiological role. We provide an overview for the discovery and physiological relevance of the two known Gβγ-mediated mechanisms for presynaptic inhibition: first, the action of Gβγ on voltage-gated calcium channels to inhibit calcium influx to the presynaptic active zone and, second, the direct binding of Gβγ to the SNARE complex to displace synaptotagmin downstream of calcium entry, which has been demonstrated to be important in neurons and secretory cells. These two mechanisms act in tandem with each other in a synergistic manner to provide more complete spatiotemporal control over neurotransmitter release.	0
Title: Prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 are essential for activation by DOCK7 Abstract: The unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family comprising 11 DOCK180 related proteins is classified into four subfamilies, A through D, based on their relative GEF activity toward the closely related Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. DOCK proteins participate in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and are key regulators of cell motility, phagocytosis, and adhesion. Here we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of DOCK7, DHR2 (for DOCK homology region 2), is a potent GEF for prenylated Cdc42 and Rac1 in a model liposome system, demonstrating that the prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 or Rac1 are necessary for their activation by DOCK7. Additionally, we identify DOCK7 residues that confer GTPase GEF specificity. Finally, using our liposome reconstitution assay, we show that a more narrowly defined GEF domain of DHR2 (designated DHR2s) harbors an N-terminal site distinct from the GEF active site that binds preferentially to the active, GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 and thereby recruits free DHR2s from solution to the membrane surface. This recruitment results in a progressive increase in the effective concentration of DHR2s at the membrane surface that in turn provides for an accelerated rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42. The positive cooperativity observed in our reconstituted system suggests that the action of DOCK7 in vivo may involve the coordinated integration of Cdc42/Rac signaling in the context of the membrane recruitment of a DOCK7 GEF complex.	0
Title: Tundrenone: An Atypical Secondary Metabolite from Bacteria with Highly Restricted Primary Metabolism Abstract: Methane-oxidizing bacteria, aerobes that utilize methane as their sole carbon and energy source, are being increasingly studied for their environmentally significant ability to remove methane from the atmosphere. Their genomes indicate that they also have a robust and unusual secondary metabolism. Bioinformatic analysis of the Methylobacter tundripaludum genome identified biosynthetic gene clusters for several intriguing metabolites, and this report discloses the structural and genetic characterization of tundrenone, one of these metabolites. Tundrenone is a highly oxidized metabolite that incorporates both a modified bicyclic chorismate-derived fragment and a modified lipid tail bearing a β,γ-unsaturated α-hydroxy ketone. Tundrenone has been genetically linked to its biosynthetic gene cluster, and quorum sensing activates its production. M. tundripaludum's genome and tundrenone's discovery support the idea that additional studies of methane-oxidizing bacteria will reveal new naturally occurring molecular scaffolds and the biosynthetic pathways that produce them.	1
Title: Covalent inhibitors of human monoacylglycerol lipase: ligand-assisted characterization of the catalytic site by mass spectrometry and mutational analysis Abstract: The active site of recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged human monoacylglycerol lipase (hMGL) is characterized by mass spectrometry using the inhibitors 5-((biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2H-tetrazole-2-carboxamide (AM6701), and N-arachidonylmaleimide (NAM) as probes. Carbamylation of Ser(129) by AM6701 in the putative hMGL catalytic triad demonstrates this residue's essential role in catalysis. Partial NAM alkylation of hMGL cysteine residues 215 and/or 249 was sufficient to achieve approximately 80% enzyme inhibition. Although Cys(215) and/or Cys(249) mutations to alanine(s) did not affect hMGL hydrolytic activity as compared with nonmutated hMGL, the C215A displayed heightened NAM sensitivity, whereas the C249A evidenced reduced NAM sensitivity. These data conclusively demonstrate a sulfhydryl-based mechanism for NAM inhibition of hMGL in which Cys(249) is of paramount importance. Identification of amino acids critical to the catalytic activity and pharmacological modulation of hMGL informs the design of selective MGL inhibitors as potential drugs.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of antimycins with a reconstituted 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore in Escherichia coli Abstract: Antimycins are a family of natural products generated from a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line. Although they possess an array of useful biological activities, their structural complexity makes chemical synthesis challenging, and their biosynthesis has thus far been dependent on slow-growing source organisms. Here, we reconstituted the biosynthesis of antimycins in Escherichia coli, a versatile host that is robust and easy to manipulate genetically. Along with Streptomyces genetic studies, the heterologous expression of different combinations of ant genes enabled us to systematically confirm the functions of the modification enzymes, AntHIJKL and AntO, in the biosynthesis of the 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore of antimycins. Our E. coli-based antimycin production system can not only be used to engineer the increased production of these bioactive compounds, but it also paves the way for the facile generation of novel and diverse antimycin analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Analysis of intact and dissected fungal polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase in vitro and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The widely found fungal iterative PKS-NRPS hybrid megasynthetases are highly programmed biosynthetic machines involved in the synthesis of 3-acyltetramic acids and related natural products. In vitro analysis of iterative PKS-NRPS has been hampered by the difficulties associated with obtaining pure and functional forms of these large enzymes (>400 kDa). We successfully expressed Aspergillus nidulans aspyridone synthetase (ApdA) from an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. The complete functions of ApdA and its enoylreductase partner ApdC are reconstituted in vitro and in S. cerevisiae with the production of preaspyridone 7. The programming rules of both the PKS and NRPS modules were then examined in vitro. The key interaction between the PKS and the NRPS was dissected and reconstituted in trans by using stand-alone modules. Analogs of 7 were synthesized through heterologous combinations of PKS and NRPS modules from different sources. Our results represent one of the largest, multidomain enzyme reconstituted to date and offer new opportunities for engineered biosynthesis of fungal natural products.	1
Title: Discovery and Characterization of a Class IV Lanthipeptide with a Nonoverlapping Ring Pattern Abstract: Lanthipeptides constitute a major family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). They are classified into four subfamilies, based on the characteristics of their lanthipeptide synthetases. While over a hundred lanthipeptides have been discovered to date, very few of them are class IV lanthipeptides and the latter are all structurally similar. Here, we identified an uncharacterized group of class IV lanthipeptides using bioinformatics analysis. One representative pathway from Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1022 was expressed in Escherichia coli, which generated a lanthipeptide with two nonoverlapping rings that have not been reported for known class IV lanthipeptides. Further investigation into the biosynthetic mechanism revealed that multiple modification pathways are in operation in which dehydration and cyclization occur in parallel. While peptidases for maturation of class IV lanthipeptides have been elusive, two aminopeptidases encoded in the genome of Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1022 were shown to process the modified peptide by the dual endopeptidase/aminopeptidase activity. This work opens doors to discover more class IV lanthipeptides with interesting structural features and biological activities.	1
Title: Degradation of azo dyes by Trametes villosa laccase over long periods of oxidative conditions Abstract: Trametes villosa laccase was used for direct azo dye degradation, and the reaction products that accumulated after 72 h of incubation were analyzed. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed the formation of phenolic compounds during the dye oxidation process as well as a large amount of polymerized products that retain azo group integrity. The amino-phenol reactions were also investigated by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance and LC-MS analysis, and the polymerization character of laccase was shown. This study highlights the fact that laccases polymerize the reaction products obtained during long-term batch decolorization processes with azo dyes. These polymerized products provide unacceptable color levels in effluents, limiting the application of laccases as bioremediation agents.	0
Title: Sesquiterpene Synthase-3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Synthase Fusion Protein Responsible for Hirsutene Biosynthesis in Stereum hirsutum Abstract: The wood-rotting mushroom Stereum hirsutum is a known producer of a large number of namesake hirsutenoids, many with important bioactivities. Hirsutenoids form a structurally diverse and distinct class of sesquiterpenoids. No genes involved in hirsutenoid biosynthesis have yet been identified or their enzymes characterized. Here, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a hirsutene synthase as an unexpected fusion protein of a sesquiterpene synthase (STS) with a C-terminal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) synthase (HMGS) domain. Both the full-length fusion protein and truncated STS domain are highly product-specific 1,11-cyclizing STS enzymes with kinetic properties typical of STSs. Complementation studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that the HMGS domain is also functional in vivo Phylogenetic analysis shows that the hirsutene synthase domain does not form a clade with other previously characterized sesquiterpene synthases from Basidiomycota. Comparative gene structure analysis of this hirsutene synthase with characterized fungal enzymes reveals a significantly higher intron density, suggesting that this enzyme may be acquired by horizontal gene transfer. In contrast, the HMGS domain is clearly related to other fungal homologs. This STS-HMGS fusion protein is part of a biosynthetic gene cluster that includes P450s and oxidases that are expressed and could be cloned from cDNA. Finally, this unusual fusion of a terpene synthase to an HMGS domain, which is not generally recognized as a key regulatory enzyme of the mevalonate isoprenoid precursor pathway, led to the identification of additional HMGS duplications in many fungal genomes, including the localization of HMGSs in other predicted sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters.IMPORTANCE Hirsutenoids represent a structurally diverse class of bioactive sesquiterpenoids isolated from fungi. Identification of their biosynthetic pathways will provide access to this chemodiversity for the discovery and synthesis of molecules with new bioactivities. The identification and successful cloning of the previously elusive hirsutene synthase from the S. hirsutum provide important insights and strategies for biosynthetic gene discovery in Basidiomycota. The finding of a terpene synthase-HMGS fusion, the discovery of other sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters with dedicated HMGS genes, and HMGS gene duplications in fungal genomes give new importance to the role of HMGS as a key regulatory enzyme in isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis that should be exploited for metabolic engineering.	1
Title: Metformin Changes the Relationship between Blood Monocyte Toll-Like Receptor 4 Levels and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease-Ex Vivo Studies Abstract: Background:                       Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to the development of NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and MetS (metabolic syndrome). It is unclear whether anti-diabetic metformin affects TLR4 expression on blood monocytes, thereby protecting or improving inflammatory parameters. Therefore, we investigated TLR4 in patients with NAFLD meeting different sets of MetS criteria and linked the results with the disease burden.                  Methods:                       70 subjects were characterized and divided into three groups: (I) healthy individuals, (II) nonobese with NAFLD and without MetS, and (III) prediabetic, obese with NAFLD and MetS. We determined the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and monocyte TLR4 levels in fresh blood as well as in blood cultures with or without metformin supplementation.                  Results:                       The characteristics of the study groups revealed a significant association between NAFLD and BMI, MetS and inflammatory parameters, and TLR4. In ex vivo studies, 100 μM of metformin decreased the TLR4 level by 19.9% (II group) or by 35% (III group) as well as IL-1β and TNFα production. A stepwise multiple regression analysis highlighted a strong effect of metformin on attenuation of the link between TLR4 and NAFLD, and TNFα.                  Conclusion:                       We concluded that, by attenuation of the blood monocyte TLR4 level, metformin reduced their inflammatory potential-critical after recruitment these cells into liver. However, this finding should be confirmed after in vivo metformin administration.	0
Title: Pseudomonas Cyclic Lipopeptides Suppress the Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by Induced Resistance and Direct Antagonism Abstract: Beneficial Pseudomonas spp. produce an array of antimicrobial secondary metabolites such as cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs). We investigated the capacity of CLP-producing Pseudomonas strains and their crude CLP extracts to control rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, both in a direct manner and via induced systemic resistance (ISR). In planta biocontrol assays showed that lokisin-, white line inducing principle (WLIP)-, entolysin- and N3-producing strains successfully induced resistance to M. oryzae VT5M1. Furthermore, crude extracts of lokisin, WLIP and entolysin gave similar ISR results when tested in planta. In contrast, a xantholysin-producing strain and crude extracts of N3, xantholysin and orfamide did not induce resistance against the rice blast disease. The role of WLIP in triggering ISR was further confirmed by using WLIP-deficient mutants. The severity of rice blast disease was significantly reduced when M. oryzae spores were pre-treated with crude extracts of N3, lokisin, WLIP, entolysin or orfamide prior to inoculation. In vitro microscopic assays further revealed the capacity of crude N3, lokisin, WLIP, entolysin, xantholysin and orfamide to significantly inhibit appressoria formation by M. oryzae. In addition, the lokisin and WLIP biosynthetic gene clusters in the producing strains are described. In short, our study demonstrates the biological activity of structurally diverse CLPs in the control of the rice blast disease caused by M. oryzae. Furthermore, we provide insight into the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes encoding the WLIP and lokisin biosynthetic machineries.	1
Title: The psymberin story--biological properties and approaches towards total and analogue syntheses Abstract: Psymberin is a marine natural product which has attracted a great deal of interest since its isolation: While the highly cytotoxic compound was detected early on as an ingredient in a marine sponge, it took over a decade and 600 additional samples for the structure to eventually be assigned. In the last eight years fascinating synthetic and biosynthetic investigations have led to a more detailed understanding as well as a new starting point for structure-activity studies towards new antitumor compounds. The Review gives an in-depth insight into the progress in the field of the marine polyketide psymberin and demonstrates how organic synthesis is influencing neighboring scientific subjects.	1
Title: Olaparib-Based Photoaffinity Probes for PARP-1 Detection in Living Cells Abstract: The poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) is a protein from the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyzes polyadenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) formation in order to attract the DNA repair machinery to sites of DNA damage. The inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib can cause cell death, which is of clinical relevance in some tumor types. This demonstrates that quantification of PARP activity in the context of living cells is of great importance. In this work, we present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of photo-activatable affinity probes inspired by the olaparib molecule that are equipped with a diazirine for covalent attachment upon activation by UV light and a ligation handle for the addition of a reporter group of choice. SDS-PAGE, western blotting and label-free LC-MS/MS quantification analysis show that the probes target the PARP-1 protein and are selectively outcompeted by olaparib; this suggests that they bind in the same enzymatic pocket. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018661.	0
Title: SlyA regulates type III secretion system (T3SS) genes in parallel with the T3SS master regulator HrpL in Dickeya dadantii 3937 Abstract: The hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes of Dickeya dadantii 3937 encode a type III secretion system (T3SS) which is essential for its full virulence. Previous studies of the T3SS regulation in D. dadantii 3937 revealed that the expression of the hrp genes is regulated by a master regulator, HrpL, through the HrpX-HrpY-HrpS-HrpL and GacS-GacA-rsmB-RsmA pathways. In this work, we identified a novel regulator of the SlyA/MarR family, SlyA, which regulates hrp genes of the HrpL regulon in parallel with HrpL in D. dadantii. SlyA regulates the T3SS in a two-tier manner. It negatively regulates the expression of hrpL by downregulating hrpS and upregulating rsmA. Interestingly, concomitant with its downregulation of the hrpL, SlyA positively regulates the expression of hrpA and hrpN, two hrp genes located in the HrpL regulon. In contrast to Pectobacterium carotovorum, the expression of slyA is not controlled by ExpR and ExpI in D. dadantii 3937. We further show that SlyA is involved in controlling swimming motility and pellicle formation in D. dadantii 3937.	0
Title: Genetics of zwittermicin a production by Bacillus cereus Abstract: Zwittermicin A represents a new chemical class of antibiotic and has diverse biological activities, including suppression of oomycete diseases of plants and potentiation of the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. To identify genes involved in zwittermicin A production, we generated 4,800 transposon mutants of B. cereus UW101C and screened them for zwittermicin A accumulation. Nine mutants did not produce detectable zwittermicin A, and one mutant produced eightfold more than the parent strain. The DNA flanking the transposon insertions in six of the nine nonproducing mutants contains significant sequence similarity to genes involved in peptide and polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis. The mutant that overproduced zwittermicin A contained a transposon insertion immediately upstream from a gene that encodes a deduced protein that is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Three genes identified by the mutant analysis mapped to a region that was previously shown to carry the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, and a biosynthetic gene (E. A. Stohl, J. L. Milner, and J. Handelsman, Gene 237:403-411, 1999). Further sequencing of this region revealed genes proposed to encode zwittermicin A precursor biosynthetic enzymes, in particular, those involved in the formation of the aminomalonyl- and hydroxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein intermediates. Additionally, nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) homologs are present, suggesting that zwittermicin A is synthesized by a mixed NRPS/PKS pathway.	1
Title: Glycan sequence-dependent Nod2 activation investigated by using a chemically synthesized bacterial peptidoglycan fragment library Abstract: Nucleotide oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (Nod2), an innate immune receptor, recognizes bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan (PGN), the minimum ligand of which is muramyl dipeptide (MDP). Enzymatic digestion of PGN appears to be important for Nod2 recognition. PGN is degraded by muramidase or glucosamidase through a process that produces two types of glycan sequence; glycans containing GlcNAcβ(1→4)MurNAc or MurNAcβ(1→4)GlcNAc. In this report, a range of disaccharide or tetrasaccharide fragments of each sequence were chemically synthesized, and their activities in stimulating human Nod2 (hNod2) were investigated. The results reveal that hNod2 recognitions is dependent on the glycan sequence, as demonstrated by comparing the activities of glycans with the same peptide moieties. (MurNAcβ(1→4)GlcNAc)(2) -containing structures exhibited stronger activity than those containing (GlcNAcβ(1→4)MurNAc)(2) . The results suggest that differences in the enzymatic degradation process affect the host's immunomodulation process.	0
Title: An unusual metal-bound 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase from Streptomyces sp. MA37 catalyses promiscuous transaldol reactions Abstract: β-Hydroxy-α-amino acids (βH-AAs) are key components of many bioactive molecules as well as exist as specialised metabolites. Among these βH-AAs, 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) is the only naturally occurring fluorinated AA discovered thus far. Here we report overexpression and biochemical characterisation of 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase from Streptomyces sp. MA37 (FTaseMA), a homologue of FTase previously identified in the biosynthesis of 4-FT in S. cattleya. FTaseMA displays considerable substrate plasticity to generate 4-FT as well as other β-hydroxy-α-amino acids with various functionalities at C4 position, giving the prospect of new chemo-enzymatic applications. The enzyme has a hybrid of two catalytic domains, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (S) and aldolase (A). Site-directed mutagenesis allowed the identification of the key residues of FTases, suggesting that the active site of A domain has a historical reminiscent feature in metal-dependent aldolases. Elemental analysis demonstrated that FTaseMA is indeed a Zn2+-dependent enzyme, the first example of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzyme family fused with a metal-binding domain carrying out a distinct catalytic role. Finally, FTaseMA showed divergent evolutionary origin with other PLP dependent enzymes.	0
Title: Activation and Identification of a Griseusin Cluster in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by Employing Transcriptional Regulators and Multi-Omics Methods Abstract: Streptomyces are well-known producers of a range of different secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. Recently, it has been demonstrated that "silent" biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be activated by heterologously expressing transcriptional regulators from other BGCs. Here, we have activated a silent BGC in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by overexpression of a set of SARP family transcriptional regulators. The structure of the produced compound was elucidated by NMR and found to be an N-acetyl cysteine adduct of the pyranonaphtoquinone polyketide 3'-O-α-d-forosaminyl-(+)-griseusin A. Employing a combination of multi-omics and metabolic engineering techniques, we identified the responsible BGC. These methods include genome mining, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, in combination with CRISPR induced gene inactivations and expression of the BGC in a heterologous host strain. This work demonstrates an easy-to-implement workflow of how silent BGCs can be activated, followed by the identification and characterization of the produced compound, the responsible BGC, and hints of its biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Therapeutic potency of compound RMY-205 for pulmonary fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is linked with a poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary fibrosis by activating pulmonary fibroblasts. N protein interacted with the transforming growth factor β receptor I (TβRI), to disrupt the interaction of TβRI-FK506 Binding Protein12 (FKBP12), which led to activation of TβRI to phosphorylate Smad3 and boost expression of pro-fibrotic genes and secretion of cytokines to promote pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified a compound, RMY-205, that bound to Smad3 to disrupt TβRI-induced Smad3 activation. The therapeutic potential of RMY-205 was strengthened in mouse models of N protein-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This study highlights a signaling pathway of pulmonary fibrosis induced by N protein and demonstrates a novel therapeutic strategy for treating pulmonary fibrosis by a compound targeting Smad3.	0
Title: Veillonella Catalase Protects the Growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum in Microaerophilic and Streptococcus gordonii-Resident Environments Abstract: The oral biofilm is a multispecies community in which antagonism and mutualism coexist among friends and foes to keep an ecological balance of community members. The pioneer colonizers, such as Streptococcus gordonii, produce H2O2 to inhibit the growth of competitors, like the mutans streptococci, as well as strict anaerobic middle and later colonizers of the dental biofilm. Interestingly, Veillonella species, as early colonizers, physically interact (coaggregate) with S. gordonii A putative catalase gene (catA) is found in most sequenced Veillonella species; however, the function of this gene is unknown. In this study, we characterized the ecological function of catA from Veillonella parvula PK1910 by integrating it into the only transformable strain, Veillonella atypica OK5, which is catA negative. The strain (OK5-catA) became more resistant to H2O2 Further studies demonstrated that the catA gene expression is induced by the addition of H2O2 or coculture with S. gordonii Mixed-culture experiments further revealed that the transgenic OK5-catA strain not only enhanced the growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a strict anaerobic periodontopathogen, under microaerophilic conditions, but it also rescued F. nucleatum from killing by S. gordonii A potential role of catalase in veillonellae in biofilm ecology and pathogenesis is discussed here.IMPORTANCEVeillonella species, as early colonizers, can coaggregate with many bacteria, including the initial colonizer Streptococcus gordonii and periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum, during various stages of oral biofilm formation. In addition to providing binding sites for many microbes, our previous study also showed that Veillonella produces nutrients for the survival and growth of periodontal pathogens. These findings indicate that Veillonella plays an important "bridging" role in the development of oral biofilms and the ecology of the human oral cavity. In this study, we demonstrated that the reducing activity of Veillonella can rescue the growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum not only under microaerophilic conditions, but also in an environment in which Streptococcus gordonii is present. Thus, this study will provide a new insight for future studies on the mechanisms of human oral biofilm formation and the control of periodontal diseases.	0
Title: Assembly of a Ribozyme Ligase from Short Oligomers by Nonenzymatic Ligation Abstract: Our current understanding of the chemistry of the primordial genetic material is fragmentary at best. The chemical replication of oligonucleotides long enough to perform catalytic functions is particularly problematic because of the low efficiency of nonenzymatic template copying. Here we show that this problem can be circumvented by assembling a functional ribozyme by the templated ligation of short oligonucleotides. However, this approach creates a new problem because the splint oligonucleotides used to drive ribozyme assembly strongly inhibit the resulting ribozyme. We explored three approaches to the design of splint oligonucleotides that enable efficient ligation but which allow the assembled ribozyme to remain active. DNA splints, splints with G:U wobble pairs, and splints with G to I (Inosine) substitutions all allowed for the efficient assembly of an active ribozyme ligase. Our work demonstrates the possibility of a transition from nonenzymatic ligation to enzymatic ligation and reveals the importance of avoiding ribozyme inhibition by complementary oligonucleotides.	0
Title: FliL associates with the stator to support torque generation of the sodium-driven polar flagellar motor of Vibrio Abstract: Flagellar motors generate torque to rotate flagellar filaments and drive bacterial cells. Each motor is composed of a rotor and many stators. The stator is a force-generating complex that converts ion flux into torque. Previous reports have suggested that the membrane protein FliL is located near the stator and is involved in torque generation. We investigated the role of FliL in the sodium-driven polar flagellar motor of Vibrio alginolyticus. Our results revealed that FliL is a cytoplasmic membrane protein and is located at the base of flagellum. The deletion of fliL did not affect the cell morphology or flagellation but resulted in a significant decrease of swimming speed, especially at a higher load thus suggesting that FliL is important for torque generation at high load conditions. Furthermore, the polar localization of the stator was decreased in a ΔfliL mutant, but the sodium-dependent assembly of the stator complex was still retained. The polar localization of FliL was lost in the absence of the stator complex, indicating that FliL interacts directly or indirectly with the stator. Our results suggest that FliL is localized along with the stator in order to support the motor functioning for swimming at high load conditions by maintaining the stator assembly.	0
Title: Enantio- and regioselective CuH-catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes Abstract: A highly enantio- and regioselective copper-catalyzed hydroamination reaction of alkenes has been developed using diethoxymethylsilane and esters of hydroxylamines. The process tolerates a wide variety of substituted styrenes, including trans-, cis-, and β,β-disubstituted styrenes, to yield α-branched amines. In addition, aliphatic alkenes coupled to generate exclusively the anti-Markovnikov hydroamination products.	0
Title: Identification and analysis of the gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of paenibactin, a catecholate siderophore produced by Paenibacillus elgii B69 Abstract: Bacteria belonging to the genus Paenibacillus are recognized as rich sources of bioactive natural products. To date, there are few characterized siderophores from this genus. Here, through genome analysis, we identified a non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster (pae) responsible for siderophore assembly in Paenibacillus elgii B69. The 12.8 kb gene cluster comprises six open reading frames encoding proteins similar to the components of the bacillibactin biosynthetic machinery and bacillibactin esterase. To examine the product of the pae gene cluster, we cultured P. elgii B69 in iron-deficient medium for siderophore expression. A novel siderophore structurally similar to bacillibactin, designated paenibactin, was purified and characterized. Its structure was determined as a cyclic trimeric lactone of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-alanine-threonine. The involvement of the pae gene cluster in paenibactin biosynthesis was confirmed by the biochemical assay of adenylation domain specificity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the pae gene cluster evolves from an ancestral bacillibactin biosynthetic gene cluster via sequence and phylogenetic analyses. The structural difference between paenibactin and bacillibactin may stem from a mutation-induced change in the adenylation domain specificity. Based on these findings and published models for bacillibactin, we proposed models for paenibactin biosynthesis, ferric-paenibactin uptake and paenibactin-bounded iron release.	1
Title: Extraordinary Redox Activities in Ladder-Type Conjugated Molecules Enabled by B ← N Coordination-Promoted Delocalization and Hyperconjugation Abstract: The introduction of B ← N coordinate bond-isoelectronic to C-C single bond-into π-systems represents a promising strategy to impart exotic redox and electrochromic properties into conjugated organic molecules and macromolecules. To achieve both reductive and oxidative activities using this strategy, a cruciform ladder-type molecular constitution was designed to accommodate oxidation-active, reduction-active, and B ← N coordination units into a compact structure. Two such compounds (BN-F and BN-Ph) were synthesized via highly efficient N-directed borylation. These molecules demonstrated well-separated, two reductive and two oxidative electron-transfer processes, corresponding to five distinct yet stable oxidation states, including a rarely observed boron-containing radical cation. Spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed unique optical characteristics for each of these reduced/oxidized species, demonstrating multicolor electrochromism with excellent recyclability. Distinct color changes were observed between each redox state with clear isosbestic points on the absorption spectra. The underlying redox mechanism was elucidated by a combination of computational and experimental investigations. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis on the neutral state, the oxidized radical cation, and the reduced dianion of BN-Ph revealed structural transformations into two distinct quinonoid constitutions during the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively. B ← N coordination played an important role in rendering the robust and reversible multistage redox properties, by extending the charge and spin delocalization, by modulating the π-electron density, and by a newly established hyperconjugation mechanism.	0
Title: Essential PchG-dependent reduction in pyochelin biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The biosynthetic genes pchDCBA and pchEF, which are known to be required for the formation of the siderophore pyochelin and its precursors salicylate and dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), are clustered with the pchR regulatory gene on the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 4.6-kb region located downstream of the pchEF genes was found to contain three additional, contiguous genes, pchG, pchH, and pchI, probably forming a pchEFGHI operon. The deduced amino acid sequences of PchH and PchI are similar to those of ATP binding cassette transport proteins with an export function. PchG is a homolog of the Yersinia pestis and Y. enterocolitica proteins YbtU and Irp3, which are involved in the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin. A null mutation in pchG abolished pyochelin formation, whereas mutations in pchH and pchI did not affect the amounts of salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin produced. The pyochelin biosynthetic genes were expressed from a vector promoter, uncoupling them from Fur-mediated repression by iron and PchR-dependent induction by pyochelin. In a P. aeruginosa mutant lacking the entire pyochelin biosynthetic gene cluster, the expressed pchDCBA and pchEFG genes were sufficient for salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin production. Pyochelin formation was also obtained in the heterologous host Escherichia coli expressing pchDCBA and pchEFG together with the E. coli entD gene, which provides a phosphopantetheinyl transferase necessary for PchE and PchF activation. The PchG protein was purified and used in combination with PchD and phosphopantetheinylated PchE and PchF in vitro to produce pyochelin from salicylate, L-cysteine, ATP, NADPH, and S-adenosylmethionine. Based on this assay, a reductase function was attributed to PchG. In summary, this study completes the identification of the biosynthetic genes required for pyochelin formation from chorismate in P. aeruginosa.	1
Title: Evolution of a complex locus for terpene biosynthesis in solanum Abstract: Functional gene clusters, containing two or more genes encoding different enzymes for the same pathway, are sometimes observed in plant genomes, most often when the genes specify the synthesis of specialized defensive metabolites. Here, we show that a cluster of genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; Solanaceae) contains genes for terpene synthases (TPSs) that specify the synthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes from cis-prenyl diphosphates, substrates that are synthesized by enzymes encoded by cis-prenyl transferase (CPT) genes also located within the same cluster. The monoterpene synthase genes in the cluster likely evolved from a diterpene synthase gene in the cluster by duplication and divergence. In the orthologous cluster in Solanum habrochaites, a new sesquiterpene synthase gene was created by a duplication event of a monoterpene synthase followed by a localized gene conversion event directed by a diterpene synthase gene. The TPS genes in the Solanum cluster encoding cis-prenyl diphosphate-utilizing enzymes are closely related to a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; Solanaceae) diterpene synthase encoding Z-abienol synthase (Nt-ABS). Nt-ABS uses the substrate copal-8-ol diphosphate, which is made from the all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate by copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase (Nt-CPS2). The Solanum gene cluster also contains an ortholog of Nt-CPS2, but it appears to encode a nonfunctional protein. Thus, the Solanum functional gene cluster evolved by duplication and divergence of TPS genes, together with alterations in substrate specificity to utilize cis-prenyl diphosphates and through the acquisition of CPT genes.	1
Title: Stationary-phase production of the antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is transcriptionally regulated Abstract: Production of actinorhodin, a polyketide antibiotic made by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), normally occurs only in stationary-phase cultures. S1 nuclease protection experiments showed that transcription of actII-ORF4, the activator gene required for expression of the biosynthetic structural genes, increased dramatically during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. The increase in actII-ORF4 expression was followed by transcription of the biosynthetic structural genes actIII and actVI-ORF1, and by the production of actinorhodin. The presence of actII-ORF4 on a multicopy plasmid resulted in enhanced levels of actII-ORF4 mRNA, and transcription of actIII and actinorhodin production during exponential growth, suggesting that actinorhodin synthesis in rapidly growing cultures is normally limited only by the availability of enough of the activator protein. bldA, which encodes a tRNA(Leu)UUA that is required for the efficient translation of a single UUA codon in the actII-ORF4 mRNA, was transcribed throughout growth. Moreover, translational fusions of the 5' end of actII-ORF4 that included the UUA codon to the ermE reporter gene demonstrated the presence of functional bldA tRNA in young, exponentially growing cultures and no increase in the efficiency of translation of UUA codons, relative to UUG codons, was observed during growth. The normal growth-phase-dependent production of actinorhodin in the liquid culture conditions used in these experiments appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level through activation of the actII-ORF4 promoter.	1
Title: The genetics of cell wall biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Abstract: Despite an available vaccine and effective antibiotics, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still the causative agent of almost 2 million deaths every year. The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is composed of sugars and lipids of exotic structure, many of which contribute to its pathogenicity. The majority of the enzymes responsible for building this structure are essential. However, they share very little homology with well-characterized enzymes, which makes their identification in the genome difficult. Despite this, our knowledge of the structure of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis is fairly complete and an increasing number of genes have been identified that are involved in its biosynthesis. By contrast, data concerning regulation of the expression of these genes and control of the cell wall composition are restricted. This review summarizes current information on the genetics of cell wall biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis, incorporating available data on gene organization and regulation.	1
Title: Genome- and MS-based mining of antibacterial chlorinated chromones and xanthones from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana strain 11134 Abstract: Halogen substituents are important for biological activity in many compounds. Genome-based mining of halogenase along with its biosynthetic gene cluster provided an efficient approach for the discovery of naturally occurring organohalogen compounds. Analysis of the genome sequence of a phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana 11134 revealed a polyketide gene cluster adjacent to a flavin-dependent halogenase capable of encoding halogenated polyketides, which are rarely reported in phytopathogenic fungi. Furthermore, MS- and UV-guided isolation and purification led to the identification of five chlorine-containing natural products together with seven other chromones and xanthones. Two of the chlorinated compounds and four chromones are new compounds. Their structures were elucidated by NMR spectroscopic analysis and HRESIMS data. The biosynthetic gene clusters of isolated compounds and their putative biosynthetic pathway are also proposed. One new chlorinated compound showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and three clinical-resistant S. aureus strains with a shared minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.5 μg/mL.

Title: Reconstitution of biosynthetic machinery for indole-diterpene paxilline in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Indole-diterpenes represented by paxilline share a common pentacyclic core skeleton derived from indole and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. To shed light on the detailed biosynthetic mechanism of the paspaline-type hexacyclic skeleton, we examined the reconstitution of paxilline biosynthetic machinery in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Stepwise introduction of the six pax genes enabled us to isolate all biosynthetic intermediates and to synthesize paxilline. In vitro and in vivo studies on the key enzymes, prenyltransferase PaxC and cyclase PaxB, allowed us to elucidate actual substrates of these enzymes. Using the isolated and the synthesized epoxide substrates, the highly intriguing stepwide epoxidation/cyclization mechanism for the construction of core structure has been confirmed. In addition, we also demonstrated "tandem transformation" to simultaneously introduce two genes using a single vector (paxG/paxB, pAdeA; paxP/paxQ, pUNA). This may provide further option for the reconstitution strategy to synthesize more complex fungal metabolites.	1
Title: Identification of the site of translational frameshifting required for production of the transposase encoded by insertion sequence IS 1 Abstract: Previous genetic analyses indicated that translational frameshifting in the--1 direction occurs within the run of six adenines in the sequence 5'-TTAAAAAACTC-3' at nucleotide positions 305-315 in IS 1, where the two out-of-phase reading frames insA and B'-insB overlap, to produce transposase with a polypeptide segment Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu at residues 84-87. IS 1 mutants with a 1 bp insertion, which encode mutant transposases with an amino acid substitution within the polypeptide segment at residues 84-87, did not efficiently mediate cointegration, except for an IS 1 mutant which encodes a mutant transposase with a Leu-Arg-Lys-Leu segment instead of Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu. An IS 1 mutant with the DNA segment 5'-CTTAAAAACTC-3' at positions 305-315 carrying the termination codon TAA in the B'-insB reading frame could still mediate cointegration, indicating that codon AAA for Lys corresponding to second, third and fourth positions in the run of adenines is the site of frameshifting. The beta-galactosidase activity specified by several IS 1-lacZ fusion plasmids, in which B'-insB is in-frame with lacZ, showed that the region 292-377 is sufficient for frameshifting. The protein produced by frameshifting from the IS 1-lacZ plasmid in fact contained the polypeptide segment Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu encoded by the DNA segment 5'-TTAAAAAACTC-3', indicating that--1 frameshifting does occur within the run of adenines.	0
Title: Activation of Natural Products Biosynthetic Pathways via a Protein Modification Level Regulation Abstract: Natural products are critical for drug discovery and development; however their discovery is challenged by the wide inactivation or silence of microbial biosynthetic pathways. Currently strategies targeting this problem are mainly concentrated on chromosome dissembling, transcription, and translation-stage regulations as well as chemical stimulation. In this study, we developed a novel approach to awake cryptic/silenced microbial biosynthetic pathways through augmentation of the conserved protein modification step-phosphopantetheinylation of carrier proteins. Overexpression of phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Pptase) genes into 33 Actinomycetes achieved a significantly high activation ratio at which 23 (70%) strains produced new metabolites. Genetic and biochemical studies on the mode-of-action revealed that exogenous PPtases triggered the activation of carrier proteins and subsequent production of metabolites. With this approach we successfully identified five oviedomycin and halichomycin-like compounds from two strains. This study provides a novel approach to efficiently activate cryptic/silenced biosynthetic pathways which will be useful for natural products discovery.	1
Title: Higher Acenes by On-Surface Dehydrogenation: From Heptacene to Undecacene Abstract: A unified approach to the synthesis of the series of higher acenes up to previously unreported undecacene has been developed through the on-surface dehydrogenation of partially saturated precursors. These molecules could be converted into the parent acenes by both atomic manipulation with the tip of a scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope (STM/AFM) as well as by on-surface annealing. The structure of the generated acenes has been visualized by high-resolution non-contact AFM imaging and the evolution of the transport gap with the increase of the number of fused benzene rings has been determined on the basis of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements.	0
Title: Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy Abstract: Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti-PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral-flow assays based on up-converting nanoparticles (UCP-LFAs) showed that the generated PGL-I and PGL-II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.	0
Title: Novel tryptophan metabolites, chromoazepinone A, B and C, produced by a blocked mutant of Chromobacterium violaceum, the biosynthetic implications and the biological activity of chromoazepinone A and B Abstract: Chromobacterium violaceum produces tryptophan metabolites, purple pigments of violacein and deoxyviolacein. A blocked mutant was prepared with N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine to gain insights into the biosynthetic mechanisms of the pigments. Five tryptophan metabolites were isolated: three novel compounds, named chromoazepinone A, B and C and two known compounds, chromopyrrolic acid and arcyriarubin A. The structure determinations of the three novel compounds are described. The biosynthetic pathways of these metabolites are proposed on the basis of the findings about violacein biosynthesis. Chromoazepinone A and B were found to have an interesting effect of inhibition of Wnt signal transcriptional activity, which is implicated in the formation of numerous tumors when aberrantly activated.	1
Title: Reprogramming acyl carrier protein interactions of an Acyl-CoA promiscuous trans-acyltransferase Abstract: Protein interactions between acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) and trans-acting acyltransferase domains (trans-ATs) are critical for regioselective extender unit installation by many polyketide synthases, yet little is known regarding the specificity of these interactions, particularly for trans-ATs with unusual extender unit specificities. Currently, the best-studied trans-AT with nonmalonyl specificity is KirCII from kirromycin biosynthesis. Here, we developed an assay to probe ACP interactions based on leveraging the extender unit promiscuity of KirCII. The assay allows us to identify residues on the ACP surface that contribute to specific recognition by KirCII. This information proved sufficient to modify a noncognate ACP from a different biosynthetic system to be a substrate for KirCII. The findings form a foundation for further understanding the specificity of trans-AT:ACP protein interactions and for engineering modular polyketide synthases to produce analogs.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of the biosynthetic systems for fungal bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane indole alkaloids: the (+)/(-)-notoamide, paraherquamide and malbrancheamide pathways Abstract: The biosynthesis of fungal bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane indole alkaloids with a wide spectrum of biological activities have attracted increasing interest. Their intriguing mode of assembly has long been proposed to feature a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, a presumed intramolecular Diels-Alderase, a variant number of prenyltransferases, and a series of oxidases responsible for the diverse tailoring modifications of their cyclodipeptide-based structural core. Until recently, the details of these biosynthetic pathways have remained largely unknown due to lack of information on the fungal derived biosynthetic gene clusters. Herein, we report a comparative analysis of four natural product metabolic systems of a select group of bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane indole alkaloids including (+)/(-)-notoamide, paraherquamide and malbrancheamide, in which we propose an enzyme for each step in the biosynthetic pathway based on deep annotation and on-going biochemical studies.	1
Title: Draft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces niveus NCIMB 11891, Producer of the Aminocoumarin Antibiotic Novobiocin Abstract: Streptomyces niveus NCIMB 11891 is the producer of the gyrase inhibitor novobiocin, which belongs to the aminocoumarin class of antibiotics. The genome sequence of this strain was found to contain, besides the gene cluster for novobiocin, a putative gene cluster for the macrolactam antibiotic BE-14106 and further secondary metabolite gene clusters.	1
Title: Luminmycins A-C, cryptic natural products from Photorhabdus luminescens identified by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The 18 kb "silent" luminmycin biosynthetic pathway from Photorhabdus luminescens was cloned into a vector by using the newly established linear-linear homologous recombination and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. Luminmycins A-C (1-3) were isolated from the heterologous host, and their structures were elucidated using 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESIMS. Luminmycin A is a deoxy derivative of the previously reported glidobactin A, while luminmycins B and C most likely represent its acyclic biosynthetic intermediates. Compound 1 showed cytotoxicity against the human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cell line with an IC(50) value of 91.8 nM, while acyclic 2 was inactive at concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL.	1
Title: Efficient Stereoselective Carbocyclization to cis-1,4-Disubstituted Heterocycles Enabled by Dual Pd/Electron Transfer Mediator (ETM) Catalysis Abstract: An efficient Pd/ETM (ETM = electron transfer mediator)-cocatalyzed stereoselective oxidative carbocyclization of dienallenes under aerobic oxidation conditions has been developed to afford six-membered heterocycles. The use of a bifunctional cobalt complex [Co(salophen)-HQ] as hybrid ETM gave a faster aerobic oxidation than the use of separated ETMs, indicating that intramolecular electron transfer between the hydroquinone unit and the oxidized metal macrocycle occurs. In this way, a class of important cis-1,4-disubstituted six-membered heterocycles, including dihydropyran and tetrahydropyridine derivatives were obtained in high diastereoselectivity with good functional group compatibility. The experimental and computational (DFT) studies reveal that the pendent olefin does not only act as an indispensable element for the initial allene attack involving allenic C(sp3)-H bond cleavage, but it also induces a face-selective reaction of the olefin of the allylic group, leading to a highly diastereoselective formation of the product. Finally, the deuterium kinetic isotope effects measured suggest that the initial allenic C(sp3)-H bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step, which was supported by DFT calculations.	0
Title: Discovery and Heterologous Biosynthesis of the Burnettramic Acids: Rare PKS-NRPS-Derived Bolaamphiphilic Pyrrolizidinediones from an Australian Fungus, Aspergillus burnettii Abstract: The burnettramic acids are a new class of antibiotics from an Australian fungus Aspergillus burnettii. The rare bolaamphiphilic scaffold consists of β-d-mannose linked to a pyrrolizidinedione unit via a 26-carbon chain. The most abundant metabolite displayed potent in vitro antifungal activity. Comparative genomics identified the hybrid PKS-NRPS bua gene cluster, which was verified by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Aspergillus nidulans.	1
Title: Structural characterization of the heterobactin siderophores from Rhodococcus erythropolis PR4 and elucidation of their biosynthetic machinery Abstract: In this study, the isolation, the structural characterization, and the elucidation of the biosynthetic origin of heterobactins, catecholate-hydroxamate mixed-type siderophores from Rhodococcus erythropolis PR4, are reported. The structure elucidation of heterobactin A was accomplished via MS(n) analysis and NMR spectroscopy and revealed the noteworthy presence of a peptide bond between the guanidine group of an arginine residue and a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate moiety. The two heterobactin S1 and S2 variants are derivatives of heterobactin A that have sulfonation modifications on the aromatic rings. The bioinformatic analysis of the R. erythropolis PR4 genome and the subsequent genetic and biochemical characterization of the putative biosynthetic machinery identified the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the heterobactins. Interestingly, the HtbG NRPS presents an unprecedented C-PCP-A domain organization within the second module of the synthetase that may help the correct elongation of the peptide intermediate. Finally, the present work revises the structure of heterobactin A that was described by Carrano et al. in 2001.	1
Title: Discovery and Characterization of Bicereucin, an Unusual d-Amino Acid-Containing Mixed Two-Component Lantibiotic Abstract: Lantibiotics are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) exhibiting antimicrobial activity. They are characterized by the presence of the thioether-containing bisamino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Here, we report a two-component lantibiotic from Bacillus cereus SJ1 with unusual structural features that we named bicereucin. Unlike all previous two-component lantibiotics, only one of the two peptides of bicereucin contains a lanthionine. The second peptide lacks any cysteines but contains several d-amino acids. These are installed by the dehydrogenase BsjJB, the activity of which was successfully reconstituted in vitro. The proteolytic removal of the leader peptide was also performed in vitro. Bicereucin displayed synergistic antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci as well as hemolytic activity. To illustrate the utility of the enzymes, an analog of the d-amino acid containing opioid dermorphin was successfully produced in E. coli by employing the dehydratase BsjM and the dehydrogenase NpnJA.	1
Title: Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA from human fecal samples reveals stable and host-specific communities of active bacteria Abstract: The diversity of the predominant bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract was studied by using 16S rRNA-based approaches. PCR amplicons of the V6 to V8 regions of fecal 16S rRNA and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were analyzed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). TGGE of fecal 16S rDNA amplicons from 16 individuals showed different profiles, with some bands in common. Fecal samples from two individuals were monitored over time and showed remarkably stable profiles over a period of at least 6 months. TGGE profiles derived from 16S rRNA and rDNA amplicons showed similar banding patterns. However, the intensities of bands with similar mobilities differed in some cases, indicating a different contribution to the total active fraction of the prominent fecal bacteria. Most 16S rRNA amplicons in the TGGE pattern of one subject were identified by cloning and sequence analysis. Forty-five of the 78 clones matched 15 bands, and 33 clones did not match any visible band in the TGGE pattern. Nested PCR of amplified 16S rDNA indicated preferential amplification of a sequence corresponding to 12 of the 33 nonmatching clones with similar mobilities in TGGE. The sequences matching 15 bands in the TGGE pattern showed 91.5 to 98.7% homology to sequences derived from different Clostridium clusters. Most of these were related to strains derived from the human intestine. The results indicate that the combination of cloning and TGGE analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons is a reliable approach to monitoring different microbial communities in feces.	0
Title: The structure, function, and origin of the microcin H47 ATP-binding cassette exporter indicate its relatedness to that of colicin V Abstract: Microcin H47, a gene-encoded peptide antibiotic produced by a natural Escherichia coli strain, was shown to be secreted by a three-component ATP-binding cassette exporter which was revealed to be strongly related to that of colicin V. The results of sequence and gene fusion analyses, as well as heterologous complementation assays, are presented.	1
Title: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of Rifapentine and 25-Desacetyl Rifapentine Disposition in Humans Abstract: Rifapentine (RPT) is a rifamycin antimycobacterial and, as part of a combination therapy, is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Although the results from a number of studies indicate that rifapentine has the potential to shorten treatment duration and enhance completion rates compared to other rifamycin agents utilized in antituberculosis drug regimens (i.e., regimens 1 to 4), its optimal dose and exposure in humans are unknown. To help inform such an optimization, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict time course, tissue-specific concentrations of RPT and its active metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine (dRPT), in humans after specified administration schedules for RPT. Starting with the development and verification of a PBPK model for rats, the model was extrapolated and then tested using human pharmacokinetic data. Testing and verification of the models included comparisons of predictions to experimental data in several rat tissues and time course RPT and dRPT plasma concentrations in humans from several single- and repeated-dosing studies. Finally, the model was used to predict RPT concentrations in the lung during the intensive and continuation phases of a current recommended TB treatment regimen. Based on these results, it is anticipated that the PBPK model developed in this study will be useful in evaluating dosing regimens for RPT and for characterizing tissue-level doses that could be predictors of problems related to efficacy or safety.	0
Title: Multidomain structure and cellulosomal localization of the Clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase CbhA Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum F7 cbhA gene, coding for the cellobiohydrolase CbhA, has been determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 1,230 amino acids was identified. Removal of a putative signal peptide yields a mature protein of 1,203 amino acids with a molecular weight of 135,139. Sequence analysis of CbhA reveals a multidomain structure of unusual complexity consisting of an N-terminal cellulose binding domain (CBD) homologous to CBD family IV, an immunoglobulin-like beta-barrel domain, a catalytic domain homologous to cellulase family E1, a duplicated domain similar to fibronectin type III (Fn3) modules, a CBD homologous to family III, a highly acidic linker region, and a C-terminal dockerin domain. The cellulosomal localization of CbhA was confirmed by Western blot analysis employing polyclonal antibodies raised against a truncated enzymatically active version of CbhA. CbhA was identified as cellulosomal subunit S3 by partial amino acid sequence analysis. Comparison of the multidomain structures indicates striking similarities between CbhA and a group of cellulases from actinomycetes. Average linkage cluster analysis suggests a coevolution of the N-terminal CBD and the catalytic domain and its spread by horizontal gene transfer among gram-positive cellulolytic bacteria.	0
Title: PWP2, a member of the WD-repeat family of proteins, is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene involved in cell separation Abstract: WD-repeat proteins contain four to eight copies of a conserved motif that usually ends with a tryptophan-aspartate (WD) dipeptide. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PWP2 gene, identified by sequencing of chromosome III, is predicted to contain eight so-called WD-repeats, flanked by nonhomologous extensions. This gene is expressed as a 3.2-kb mRNA in all cell types and encodes a protein of 104 kDa. The PWP2 gene is essential for growth because spores carrying the pwp2 delta 1::HIS3 disruption germinate before arresting growth with one or two large buds. The growth defect of pwp2 delta 1::HIS3 cells was rescued by expression of PWP2 or epitope-tagged HA-PWP2 using the galactose-inducible GALI promoter. In the absence of galactose, depletion of Pwp2p resulted in multibudded cells with defects in bud site selection, cytokinesis, and hydrolysis of the septal junction between mother and daughter cells. In cell fractionation studies, HA-Pwp2p was localized in the particulate component of cell lysates, from which it would be solubulized by high salt and alkaline buffer but not by nonionic detergents or urea. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that HA-Pwp2p was clustered at multiple points in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Pwp2p exists in a proteinaceous complex, possibly associated with the cytoskeleton, where it functions in control of cell growth and separation.	0
Title: Genome mining unearths a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides represent a large class of metabolites with pharmaceutical relevance. Pteridines, such as pterins, folates, and flavins, are heterocyclic metabolites that often serve as redox-active cofactors. The biosynthetic machineries for construction of these distinct classes of small molecules operate independently in the cell. Here, we discovered an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in Photorhabdus luminescens using genome synteny analysis. P. luminescens is a Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes phenotypic variation and can have both pathogenic and mutualistic roles. Through extensive gene deletion, pathway-targeted molecular networking, quantitative proteomic analysis, and NMR, we show that the genetic locus affects the regulation of quorum sensing and secondary metabolic enzymes and encodes new pteridine metabolites functionalized with cis-amide acyl-side chains, termed pepteridine A (1) and B (2). The pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic phenotypic variant and represent the first reported metabolites to be synthesized by a hybrid NRPS-pteridine pathway. These studies expand our view of the combinatorial biosynthetic potential available in bacteria.	1
Title: Gene cluster conservation provides insight into cercosporin biosynthesis and extends production to the genus Colletotrichum Abstract: Species in the genus Cercospora cause economically devastating diseases in sugar beet, maize, rice, soy bean, and other major food crops. Here, we sequenced the genome of the sugar beet pathogen Cercospora beticola and found it encodes 63 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, including the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) cluster. We show that the CTB gene cluster has experienced multiple duplications and horizontal transfers across a spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, including the wide-host range Colletotrichum genus as well as the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Although cercosporin biosynthesis has been thought to rely on an eight-gene CTB cluster, our phylogenomic analysis revealed gene collinearity adjacent to the established cluster in all CTB cluster-harboring species. We demonstrate that the CTB cluster is larger than previously recognized and includes cercosporin facilitator protein, previously shown to be involved with cercosporin autoresistance, and four additional genes required for cercosporin biosynthesis, including the final pathway enzymes that install the unusual cercosporin methylenedioxy bridge. Lastly, we demonstrate production of cercosporin by Colletotrichum fioriniae, the first known cercosporin producer within this agriculturally important genus. Thus, our results provide insight into the intricate evolution and biology of a toxin critical to agriculture and broaden the production of cercosporin to another fungal genus containing many plant pathogens of important crops worldwide.	1
Title: Identification, characterization, and expression of a second, bicistronic, operon involved in the production of lactocin S in Lactobacillus sakei L45 Abstract: Through the analysis of spontaneous insertion mutants of Lactobacillus sakei L45, a second operon involved in lactocin S production was identified and characterized. The new, bicistronic unit, termed lasXY, is situated immediately upstream of the previously characterized nine-open reading frame (ORF) lactocin S operon (lasA-W) and is transcribed in the opposite direction. The proximal of the two newly identified genes, lasX, specifies a 285-residue protein that is similar to a group of proteins with reported gene regulation functions in gram-positive bacteria. It was demonstrated that the lasX mutants have a strongly reduced level of lasA and lasA-W mRNA, thus indicating the likely cause of the Bac(-) phenotype of these mutants. The second ORF in the operon, lasY, specifies a 300-residue ABC transporter homolog, the function of which is currently obscure. Transcription initiation mapping of the lasXY operon demonstrates that the two lactocin S promoters overlap such that both transcripts initiate within the -35 region of the oppositely oriented promoter. This organization of promoters is unique among this group of regulons and may constitute a modulatory site in the proposed LasX-dependent expression of lasA and downstream genes.	1
Title: A quantitative assay for assessing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription Abstract: Most mammalian cells in nature are quiescent but actively transcribing mRNA for normal physiological processes; thus, it is important to investigate how endogenous and exogenous DNA damage compromises transcription in cells. Here we describe a new competitive transcription and adduct bypass (CTAB) assay to determine the effects of DNA lesions on the fidelity and efficiency of transcription. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that the oxidatively induced lesions 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA) and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine (cdG) and the methylglyoxal-induced lesion N(2)-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CEdG) strongly inhibited transcription in vitro and in mammalian cells. In addition, cdA and cdG, but not N(2)-CEdG, induced transcriptional mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when located on the template DNA strand, all examined lesions were primarily repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells. This newly developed CTAB assay should be generally applicable for quantitatively assessing how other DNA lesions affect DNA transcription in vitro and in cells.	0
Title: Identifying the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Triacsins with an N-Hydroxytriazene Moiety Abstract: Triacsins are a family of natural products having in common an N-hydroxytriazene moiety not found in any other known secondary metabolites. Though many studies have examined the biological activity of triacsins in lipid metabolism, their biosynthesis has remained unknown. Here we report the identification of the triacsin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces aureofaciens ATCC 31442. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene cluster led to the discovery of the tacrolimus producer Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488 as a new triacsin producer. In addition to targeted gene disruption to identify necessary genes for triacsin production, stable isotope feeding was performed in vivo to advance the understanding of N-hydroxytriazene biosynthesis.	1
Title: A melanin polyketide synthase (PKS) gene from Nodulisporium sp. that shows homology to the pks1 gene of Colletotrichum lagenarium Abstract: The melanin polyketide synthase (pks) gene of Nodulisporium sp. MF5954 (ATCC74245) was cloned by exploiting its homology to the Colletotrichum lagenarium pks1 gene. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this gene is 70% identical to the C. lagenarium pks1 gene. A gene disruption construct, designed to replace both the ketoacyl synthase and acyl transferase domains with a hygromycin resistance (Hyr) gene, was synthesized, and used to disrupt the Nodulisporium melanin pks1 gene via homologous recombination, resulting in a mel(-) phenotype. Sequence analyses of the gene and of cDNA segments generated by RT-PCR indicate that there are three introns in the 5' half of the gene. The proposed 2159-amino acid product is 72% identical and 78% similar to the 2187-amino acid sequence deduced from the C. lagenarium pks1 gene. This similarity is notable, considering that C. lagenarium is a member of the order Phyllachoales or Sordariales, whereas Nodulisporium is generally believed to be member of the order Xylariales. However, despite the strong resemblance between the amino acid sequences in the acyl transferase domains of the two proteins, only one in five codons are conserved in the DNA sequences that encode this motif. The Nodulisporium sp. pks1 gene sequence and the amino acid sequence deduced from its coding region have been deposited in Genbank under Accession No. AF151533.	1
Title: Activities of ten essential oils towards Propionibacterium acnes and PC-3, A-549 and MCF-7 cancer cells Abstract: Ten essential oils, namely, mint (Mentha spicata L., Lamiaceae), ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc., Zingiberaceae), lemon (Citrus limon Burm.f., Rutaceae), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf., Rutaceae), jasmine (Jasminum grandiflora L., Oleaceae), lavender (Mill., Lamiaceae), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L., Compositae), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L., Lamiaceae), rose (Rosa damascena Mill., Rosaceae) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum N. Lauraceae) were tested for their antibacterial activities towards Propionibacterium acnes and in vitro toxicology against three human cancer cell lines. Thyme, cinnamon and rose essential oils exhibited the best antibacterial activities towards P. acnes, with inhibition diameters of 40 +/- 1.2 mm, 33.5 +/- 1.5 mm and 16.5 +/- 0.7 mm, and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.016% (v/v), 0.016% (v/v) and 0.031% (v/v), respectively. Time-kill dynamic procedures showed that thyme, cinnamon, rose, and lavender essential oils exhibited the strongest bactericidal activities at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v), and P. acnes was completely killed after 5 min. The thyme essential oil exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards three human cancer cells. Its inhibition concentration 50% (IC(50)) values on PC-3, A549 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines were 0.010% (v/v), 0.011% (v/v) and 0.030% (v/v), respectively. The cytotoxicity of 10 essential oils on human prostate carcinoma cell (PC-3) was significantly stronger than on human lung carcinoma (A549) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines.	0
Title: Isolation and mapping of plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: A purified EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragment that determines resistance to kanamycin and is incapable of self-replication was used to select autonomously replicating fragments from an EcoRI digest of a Salmonella typhimurium F' plasmid containing the chromosomal region believed to include the S. typhimurium origin of DNA replication. Both the F factor and S. typhimurium chromosome replication origins were cloned by this procedure. The EcoRI fragmentment containing the S. typhimurium origin of replication is 19.4 kilobase pairs long and includes functional asp+ and uncB+ genes. Restriction endonuclease analysis of deletions obtained from the S. typhimurium origin plasmid indicated that the replication origin (ori region) is contained within a 3.3-kilobase pair region. Comparison with Escherichia coli origin plasmids shows colinearity of gene arrangement on the chromosomes in this region and suggests that some, but not all, regions of the nucleotide sequence in the origin region may be conserved (identical) in these two bacterial species.	0
Title: Characterization of the sugar-O-methyltransferase LobS1 in lobophorin biosynthesis Abstract: Lobophorins A (1) and B (2) belong to a large group of spirotetronate natural products with potent antibacterial and antitumor activities. The cloning of the lobophorin biosynthesis gene cluster from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127 identified a sugar-O-methyltransferase-encoding gene lobS1. The lobS1 inactivation mutant accumulated two new lobophorin analogs 3 and 4, different from 1 and 2 by lacking the 4-methyl group at the terminal L-digitoxose, respectively. Biochemical experiments verified that LobS1 was a SAM-dependent sugar-O-methyltransferase that required divalent metal ions for better activity. Antibacterial assays revealed compounds 3 and 4 were generally less potent than compounds 1 and 2. These findings suggest that the methylation on the terminal digitoxose by LobS1 tailors lobophorin biosynthesis and highlights the importance of this methylation for antibacterial potence.	1
Title: Equisetin biosynthesis in Fusarium heterosporum Abstract: An iterative polyketide synthase-peptide synthetase hybrid assembles the HIV-1 integrase inhibitory tetramic acid, equisetin, in the filamentous fungus Fusarium heterosporum.	1
Title: Andrimid producers encode an acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase subunit resistant to the action of the antibiotic Abstract: Andrimid is a hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide antibiotic that blocks the carboxyl-transfer reaction of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and thereby inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis with submicromolar potency. The andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster from Pantoea agglomerans encodes an admT gene with homology to the acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase (CT) beta-subunit gene accD. Escherichia coli cells overexpressing admT showed resistance to andrimid. Co-overproduction of AdmT with E. coli CT alpha-subunit AccA allowed for the in vitro reconstitution of an active heterologous tetrameric CT A(2)T(2) complex. A subsequent andrimid-inhibition assay revealed an IC(50) of 500 nM for this hybrid A(2)T(2) in contrast to that of 12 nM for E. coli CT A(2)D(2). These results validated that AdmT is an AccD homolog that confers resistance in the andrimid producer. Mutagenesis studies guided by the x-ray crystal structure of the E. coli A(2)D(2) complex disclosed a single amino acid mutation of AdmT (L203M) responsible for 5-fold andrimid sensitivity (IC(50) = 100 nM). Complementarily, the E. coli AccD mutant M203L became 5-fold more resistant in the CT assays. This observation allowed for bioinformatic identification of several Vibrio cholerae strains in which accD genes encode the Met<-->Leu switches, and their occurrences correlate predictively with sensitivities to andrimid in vivo.	1
Title: Seeing for speaking: Semantic and lexical information provided by briefly presented, naturalistic action scenes Abstract: At the interface between scene perception and speech production, we investigated how rapidly action scenes can activate semantic and lexical information. Experiment 1 examined how complex action-scene primes, presented for 150 ms, 100 ms, or 50 ms and subsequently masked, influenced the speed with which immediately following action-picture targets are named. Prime and target actions were either identical, showed the same action with different actors and environments, or were unrelated. Relative to unrelated primes, identical and same-action primes facilitated naming the target action, even when presented for 50 ms. In Experiment 2, neutral primes assessed the direction of effects. Identical and same-action scenes induced facilitation but unrelated actions induced interference. In Experiment 3, written verbs were used as targets for naming, preceded by action primes. When target verbs denoted the prime action, clear facilitation was obtained. In contrast, interference was observed when target verbs were phonologically similar, but otherwise unrelated, to the names of prime actions. This is clear evidence for word-form activation by masked action scenes. Masked action pictures thus provide conceptual information that is detailed enough to facilitate apprehension and naming of immediately following scenes. Masked actions even activate their word-form information-as is evident when targets are words. We thus show how language production can be primed with briefly flashed masked action scenes, in answer to long-standing questions in scene processing.	0
Title: Catalytic C-H Trifluoromethoxylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Abstract: The intermolecular C-H trifluoromethoxylation of arenes remains a long-standing and unsolved problem in organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first catalytic protocol employing a novel trifluoromethoxylating reagent and redox-active catalysts for the direct (hetero)aryl C-H trifluoromethoxylation. Our approach is operationally simple, proceeds at room temperature, uses easy-to-handle reagents, requires only 0.03 mol % of redox-active catalysts, does not need specialized reaction apparatus, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups and complex structures such as sugars and natural product derivatives. Importantly, both ground-state and photoexcited redox-active catalysts are effective. Detailed computational and experimental studies suggest a unique reaction pathway where photoexcitation of the trifluoromethoxylating reagent releases the OCF3 radical that is trapped by (hetero)arenes. The resulting cyclohexadienyl radicals are oxidized by redox-active catalysts and deprotonated to form the desired products of trifluoromethoxylation.	0
Title: Valorization of cheese whey using microbial fermentations Abstract: Cheese whey (CW), the liquid resulting from the precipitation and removal of milk casein during cheese-making, and the second cheese whey (SCW) derived from the production of cottage and ricotta cheeses are the main byproducts of dairy industry. The major constituent of CW and SCW is lactose, contributing to the high BOD and COD content. Because of this, CW and SCW are high-polluting agents and their disposal is still a problem for the dairy sector. CW and SCW, however, also consist of lipids, proteins, and minerals, making them useful for production of various compounds. In this paper, microbial processes useful to promote the bioremediation of CW and SCW are discussed, and an overview on the main whey-derived products is provided. Special focus was paid to the production of health-promoting whey drinks, vinegar, and biopolymers, which may be exploited as value-added products in different segments of food and pharmaceutical industries.	0
Title: Transposition in Lactobacillus sake and its abolition of lactocin S production by insertion of IS1163, a new member of the IS3 family Abstract: This report presents the nucleotide sequence and insertional activity of IS1163, which is a new member of the IS3 family of transposable elements. Analysis of spontaneous mutants of the lactocin S-producing Lactobacillus sake strain L45 show that the bacteriocin-negative phenotype is due to either loss of the producer plasmid or the insertion of IS1163 into the lactocin S operon (las operon). The data further show that insertional inactivation of the lactocin S operon is the result of a transposition event involving a chromosomally located donor copy of IS1163. Although the insertions described are clustered within a 250-bp region of the las operon, there are no features of the insertion sites to suggest target-specific insertion of IS1163. The overlapping, frameshifted organization of the two major open reading frames found in IS1163 is typical for the IS3 family, but the structure of the putative frameshift region includes features which distinguish IS1163 from the other members of the group. The insertional activity of IS1163 in L. sake L45 has aided in identifying regions of pCIM1 essential for lactocin S production and may have further practical applications as a mutational tool in L. sake.	1
Title: Aranciamycin analogs generated by combinatorial biosynthesis show improved antitumor activity Abstract: Expression of the aranciamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü6028 resulted in production of four novel compounds, aranciamycins E, F, G, and H with different decorations in the tetracyclic backbone. Two derivatives contain a D-amicetose moiety at C7 (aranciamycins F and G), two are hydroxylated at position C1 (aranciamycins E and G), and one is hydroxylated at C13 (aranciamycin F). Analysis of the biological activities of the aranciamycins against two human tumor cell lines--MCF-7 and MATU--shows surprising impact of the hydroxyl group at position C1 on activity. As aranciamycins E and G were the most active derivatives, hydroxylation of the C1 appears to coincide with increased antitumor activity of aranciamycins.	1
Title: CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for activation of silent Streptomyces biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Here we report an efficient CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in strategy to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in streptomycetes. We applied this one-step strategy to activate multiple BGCs of different classes in five Streptomyces species and triggered the production of unique metabolites, including a novel pentangular type II polyketide in Streptomyces viridochromogenes. This potentially scalable strategy complements existing activation approaches and facilitates discovery efforts to uncover new compounds with interesting bioactivities.	0
Title: The tryptophan aminotransferase Tam1 catalyses the single biosynthetic step for tryptophan-dependent pigment synthesis in Ustilago maydis Abstract: Tryptophan is a precursor for many biologically active secondary metabolites. We have investigated the origin of indole pigments first described in the pityriasis versicolor-associated fungus Malassezia furfur. Some of the identified indole pigments have properties potentially explaining characteristics of the disease. As M. furfur is not amenable to genetic manipulation, we used Ustilago maydis to investigate the pathway leading to pigment production from tryptophan. We show by high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis that the compounds produced by U. maydis include those putatively involved in the etiology of pityriasis versicolor. Using a reverse genetics approach, we demonstrate that the tryptophan aminotransferase Tam1 catalyses pigment biosynthesis by conversion of tryptophan into indolepyruvate. A forward genetics approach led to the identification of mutants incapable of producing the pigments. These mutants were affected in the sir1 gene, presumably encoding a sulphite reductase. In vitro experiments with purified Tam1 showed that 2-oxo 4-methylthio butanoate serves as a substrate linking tryptophan deamination to sulphur metabolism. We provide the first direct evidence that these indole pigments form spontaneously from indolepyruvate and tryptophan without any enzymatic activity. This suggests that compounds with a proposed function in M. furfur-associated disease consist of indolepyruvate-derived spontaneously generated metabolic by-products.	0
Title: Genome-wide identification of Streptococcus sanguinis fitness genes in human serum and discovery of potential selective drug targets Abstract: Streptococcus sanguinis is a primary colonizer of teeth and is associated with oral health. When it enters the bloodstream, however, this bacterium may cause the serious illness infective endocarditis. The genes required for survival and proliferation in blood have not been identified. The products of these genes could provide a rich source of targets for endocarditis-specific antibiotics possessing greater efficacy for endocarditis, and also little or no activity against those bacteria that remain in the mouth. We previously created a comprehensive library of S. sanguinis mutants lacking every nonessential gene. We have now screened each member of this library for growth in human serum and discovered 178 mutants with significant abundance changes. The main biological functions disrupted in these mutants, including purine metabolism, were highlighted via network analysis. The components of an ECF-family transporter were required for growth in serum and were shown for the first time in any bacterium to be essential for endocarditis virulence. We also identified two mutants whose growth was reduced in serum but not in saliva. This strategy promises to enable selective targeting of bacteria based on their location in the body, in this instance, treating or preventing endocarditis while leaving the oral microbiome intact.	0
Title: Decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids via photoredox catalysis: a one-step conversion of biomass to drug pharmacophore Abstract: The direct decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids has been achieved via visible light-mediated photoredox catalysis. This method offers rapid entry to prevalent benzylic amine architectures from an abundant biomass, specifically α-amino acid precursors. Significant substrate scope is observed with respect to both the amino acid and arene components.	0
Title: Ras1 and Ras2 play antagonistic roles in regulating cellular cAMP level, stationary-phase entry and stress response in Candida albicans Abstract: The GTPase Ras1 activates the yeast-to-hypha transition in Candida albicans by activating cAMP synthesis. Here, we have characterized Ras2. Ras2 belongs to a group of atypical Ras proteins in some fungal species that share poor identity with other Ras GTPases with many variations in conserved motifs thought to be crucial for Ras-associated activities. We find that recombinant Ras2 is enzymatically as active as Ras1. However, only RAS1 can rescue the lethality of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ras1 ras2 mutant, suggesting functional divergence of the two genes. ras2Delta is normal in hyphal growth, but deleting RAS2 in the ras1Delta background greatly aggravates the hyphal defect, indicating that Ras2 also has a role in hyphal development. Strikingly, while RAS1 deletion causes a approximately 20-fold decrease in cellular cAMP, further deletion of RAS2 restores it to approximately 30% of the wild-type level. Consistently, while the ras1Delta mutant enters the stationary phase prematurely, the double mutant does so normally. Moreover, ras1Delta cells exhibit increased resistance to H(2)O(2) and higher sensitivity to the heavy metal Co(2+), whereas ras2Delta cells show the opposite phenotypes. Together, our data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which two antagonizing Ras GTPases balance each other in regulating multiple cellular processes in C. albicans.	0
Title: Enzymatic synthesis of dilactone scaffold of antimycins Abstract: Antimycins are a family of natural products possessing outstanding biological activities and unique structures, which have intrigued chemists for over a half century. The antimycin structural skeleton is built on a nine-membered dilactone ring containing one alkyl, one acyloxy, two methyl moieties, and an amide linkage connecting to a 3-formamidosalicylic acid. Although a biosynthetic gene cluster for antimycins was recently identified, the enzymatic logic that governs the synthesis of antimycins has not yet been revealed. In this work, the biosynthetic pathway for antimycins was dissected by both genetic and enzymatic studies for the first time. A minimum set of enzymes needed for generation of the antimycin dilactone scaffold were identified, featuring a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line containing both cis- and trans-acting components. Several antimycin analogues were further produced using in vitro enzymatic total synthesis based on the substrate promiscuity of this NRPS-PKS machinery.	1
Title: Transcriptional and translational analysis of the ccaR gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: CcaR is a positive-acting transcriptional regulator involved in cephamycin C and clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Previous sequence analyses of the ccaR gene revealed two possible start codons, an ATG, and a GTG located in-frame 18 bp downstream of the ATG. To determine the true start codon, ccaR was expressed, either from the GTG or ATG codon, in Escherichia coli. A protein product was only obtained from the ATG construct. Similarly, ccaR constructs originating from ATG or GTG and designed for expression from a glycerol-regulated promoter in Streptomyces species were prepared and used to complement a S. clavuligerus ccaR mutant. Bioassays showed that only the ATG construct could complement the ccaR mutant to restore cephamycin C production, and Western analysis confirmed the presence of CcaR in the mutant complemented with the ATG construct only. To ensure that expression of ccaR from its native promoter also initiated at the ATG rather than GTG, a conservative point mutation was introduced into ccaR, converting the GTG to GTC. The GTC construct still fully complemented a ccaR mutant, confirming that ATG is the true start codon. Inspection of the region upstream of ccaR by S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses indicated the presence of two transcript start points that mapped to residues located 74 and 173 bp upstream of the ATG codon.	1
Title: Functional characterization of the gene cluster from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 involved in synthesis of phaseolotoxin Abstract: Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola is the causal agent of halo blight disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), which is characterized by water-soaked lesions surrounded by a chlorotic halo resulting from the action of a non-host-specific toxin known as phaseolotoxin. This phytotoxin inhibits the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase involved in arginine biosynthesis. Different evidence suggested that genes involved in phaseolotoxin production were clustered. Two genes had been previously identified in our laboratory within this cluster: argK, which is involved in the immunity of the bacterium to its own toxin, and amtA, which is involved in the synthesis of homoarginine. We sequenced the region around argK and amtA in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 to determine the limits of the putative phaseolotoxin gene cluster and to determine the transcriptional pattern of the genes comprising it. We report that the phaseolotoxin cluster (Pht cluster) is composed of 23 genes and is flanked by insertion sequences and transposases. The mutation of 14 of the genes within the cluster lead to a Tox(-) phenotype for 11 of them, while three mutants exhibited low levels of toxin production. The analysis of fusions of selected DNA fragments to uidA, Northern probing, and reverse transcription-PCR indicate the presence of five transcriptional units, two monocistronic and three polycistronic; one is internal to a larger operon. The site for transcription initiation has been determined for each promoter, and the putative promoter regions were identified. Preliminary results also indicate that the gene product of phtL is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of phaseolotoxin.	1
Title: Genomics-Driven Discovery of Chlorinated Cyclic Hexapeptides Ulleungmycins A and B from a Streptomyces Species Abstract: Analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. KCB13F003 showed the presence of a cryptic gene cluster encoding flavin-dependent halogenase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Pleiotropic approaches using multiple culture media followed by LC-MS-guided isolation and spectroscopic analysis enabled the identification of two new chlorinated cyclic hexapeptides, ulleungmycins A and B (1 and 2). Their structures, including absolute configurations, were determined by 1D and 2D NMR techniques, advanced Marfey's analysis, and GITC derivatization. The new peptides, featuring unusual amino acids 5-chloro-l-tryptophan and d-homoleucine, exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria including methicillin-resistant and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	1
Title: (9βH)-Pimaranes and Derivatives from the Tuber of Icacina trichantha Abstract: New 17-nor-pimaranes (1, 2), (9βH)-pimaranes (3, 4), and 17-nor-(9βH)-pimarane (5) were isolated from the tuber of Icacina trichantha. The structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic and HRMS data. The absolute configurations of 3 and 5 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 5 possesses a unique 19,20-δ-lactone moiety. Compound 3 showed cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma cancer) cells with an IC50 value of 7.04 μM. A plausible biogenetic pathway for compounds 1-5 is proposed.	0
Title: Seasonal and spatial patterns of microbial diversity along a trophic gradient in the interconnected lakes of the Osterseen Lake District, Bavaria Abstract: The Osterseen Lake District in Bavaria consists of 19 small interconnected lakes that exhibit a pronounced trophic gradient from eutrophic to oligotrophic. It therefore presents a unique model system to address ecological questions regarding niche adaptation and Baas Becking's long standing hypothesis of "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects." Here, we present the first assessment of the microbial diversity in these lakes. We sampled the lakes in August and December and used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons to analyze the microbial diversity. The diversity patterns between lakes and seasons were compared and the bacterial community composition was correlated with key chemical and physical parameters. Distinct patterns of bacterial diversity only emerged at the level of individual OTUs (operational taxonomic units), but not at the level of the major bacterial phyla. This emphasizes the high functional and physiological diversity among bacterial species within a phylum and calls for analysis of biodiversity at the level of OTUs in order to understand fine-scale biogeography. We were able to identify a number of cosmopolitan OTUs as well as specialist OTUs that were restricted to certain lakes or seasons, suggesting adaptation to specific ecological niches.	0
Title: Phosphorylated AbsA2 negatively regulates antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor through interactions with pathway-specific regulatory gene promoters Abstract: The AbsA two-component signal transduction system, comprised of the sensor kinase AbsA1 and the response regulator AbsA2, acts as a negative regulator of antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor, for which the phosphorylated form of AbsA2 (AbsA2 approximately P) is the agent of repression. In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that AbsA2 binds the promoter regions of actII-ORF4, cdaR, and redZ, which encode pathway-specific activators for actinorhodin, calcium-dependent antibiotic, and undecylprodigiosin, respectively. We confirm that these interactions also occur in vitro and that the binding of AbsA2 to each gene is enhanced by phosphorylation. Induced expression of actII-ORF4 and redZ in the hyperrepressive absA1 mutant (C542) brought about pathway-specific restoration of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin production, respectively. Our results suggest that AbsA2 approximately P interacts with as many as four sites in the region that includes the actII-ORF4 promoter. These data suggest that AbsA2 approximately P inhibits antibiotic production by directly interfering with the expression of pathway-specific regulators of antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Identification of Thiotetronic Acid Antibiotic Biosynthetic Pathways by Target-directed Genome Mining Abstract: Recent genome sequencing efforts have led to the rapid accumulation of uncharacterized or "orphaned" secondary metabolic biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in public databases. This increase in DNA-sequenced big data has given rise to significant challenges in the applied field of natural product genome mining, including (i) how to prioritize the characterization of orphan BGCs and (ii) how to rapidly connect genes to biosynthesized small molecules. Here, we show that by correlating putative antibiotic resistance genes that encode target-modified proteins with orphan BGCs, we predict the biological function of pathway specific small molecules before they have been revealed in a process we call target-directed genome mining. By querying the pan-genome of 86 Salinispora bacterial genomes for duplicated house-keeping genes colocalized with natural product BGCs, we prioritized an orphan polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid BGC (tlm) with a putative fatty acid synthase resistance gene. We employed a new synthetic double-stranded DNA-mediated cloning strategy based on transformation-associated recombination to efficiently capture tlm and the related ttm BGCs directly from genomic DNA and to heterologously express them in Streptomyces hosts. We show the production of a group of unusual thiotetronic acid natural products, including the well-known fatty acid synthase inhibitor thiolactomycin that was first described over 30 years ago, yet never at the genetic level in regards to biosynthesis and autoresistance. This finding not only validates the target-directed genome mining strategy for the discovery of antibiotic producing gene clusters without a priori knowledge of the molecule synthesized but also paves the way for the investigation of novel enzymology involved in thiotetronic acid natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genetic and functional analyses of the lgtH gene, a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase gene family in the genus Neisseria Abstract: Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a major virulence factor of the pathogenic Neisseria. Three galactosyltransferase genes, lgtB, lgtE and lgtH, responsible for the biosynthesis of LOS oligosaccharide chains, were analysed in five Neisseria species. The function of lgtH in Neisseria meningitidis 6,275 was determined by mutagenesis and chemical characterization of the parent and mutant LOS chains. The chemical characterization included SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, hexose and mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with the parent LOS, the mutant LOS lacked galactose, and its oligosaccharide decreased by three or four sugar units in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MS analysis. The results show that lgtH encodes a beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, and that the glucose moiety linked to heptose (Hep) in the alpha chain is the acceptor site in the biosynthesis of Neisseria LOS. To understand the sequence diversity and relationships of lgtB, lgtE and lgtH, the entire lgt-1 locus was further sequenced in three N. meningitidis strains and three commensal Neisseria strains, and compared with the previously reported lgt genes from Neisseria species. Comparison of the protein sequences of the three enzymes LgtB, LgtE and LgtH showed a conserved N-terminal region, and a highly variable C-terminal region, suggesting functional constraint for substrate and acceptor specificity, respectively. The analyses of allelic variation and evolution of 23 lgtB, 12 lgtE and 14 lgtH sequences revealed a distinct evolutionary history of these genes in Neisseria. For example, the splits graph of lgtE displayed a network evolution, indicating frequent DNA recombination, whereas splits graphs of lgtB and lgtH displayed star-tree-like evolution, indicating the accumulation of point mutations. The data presented here represent examples of the evolution and variation of prokaryotic glycosyltransferase gene families. These imply the existence of multiple enzyme isoforms for biosynthesis of a great diversity of oligosaccharides in nature.	0
Title: Monitoring of the bacterial and fungal biodiversity and dynamics during Massa Medicata Fermentata fermentation Abstract: The microbial community dynamics play an important role during Massa Medicata Fermentata (MMF) fermentation. In this study, bacterial and fungal communities were investigated based on the culture-dependent method and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Meanwhile the dynamic changes of digestive enzyme activities were also examined. Plating results showed that MMF fermentation comprised two stages: pre-fermentation stage (0-4 days) was dominated by bacterial community and post-fermentation stage (5-9 days) was dominated by fungal community. The amount of bacteria reached the highest copy number 1.2 × 10(10) CFU/g at day 2, but the fungi counts reached 6.3 × 10(5) CFU/g at day 9. A total of 170 isolates were closely related to genera Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Mucor, Saccharomyces, Rhodotorula, and Amylomyces. DGGE analysis showed a clear reduction of bacterial and fungal diversity during fermentation, and the dominant microbes belonged to genera Enterobacter, Pediococcus, Pseudomonas, Mucor, and Saccharomyces. Digestive enzyme assay showed filter paper activity; the activities of amylase, carboxymethyl cellulase, and lipase reached a peak at day 4; and the protease activity constantly increased until the end of the fermentation. In this study, we carried out a detailed and comprehensive analysis of microbial communities as well as four digestive enzymes' activities during MMF fermentation process. The monitoring of bacterial and fungal biodiversity and dynamics during MMF fermentation has significant potential for controlling the fermentation process.	0
Title: A simple stereocontrolled synthesis of salinosporamide A Abstract: A simple and effective stereocontrolled synthesis of salinosporamide A has been developed. This process, the first synthesis of salinosporamide A, is capable of providing the compound in substantial quantities for further biological studies. Salinosporamide A was of special interest as a synthetic target because of its potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against many tumor cell lines (IC(50) values of 10 nM or less).	1
Title: Characterization of Two Polyketide Synthases Involved in Sorbicillinoid Biosynthesis by Acremonium chrysogenum Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System Abstract: Acremonium chrysogenum is an important fungal strain used for cephalosporin C production. Many efforts have been made to develop versatile genome-editing tools to better understand the mechanism of A. chrysogenum. Here, we developed a feasible and efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two genes responsible for the synthesis of yellow pigments (sorbicillinoids) were chosen as targets, and plasmids expressing both the Cas9 protein and single-guide RNAs were constructed. After introducing the plasmids into the protoplasts of A. chrysogenum, 83 to 93% albino mutants harboring the expected genomic alteration, on average, were obtained. We have generated two mutant strains that respectively disrupt sorA and sorB by flexible CRISPR/Cas9 system. We further confirmed that the sorbicillinoid biosynthetic gene cluster is regulated by an autoinduction mechanism. This work will lay a solid foundation for gene function research and regulation in the sorbicillinoid biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Skeletal muscle expression of the adhesion-GPCR CD97: CD97 deletion induces an abnormal structure of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum but does not impair skeletal muscle function Abstract: CD97 is a widely expressed adhesion class G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR). Here, we investigated the presence of CD97 in normal and malignant human skeletal muscle as well as the ultrastructural and functional consequences of CD97 deficiency in mice. In normal human skeletal muscle, CD97 was expressed at the peripheral sarcolemma of all myofibers, as revealed by immunostaining of tissue sections and surface labeling of single myocytes using flow cytometry. In muscle cross-sections, an intracellular polygonal, honeycomb-like CD97-staining pattern, typical for molecules located in the T-tubule or sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR), was additionally found. CD97 co-localized with SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a constituent of the longitudinal SR, but not with the receptors for dihydropyridine (DHPR) or ryanodine (RYR), located in the T-tubule and terminal SR, respectively. Intracellular expression of CD97 was higher in slow-twitch compared to most fast-twitch myofibers. In rhabdomyosarcomas, CD97 was strongly upregulated and in part more N-glycosylated compared to normal skeletal muscle. All tumors were strongly CD97-positive, independent of the underlying histological subtype, suggesting high sensitivity of CD97 for this tumor. Ultrastructural analysis of murine skeletal myofibers confirmed the location of CD97 in the SR. CD97 knock-out mice had a dilated SR, resulting in a partial increase in triad diameter yet not affecting the T-tubule, sarcomeric, and mitochondrial structure. Despite these obvious ultrastructural changes, intracellular Ca2+ release from single myofibers, force generation and fatigability of isolated soleus muscles, and wheel-running capacity of mice were not affected by the lack of CD97. We conclude that CD97 is located in the SR and at the peripheral sarcolemma of human and murine skeletal muscle, where its absence affects the structure of the SR without impairing skeletal muscle function.	0
Title: Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe thi4, a thiamine biosynthetic gene Abstract: thi4 mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe exhibit defective thiamine biosynthesis, and thi4 mutations define a gene which is believed to be involved in the phosphorylation of 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine or 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole and/or in the coupling of the two phosphorylated precursors to thiamine monophosphate (A. M. Schweingruber, J. Dlugonski, E. Edenharter, and M. E. Schweingruber, Curr. Genet. 19:249-254, 1991). The thi4 gene was cloned by functional complementation of a thi4 mutant and physically mapped on the left arm of chromosome I close to the genetic marker gln1. The thi4-carrying DNA fragment shows an open reading frame encoding a protein of 518 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 55.6 kDa. The appearance of thi4 mRNA is strongly repressed by thiamine and to a lesser extent by 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole. thi4 mRNA production is under the control of the thi1 gene-encoded transcription factor and of the negative regulators encoded by genes tnr1, tnr2, and tnr3. thi4 is expressed and regulated in manners similar to those of other S. pombe genes involved in thiamine metabolism, including thi2, thi3, and pho4.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antifungal polyketide soraphen A from Sorangium cellulosum So ce26 Abstract: A genomic DNA region of over 80 kb that contains the complete biosynthetic gene cluster for the synthesis of the antifungal polyketide metabolite soraphen A was cloned from Sorangium cellulosum So ce26. The nucleotide sequence of the soraphen A gene region, including 67,523 bp was determined. Examination of this sequence led to the identification of two adjacent type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes that encode the soraphen synthase. One of the soraphen A PKS genes includes three biosynthetic modules and the second contains five additional modules for a total of eight. The predicted substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains, as well as the reductive loop domains identified within each module, are consistent with expectations from the structure of soraphen A. Genes were identified in the regions flanking the two soraphen synthase genes that are proposed to have roles in the biosynthesis of soraphen A. Downstream of the soraphen PKS genes is an O-methyltransferase (OMT) gene. Upstream of the soraphen PKS genes there is a gene encoding a reductase and a group of genes that are postulated to have roles in the synthesis of methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP). This unusual extender unit is proposed to be incorporated in two positions of the soraphen polyketide chain. One of the genes in this group contains distinct domains for an AT, an ACP, and an OMT.	1
Title: Enzymology of Anthraquinone-γ-Pyrone Ring Formation in Complex Aromatic Polyketide Biosynthesis Abstract: Aromatic-fused γ-pyrones are structural features of many bioactive natural products and valid scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. However, the enzymology of their formation has not been completely established. Now it is demonstrated that TxnO9, a CalC-like protein belonging to a START family, functions as an unexpected anthraquinone-γ-pyrone synthase involved in the biosynthesis of antitumor antibiotic trioxacarcin A (TXN-A). Structural analysis by NMR identified a likely substrate/product-binding mode and putative key active sites of TxnO9, which allowed an enzymatic mechanism to be proposed. Moreover, a subset of uncharacterized homologous proteins bearing an unexamined Lys-Thr dyad exhibit the same function. Therefore, the functional assignment and mechanistic investigation of this γ-pyrone synthase elucidated an undescribed step in TXN-A biosynthesis, and the discovery of this new branch of polyketide heterocyclases expands the functions of the START superfamily.	1
Title: Cloning and functional analysis of the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. CS Abstract: Naphthomycins (NATs) are 29-membered naphthalenic ansamacrolactam antibiotics with antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Their biosynthesis starts from 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA). By PCR amplification with primers for AHBA synthase and amino-dehydroquinate (aDHQ) synthase, a genomic region containing orthologs of these genes was identified in Streptomyces sp. CS. It was confirmed to be involved in naphthomycin biosynthesis by deletion of a large DNA fragment, resulting in abolishment of naphthomycin production. A 106 kb region was sequenced, and 32 complete ORFs were identified, including five polyketide synthase genes, eight genes for AHBA synthesis, and putative genes for modification, regulation, transport or resistance. Targeted inactivation and complementation experiments proved that the halogenase gene nat1 is responsible for the chlorination of C-30 of NATs. The nat1 mutant could also be complemented with asm12, the halogenase gene of ansamitocin biosynthesis. Likewise, an asm12 mutant could be complemented with nat1, suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism for both halogenases. A putative hydroxylase gene, nat2, was also inactivated, whereupon the biosynthesis of NATs was completely abolished with a tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b accumulated, indicating the participation of nat2 in the formation of the naphthalene ring. The information presented here expands our understanding of the biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins, and may pave the way for engineering ansamacrolactams with improved pharmaceutical properties.	1
Title: Deletion and gene expression analyses define the paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The indole-diterpene paxilline is an abundant secondary metabolite synthesized by Penicillium paxilli. In total, 21 genes have been identified at the PAX locus of which six have been previously confirmed to have a functional role in paxilline biosynthesis. A combination of bioinformatics, gene expression and targeted gene replacement analyses were used to define the boundaries of the PAX gene cluster. Targeted gene replacement identified seven genes, paxG, paxA, paxM, paxB, paxC, paxP and paxQ that were all required for paxilline production, with one additional gene, paxD, required for regular prenylation of the indole ring post paxilline synthesis. The two putative transcription factors, PP104 and PP105, were not co-regulated with the pax genes and based on targeted gene replacement, including the double knockout, did not have a role in paxilline production. The relationship of indole dimethylallyl transferases involved in prenylation of indole-diterpenes such as paxilline or lolitrem B, can be found as two disparate clades, not supported by prenylation type (e.g., regular or reverse). This paper provides insight into the P. paxilli indole-diterpene locus and reviews the recent advances identified in paxilline biosynthesis.	1
Title: A novel mechanism of phase variation of virulence in Staphylococcus epidermidis: evidence for control of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesis by alternating insertion and excision of the insertion sequence element IS256 Abstract: Biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis on smooth polymer surfaces has been shown to be mediated by the ica operon. Upon activation of this operon, a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is synthesized that supports bacterial cell-to-cell contacts and triggers the production of thick, multilayered biofilms. Thus, the ica gene cluster represents a genetic determinant that significantly contributes to the virulence of specific Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. PIA synthesis has been reported recently to undergo a phase variation process. In this study, biofilm-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and their PIA-negative phase variants were analysed genetically to investigate the molecular mechanisms of phase variation. We have characterized biofilm-negative variants by Southern hybridization with ica-specific probes, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. The data obtained in these analyses suggested that in approximately 30% of the variants the missing biofilm formation was due to the inactivation of either the icaA or the icaC gene by the insertion of the insertion sequence element IS256. Furthermore, it was shown that the transposition of IS256 into the ica operon is a reversible process. After repeated passages of the PIA-negative insertional mutants, the biofilm-forming phenotype could be restored. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the revertants confirmed the complete excision of IS256, including the initially duplicated 8 bp target sites. These results elucidate, for the first time, a molecular mechanism mediating phase variation in staphylcocci, and they demonstrate that a naturally occurring insertion sequence element is actively involved in the modulation of expression of a Staphylococcus virulence factor.	0
Title: Gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner Gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin Abstract: Serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (SRRPs) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. Fimbriae-associated protein (Fap1) from Streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first SRRP identified; it plays an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. A gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for Fap1 biogenesis. Two glycosylation-associated proteins, Gap1 and Gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in Fap1 biogenesis. Here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to Fap1 biogenesis. The Gap1-deficient mutant rendered Gap3 unstable and degraded in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of a gene encoding protease ClpP reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that ClpP is responsible for degradation of Gap3. Molecular chaperone GroEL was co-purified with Gap3 only when Gap1 was absent and also reacted with Gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that Gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for Gap3. The N-terminal interacting domains of Gap1 mediated the Gap3 stability and Fap1 biogenesis. Gap1 homologues from Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and stabilized corresponding Gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity of the Gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of SRRPs.	0
Title: The Pax-5 gene is alternatively spliced during B-cell development Abstract: The transcription factor Pax-5 is expressed during the early stages of B-cell differentiation and influences the expression of several B-cell-specific genes. In addition to the existing isoform (Pax-5, which we have named Pax-5a), we have isolated three new isoforms, Pax-5b, Pax-5d, and Pax-5e, from murine spleen and B-lymphoid cell lines using library screenings and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Isoforms Pax-5b and Pax-5e have spliced out their second exon, resulting in proteins with only a partial DNA-binding domain. Isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e have deleted the 3'-region, which encodes the transactivating domain, and replaced it with a novel sequence. The existence of alternative Pax-5 transcripts was confirmed using RNase protection assays. Furthermore, Pax-5a and Pax-5b proteins were detected using Western blot analysis. Pax-5a was detectable in pro-, pre-, and mature B-cell lines, but not in two plasmacytomas; Pax-5b was shown to be present at low levels in mature B-cell lines and, unexpectedly, in one plasma cell line, but not in pro-B-cell or T-cell lines. Mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated Pax-5a and Pax-5d, but not Pax-5b or Pax-5e, could interact with a B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site on the blk promoter. Using this assay, we also showed that Pax-5d was present in nuclear extracts of some (but not all) B-lymphoid lines and interacts with the B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site. The pattern of differential expression of alternatively spliced Pax-5 isoforms suggests that they may be important regulators of transcription during B-cell maturation.	0
Title: Tailoring of glycopeptide scaffolds by the acyltransferases from the teicoplanin and A-40,926 biosynthetic operons Abstract: The teicoplanin acyltransferase (Atf) responsible for N-acylation of the glucosamine moiety to create the teicoplanin lipoglycopeptide scaffold has recently been identified. Here we use that enzyme (tAtf) and the cognate acyltransferase from the related A-40,926 biosynthetic cluster (aAtf) to evaluate specificity for glycopeptide scaffolds and for the acyl-CoA donor. In addition to acylation of 2-aminoglucosyl glycopeptide scaffolds with k(cat) values of 400-2000 min(-1), both Atfs transfer acyl groups to regioisomeric 6-aminoglucosyl scaffolds and to glucosyl scaffolds at rates of 0.2-0.5 min(-1) to create variant lipoglycopeptides. Using the teicoplanin glycosyltransferase tGtfA, tAtf, and GtfD, a glycosyltransferase from the vancomycin producer, it is possible to assemble a novel lipoglycopeptide with GlcNAc at beta-OH-Tyr(6) and an N(6)-acyl-glucosaminyl-vancosamine at Phegly(4). This study illustrates the utility of chemo- and regioselective acyltransferases and glycosyltransferases to create novel lipoglycopeptides.	1
Title: Structure-guided inhibitor design expands the scope of analog-sensitive kinase technology Abstract: Engineered analog-sensitive (AS) protein kinases have emerged as powerful tools for dissecting phospho-signaling pathways, for elucidating the cellular function of individual kinases, and for deciphering unanticipated effects of clinical therapeutics. A crucial and necessary feature of this technology is a bioorthogonal small molecule that is innocuous toward native cellular systems but potently inhibits the engineered kinase. In order to generalize this method, we sought a molecule capable of targeting divergent AS-kinases. Here we employ X-ray crystallography and medicinal chemistry to unravel the mechanism of current inhibitors and use these insights to design the most potent, selective, and general AS-kinase inhibitors reported to date. We use large-scale kinase inhibitor profiling to characterize the selectivity of these molecules as well as examine the consequences of potential off-target effects in chemical genetic experiments. The molecules reported here will serve as powerful tools in efforts to extend AS-kinase technology to the entire kinome and the principles discovered may help in the design of other engineered enzyme/ligand pairs.	0
Title: An Engineered Allele of afsQ1 Facilitates the Discovery and Investigation of Cryptic Natural Products Abstract: New approaches to antimicrobial discovery are needed to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. The Streptomyces genus, a proven source of antibiotics, is recognized as having a large reservoir of untapped secondary metabolic genes, many of which are likely to produce uncharacterized compounds. However, most of these compounds are currently inaccessible, as they are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. Here, we present a novel methodology for activating these "cryptic" metabolites by heterologously expressing a constitutively active pleiotropic regulator. By screening wild Streptomyces isolates, we identified the antibiotic siamycin-I, a lasso peptide that we show is active against multidrug pathogens. We further revealed that siamycin-I interferes with cell wall integrity via lipid II. This new technology has the potential to be broadly applied for use in the discovery of additional "cryptic" metabolites.	1
Title: Evidence for the involvement of human DNA polymerase N in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links Abstract: Human DNA polymerase N (PolN) is an A-family nuclear DNA polymerase whose function is unknown. This study examines the possible role of PolN in DNA repair in human cells treated with PolN-targeted siRNA. HeLa cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of PolN were more sensitive than control cells to DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC) but were not hypersensitive to UV irradiation. The MMC hypersensitivity of PolN knockdown cells was rescued by the overexpression of DNA polymerase-proficient PolN but not by DNA polymerase-deficient PolN. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that purified PolN conducts low-efficiency nonmutagenic bypass of a psoralen DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL), whose structure resembles an intermediate in the proposed pathway of ICL repair. These results suggest that PolN might play a role in translesion DNA synthesis during ICL repair in human cells.	0
Title: The Generation and Exploitation of Protein Mutability Landscapes for Enzyme Engineering Abstract: The increasing number of enzyme applications in chemical synthesis calls for new engineering methods to develop the biocatalysts of the future. An interesting concept in enzyme engineering is the generation of large-scale mutational data in order to chart protein mutability landscapes. These landscapes allow the important discrimination between beneficial mutations and those that are neutral or detrimental, thus providing detailed insight into sequence-function relationships. As such, mutability landscapes are a powerful tool with which to identify functional hotspots at any place in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme. These hotspots can be used as targets for combinatorial mutagenesis to yield superior enzymes with improved catalytic properties, stability, or even new enzymatic activities. The generation of mutability landscapes for multiple properties of one enzyme provides the exciting opportunity to select mutations that are beneficial either for one or for several of these properties. This review presents an overview of the recent advances in the construction of mutability landscapes and discusses their importance for enzyme engineering.	0
Title: Authentic heterologous expression of the tenellin iterative polyketide synthase nonribosomal peptide synthetase requires coexpression with an enoyl reductase Abstract: The tenS gene encoding tenellin synthetase (TENS), a 4239-residue polyketide synthase nonribosomal-peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) from Beauveria bassiana, was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae M-2-3. This led to the production of three new compounds, identified as acyl tetramic acids, and numerous minor metabolites. Consideration of the structures of these compounds indicates that the putative C-terminal thiolester reductase (R) domain does not act as a reductase, but appears to act as a Dieckmann cyclase (DKC). Expression of tenS in the absence of a trans-acting ER component encoded by orf3 led to errors in assembly of the polyketide component, giving clues to the mode of programming of highly reducing fungal PKS. Coexpression of tenS with orf3 from the linked gene cluster led to the production of a correctly elaborated polyketide. The NRPS adenylation domain possibly shows the first identified fungal signature sequences for tyrosine selectivity.	1
Title: Deciphering and engineering of the final step halogenase for improved chlortetracycline biosynthesis in industrial Streptomyces aureofaciens Abstract: Chlortetracycline (CTC) is an important member from antibiotics tetracycline (TC) family, which inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria and is widely involved in clinical therapy, animal feeds and aquaculture. Previous works have reported intricately the biosynthesis of CTC from the intermediates in random mutants of Streptomyces aureofaciens and the crucial chlorination remained unclear. We have developed the genetic manipulation in an industrial producer, in which about 15.0g/l CTC predominated along with 1.2g/l TC, and discovered that chlorination by ctcP (an FADH2-dependent halogenase gene) is the last inefficient step during CTC biosynthesis. Firstly, the ΔctcP strain accumulated about 18.9g/l "clean" TC without KBr addition and abolished the production of CTC. Subsequently, CtcP was identified to exhibit a substrate stereo-specificity to absolute TC (4S) rather than TC (4R), with low kcat of 0.51±0.01min(-1), while it could halogenate several TC analogs. Accordingly, we devised a strategy for overexpression of ctcP in S. aureofaciens and improved CTC production to a final titer of 25.9g/l. We anticipate that our work will provide a biotechnological potential of enzymatic evolution and strain engineering towards new TC derivatives in microorganisms.	1
Title: Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin Abstract: A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.	1
Title: Modeling of bacterial growth as a function of temperature Abstract: The temperature of chilled foods is a very important variable for microbial safety in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time.	0
Title: Iteration as programmed event during polyketide assembly; molecular analysis of the aureothin biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Analysis of the type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the rare nitroaryl polyketide metabolite aureothin (aur) from Streptomyces thioluteus HKI-227 has revealed only four modules to catalyze the five polyketide chain extensions required. By heterologous expression of the aur PKS cluster, direct evidence was obtained that these modules were sufficient to support aureothin biosynthesis. It appears that one module catalyzes two successive cycles of chain extension, one of the first examples of a PKS in which such iteration or "stuttering" is required to produce the normal polyketide product. In addition, lack of a specified loading domain implicates a novel PKS priming mechanism involving the unique p-nitrobenzoate starter unit. The 27 kb aur gene cluster also encodes a novel N-oxidase, which may represent the first member of a new family of such enzymes.	1
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the anti-MRSA Lysocins through Gene Cluster Activation Using Strong Promoters of Housekeeping Genes and Production of New Analogs in Lysobacter sp. 3655 Abstract: The Gram-negative gliding bacteria Lysobacter represent a new and rich source for bioactive natural products. In an effort to discover new antibiotics, we found a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Lysobacter sp. 3655 that shared a high similarity with the putative lysocin BGC identified in silico previously from Lysobacter sp. RH2180-5. Lysocins are cyclic lipodepsipeptides with potent activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) using a novel mode of action, but the lysocin BGC had not been experimentally verified so far. Using an activity-guided screening, we isolated the main antibiotic compound and confirmed it to be lysocin E. However, the putative lysocin BGC was barely transcribed in the wild type, in which lysocins were produced only in specific conditions and in a negligible amount. To activate the putative lysocin BGC, we screened for strongly transcribed housekeeping genes in strain 3655 and found several powerful promoters. Upon engineering the promoters into the BGC, the lysocin gene transcription was significantly enhanced and the lysocin yield was markedly increased. With readily detectable lysocins production in the engineered strains, we showed that lysocin production was abolished in the gene deletion mutant and then restored in the complementary strain, even when grown in conditions that did not support the wild type for lysocin production. Moreover, the engineered strain produced multiple new lysocin congeners. The determination of the lysocin BGC and the Lysobacter promoters will facilitate the ongoing efforts for yield improvement and new antibiotic biosynthesis using synthetic biology strategies.	1
Title: Atkamine: a new pyrroloiminoquinone scaffold from the cold water Aleutian Islands Latrunculia sponge Abstract: A new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloid, named atkamine, with an unusual scaffold was discovered from a cold, deep water Alaskan sponge Latrunculia sp. collected from the Aleutian Islands. Olefin metathesis was utilized to determine the location of the double bond in the hydrocarbon chain. The absolute configuration was determined by using computational approaches combing with the ECD (electronic circular dichroism) spectroscopy.	0
Title: The biosynthetic genes encoding for the production of the dynemicin enediyne core in Micromonospora chersina ATCC53710 Abstract: Dynemicin is a novel anthraquinone-fused member of the 10-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotic family. The development of a genetic system for the dynemicin producer Micromonospora chersina confirmed, for the first time, the requirement of the putative enediyne core biosynthetic genes (dynE8, U14 and U15) and a tailoring oxidase gene (orf23) for dynemicin production. Cloning and sequence analysis of a 76 kb of genomic sequence region containing dynE8 revealed a variety of genes conserved among known enediyne loci. Surprisingly, this fragment and flanking chromosomal DNA lacked any obvious genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the anthraquinone, suggesting that the location of genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the dynemicin enediyne core and the dynemicin anthraquinone are chromosomally distinct. The demonstrated trace production of a shunt product from mutant strain QGD23 (Deltaorf23) also sets the stage for subsequent studies to delineate the key steps in enediyne core biosynthesis and tailoring.	1
Title: Development of a Multifunctional Benzophenone Linker for Peptide Stapling and Photoaffinity Labelling Abstract: Photoaffinity labelling is a useful method for studying how proteins interact with ligands and biomolecules, and can help identify and characterise new targets for the development of new therapeutics. We present the design and synthesis of a novel multifunctional benzophenone linker that serves as both a photo-crosslinking motif and a peptide stapling reagent. Using double-click stapling, we attached the benzophenone to the peptide via the staple linker, rather than by modifying the peptide sequence with a photo-crosslinking amino acid. When applied to a p53-derived peptide, the resulting photoreactive stapled peptide was able to preferentially crosslink with MDM2 in the presence of competing protein. This multifunctional linker also features an extra alkyne handle for downstream applications such as pull-down assays, and can be used to investigate the target selectivity of stapled peptides.	0
Title: Cloning, expression, and regulation of the Pseudomonas cepacia protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes Abstract: The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) were cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment into the broad-host-range cloning vector pRO2317. The resultant clone was able to complement protocatechuate 3,4-dioxugenase mutations in P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. Expression studies showed that the genes were constitutively expressed and subject to catabolite repression in the heterologous host. Since the cloned genes exhibited normal induction patterns when present in P. cepacia DBO1, it was concluded that induction was subject to negative control. Regulatory studies with P. cepacia wild-type and mutant strains showed that protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase is induced either by protocatechuate or by beta-carboxymuconate. Further studies of P. cepacia DBO1 showed that p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2), the preceding enzyme in the pathway, is induced by p-hydroxybenzoate and that beta-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction following protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, is induced by both p-hydroxybenzoate and beta-ketoadipate.	0
Title: Modulation of type M2 pyruvate kinase activity by the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein Abstract: We report here that the E7 oncoprotein encoded by the oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 binds to the glycolytic enzyme type M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). M2-PK occurs in a tetrameric form with a high affinity to its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and a dimeric form with a low affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate, and the transition between both conformations regulates the glycolytic flux in tumor cells. The glycolytic intermediate fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate induces the reassociation of the dimeric to the tetrameric form of M2-PK. The expression of E7 in an experimental cell line shifts the equilibrium to the dimeric state despite a significant increase in the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. Investigations of HPV-16 E7 mutants and the nononcogenic HPV-11 subtype suggest that the interaction of HPV-16 E7 with M2-PK may be linked to the transforming potential of the viral oncoprotein.	0
Title: Total syntheses of indolactam alkaloids (-)-indolactam V, (-)-pendolmycin, (-)-lyngbyatoxin A, and (-)-teleocidin A-2 Abstract: We report the total syntheses of (-)-indolactam V and the C7-substituted indolactam alkaloids (-)-pendolmycin, (-)-lyngbyatoxin A, and (-)-teleocidin A-2. The strategy for preparing indolactam V relies on a distortion-controlled indolyne functionalization reaction to establish the C4-N linkage, in addition to an intramolecular conjugate addition to build the conformationally-flexible nine-membered ring. The total synthesis of indolactam V then sets the stage for the divergent synthesis of the other targeted alkaloids. Specifically, late-stage sp2-sp3 cross-couplings on an indolactam V derivative are used to introduce the key C7 substituents and the necessary quaternary carbons. These challenging couplings, in addition to other delicate manipulations, all proceed in the presence of a basic tertiary amine, an unprotected secondary amide, and an unprotected indole. Thus, our approach not only enables the enantiospecific total syntheses of four indolactam alkaloids, but also serves as a platform for probing complexity-generating and chemoselective transformations in the context of alkaloid total synthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of Polycyclic Macrolide Shuangdaolides by Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic trans-AT PKS Gene Cluster Abstract: A cryptic trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster sdl (80 kb) from Streptomyces sp. B59 was cloned and transferred into a heterologous host Streptomyces albus J1074, resulting in a class of polycyclic macrolide shuangdaolides A-D (1-4) and dumulmycin (5). Heterologous expression and gene inactivation experiments allowed the identification of two biosynthetic intermediates, 6 and 7, suggesting an unusual multidomain SDR oxidoreductase SdlR in charge of the formation of a rare 2-hydroxycyclopentenone moiety in this class of compounds.	1
Title: Tannerella forsythia strains display different cell-surface nonulosonic acids: biosynthetic pathway characterization and first insight into biological implications Abstract: Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative periodontal pathogen. A unique O-linked oligosaccharide decorates the bacterium's cell surface proteins and was shown to modulate the host immune response. In our study, we investigated the biosynthesis of the nonulosonic acid (NulO) present at the terminal position of this glycan. A bioinformatic analysis of T. forsythia genomes revealed a gene locus for the synthesis of pseudaminic acid (Pse) in the type strain ATCC 43037 while strains FDC 92A2 and UB4 possess a locus for the synthesis of legionaminic acid (Leg) instead. In contrast to the NulO in ATCC 43037, which has been previously identified as a Pse derivative (5-N-acetimidoyl-7-N-glyceroyl-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-NulO), glycan analysis of strain UB4 performed in this study indicated a 350-Da, possibly N-glycolyl Leg (3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-NulO) derivative with unknown C5,7 N-acyl moieties. We have expressed, purified and characterized enzymes of both NulO pathways to confirm these genes' functions. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), CE-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, our studies revealed that Pse biosynthesis in ATCC 43037 essentially follows the UDP-sugar route described in Helicobacter pylori, while the pathway in strain FDC 92A2 corresponds to Leg biosynthesis in Campylobacter jejuni involving GDP-sugar intermediates. To demonstrate that the NulO biosynthesis enzymes are functional in vivo, we created knockout mutants resulting in glycans lacking the respective NulO. Compared to the wild-type strains, the mutants exhibited significantly reduced biofilm formation on mucin-coated surfaces, suggestive of their involvement in host-pathogen interactions or host survival. This study contributes to understanding possible biological roles of bacterial NulOs.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of mayamycin B, a new polyketide with antibacterial activity from Streptomyces sp. 120454 Abstract: Mayamycin B, a new antibacterial type II polyketide, together with its known congener mayamycin A, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. 120454. The structure of new compound was elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed the biosynthetic gene cluster for mayamycins A and B.	1
Title: Thioholgamides: Thioamide-Containing Cytotoxic RiPP Natural Products Abstract: Thioviridamide is a structurally unique ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide that contains several thioamide bonds and is active against a number of cancer cell lines. In the search for naturally occurring thioviridamide analogs, we employed genome mining that led to the identification of several related gene clusters. Chemical screening followed by cultivation and isolation yielded thioholgamides A and B, two new additions to the thioviridamide family with several amino acid substitutions, a different N-capping moiety, and with one less thioamide bond. Thioholgamides display improved cytotoxicity in the submicromolar range against a range of cell lines and an IC50 of 30 nM for thioholgamide A against HCT-116 cells. Herein, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of thioholgamides A and B, a proposed biosynthetic cluster for their production, and their bioactivities against a larger panel of microorganisms and cancer cell lines.	1
Title: Isolation and identification of three new 5-alkenyl-3,3(2H)-furanones from two streptomyces species using a genomic screening approach Abstract: Analyses of biosynthetic gene clusters derived from Streptomyces aculeolatus NRRL 18422 and Streptomyces sp. Eco86 indicated that both microorganisms have similar type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters with relatively few genes encoding post-PKS elaborative enzymes. However both gene clusters included a sequence coding for a relatively uncommon oxidative enzyme related to Baeyer-Villiger, flavin-type monooxygenases. Screening of culture extracts for compounds with the predicted physicochemical properties of the end products from these loci, led to the isolation of three 5-alkenyl-3,3(2H)-furanones, one (E-837, 1) from the former and two (E-492, 2, E-975, 3) from the latter strain. The structures, confirmed by spectral analyses including MS, and ID and 2D NMR experiments, were in accord with those predicted by genomic analyses. Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation is postulated to be involved in the formation of the furanone moieties in these molecules. All three new compounds were tested for their electron transport inhibitory activities. They had IC50 values of 1-4 microg/ml against Ascaris suum NADH-fumarate reductase and 1-12 microg/ml against bovine heart NADH oxidase.	1
Title: The albonoursin gene Cluster of S noursei biosynthesis of diketopiperazine metabolites independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases Abstract: Albonoursin [cyclo(deltaPhe-DeltaLeu)], an antibacterial peptide produced by Streptomyces noursei, is one of the simplest representatives of the large diketopiperazine (DKP) family. Formation of alpha,beta unsaturations was previously shown to occur on cyclo(L-Phe-L-Leu), catalyzed by the cyclic dipeptide oxidase (CDO). We used CDO peptide sequence information to isolate a 3.8 kb S. noursei DNA fragment that directs albonoursin biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans. This fragment encompasses four complete genes: albA and albB, necessary for CDO activity; albC, sufficient for cyclic dipeptide precursor formation, although displaying no similarity to non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes; and albD, encoding a putative membrane protein. This first isolated DKP biosynthetic gene cluster should help to elucidate the mechanism of DKP formation, totally independent of NRPS, and to characterize novel DKP biosynthetic pathways that could be engineered to increase the molecular diversity of DKP derivatives.	1
Title: Relative morphological effects induced by cefoxitin and other beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro Abstract: Cefoxitin, a new semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic, induced filament formation at subinhibitory concentrations with a beta-lactamaseless strain of Enterobacter cloacae (HSC 18410 M66). The extent of filament induction by cefoxitin was similar to that seen with cephalothin, cefazolin, and benzylpenicillin. Filament induction by cefoxitin was markedly less than that seen with cephalexin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, cephradine, and cephapirin. Antibiotics which failed to induce filaments at any level tested included cephaloridine, cephacetrile, cephalosporin C, the cephamycins, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, A16884, A16886, and FL-1060. Those antimicrobial agents tested which lacked an aromatic substituent in the 7-position (for cephems) or in the 6-position (for penams) did not induce filaments. These observations suggest a possible relationship between filament induction of the test organism and the molecular nature of constituents in the 7- or 6-position of beta-lactams.	0
Title: Rapid Recognition and Targeted Isolation of Anti-HIV Daphnane Diterpenes from Daphne genkwa Guided by UPLC-MSn Abstract: Daphnane diterpenes with a 5/7/6-tricyclic ring system exhibit potent anti-HIV activity but are found in low abundance as plant natural products. In this study, an effective approach based on mass spectrometric fragmentation pathways was conducted to specifically recognize and isolate anti-HIV compounds of this type from Daphne genkwa. Briefly, the fragmentation pathways of reference analogues were elucidated based on characteristic ion fragments of m/z 323 → 295 → 267 or m/z 253 → 238 → 197 by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-IT-MSn) and then applied to the differentiations of substances with or without an oxygenated group at C-12. Twenty-seven daphnane diterpenes were successfully recognized from a petroleum ether extract of D. genkwa, including some potential new compounds and isomers that could not be identified accurately only from the ion fragments. Further separation of these target compounds using high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) and preparative HPLC led to the isolation of three new (11, 25, and 27) and 14 known compounds, whose structures were identified and confirmed based on MS, NMR, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. The isolates exhibited anti-HIV activities at nanomolar concentrations. The results demonstrated that this strategy is feasible and reliable to rapidly recognize and isolate daphnane diterpenes from D. genkwa.	0
Title: Characterization of Miharamycin Biosynthesis Reveals a Hybrid NRPS-PKS to Synthesize High-Carbon Sugar from a Complex Nucleoside Abstract: Miharamycins are peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique branched C9 pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2-aminopurine moiety. Inactivation of 19 genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster and identification of several unexpected intermediates suggest an alternative biosynthetic pathway, which is further supported by feeding experiments and in vitro characterization of an unusual adenylation domain recognizing a complex nucleoside derivative as the substrate. These results thereby provide an unprecedented biosynthetic route of high-carbon sugar catalyzed by atypical hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase.	1
Title: Genomic islands link secondary metabolism to functional adaptation in marine Actinobacteria Abstract: Genomic islands have been shown to harbor functional traits that differentiate ecologically distinct populations of environmental bacteria. A comparative analysis of the complete genome sequences of the marine Actinobacteria Salinispora tropica and Salinispora arenicola reveals that 75% of the species-specific genes are located in 21 genomic islands. These islands are enriched in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis providing evidence that secondary metabolism is linked to functional adaptation. Secondary metabolism accounts for 8.8% and 10.9% of the genes in the S. tropica and S. arenicola genomes, respectively, and represents the major functional category of annotated genes that differentiates the two species. Genomic islands harbor all 25 of the species-specific biosynthetic pathways, the majority of which occur in S. arenicola and may contribute to the cosmopolitan distribution of this species. Genome evolution is dominated by gene duplication and acquisition, which in the case of secondary metabolism provide immediate opportunities for the production of new bioactive products. Evidence that secondary metabolic pathways are exchanged horizontally, coupled with earlier evidence for fixation among globally distributed populations, supports a functional role and suggests that the acquisition of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters represents a previously unrecognized force driving bacterial diversification. Species-specific differences observed in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences suggest that S. arenicola may possess a higher level of phage immunity, whereas a highly duplicated family of polymorphic membrane proteins provides evidence for a new mechanism of marine adaptation in Gram-positive bacteria.	1
Title: Identification and regulation of fusA, the polyketide synthase gene responsible for fusarin production in Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Fusarins are a class of mycotoxins of the polyketide family produced by different Fusarium species, including the gibberellin-producing fungus Fusarium fujikuroi. Based on sequence comparisons between polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes for fusarin production in other Fusarium strains, we have identified the F. fujikuroi orthologue, called fusA. The participation of fusA in fusarin biosynthesis was demonstrated by targeted mutagenesis. Fusarin production is transiently stimulated by nitrogen availability in this fungus, a regulation paralleled by the fusA mRNA levels in the cell. Illumination of the cultures results in a reduction of the fusarin content, an effect partially explained by a high sensitivity of these compounds to light. Mutants of the fusA gene exhibit no external phenotypic alterations, including morphology and conidiation, except for a lack of the characteristic yellow and/or orange pigmentation of fusarins. Moreover, the fusA mutants are less efficient than the wild type at degrading cellophane on agar cultures, a trait associated with pathogenesis functions in Fusarium oxysporum. The fusA mutants, however, are not affected in their capacities to grow on plant tissues.	1
Title: Pleiotropic effects of Pasteurella multocida toxin are mediated by Gq-dependent and -independent mechanisms. involvement of Gq but not G11 Abstract: Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a highly potent mitogen for a variety of cell types. PMT has been shown to induce various cellular signaling processes, and it has been suggested to function through the heterotrimeric G-proteins G(q)/G(11). To analyze the role of G(q)/G(11) in the action of PMT, we have studied the effect of the toxin in Galpha(q)/Galpha(11) double-deficient fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts lacking only Galpha(q) or Galpha(11). Interestingly, formation of inositol phosphates in response to PMT was exclusively dependent on Galpha(q) but not on the closely related Galpha(11). Although Galpha(q)/Galpha(11) double-deficient and Galpha(q)-deficient cells did not respond with any production of inositol phosphates to PMT, PMT was still able to induce various other cellular effects in these cells, including the activation of Rho, the Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, as well as the stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These data show that PMT leads to a variety of cellular effects that are mediated only in part by the heterotrimeric G-protein G(q).	0
Title: Imaging LDL receptor oligomerization during endocytosis using a co-internalization assay Abstract: Methods to probe receptor oligomerization are useful to understand the molecular mechanisms of receptor signaling. Here we report a fluorescence imaging method to determine receptor oligomerization state in living cells during endocytic internalization. The wild-type receptor is co-expressed with an internalization-defective mutant, and the internalization kinetics of each are independently monitored. If the receptor internalizes as an oligomer, then the wild-type and mutant isoforms will mutually influence each others' trafficking properties, causing co-internalization of the mutant or co-retention of the wild-type at the cell surface. Using this approach, we found that the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor internalizes as an oligomer into cells, both in the presence and absence of LDL ligand. The internalization kinetics of the wild-type receptor are not changed by LDL binding. We also found that the oligomerization domain of the LDL receptor is located in its cytoplasmic tail.	0
Title: Genome Sequencing of Streptomyces olivaceus SCSIO T05 and Activated Production of Lobophorin CR4 via Metabolic Engineering and Genome Mining Abstract: Marine-sourced actinomycete genus Streptomyces continues to be an important source of new natural products. Here we report the complete genome sequence of deep-sea-derived Streptomyces olivaceus SCSIO T05, harboring 37 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). A cryptic BGC for type I polyketides was activated by metabolic engineering methods, enabling the discovery of a known compound, lobophorin CR4 (1). Genome mining yielded a putative lobophorin BGC (lbp) that missed the functional FAD-dependent oxidoreductase to generate the d-kijanose, leading to the production of lobophorin CR4 without the attachment of d-kijanose to C17-OH. Using the gene-disruption method, we confirmed that the lbp BGC accounts for lobophorin biosynthesis. We conclude that metabolic engineering and genome mining provide an effective approach to activate cryptic BGCs.	1
Title: Roles of Aag, Alkbh2, and Alkbh3 in the Repair of Carboxymethylated and Ethylated Thymidine Lesions Abstract: Environmental and endogenous genotoxic agents can result in a variety of alkylated and carboxymethylated DNA lesions, including N3-ethylthymidine (N3-EtdT), O(2)-EtdT, and O(4)-EtdT as well as N3-carboxymethylthymidine (N3-CMdT) and O(4)-CMdT. By using nonreplicative double-stranded vectors harboring a site-specifically incorporated DNA lesion, we assessed the potential roles of alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag); alkylation repair protein B homologue 2 (Alkbh2); or Alkbh3 in modulating the effects of N3-EtdT, O(2)-EtdT, O(4)-EtdT, N3-CMdT, or O(4)-CMdT on DNA transcription in mammalian cells. We found that the depletion of Aag did not significantly change the transcriptional inhibitory or mutagenic properties of all five examined lesions, suggesting a negligible role of Aag in the repair of these DNA adducts in mammalian cells. In addition, our results revealed that N3-EtdT, but not other lesions, could be repaired by Alkbh2 and Alkbh3 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the direct reversal of N3-EtdT by purified human Alkbh2 protein in vitro. These findings provided important new insights into the repair of the carboxymethylated and alkylated thymidine lesions in mammalian cells.	0
Title: Cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds during biosynthesis of the griseorhodin a spiroketal pharmacophore Abstract: The rubromycins, such as gamma-rubromycin, heliquinomycin, and griseorhodin A, are a family of extensively modified aromatic polyketides that inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and human telomerase. Telomerase inhibition crucially depends on the presence of a spiroketal moiety that is unique among aromatic polyketides. Biosynthetic incorporation of this pharmacophore into the rubromycins results in a dramatic distortion of the overall polyketide structure, but how this process is achieved by the cell has been obscure. To identify the enzymes involved in spiroketal construction, we generated 14 gene-deletion variants of the griseorhodin A biosynthetic gene cluster isolated from the tunicate-associated bacterium Streptomyces sp. JP95. Heterologous expression and metabolic analysis allowed for an assignment of most genes to various stages of griseorhodin tailoring and pharmacophore generation. The isolation of the novel advanced intermediate lenticulone, which exhibits cytotoxic, antibacterial, and elastase-inhibiting activity, provided direct evidence that the spiroketal is formed by cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds in a pentangular polyketide precursor. This remarkable transformation is followed by an epoxidation catalyzed by an unusual cytochrome P450/NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase pair that utilizes a saturated substrate. In addition, the absolute configuration of griseorhodin A was determined by quantum-chemical circular dichroism (CD) calculations in combination with experimental CD measurements.	1
Title: N-Carboxyanhydride Polymerization of Glycopolypeptides That Activate Antigen-Presenting Cells through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 Abstract: The C-type lectins dectin-1 and dectin-2 contribute to innate immunity against microbial pathogens by recognizing their foreign glycan structures. These receptors are promising targets for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy. However, currently available agonists are heterogeneous glycoconjugates and polysaccharides from natural sources. Herein, we designed and synthesized the first chemically defined ligands for dectin-1 and dectin-2. They comprised glycopolypeptides bearing mono-, di-, and trisaccharides and were built through polymerization of glycosylated N-carboxyanhydrides. Through this approach, we achieved glycopolypeptides with high molecular weights and low dispersities. We identified structures that elicit a pro-inflammatory response through dectin-1 or dectin-2 in antigen-presenting cells. With their native proteinaceous backbones and natural glycosidic linkages, these agonists are attractive for translational applications.	0
Title: Heterologous production of fosfomycin and identification of the minimal biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Fosfomycin is a clinically utilized, highly effective antibiotic, which is active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant pathogens. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces fradiae and heterologous production of fosfomycin in S. lividans. Sequence analysis coupled with gene deletion and disruption revealed that the minimal cluster consists of fom1-4, fomA-D. A LuxR-type activator that was apparently required for heterologous fosfomycin production was also discovered approximately 13 kb away from the cluster and was named fomR. The genes fomE and fomF, previously thought to be involved in fosfomycin biosynthesis, were shown not to be essential by gene disruption. This work provides new insights into fosfomycin biosynthesis and opens the door for fosfomycin overproduction and creation of new analogs via biomolecular pathway engineering.	1
Title: Copper-mediated reversal of defective laccase in a Deltavph1 avirulent mutant of Cryptococcus neoformans Abstract: Previous studies have shown that a Deltavph1 Cryptococcus neoformans mutant defective in vesicular acidification lacked several important virulence factors including a copper-containing laccase and was avirulent in a mouse model. In the present studies, we characterized laccase transcription and protein production to obtain insights into the mechanism of the vph1 mutation in this pathogen. Although transcription and protein expression were somewhat reduced, laccase protein was found to be successfully translated and correctly targeted to the cell wall in the Deltavph1 mutant as shown by Western blot and immuno-electron microscopy, despite a complete lack of laccase activity. Laccase activity was substantially restored in metabolically active Deltavph1 cells at 30 degrees C by addition of 100 micro M copper sulphate. This restoration by copper was found to occur through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Laccase transcriptional induction by copper was found to be dependent on enhancer region II within the 5'-untranslated region of CNLAC1. Copper was also found to restore partial activity to Deltavph1 cells at 0 degrees C, suggesting that cell wall laccase was expressed in the mutant as an apo-enzyme. Apo-laccase restoration by copper was found to be facilitated by an acidic environment, consistent with a role for the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase proton pump in copper assembly of laccase in C. neoformans.	0
Title: Intertwined Precursor Supply during Biosynthesis of the Catecholate-Hydroxamate Siderophores Qinichelins in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 Abstract: The explosive increase in genome sequencing and the advances in bioinformatic tools have revolutionized the rationale for natural product discovery from actinomycetes. In particular, this has revealed that actinomycete genomes contain numerous orphan gene clusters that have the potential to specify many yet unknown bioactive specialized metabolites, representing a huge unexploited pool of chemical diversity. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel group of catecholate-hydroxamate siderophores termed qinichelins (2-5) from Streptomyces sp. MBT76. Correlation between the metabolite levels and the protein expression profiles identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (named qch) most likely responsible for qinichelin biosynthesis. The structure of the molecules was elucidated by bioinformatics, mass spectrometry, and NMR. The genome of Streptomyces sp. MBT76 contains three gene clusters for the production of catecholate-peptide siderophores, including a separate cluster for the production of a shared catecholate precursor. In addition, an operon in the qch cluster was identified for the production of the ornithine precursor for qinichelins, independent of primary metabolism. This biosynthetic complexity provides new insights into the challenges scientists face when applying synthetic biology approaches for natural product discovery.	1

Title: Leuhistin, a new inhibitor of aminopeptidase M, produced by Bacillus laterosporus BMI156-14F1. II. Structure determination of leuhistin Abstract: Leuhistin, a new inhibitor of aminopeptidase M, has been isolated from the culture broth of Bacillus laterosporus BMI156-14F1. The structure of leuhistin was determined by NMR studies. X-Ray and chemical analysis confirmed the absolute structure to be (2R,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-2-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-5-methylhe xanoic acid.	0
Title: Structure of Hierridin C, Synthesis of Hierridins B and C, and Evidence for Prevalent Alkylresorcinol Biosynthesis in Picocyanobacteria Abstract: Small, single-celled planktonic cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in the world's oceans yet tend not to be perceived as secondary metabolite-rich organisms. Here we report the isolation and structure elucidation of hierridin C, a minor metabolite obtained from the cultured picocyanobacterium Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06113. We describe a simple, straightforward synthetic route to the scarcely produced hierridins that relies on a key regioselective halogenation step. In addition, we show that these compounds originate from a type III PKS pathway and that similar biosynthetic gene clusters are found in a variety of bacterial genomes, most notably those of the globally distributed picocyanobacteria genera Prochlorococcus, Cyanobium and Synechococcus.	1
Title: Renal Dnase1 enzyme activity and protein expression is selectively shut down in murine and human membranoproliferative lupus nephritis Abstract: Background:                       Deposition of chromatin-IgG complexes within glomerular membranes is a key event in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. We recently reported an acquired loss of renal Dnase1 expression linked to transformation from mild to severe membranoproliferative lupus nephritis in (NZBxNZW)F1 mice. As this may represent a basic mechanism in the progression of lupus nephritis, several aspects of Dnase1 expression in lupus nephritis were analyzed.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       Total nuclease activity and Dnase1 expression and activity was evaluated using in situ and in vitro analyses of kidneys and sera from (NZBxNZW)F1 mice of different ages, and from age-matched healthy controls. Immunofluorescence staining for Dnase1 was performed on kidney biopsies from (NZBxNZW)F1 mice as well as from human SLE patients and controls. Reduced serum Dnase1 activity was observed in both mesangial and end-stage lupus nephritis. A selective reduction in renal Dnase1 activity was seen in mice with massive deposition of chromatin-containing immune complexes in glomerular capillary walls. Mice with mild mesangial nephritis showed normal renal Dnase1 activity. Similar differences were seen when comparing human kidneys with severe and mild lupus nephritis. Dnase1 was diffusely expressed within the kidney in normal and mildly affected kidneys, whereas upon progression towards end-stage renal disease, Dnase1 was down-regulated in all renal compartments. This demonstrates that the changes associated with development of severe nephritis in the murine model are also relevant to human lupus nephritis.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Reduction in renal Dnase1 expression and activity is limited to mice and SLE patients with signs of membranoproliferative nephritis, and may be a critical event in the development of severe forms of lupus nephritis. Reduced Dnase1 activity reflects loss in the expression of the protein and not inhibition of enzyme activity.	0
Title: The hedamycin locus implicates a novel aromatic PKS priming mechanism Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the pluramycin-type antitumor antibiotic hedamycin has been cloned from Streptomyces griseoruber. Sequence analysis of the 45.6 kb region revealed a variety of unique features such as a fabH homolog (KSIII), an acyltransferase (AT) gene, a set of type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, and two putative C-glycosyltransferase genes. As the first report of the cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the pluramycin antibiotics, this work suggests that the biosynthesis of pluramycins utilize an iterative type I PKS system for the generation of a novel starter unit that subsequently primes the type II PKS system. It also implicates the involvement of a second catalytic ketosynthase (KSIII) to regulate this unusual priming step. Gene disruption is used to confirm the importance of both type I and II PKS genes for the biosynthesis of hedamycin.	1
Title: Potential repair of Escherichia coli DNA following exposure to UV radiation from both medium- and low-pressure UV sources used in drinking water treatment Abstract: The increased use of UV radiation as a drinking water treatment technology has instigated studies of the repair potential of microorganisms following treatment. This study challenged the repair potential of an optimally grown nonpathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli after UV radiation from low- and medium-pressure lamps. Samples were irradiated with doses of 5, 8, and 10 mJ/cm(2) from a low-pressure lamp and 3, 5, 8, and 10 mJ/cm(2) from a medium-pressure UV lamp housed in a bench-scale collimated beam apparatus. Following irradiation, samples were incubated at 37 degrees C under photoreactivating light or in the dark. Sample aliquots were analyzed for up to 4 h following incubation using a standard plate count. Results of this study showed that E. coli underwent photorepair following exposure to the low-pressure UV source, but no repair was detectable following exposure to the medium-pressure UV source at the initial doses examined. Minimal repair was eventually observed upon medium-pressure UV lamp exposure when doses were lowered to 3 mJ/cm(2). This study clearly indicates differences in repair potential under laboratory conditions between irradiation from low-pressure and medium-pressure UV sources of the type used in water treatment.	0
Title: An Untargeted Approach for Revealing Electrophilic Metabolites Abstract: Reactive electrophilic intermediates such as coenzyme A esters play central roles in metabolism but are difficult to detect with conventional strategies. Here, we introduce hydroxylamine-based stable isotope labeling to convert reactive electrophilic intermediates into stable derivatives that are easily detectable via LC-MS. In the model system Caenorhabditis elegans, parallel treatment with 14NH2OH and 15NH2OH revealed >1000 labeled metabolites, e.g., derived from peptide, fatty acid, and ascaroside pheromone biosyntheses. Results from NH2OH treatment of a pheromone biosynthesis mutant, acox-1.1, suggested upregulation of thioesterase activity, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis. The upregulated thioesterase contributes to the biosynthesis of a specific subset of ascarosides, determining the balance of dispersal and attractive signals. These results demonstrate the utility of NH2OH labeling for investigating complex biosynthetic networks. Initial results with Aspergillus and human cell lines indicate applicability toward uncovering reactive metabolomes in diverse living systems.	0
Title: Ruthenium-Catalyzed Reductive Cleavage of Unstrained Aryl-Aryl Bonds: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Study Abstract: Cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds has been found in some important industrial processes, for example, petroleum cracking, and has inspired development of numerous synthetic methods. However, nonpolar unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds remain one of the toughest bonds to be activated. As a detailed study of a fundamental reaction mode, here a full story is described about our development of a Ru-catalyzed reductive cleavage of unstrained C(aryl)-C(aryl) bonds. A wide range of biaryl compounds that contain directing groups (DGs) at 2,2' positions can serve as effective substrates. Various heterocycles, such as pyridine, quinoline, pyrimidine, and pyrazole, can be employed as DGs. Besides hydrogen gas, other reagents, such as Hantzsch ester, silanes, and alcohols, can be employed as terminal reductants. The reaction is pH neutral and free of oxidants; thus a number of functional groups are tolerated. Notably, a one-pot C-C activation/C-C coupling has been realized. Computational and experimental mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a ruthenium(II) monohydride-mediated C(aryl)-C(aryl) activation and the resting state of the catalyst is a η4-coordinated ruthenium(II) dichloride complex, which could inspire development of other transformations based on this reaction mode.	0
Title: Molecular analysis of three Aeromonas hydrophila AH-3 (serotype O34) lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis gene clusters Abstract: By the isolation of three different Aeromonas hydrophila strain AH-3 (serotype O34) mutants with an altered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) migration in gels, three genomic regions encompassing LPS core biosynthesis genes were identified and characterized. When possible, mutants were constructed using each gene from the three regions, containing seven, four, and two genes (regions 1 to 3, respectively). The mutant LPS core structures were elucidated by using mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and comparison with the full core structure of an O-antigen-lacking AH-3 mutant previously established by us. Combining the gene sequence and complementation test data with the structural data and phenotypic characterization of the mutant LPSs enabled a presumptive assignment of all LPS core biosynthesis gene functions in A. hydrophila AH-3. The three regions and the genes contained are in complete agreement with the recently sequenced genome of A. hydrophila ATCC 7966. The functions of the A. hydrophila genes waaC in region 3 and waaF in region 2 were completely established, allowing the genome annotations of the two heptosyl transferase products not previously assigned. Having the functions of all genes involved with the LPS core biosynthesis and most corresponding single-gene mutants now allows experimental work on the role of the LPS core in the virulence of A. hydrophila.	1
Title: Genotyping of Bacillus cereus strains by microarray-based resequencing Abstract: The ability to distinguish microbial pathogens from closely related but nonpathogenic strains is key to understanding the population biology of these organisms. In this regard, Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes inhalational anthrax, is of interest because it is closely related and often difficult to distinguish from other members of the B. cereus group that can cause diverse diseases. We employed custom-designed resequencing arrays (RAs) based on the genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis to generate 422 kb of genomic sequence from a panel of 41 Bacillus cereus sensu lato strains. Here we show that RAs represent a "one reaction" genotyping technology with the ability to discriminate between highly similar B. anthracis isolates and more divergent strains of the B. cereus s.l. Clade 1. Our data show that RAs can be an efficient genotyping technology for pre-screening the genetic diversity of large strain collections to selected the best candidates for whole genome sequencing.	0
Title: Identification and elimination of genomic regions irrelevant for magnetosome biosynthesis by large-scale deletion in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense Abstract: Background:                       Magnetosome formation in the alphaproteobacterium Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense is controlled by more than 30 known mam and mms genes clustered within a large genomic region, the 'magnetosome island' (MAI), which also harbors numerous mobile genetic elements, repeats, and genetic junk. Because of the inherent genetic instability of the MAI caused by neighboring gene content, the elimination of these regions and their substitution by a compact, minimal magnetosome expression cassette would be important for future analysis and engineering. In addition, the role of the MAI boundaries and adjacent regions are still unclear, and recent studies indicated that further auxiliary determinants for magnetosome biosynthesis are encoded outside the MAI. However, techniques for large-scale genome editing of magnetic bacteria are still limited, and the full complement of genes controlling magnetosome formation has remained uncertain.                  Results:                       Here we demonstrate that an allelic replacement method based on homologous recombination can be applied for large-scale genome editing in M. gryphiswaldense. By analysis of 24 deletion mutants covering about 167 kb of non-redundant genome content, we identified genes and regions inside and outside the MAI irrelevant for magnetosome biosynthesis. A contiguous stretch of ~ 100 kb, including the scattered mam and mms6 operons, could be functionally substituted by a compact and contiguous ~ 38 kb cassette comprising all essential biosynthetic gene clusters, but devoid of interspersing irrelevant or problematic gene content.                  Conclusions:                       Our results further delineate the genetic complement for magnetosome biosynthesis and will be useful for future large-scale genome editing and genetic engineering of magnetosome biosynthesis.	0
Title: Covalent targeting of remote cysteine residues to develop CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinases 12 and 13 (CDK12 and CDK13) play critical roles in the regulation of gene transcription. However, the absence of CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors has hindered the ability to investigate the consequences of their inhibition in healthy cells and cancer cells. Here we describe the rational design of a first-in-class CDK12 and CDK13 covalent inhibitor, THZ531. Co-crystallization of THZ531 with CDK12-cyclin K indicates that THZ531 irreversibly targets a cysteine located outside the kinase domain. THZ531 causes a loss of gene expression with concurrent loss of elongating and hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. In particular, THZ531 substantially decreases the expression of DNA damage response genes and key super-enhancer-associated transcription factor genes. Coincident with transcriptional perturbation, THZ531 dramatically induced apoptotic cell death. Small molecules capable of specifically targeting CDK12 and CDK13 may thus help identify cancer subtypes that are particularly dependent on their kinase activities.	0
Title: Molecular cloning and characterization of a locus responsible for O acetylation of the O polysaccharide of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 lipopolysaccharide Abstract: Complementation experiments, Tn5 mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing were used to identify a locus (lag-1) that participates in acetylation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 lipopolysaccharide. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of lipopolysaccharides from mutant and complemented strains suggest that lag-1 is responsible for O acetylation of serogroup 1 O polysaccharide.	0
Title: Five gene products are required for assembly of the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 Abstract: Coumermycin A1 is an aminocoumarin antibiotic produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis. It exhibits potent antibacterial and anticancer activity. The coumermycin A1 molecule contains two terminal 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moieties and one central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid moiety (CPM). While the biosynthesis of the terminal moieties has been elucidated in detail, the pathway leading to the CPM remains poorly understood. In this work, the minimal set of genes required for the generation of the CPM scaffold was identified. It comprises the five genes couR1, couR2a, couR2b, couR3, and couR4 which are grouped together in a contiguous 4.7 kb region within the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster. The DNA fragment containing these genes was cloned into an expression plasmid and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. Thereupon, the formation of CPM could be shown by HPLC and by HPLC-MS/MS, in comparison to an authentic CPM standard. This proves that the genes couR1-couR4 are sufficient to direct the biosynthesis of CPM, and that the adjacent genes couR5 and couR6 are not required for this pathway. The enzyme CouR3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The protein exhibited an ATPase activity similar to that reported for its close ortholog, the threonine kinase PduX. However, we could not show a threonine kinase activity of CouR3, and; therefore, the substrate of CouR3 in CPM biosynthesis is still unknown and may be different from threonine.	1
Title: Taming the Complexity of Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts: Infrared Motion Pictures of the Complete Switching Pathway Abstract: Switches that can be actively steered by external stimuli along multiple pathways at the molecular level are the basis for next-generation responsive material systems. The operation of commonly employed molecular photoswitches revolves around one key structural coordinate. Photoswitches with functionalities that depend on and can be addressed along multiple coordinates would offer novel means to tailor and control their behavior and performance. The recently developed donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are versatile switches suitable for such applications. Their photochemistry is well understood, but is only responsible for part of their overall photoswitching mechanism. The remaining thermal switching pathways are to date unknown. Here, rapid-scan infrared absorption spectroscopy is used to obtain transient fingerprints of reactions occurring on the ground state potential energy surface after reaching structures generated through light absorption. The spectroscopic data are interpreted in terms of structural transformations using kinetic modeling and quantum chemical calculations. Through this combined experimental-theoretical approach, we are able to unravel the complexity of the multidimensional ground-state potential energy surface explored by the photoswitch and use this knowledge to predict, and subsequently confirm, how DASA switches can be guided along this potential energy surface. These results break new ground for developing user-geared DASA switches but also shed light on the development of novel photoswitches in general.	0
Title: Escherichia coli allows efficient modular incorporation of newly isolated quinomycin biosynthetic enzyme into echinomycin biosynthetic pathway for rational design and synthesis of potent antibiotic unnatural natural product Abstract: Natural products display impressive activities against a wide range of targets, including viruses, microbes, and tumors. However, their clinical use is hampered frequently by their scarcity and undesirable toxicity. Not only can engineering Escherichia coli for plasmid-based pharmacophore biosynthesis offer alternative means of simple and easily scalable production of valuable yet hard-to-obtain compounds, but also carries a potential for providing a straightforward and efficient means of preparing natural product analogs. The quinomycin family of nonribosomal peptides, including echinomycin, triostin A, and SW-163s, are important secondary metabolites imparting antibiotic antitumor activity via DNA bisintercalation. Previously we have shown the production of echinomycin and triostin A in E. coli using our convenient and modular plasmid system to introduce these heterologous biosynthetic pathways into E. coli. However, we have yet to develop a novel biosynthetic pathway capable of producing bioactive unnatural natural products in E. coli. Here we report an identification of a new gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of SW-163s that involves previously unknown biosynthesis of (+)-(1S, 2S)-norcoronamic acid and generation of aliphatic side chains of various sizes via iterative methylation of an unactivated carbon center. Substituting an echinomycin biosynthetic gene with a gene from the newly identified SW-163 biosynthetic gene cluster, we were able to rationally re-engineer the plasmid-based echinomycin biosynthetic pathway for the production of a novel bioactive compound in E. coli.	1
Title: A complex multienzyme system encoded by five polyketide synthase genes is involved in the biosynthesis of the 26-membered polyene macrolide pimaricin in Streptomyces natalensis Abstract: Background:                       Polyene macrolides are a class of large macrocyclic polyketides that interact with membrane sterols, having antibiotic activity against fungi but not bacteria. Their rings include a chromophore of 3-7 conjugated double bonds which constitute the distinct polyene structure. Pimaricin is an archetype polyene, important in the food industry as a preservative to prevent mould contamination of foods, produced by Streptomyces natalensis. We set out to clone, sequence and analyse the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this tetraene.                  Results:                       A large cluster of 16 open reading frames spanning 84985 bp of the S. natalensis genome has been sequenced and found to encode 13 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules) of a polyketide synthase (PKS) distributed within five giant multienzyme proteins (PIMS0-PIMS4). The total of 60 constituent active sites, 25 of them on a single enzyme (PIMS2), make this an exceptional multienzyme system. Eleven additional genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework and export. Disruption of the genes encoding the PKS abolished pimaricin production.                  Conclusions:                       The overall architecture of the PKS gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the 26-membered polyene macrolide pimaricin has been determined. Eleven additional tailoring genes have been cloned and analysed. The availability of the PKS cluster will facilitate the generation of designer pimaricins by combinatorial biosynthesis approaches. This work represents the extensive description of a second polyene macrolide biosynthetic gene cluster after the one for the antifungal nystatin.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the structurally unique polycyclopropanated polyketide-nucleoside hybrid jawsamycin (FR-900848) Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of antifungal agent jawsamycin (FR-900848) has been identified by heterologous expression. A series of gene inactivations and in vitro and in vivo analysis of key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway established their functions. A novel mechanism involving a radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cyclopropanase collaborating with an iterative polyketide synthase is proposed for the construction of the unique polycyclopropanated backbone. Our reconstitution system sets the stage for studying the catalytic mechanism of this intriguing contiguous cyclopropanation.	1
Title: Capturing Post-Translational Modification-Triggered Protein-Protein Interactions Using Dual Noncanonical Amino Acid Mutagenesis Abstract: Reversible post-translational modification (PTM) is a powerful and ubiquitous mechanism to regulate protein function. The mechanistic basis of the associated functional regulation by PTMs often involves the recruitment of interaction partners that selectively bind the modified protein. Identifying such functionally important protein-protein interactions that are uniquely triggered by PTMs remains difficult due to several technical challenges. To address this, here we develop technology to site-specifically incorporate two distinct noncanonical amino acids into recombinant proteins: one modeling a PTM of interest and the second harboring a photoaffinity probe. Using lysine-23 acetylation of histone 3 as a model system, we show that such dual-labeled "protein probes" can covalently capture its "reader" protein.	0
Title: Methylation-dependent acyl transfer between polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules in fungal natural product biosynthesis Abstract: Biochemical studies of purified and dissected fungal polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) hybrid enzymes involved in biosynthesis of pseurotin and aspyridone indicate that one α-methylation step during polyketide synthesis is a prerequisite and a key checkpoint for chain transfer between PKS and NRPS modules. In the absence of the resulting γ-methyl feature, the completed polyketide intermediate is offloaded as an α-pyrone instead of being aminoacylated by the NRPS domain. These examples illustrate that precisely timed tailoring domain activities play critical roles in the overall programming of the iterative PKS (and NRPS) functions.	1
Title: Genes for the biosynthesis of the fungal polyketides hypothemycin from Hypomyces subiculosus and radicicol from Pochonia chlamydosporia Abstract: Gene clusters for biosynthesis of the fungal polyketides hypothemycin and radicicol from Hypomyces subiculosus and Pochonia chlamydosporia, respectively, were sequenced. Both clusters encode a reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonreducing PKS like those in the zearalenone cluster of Gibberella zeae, plus enzymes with putative post-PKS functions. Introduction of an O-methyltransferase (OMT) knockout construct into H. subiculosus resulted in a strain with increased production of 4-O-desmethylhypothemycin, but because transformation of H. subiculosus was very difficult, we opted to characterize hypothemycin biosynthesis using heterologous gene expression. In vitro, the OMT could methylate various substrates lacking a 4-O-methyl group, and the flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) could epoxidate substrates with a 1',2' double bond. The glutathione S-transferase catalyzed cis-trans isomerization of the 7',8' double bond of hypothemycin. Expression of both hypothemycin PKS genes (but neither gene alone) in yeast resulted in production of trans-7',8'-dehydrozearalenol (DHZ). Adding expression of OMT, expression of FMO, and expression of cytochrome P450 to the strain resulted in methylation, 1',2'-epoxidation, and hydroxylation of DHZ, respectively. The radicicol gene cluster encodes halogenase and cytochrome P450 homologues that are presumed to catalyze chlorination and epoxidation, respectively. Schemes for biosynthesis of hypothemycin and radicicol are proposed. The PKSs encoded by the two clusters described above and those encoded by the zearalenone cluster all synthesize different products, yet they have significant sequence identity. These PKSs may provide a useful system for probing the mechanisms of fungal PKS programming.	1
Title: 5S clavam biosynthetic genes are located in both the clavam and paralog gene clusters in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: The Streptomyces clavuligerus clavam gene cluster was examined to identify genes specifically involved in 5S clavam biosynthesis. A reduction/loss of 5S clavam production was seen in cvm2 and cvm5 gene mutants, and a clavam metabolite not previously observed, 2-carboxymethylideneclavam, accumulated in the cvm5 mutant. Disruption of additional genes from the region of the clavam cluster did not have any effect on 5S clavam production. Examination of the paralog gene cluster region for 5S clavam biosynthetic genes led to the identification of cvm6P and cvm7P, which encode a putative aminotransferase and a transcriptional regulator, respectively. Mutants defective in cvm6P and cvm7P were completely blocked in 5S clavam but not clavulanic acid production. The loss of 5S clavam production in cvm7P mutants suggests that this gene encodes a transcriptional regulator specific for 5S clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Title: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase is required for development and muscle function in Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (SERCA) loads intracellular releasable Ca(2+) stores by transporting cytosolic Ca(2+) into the endoplasmic (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We characterized the only SERCA homologue of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is encoded by the sca-1 gene. The sca-1 transcript is alternatively spliced in a similar mode as the vertebrate SERCA2 transcript, giving rise to two protein variants: CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb. These proteins showed structural and functional conservation to the vertebrate SERCA2a/b proteins. The CeSERCAs were primarily expressed in contractile tissues. Loss of CeSERCA through gene ablation or RNA interference resulted in contractile dysfunctioning and in early larval or embryonic lethality, respectively. Similar defects could be induced pharmacologically using the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, which bound CeSERCA at a conserved site. The conservation of SERCA2 homologues in C. elegans will allow genetic and chemical suppressor analyses to identify promising drug targets and lead molecules for treatment of SERCA-related diseases such as heart disease.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide ustiloxin B in Aspergillus flavus Abstract: Ustiloxin B is a secondary metabolite known to be produced by Ustilaginoidea virens. In our previous paper, we observed the production of this compound by Aspergillus flavus, and identified two A. flavus genes responsible for ustiloxin B biosynthesis (Umemura et al., 2013). The compound is a cyclic tetrapeptide of Tyr-Ala-Ile-Gly, whose tyrosine is modified with a non-protein coding amino acid, norvaline. Although its chemical structure strongly suggested that ustiloxin B is biosynthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, in the present study, we observed its synthesis through a ribosomal peptide synthetic (RiPS) pathway by precise sequence analyses after experimental validation of the cluster. The cluster possessed a gene (AFLA_094980), termed ustA, whose translated product, UstA, contains a 16-fold repeated peptide embedding a tetrapeptide, Tyr-Ala-Ile-Gly, that is converted into the cyclic moiety of ustiloxin B. This result strongly suggests that ustiloxin B is biosynthesized through a RiPS pathway and that UstA provides the precursor peptide of the compound. The present work is the first characterization of RiPS in Ascomycetes and the entire RiPS gene cluster in fungi. Based on the sequence analyses, we also proposed a biosynthetic mechanism involving the entire gene cluster. Our finding indicates the possibility that a number of unidentified RiPSs exist in Ascomycetes as the biosynthetic genes of secondary metabolites, and that the feature of a highly repeated peptide sequence in UstA will greatly contribute to the discovery of additional RiPS.	1
Title: Functional characterization of tlmK unveiling unstable carbinolamide intermediates in the tallysomycin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Tallysomycins (TLMs) belong to the bleomycin family of anticancer antibiotics. TLMs differ from bleomycins primarily by the presence of a 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-l-talose sugar attached to C-41 as part of a glycosylcarbinolamide. We previously proposed, on the basis of bioinformatics analysis of the tlm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC 31158, that the tlmK gene is responsible for the attachment of this sugar moiety. We now report that inactivation of tlmK in S. hindustanus abolished TLM A and TLM B production, the resultant DeltatlmK mutant instead accumulated five new metabolites, and introduction of a functional copy of tlmK to the DeltatlmK mutant restored TLM A and TLM B production. Two major metabolites, TLM K-1 and TLM K-2, together with three minor metabolites, TLM K-3, TLM K-4, and TLM K-5, were isolated from the DeltatlmK mutant, and their structures were elucidated. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the previous functional assignment of tlmK to encode a glycosyltransferase and unveil two carbinolamide pseudoaglycones as key intermediates in the TLM biosynthetic pathway. TlmK stabilizes the carbinolamide intermediates by glycosylating their hemiaminal hydroxyl groups, thereby protecting them from hydrolysis during TLM biosynthesis. In the absence of TlmK, the carbinolamide intermediates fragment to produce an amide TLM K-1 and aldehyde intermediates, which undergo further oxidative fragmentation to afford carboxylic acids TLM K-2, TLM K-3, TLM K-4, and TLM K-5.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the countries of the Gulf cooperation council: dominance of OXA-48 and NDM producers Abstract: The molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were determined in hospitals in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), namely, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Isolates were subjected to PCR-based detection of antibiotic-resistant genes and repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) assessments of clonality. Sixty-two isolates which screened positive for potential carbapenemase production were assessed, and 45 were found to produce carbapenemase. The most common carbapenemases were of the OXA-48 (35 isolates) and NDM (16 isolates) types; 6 isolates were found to coproduce the OXA-48 and NDM types. No KPC-type, VIM-type, or IMP-type producers were detected. Multiple clones were detected with seven clusters of clonally related Klebsiella pneumoniae. Awareness of CRE in GCC countries has important implications for controlling the spread of CRE in the Middle East and in hospitals accommodating patients transferred from the region.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the myxobacterial antibiotic corallopyronin A Abstract: Corallopyronin A is a myxobacterial compound with potent antibacterial activity. Feeding experiments with labelled precursors resulted in the deduction of all biosynthetic building blocks for corallopyronin A and revealed an unusual feature of this metabolite: its biosynthesis from two chains, one solely PKS-derived and the other NRPS/PKS-derived. The starter molecule is believed to be carbonic acid or its monomethyl ester. The putative corallopyronin A biosynthetic gene cluster is a trans-AT-type mixed PKS/NRPS gene cluster, containing a beta-branching cassette. Striking features of this gene cluster are a NRPS-like adenylation domain that is part of a PKS-type module and is believed to be responsible for glycine incorporation, as well as split modules with individual domains occurring on different genes. It is suggested that CorB is a trans-acting ketosynthase and it is proposed that it catalyses the Claisen condensation responsible for the interconnection of the two chains. Additionally, the stereochemistry of corallopyronin A was deduced by a combination of a modified Mosher's method and ozonolysis with subsequent chiral GC analyses.	1
Title: Effects of Swine manure on macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antimicrobial resistance in soils Abstract: Current agricultural practices involve inclusion of antimicrobials in animal feed and result in manure containing antimicrobials and antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. This work evaluated the effects of land application of swine manure on the levels of tetracycline, macrolide, and lincosamide antimicrobials and on macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance in field soil samples and laboratory soil batch tests. MLS(B) and tetracycline antimicrobials were quantified after solid-phase extraction using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The prevalence of the ribosomal modification responsible for MLS(B) resistance in the same samples was quantified using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Macrolide antimicrobials were not detected in soil samples, while tetracyclines were detected, suggesting that the latter compounds persist in soil. No significant differences in ribosomal methylation or presumed MLS(B) resistance were observed when amended and unamended field soils were compared, although a transient (<20-day) increase was observed in most batch tests. Clostridium cluster XIVa accounted for the largest fraction of resistant bacteria identified in amended soils. Overall, this study did not detect a persistent increase in the prevalence of MLS(B) resistance due to land application of treated swine manure.	0
Title: Two divergent Symbiodinium genomes reveal conservation of a gene cluster for sunscreen biosynthesis and recently lost genes Abstract: Background:                       The marine dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium, is a well-known photosynthetic partner for coral and other diverse, non-photosynthetic hosts in subtropical and tropical shallows, where it comprises an essential component of marine ecosystems. Using molecular phylogenetics, the genus Symbiodinium has been classified into nine major clades, A-I, and one of the reported differences among phenotypes is their capacity to synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which absorb UV radiation. However, the genetic basis for this difference in synthetic capacity is unknown. To understand genetics underlying Symbiodinium diversity, we report two draft genomes, one from clade A, presumed to have been the earliest branching clade, and the other from clade C, in the terminal branch.                  Results:                       The nuclear genome of Symbiodinium clade A (SymA) has more gene families than that of clade C, with larger numbers of organelle-related genes, including mitochondrial transcription terminal factor (mTERF) and Rubisco. While clade C (SymC) has fewer gene families, it displays specific expansions of repeat domain-containing genes, such as leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and retrovirus-related dUTPases. Interestingly, the SymA genome encodes a gene cluster for MAA biosynthesis, potentially transferred from an endosymbiotic red alga (probably of bacterial origin), while SymC has completely lost these genes.                  Conclusions:                       Our analysis demonstrates that SymC appears to have evolved by losing gene families, such as the MAA biosynthesis gene cluster. In contrast to the conservation of genes related to photosynthetic ability, the terminal clade has suffered more gene family losses than other clades, suggesting a possible adaptation to symbiosis. Overall, this study implies that Symbiodinium ecology drives acquisition and loss of gene families.	1
Title: Assessing the regioselectivity of OleD-catalyzed glycosylation with a diverse set of acceptors Abstract: To explore the acceptor regioselectivity of OleD-catalyzed glucosylation, the products of OleD-catalyzed reactions with six structurally diverse acceptors flavones- (daidzein), isoflavones (flavopiridol), stilbenes (resveratrol), indole alkaloids (10-hydroxycamptothecin), and steroids (2-methoxyestradiol)-were determined. This study highlights the first synthesis of flavopiridol and 2-methoxyestradiol glucosides and confirms the ability of OleD to glucosylate both aromatic and aliphatic nucleophiles. In all cases, molecular dynamics simulations were consistent with the determined product distribution and suggest the potential to develop a virtual screening model to identify additional OleD substrates.	0
Title: Genomic mining for Aspergillus natural products Abstract: The genus Aspergillus is renowned for its ability to produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although the propensity of biosynthetic genes to form contiguous clusters greatly facilitates assignment of putative secondary metabolite genes in the completed Aspergillus genomes, such analysis cannot predict gene expression and, ultimately, product formation. To circumvent this deficiency, we have examined Aspergillus nidulans microarrays for expressed secondary metabolite gene clusters by using the transcriptional regulator LaeA. Deletion or overexpression of laeA clearly identified numerous secondary metabolite clusters. A gene deletion in one of the clusters eliminated the production of the antitumor compound terrequinone A, a metabolite not described, from A. nidulans. In this paper, we highlight that LaeA-based genome mining helps decipher the secondary metabolome of Aspergilli and provides an unparalleled view to assess secondary metabolism gene regulation.	1
Title: Darlucins A and B, new isocyanide antibiotics from Sphaerellopsis filum (Darluca filum) Abstract: Two new xanthocillin type antibiotics, darlucin A (1) and B (2), were isolated from fermentations of Sphaerellopsis filum (Darluca filum). Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods. The darlucins are the first known compounds with a 1,2-diisocyanoalkene moiety. Both compounds exhibited antibacterial, antifungal and weak cytotoxic activities.	0
Title: Chain-shattering polymeric therapeutics with on-demand drug-release capability Abstract: Design of smart polymeric therapeutics:                       We designed and synthesized trigger-responsive chain-shattering polymeric therapeutics (CSPTs) via condensation polymerization of a UV-or hydrogen peroxide-responsive domain and a bisfunctional drug as co-monomers. CSPTs have precisely controlled molecular composition and unique chain-shattering type of drug release mechanism. Drug release kinetics can be precisely controlled by means of the trigger treatment. Chemotherapeutic-containing CSPTs showed trigger-responsive in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy.	0
Title: Osmotically regulated synthesis of the compatible solute ectoine in Bacillus pasteurii and related Bacillus spp Abstract: By using natural-abundance (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis we have investigated the types of compatible solutes that are synthesized de novo in a variety of Bacillus species under high-osmolality growth conditions. Five different patterns of compatible solute production were found among the 13 Bacillus species we studied. Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, and B. megaterium produced proline; B. cereus, B. circulans, B. thuringiensis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus synthesized glutamate; B. alcalophilus, B. psychrophilus, and B. pasteurii synthesized ectoine; and Salibacillus (formerly Bacillus) salexigens produced both ectoine and hydroxyectoine, whereas Virgibacillus (formerly Bacillus) pantothenticus synthesized both ectoine and proline. Hence, the ability to produce the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine under hyperosmotic growth conditions is widespread within the genus Bacillus and closely related taxa. To study ectoine biosynthesis within the group of Bacillus species in greater detail, we focused on B. pasteurii. We cloned and sequenced its ectoine biosynthetic genes (ectABC). The ectABC genes encode the diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase (EctA), the diaminobutyric acid aminotransferase (EctB), and the ectoine synthase (EctC). Together these proteins constitute the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, and their heterologous expression in B. subtilis led to the production of ectoine. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the ectABC genes are genetically organized as an operon whose expression is strongly enhanced when the osmolality of the growth medium is raised. Primer extension analysis allowed us to pinpoint the osmoregulated promoter of the B. pasteurii ectABC gene cluster. HPLC analysis of osmotically challenged B. pasteurii cells revealed that ectoine production within this bacterium is finely tuned and closely correlated with the osmolality of the growth medium. These observations together with the osmotic control of ectABC transcription suggest that the de novo synthesis of ectoine is an important facet in the cellular adaptation of B. pasteurii to high-osmolarity surroundings.	1
Title: Effect of point mutations at position 89 of the E. coli 5S rRNA on the assembly and activity of the large ribosomal subunit Abstract: Nucleotide residue U89 in the D loop of Escherichia coli 5S rRNA is adjacent to two domains of 23S rRNA in the large ribosomal subunit [Dokudovskaya et al., RNA 2 (1996) 146-152]. 50S ribosomal subunits were reconstituted containing U89(C, G or A) mutants of 5S rRNAs and the activities of the corresponding 70S ribosomes were studied. The U89C mutant behaves similarly to the wild-type 5S rRNA. Replacement of the pyrimidine base at position U89 by more bulky purine bases impairs the incorporation of 5S rRNA into 50S subunits, whereas the particles formed showed full activities in poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis in the presence of either U89G or U89A 5S rRNA mutants. The activity of the reconstituted particles depends on the incorporation of 5S rRNA in agreement with early observations.	0
Title: Synthesis of substituted 2-aminoimidazoles via Pd-catalyzed alkyne carboamination reactions. Application to the synthesis of preclathridine natural products Abstract: A new method for the synthesis of 2-aminoimidazole products is described. The heterocyclic products are generated in good yields via Pd-catalyzed carboamination reactions of N-propargyl guanidines and aryl triflates. This methodology generates both a C-N and C-C bond during the annulation step and facilitates the rapid construction of 2-aminoimidazole products with different aryl groups. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in the total synthesis of preclathridine A, preclathridine B, and dorimidazole B from a single intermediate.	0
Title: Targeted Discovery and Combinatorial Biosynthesis of Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam Combamides A-E Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) are a growing class of natural products with distinct structure and diverse biological activities. By promoter engineering and heterologous expression of the cryptic cbm gene cluster, four new PoTeMs, combamides A-E (1-4), were identified. Additionally, two new derivatives, combamides E (5) and F (6), were generated via combinatorial biosynthesis. Together, our findings provide a sound base for expanding the structure diversities of PoTeMs through genome mining and combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Peptidolipins B-F, antibacterial lipopeptides from an ascidian-derived Nocardia sp Abstract: A marine Nocardia sp. isolated from the ascidian Trididemnum orbiculatum was found to produce five new lipopeptides, peptidolipins B-F (1-5), which show distinct similarities to the previously reported L-Val(6) analog of peptidolipin NA. Synthetic modification of peptidolipin E (4) was used to determine the location of an olefin within the lipid chain. The advanced Marfey's method was used to determine the absolute configurations of the amino acids. Peptidolipins B (1) and E (4) demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.	0
Title: Biorecovery of cobalt and nickel using biomass-free culture supernatants from Aspergillus niger Abstract: In this research, the capabilities of culture supernatants generated by the oxalate-producing fungus Aspergillus niger for the bioprecipitation and biorecovery of cobalt and nickel were investigated, as was the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on these processes. The removal of cobalt from solution was >90% for all tested Co concentrations: maximal nickel recovery was >80%. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the formation of cobalt and nickel oxalate. In a mixture of cobalt and nickel, cobalt oxalate appeared to predominate precipitation and was dependent on the mixture ratios of the two metals. The presence of EPS together with oxalate in solution decreased the recovery of nickel but did not influence the recovery of cobalt. Concentrations of extracellular protein showed a significant decrease after precipitation while no significant difference was found for extracellular polysaccharide concentrations before and after oxalate precipitation. These results showed that extracellular protein rather than extracellular polysaccharide played a more important role in influencing the biorecovery of metal oxalates from solution. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy showed that aromatic protein-like and hydrophobic acid-like substances from the EPS complexed with cobalt but did not for nickel. The humic acid-like substances from the EPS showed a higher affinity for cobalt than for nickel.	0
Title: Dynamics of ligand binding from 13C NMR relaxation dispersion at natural abundance Abstract: We show that Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) 13Calpha NMR relaxation dispersion measurements are a viable means for profiling mus-ms ligand dynamics involved in receptor binding. Critically, the dispersion is at natural 13C abundance; this matches typical pharmaceutical research settings in which ligand isotope-labeling is often impractical. The dispersion reveals ligand 13Calpha nuclei that experience mus-ms modulation of their chemical shifts due to binding. 13Calpha shifts are dominated by local torsion angles , psi, chi1; hence, these experiments identify flexible torsion angles that may assist complex formation. Since the experiments detect the ligand, they are viable even in the absence of a receptor structure. The mus-ms dynamic information gained helps establish flexibility-activity relationships. We apply these experiments to study the binding of a phospho-peptide substrate ligand to the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1.	0
Title: Class of cyclic ribosomal peptide synthetic genes in filamentous fungi Abstract: Ustiloxins were found recently to be the first example of cyclic peptidyl secondary metabolites that are ribosomally synthesized in filamentous fungi. In this work, two function-unknown genes (ustYa/ustYb) in the gene cluster for ustiloxins from Aspergillus flavus were found experimentally to be involved in cyclization of the peptide. Their homologous genes are observed mainly in filamentous fungi and mushrooms. They have two "HXXHC" motifs that might form active sites. Computational genome analyses showed that these genes are frequently located near candidate genes for ribosomal peptide precursors, which have signal peptides at the N-termini and repeated sequences with core peptides for the cyclic portions, in the genomes of filamentous fungi, particularly Aspergilli, as observed in the ustiloxin gene cluster. Based on the combination of the ustYa/ustYb homologous genes and the nearby ribosomal peptide precursor candidate genes, 94 ribosomal peptide precursor candidates that were identified computationally from Aspergilli genome sequences were classified into more than 40 types including a wide variety of core peptide sequences. A set of the predicted ribosomal peptide biosynthetic genes was experimentally verified to synthesize a new cyclic peptide compound, designated as asperipin-2a, which comprises the amino acid sequence in the corresponding precursor gene, distinct from the ustiloxin precursors.	1
Title: Evolution-guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling Abstract: Addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug-resistant infections1. Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family2. Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter2. Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics-the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin-that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins-essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection.	1
Title: The alkene monooxygenase from Xanthobacter strain Py2 is closely related to aromatic monooxygenases and catalyzes aromatic monohydroxylation of benzene, toluene, and phenol Abstract: The genes encoding the six polypeptide components of the alkene monooxygenase from Xanthobacter strain Py2 (Xamo) have been located on a 4.9-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA previously cloned in cosmid pNY2. Sequencing and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences indicate that the components of Xamo are homologous to those of the aromatic monooxygenases, toluene 2-, 3-, and 4-monooxygenase and benzene monooxygenase, and that the gene order is identical. The genes and predicted polypeptides are aamA, encoding the 497-residue oxygenase alpha-subunit (XamoA); aamB, encoding the 88-residue oxygenase gamma-subunit (XamoB); aamC, encoding the 122-residue ferredoxin (XamoC); aamD, encoding the 101-residue coupling or effector protein (XamoD); aamE, encoding the 341-residue oxygenase beta-subunit (XamoE); and aamF, encoding the 327-residue reductase (XamoF). A sequence with >60% concurrence with the consensus sequence of sigma54 (RpoN)-dependent promoters was identified upstream of the aamA gene. Detailed comparison of XamoA with the oxygenase alpha-subunits from aromatic monooxygenases, phenol hydroxylases, methane monooxygenase, and the alkene monooxygenase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous B276 showed that, despite the overall similarity to the aromatic monooxygenases, XamoA has some distinctive characteristics of the oxygenases which oxidize aliphatic, and particularly alkene, substrates. On the basis of the similarity between Xamo and the aromatic monooxygenases, Xanthobacter strain Py2 was tested and shown to oxidize benzene, toluene, and phenol, while the alkene monooxygenase-negative mutants NZ1 and NZ2 did not. Benzene was oxidized to phenol, which accumulated transiently before being further oxidized. Toluene was oxidized to a mixture of o-, m-, and p-cresols (39.8, 18, and 41.7%, respectively) and a small amount (0.5%) of benzyl alcohol, none of which were further oxidized. In growth studies Xanthobacter strain Py2 was found to grow on phenol and catechol but not on benzene or toluene; growth on phenol required a functional alkene monooxygenase. However, there is no evidence of genes encoding steps in the metabolism of catechol in the vicinity of the aam gene cluster. This suggests that the inducer specificity of the alkene monooxygenase may have evolved to benefit from the naturally broad substrate specificity of this class of monooxygenase and the ability of the host strain to grow on catechol.	0
Title: The Siderophore Metabolome of Azotobacter vinelandii Abstract: In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of the siderophore metabolome, or "chelome," of the agriculturally important and widely studied model organism Azotobacter vinelandii. Using a new high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach, we found over 35 metal-binding secondary metabolites, indicative of a vast chelome in A. vinelandii. These include vibrioferrin, a siderophore previously observed only in marine bacteria. Quantitative analyses of siderophore production during diazotrophic growth with different sources and availabilities of Fe showed that, under all tested conditions, vibrioferrin was present at the highest concentration of all siderophores and suggested new roles for vibrioferrin in the soil environment. Bioinformatic searches confirmed the capacity for vibrioferrin production in Azotobacter spp. and other bacteria spanning multiple phyla, habitats, and lifestyles. Moreover, our studies revealed a large number of previously unreported derivatives of all known A. vinelandii siderophores and rationalized their origins based on genomic analyses, with implications for siderophore diversity and evolution. Together, these insights provide clues as to why A. vinelandii harbors multiple siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters. Coupled with the growing evidence for alternative functions of siderophores, the vast chelome in A. vinelandii may be explained by multiple, disparate evolutionary pressures that act on siderophore production.	1
Title: Installation of the pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl pharmacophore by CouN1 and CouN7 in the late biosynthetic steps of the aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 Abstract: The 5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl moiety of the aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 is the key pharmacophore for targeting the ATP-binding site of GyrB for inhibition of the bacterial type-II topoisomerase DNA gyrase. During the late stage of clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 biosynthesis, the pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl group is transferred from the peptidyl carrier proteins Clo/CouN1 to the 3'-hydroxyl of the 4-methoxy-L-noviosyl scaffold by the action of the acyltransferases Clo/CouN7. CouN1 and CouN7 have now been heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The apo form of CouN1 is converted to the acyl-holo form by loading with pyrrolyl-2-carboxyl-S-pantetheinyl moieties from synthetic pyrrolyl- and 5-methylpyrrolyl-CoAs by the action of the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. CouN7 acts as an acyltransferase, moving the pyrrole acyl moieties from CouN1 to the noviose sugar of descarbamoylnovobiocin. When the 5-methylpyrrolyl-2-carboxyl-thioester of CouN1 is the cosubstrate, the in vitro product differs from clorobiocin only in a CH3 for Cl group change on the coumarin ring. Double transfer of this acyl moiety by CouN7 to the penultimate intermediate in coumermycin A1 assembly completes that antibiotic biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Initial extracellular forms of Plasmodium falciparum: their ultrastructure and their definition with monoclonal antibodies Abstract: Merozoites of the erythrocytic stage of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, when placed under appropriate conditions in a culture medium with erythrocyte extract, differentiate into early trophic forms. These forms have much the same ultrastructure as rings of the same age that have developed intracellularly and have then been freed from their host cells by immune lysis. However, these forms differ in two respects: the extracellular forms have only their single plasma membrane, whereas the forms freed from host cells have, in addition, a surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane; the forms that develop extracellularly have fewer ribosomes. Five monoclonal antibodies against the ring stage have been prepared and characterized. Their pattern of immunofluorescence localization differs in merozoites as compared with rings, but their pattern is identical in rings developed extracellularly and those developed intracellularly. These results and the observations on fine structure demonstrate biochemical and morphological differentiation in the extracellular forms.	0
Title: HIV anti-latency treatment mediated by macromolecular prodrugs of histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and panobinostat in particular are currently in the focus of intensive investigation as latency reversing agents against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Regretfully, HDACi have dose limiting side-effects making controlled, optimized methods for delivery of panobinostat highly warranted. This has proven to be highly challenging, predominantly because panobinostat has no readily available classic sites for bioconjugation. In this work, we address this challenge and present the first macromolecular prodrugs of panobinostat engineered using self immolative linkers (SIL) and a disulfide trigger for drug release upon cell entry. Synthetic methodology involved the development of a novel monomer with functionalities of SIL and activated ester for one-step polymer-analogous conjugation to drugs. In agreement with the design set forward, copolymers were stable in buffered solutions and released panobinostat at reducing conditions. Synthesized polymers were highly efficacious as latency reversing agents as monitored in three cell lines harboring latent HIV, at no expense to the cytotoxicity of treatment. The data presented herein provide broad pre-in vivo characterization of a promising prodrug system developed to address a global healthcare challenge, safe and efficient reversal of HIV latency.	0
Title: Histone modification via rapid cleavage of C4'-oxidized abasic sites in nucleosome core particles Abstract: The C4'-oxidized abasic site is produced in DNA by a variety of oxidizing agents, including potent cytotoxic antitumor agents. Independent generation of this alkali-labile lesion at defined positions within nucleosome core particles reveals that the histone proteins increase strand scission between 130- and 550-fold. Strand scission proceeds via a Schiff base intermediate, but the DNA-protein cross-links are unstable. The oxidized abasic site is removed in its entirety from the DNA and transferred to the lysine-rich tail region of the proximal histone protein in the form of a lactam. The modification is distributed over several residues within the amino-terminal tail of the proximal histone. Transfer of DNA damage to histones could affect gene regulation.	0
Title: Overproduction of Ristomycin A by activation of a silent gene cluster in Amycolatopsis japonicum MG417-CF17 Abstract: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria within the last decades is one reason for the urgent need for new antibacterial agents. A strategy to discover new anti-infective compounds is the evaluation of the genetic capacity of secondary metabolite producers and the activation of cryptic gene clusters (genome mining). One genus known for its potential to synthesize medically important products is Amycolatopsis. However, Amycolatopsis japonicum does not produce an antibiotic under standard laboratory conditions. In contrast to most Amycolatopsis strains, A. japonicum is genetically tractable with different methods. In order to activate a possible silent glycopeptide cluster, we introduced a gene encoding the transcriptional activator of balhimycin biosynthesis, the bbr gene from Amycolatopsis balhimycina (bbrAba), into A. japonicum. This resulted in the production of an antibiotically active compound. Following whole-genome sequencing of A. japonicum, 29 cryptic gene clusters were identified by genome mining. One of these gene clusters is a putative glycopeptide biosynthesis gene cluster. Using bioinformatic tools, ristomycin (syn. ristocetin), a type III glycopeptide, which has antibacterial activity and which is used for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, was deduced as a possible product of the gene cluster. Chemical analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the in silico prediction that the recombinant A. japonicum/pRM4-bbrAba synthesizes ristomycin A.	1
Title: Complex of transfer-messenger RNA and elongation factor Tu. Unexpected modes of interaction Abstract: Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is a stable RNA in bacteria of 360 +/- 40 nucleotides that can be charged with alanine and can function as both tRNA and mRNA. Ribosomes that are stalled either in a coding region of mRNA or at the 3' end of an mRNA fragment lacking a stop codon are rescued by replacing their mRNA for tmRNA. Here we demonstrate that the interaction of tmRNA with the elongation factor Tu shows unexpected features. Deacylated tmRNA can form a complex with either EF-Tu.GDP or EF-Tu.GTP, the association constants are about one order of magnitude smaller than that of an Ala-tRNA.EF-Tu.GTP complex. tmRNA as well as Ala-tmRNA can be efficiently cross-linked with EF-Tu.GDP using a zero-length cross-link. The efficiency of cross-linking in the case of deacylated tmRNA does not depend on an intact CCA-3' end and is about the same, regardless whether protein mixtures such as the post-ribosomal supernatant (S100 enzymes) or purified EF-Tu are present. Two cross-linking sites with EF-Tu.GDP have been identified that are located outside the tRNA part of tmRNA, indicating an unusual interaction of tmRNA with EF-Tu.GDP.	0
Title: The role of cell type-specific responses in IFN-β therapy of multiple sclerosis Abstract: The mechanism of IFN-β therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is not well understood, but induction of apoptosis in specific leukocyte subsets is likely to be important. Enhanced expression of TNFSF10 or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mRNA in unseparated leukocytes has been put forward as a therapeutic response marker, but it is unclear which leukocyte subsets express TRAIL. We investigated the basis of TRAIL expression in response to IFN-β by studying activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in different leukocyte subsets of patients with RRMS. Monocytes, B cells, and T cells showed substantial differences in the activation of p38 and the STATs in response to i.m. injection of IFN-β1a or stimulation in vitro. Induction of cell-surface TRAIL, analyzed in nine leukocyte subsets, was observed only on monocytes and granulocytes and correlated with the activation of p38 and/or NF-κB in these subsets only, in agreement with previous work in fibroblasts showing that the induction of TRAIL in response to IFN-β depends on the activation of p38 and NF-κB as well as STATs 1 and 2. We propose that, in myeloid cells, the differential activation of p38 and NF-κB and induction of TRAIL, which sensitizes cells to apoptosis, can help to explain differences in responsiveness to IFN-β therapy among patients with RRMS and, furthermore, that such differential patterns of activation and expression may also be important in understanding the therapeutic responses to IFN-α/β in hepatitis and cancer.	0
Title: Regiospecific O-methylation of naphthoic acids catalyzed by NcsB1, an O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin Abstract: Neocarzinostatin, a clinical anticancer drug, is the archetypal member of the chromoprotein family of enediyne antitumor antibiotics that are composed of a nonprotein chromophore and an apoprotein. The neocarzinostatin chromophore consists of a nine-membered enediyne core, a deoxyaminosugar, and a naphthoic acid moiety. We have previously cloned and sequenced the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed that the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety and its incorporation into the neocarzinostatin chromophore are catalyzed by five enzymes NcsB, NcsB1, NcsB2, NcsB3, and NcsB4. Here we report the biochemical characterization of NcsB1, unveiling that: (i) NcsB1 is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase; (ii) NcsB1 catalyzes regiospecific methylation at the 7-hydroxy group of its native substrate, 2,7-dihydroxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoic acid; (iii) NcsB1 also recognizes other dihydroxynaphthoic acids as substrates and catalyzes regiospecific O-methylation; and (iv) the carboxylate and its ortho-hydroxy groups of the substrate appear to be crucial for NcsB1 substrate recognition and binding, and O-methylation takes place only at the free hydroxy group of these dihydroxynaphthoic acids. These findings establish that NcsB1 catalyzes the third step in the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety of the neocarzinostatin chromophore and further support the early proposal for the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid and its incorporation into the neocarzinostatin chromophore with free naphthoic acids serving as intermediates. NcsB1 represents another opportunity that can now be exploited to produce novel neocarzinostatin analogs by engineering neocarzinostatin biosynthesis or applying directed biosynthesis strategies.	1
Title: Benzo pyrene-induced DNA adducts and gene expression profiles in target and non-target organs for carcinogenesis in mice Abstract: Background:                       Gene expression changes induced by carcinogens may identify differences in molecular function between target and non-target organs. Target organs for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) carcinogenicity in mice (lung, spleen and forestomach) and three non-target organs (liver, colon and glandular stomach) were investigated for DNA adducts by 32P-postlabelling, for gene expression changes by cDNA microarray and for miRNA expression changes by miRNA microarray after exposure of animals to BaP.                  Results:                       BaP-DNA adduct formation occurred in all six organs at levels that did not distinguish between target and non-target. cDNA microarray analysis showed a variety of genes modulated significantly by BaP in the six organs and the overall gene expression patterns were tissue specific. Gene ontology analysis also revealed that BaP-induced bioactivities were tissue specific; eight genes (Tubb5, Fos, Cdh1, Cyp1a1, Apc, Myc, Ctnnb1 and Cav) showed significant expression difference between three target and three non-target organs. Additionally, several gene expression changes, such as in Trp53 activation and Stat3 activity suggested some similarities in molecular mechanisms in two target organs (lung and spleen), which were not found in the other four organs. Changes in miRNA expression were generally tissue specific, involving, in total, 21/54 miRNAs significantly up- or down-regulated.                  Conclusions:                       Altogether, these findings showed that DNA adduct levels and early gene expression changes did not fully distinguish target from non-target organs. However, mechanisms related to early changes in p53, Stat3 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways may play roles in defining BaP organotropism.	0
Title: Photoluminescence quenching of dye molecules near a resonant silicon nanoparticle Abstract: Luminescent molecules attached to resonant colloidal particles are an important tool to study light-matter interaction. A traditional approach to enhance the photoluminescence intensity of the luminescent molecules in such conjugates is to incorporate spacer-coated plasmonic nanoantennas, where the spacer prevents intense non-radiative decay of the luminescent molecules. Here, we explore the capabilities of an alternative platform for photoluminescence enhancement, which is based on low-loss Mie-resonant colloidal silicon particles. We demonstrate that resonant silicon particles of spherical shape are more efficient for photoluminescence enhancement than their plasmonic counterparts in spacer-free configuration. Our theoretical calculations show that significant enhancement originates from larger quantum yields supported by silicon particles and their resonant features. Our results prove the potential of high-index dielectric particles for spacer-free enhancement of photoluminescence, which potentially could be a future platform for bioimaging and nanolasers.	0
Title: Purinyl-cobamide is a native prosthetic group of reductive dehalogenases Abstract: Cobamides such as vitamin B12 are structurally conserved, cobalt-containing tetrapyrrole biomolecules that have essential biochemical functions in all domains of life. In organohalide respiration, a vital biological process for the global cycling of natural and anthropogenic organohalogens, cobamides are the requisite prosthetic groups for carbon-halogen bond-cleaving reductive dehalogenases. This study reports the biosynthesis of a new cobamide with unsubstituted purine as the lower base and assigns unsubstituted purine a biological function by demonstrating that Coα-purinyl-cobamide (purinyl-Cba) is the native prosthetic group in catalytically active tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenases of Desulfitobacterium hafniense. Cobamides featuring different lower bases are not functionally equivalent, and purinyl-Cba elicits different physiological responses in corrinoid-auxotrophic, organohalide-respiring bacteria. Given that cobamide-dependent enzymes catalyze key steps in essential metabolic pathways, the discovery of a novel cobamide structure and the realization that lower bases can effectively modulate enzyme activities generate opportunities to manipulate functionalities of microbiomes.	0
Title: Live-cell fluorescence imaging reveals dynamic production and loss of bacterial flagella Abstract: Bacterial flagella are nanomachines that drive bacteria motility and taxis in response to environmental changes. Whether flagella are permanent cell structures and, if not, the circumstances and timing of their production and loss during the bacterial life cycle remain poorly understood. Here we used the single polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus as our model and implementing in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB) in a population varies substantially across different growth phases. In the early-exponential phase, the PFB increases rapidly through the widespread production of flagella. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaks at around 76% and the partitioning of flagella between the daughter cells are 1:1 and strictly at the old poles. After entering the stationary phase, the PFB starts to decline, mainly because daughter cells stop making new flagella after cell division. Interestingly, we observed that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, though cell division has long been suspended. Further experimental investigations confirmed that flagella were ejected in V. alginolyticus, starting from breakage in the rod. Our results highlight the dynamic production and loss of flagella during the bacterial life cycle. IMPORTANCE: Flagella motility is critical for many bacterial species. The bacterial flagellum is made up of about 20 different types of proteins in its final structure and can be self-assembled. The current understanding of the lifetime and durability of bacterial flagella is very limited. In the present study, we monitored Vibrio alginolyticus flagellar assembly and loss by in vivo fluorescence labeling, and found that the percentage of flagellated bacteria varies substantially across different growth phases. The production of flagella was synchronized with cell growth but stopped when cells entered the stationary phase. Surprisingly, we observed that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, as well as in the low glucose buffering medium. We then confirmed the ejection of flagella in V. alginolyticus started with breakage of the rod. Our results highlight the dynamic production and loss of flagella during the bacterial life cycle.	0
Title: Genome-Based Identification of a Plant-Associated Marine Bacterium as a Rich Natural Product Source Abstract: The large number of sequenced bacterial genomes provides the opportunity to bioinformatically identify rich natural product sources among previously neglected microbial groups. Testing this discovery strategy, unusually high biosynthetic potential was suggested for the Oceanospirillales member Gynuella sunshinyii, a Gram-negative marine bacterium from the rhizosphere of the halophilic plant Carex scabrifolia. Its genome contains numerous unusual biosynthetic gene clusters for diverse types of metabolites. Genome-guided isolation yielded representatives of four different natural product classes, of which only alteramide A was known. Cytotoxic lacunalides were identified as products of a giant trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase gene cluster, one of six present in this strain. Cytological profiling against HeLa cells suggested that lacunalide A disrupts CDK signaling in the cell cycle. In addition, chemical studies on model compounds were conducted, suggesting the structurally unusual ergoynes as products of a conjugated diyne-thiourea cyclization reaction.	1
Title: Noninvasive photoacoustic microscopy of living cells in two and three dimensions through enhancement by a metabolite dye Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is a powerful imaging modality that can generate high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) images non-invasively. However, most types of cells cannot be imaged and quantified by PAM due to the lack of an absorption-based contrast mechanism. Here we demonstrate that this problem could be solved by employing 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT formazan), a cellular metabolite of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), as the contrast agent. The as-formed MTT formazan crystals inside the cells have a strong absorption in the spectral region of 500-700 nm, and are generally nontoxic. It could serve as a superb contrast agent for PAM in imaging various types of cells cultured on two-dimensional (2D) substrates and in 3D porous scaffolds. This contrast mechanism is general, and can be applied to essentially all types of metabolically active cells including stem cells and tumor cells, which would be very useful for a number of biological and biomedical applications.	0
Title: Heterologous expression and functional analysis of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1 Abstract: Nukacin ISK-1 is a lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1. The gene cluster of nukacin ISK-1 consists of at least nukAMTFEG, ORF1 and ORF7. In this study, we demonstrated the heterologous production of nukacin ISK-1 in Lactococcus lactis by the artificial polycistronic expression of nukAMTFEG-ORF7 under the control of the nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system. Consequently, the recombinant L. lactis showed antimicrobial activity. Mass analysis clarified the presence of nukacin ISK-1 produced in the culture supernatant. These results suggested that the recombinant L. lactis produced nukacin ISK-1 heterologously. Inactivation of nukA, -M or -T resulted in the complete loss of the nukacin ISK-1 production phenotype. This finding suggested that nukAMT are indispensably associated with the biosynthesis of nukacin ISK-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the heterologous production of lantibiotic using the NICE system.	1
Title: In vivo evidence for a prodrug activation mechanism during colibactin maturation Abstract: Releasing the cytopath: We have identified an N-myristoyl-D-asparagine (1) as the free N-terminal prodrug scaffold in cytopathogenic Escherichia coli strains expressing the colibactin gene cluster. Colibactin is released in vivo upon cleavage of precolibactin. We provide for the first time in vivo evidence of the prodrug-like release mechanism of colibactin.	1
Title: Catalyst-free and site-specific one-pot dual-labeling of a protein directed by two genetically incorporated noncanonical amino acids Abstract: The genetic incorporation of one azide-containing and one keto-containing noncanonical amino acids into a protein at one amber and one ochre mutation sites respectively followed by their orthogonal reactions with one hydroxylamine-containing and one cyclooctyne-containing dyes allows highly efficient one-pot site-specific dual labeling of the protein in a catalyst-free fashion.	0
Title: Coordination of export and glycosylation of landomycins in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 Abstract: In Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 gene cluster for biosynthesis of polyglycosylated angucycline landomycin A (LaA), a divergently oriented gene pair for a TetR-family regulator (lanK) and an efflux protein (lanJ) is located, whose functions remained obscure. Overexpression and disruption studies showed that lanK and lanJ genes control LaA resistance. Also, a constitutive lanK overexpression led to predominant accumulation of LaA precursors bearing shorter glycoside chains. These data as well as the results of in vitro and in vivo assays of LanK activity are consistent with the idea that LanK represses lanJ and some downstream genes involved in conversion of landomycin D (a disaccharide LaA precursor) into LaA. LaA and some of its precursors accumulate in the producing cell and relieve repression by LanK, thus amplifying the biosynthesis and export of landomycins with long glycoside chains. Therefore, the main biological role of LanK appears to be the inhibition of premature extrusion of early LaA precursors from the cells, which in turn creates the optimal conditions for accumulation of LaA as the major landomycin in S. cyanogenus S136.	1
Title: Prevention of Serpin Misfolding by RNA Aptamers Abstract: Owing to their structural flexibility, most serpins inhibit the cognate proteases in a fast and specific manner and also are susceptible to pathogenic misfolding. In this issue of Cell Chemical Biology, Madsen et al.

Title: Patterns of yeast diversity distribution and its drivers in rhizosphere soil of Hami melon orchards in different regions of Xinjiang Abstract: Background:                       The unique climatic conditions of the Xinjiang region nurture rich melon and fruit resources, the melon and fruit sugar sources provide sufficient nutrients for the survival of yeast, and the diverse habitats accompanied by extreme climatic conditions promote the production of yeast diversity and strain resources. However, the relationship between yeast species and their relationship with environmental factors in the soil of Xinjiang specialty cash crop Hami melon is not clear. Here, we aimed to characterize the diversity, community structure, and relationship between yeast species and environmental factors in Hami melon orchards soils in different regions of Xinjiang, China.                  Results:                       Based on Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing analysis of the D1 domain of the LSU rRNA genes, the community richness of yeast in the soil of Northern Xinjiang was higher than in the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang, but the community diversity was significantly lower in the Northern Xinjiang than in the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang. A total of 86 OTUs were classified into 59 genera and 86 species. Most OTUs (90.4%) belonged to the Basidiomycota; only a few (9.6%) belonged to Ascomycota. The most dominant species in the Southern, Eastern and Northern Xinjiang were Filobasidium magnum (17.90%), Solicoccozyma aeria (35.83%) and Filobasidium magnum (75.36%), respectively. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the yeast community composition in the soils of the three regions were obviously different, with the Southern and Eastern Xinjiang having more similar yeast community. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil factors such as conductivity (CO), total phosphorus (TP) and Total potassium (TK) and climate factors such as average annual precipitation (PRCP), relative humidity (RH) and net solar radiation intensity (SWGNT) were significantly correlated with yeast communities (P < 0.05).                  Conclusion:                       There are abundant yeast resources in the rhizosphere soil of Hami melon orchard in Xinjiang, and there are obvious differences in the diversity and community structure of yeast in the three regions of Xinjiang. Differences in climatic factors related to precipitation, humidity and solar radiation intensity and soil factors related to conductivity, total phosphorus and total potassium are key factors driving yeast diversity and community structure.	0
Title: Resolving discrepancy between nucleotides and amino acids in deep-level arthropod phylogenomics: differentiating serine codons in 21-amino-acid models Abstract: Background:                       In a previous study of higher-level arthropod phylogeny, analyses of nucleotide sequences from 62 protein-coding nuclear genes for 80 panarthopod species yielded significantly higher bootstrap support for selected nodes than did amino acids. This study investigates the cause of that discrepancy.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       The hypothesis is tested that failure to distinguish the serine residues encoded by two disjunct clusters of codons (TCN, AGY) in amino acid analyses leads to this discrepancy. In one test, the two clusters of serine codons (Ser1, Ser2) are conceptually translated as separate amino acids. Analysis of the resulting 21-amino-acid data matrix shows striking increases in bootstrap support, in some cases matching that in nucleotide analyses. In a second approach, nucleotide and 20-amino-acid data sets are artificially altered through targeted deletions, modifications, and replacements, revealing the pivotal contributions of distinct Ser1 and Ser2 codons. We confirm that previous methods of coding nonsynonymous nucleotide change are robust and computationally efficient by introducing two new degeneracy coding methods. We demonstrate for degeneracy coding that neither compositional heterogeneity at the level of nucleotides nor codon usage bias between Ser1 and Ser2 clusters of codons (or their separately coded amino acids) is a major source of non-phylogenetic signal.                  Conclusions:                       The incongruity in support between amino-acid and nucleotide analyses of the forementioned arthropod data set is resolved by showing that "standard" 20-amino-acid analyses yield lower node support specifically when serine provides crucial signal. Separate coding of Ser1 and Ser2 residues yields support commensurate with that found by degenerated nucleotides, without introducing phylogenetic artifacts. While exclusion of all serine data leads to reduced support for serine-sensitive nodes, these nodes are still recovered in the ML topology, indicating that the enhanced signal from Ser1 and Ser2 is not qualitatively different from that of the other amino acids.	0
Title: Real-time imaging of Rab5 activity using a prequenched biosensor Abstract: A key regulator of receptor-mediated endocytosis, Rab5, plays a pivotal role in cargo receptor internalization, endosomal maturation, and transduction and degradation of internalized signaling molecules and recycling cargo receptor. Stressful conditions within cells lead to increased Rab5 activation, and increasing evidence correlates Rab5 activity abnormalities with certain diseases. Current antibody-based imaging methods cannot distinguish active Rab5 from total Rab5 population and provide dynamic information on magnitude and duration of Rab5 activation in cellular events and pathogenesis. We report here novel molecular imaging probes that specifically target GTP-bound Rab5 associated with the early endosome membrane in live cells and fixed mouse brain tissues. Our Rab5 activity fluorescent biosensor (RAFB) contains the Rab5 binding domain of the Rab5 effector Rabaptin 5, a fluorophore (a quantum dot or fluorescent dye) and a cell-penetrating peptide for live-cell delivery. The quantum dot conjugated RAFB was able to image the elevated Rab5 activity in both the cortex and hippocampi tissues of a Ts65Dn mouse. A prequenched RAFB based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can image cytosolic active Rab5 in single live cells. This novel method should enable imaging of the biological process in which Rab5 activity is regulated in various cellular systems.	0
Title: Characterization of a partial duplication of the aflatoxin gene cluster in Aspergillus parasiticus ATCC 56775 Abstract: A partial duplication of the complete aflatoxin gene cluster containing homologues of aflR-aflJ-adhA-estA-norA-ver1and omtB was identified from Aspergillus parasiticus ATCC 56775. The genes, verA-avnA-verB-avfA, between ver1 and omtB in the complete gene cluster, however, were not found. One-hybrid assays showed that the duplicated aflRgene ( aflR2) encoded a protein that could activate transcription just as that encoded by aflR1,the aflR gene in the complete gene cluster. Two-hybrid assays showed that AFLR2 also interacted with a putative coactivator, AFLJ1, at comparable levels to AFLR1. Deletion of aflR1 resulted in the loss of production of aflatoxin precursors, which suggested that aflR2could not completely replace the function of aflR1. Point mutations found in adhA2, pre-termination in ver1B and norA2,and a large deletion in omtB2 probably render these duplicated genes to become nonfunctional. A close examination of the history of isolates reported to have a partial duplication suggested that duplication of the aflatoxin cluster is not a prevalent event.	1
Title: Characterization of the mupirocin biosynthesis gene cluster from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 Abstract: The polyketide antibiotic mupirocin (pseudomonic acid) produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 competitively inhibits bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthase and is useful in controlling Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The 74 kb mupirocin biosynthesis cluster has been sequenced, and putative enzymatic functions of many of the open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified. The mupirocin cluster is a combination of six larger ORFs (mmpA-F), containing several domains resembling the multifunctional proteins of polyketide synthase and fatty acid synthase type I systems, and individual genes (mupA-X and macpA-E), some of which show similarity to type II systems (mupB, mupD, mupG, and mupS). Gene knockout experiments demonstrated the importance of regions in mupirocin production, and complementation of the disrupted gene confirmed that the phenotypes were not due to polar effects. A model for mupirocin biosynthesis is presented based on the sequence and biochemical evidence.	1
Title: Characterization of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene cluster of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Abstract: Ten genes (plt) required for the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, an antifungal compound composed of a bichlorinated pyrrole linked to a resorcinol moiety, were identified within a 24-kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. The deduced amino acid sequences of eight plt genes were similar to the amino acid sequences of genes with known biosynthetic functions, including type I polyketide synthases (pltB, pltC), an acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) dehydrogenase (pltE), an acyl-CoA synthetase (pltF), a thioesterase (pltG), and three halogenases (pltA, pltD, and pltM). Insertions of the transposon Tn5 or Tn3-nice or a kanamycin resistance gene in each of these genes abolished pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. The presumed functions of the eight plt products are consistent with biochemical transformations involved in pyoluteorin biosynthesis from proline and acetate precursors. Isotope labeling studies demonstrated that proline is the primary precursor to the dichloropyrrole moiety of pyoluteorin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the product of another plt gene, pltR, is similar to those of members of the LysR family of transcriptional activators. pltR and pltM are transcribed divergently from the pltLABCDEFG gene cluster, and a sequence with the characteristics of a LysR binding site was identified within the 486-bp intergenic region separating pltRM from pltLABCDEFG. Transcription of the pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes pltB, pltE, and pltF, assessed with transcriptional fusions to an ice nucleation reporter gene, was significantly greater in Pf-5 than in a pltR mutant of Pf-5. Therefore, PltR is proposed to be a transcriptional activator of linked pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: A structure-guided approach to creating covalent FGFR inhibitors Abstract: The fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4) represent promising therapeutic targets in a number of cancers. We have developed the first potent and selective irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, which we named FIIN-1 that forms a covalent bond with cysteine 486 located in the P loop of the FGFR1 ATP binding site. We demonstrated that the inhibitor potently inhibits Tel-FGFR1-transformed Ba/F3 cells (EC(50) = 14 nM) as well as numerous FGFR-dependent cancer cell lines. A biotin-derivatized version of the inhibitor, FIIN-1-biotin, was shown to covalently label FGFR1 at Cys486. FIIN-1 is a useful probe of FGFR-dependent cellular phenomena and may provide a starting point of the development of therapeutically relevant irreversible inhibitors of wild-type and drug-resistant forms of FGFR kinases.	0
Title: Elucidation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin in Streptomyces pulveraceus Abstract: Fostriecin is a unique phosphate monoester antibiotic that was isolated from Streptomyces pulveraceus as a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP4A selective inhibitor. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, a 73 kb gene cluster encoding a six modular Type I polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven tailoring enzymes was identified by cosmid sequencing from the producer. The functions of two tailoring enzymes were characterized by gene disruption and an in vitro enzyme activity assay. Remarkably, the isolation of three malonylated fostriecin analogs from post-PKS gene knockout mutants indicated malonylated-polyketide formation could be a normal biosynthetic process in the formation of the unsaturated six-membered lactone in fostriecin. Based on this study, a comprehensive post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin biosynthesis was proposed.	1
Title: Differential impact of nutrition on developmental and metabolic gene expression during fruiting body development in Neurospora crassa Abstract: Fungal fruiting body size and form are influenced by the ecology of the species, including diverse environmental stimuli. Accordingly, nutritional resources available to the fungus during development can be vital to successful production of fruiting bodies. To investigate the effect of nutrition, perithecial development of Neurospora crassa was induced on two different media, a chemically sparsely nutritive Synthetic Crossing Medium (SCM) and a natural Carrot Agar (CA). Protoperithecia were collected before crossing, and perithecia were collected at 2, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and at full maturity 144 h after crossing. No differences in fruiting body morphology were observed between the two media at any time point. A circuit of microarray hybridizations comparing cDNA from all neighboring stages was performed. For a majority of differentially expressed genes, expression was higher in SCM than in CA, and expression of core metabolic genes was particularly affected. Effects of nutrition were highest in magnitude before crossing, lowering in magnitude during early perithecial development. Interestingly, metabolic effects of the media were also large in magnitude during late perithecial development, at which stage the lower expression in CA presumably reflected the continued intake of diverse complex initial compounds, diminishing the need for expression of anabolic pathways. However, for genes with key regulatory roles in sexual development, including pheromone precursor ccg-4 and poi2, expression patterns were similar between treatments. When possible, a common nutritional environment is ideal for comparing transcriptional profiles between different fungi. Nevertheless, the observed consistency of the developmental program across media, despite considerable metabolic differentiation is reassuring. This result facilitates comparative studies that will require different nutritional resources for sexual development in different fungi.	0
Title: Targeted Genome Mining Reveals the Psychrophilic Clostridium estertheticum Complex as a Potential Source for Novel Bacteriocins, Including Cesin A and Estercticin A Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is considered a major public health issue necessitating the discovery of alternative antimicrobial compounds. In this regard, targeted genome mining in bacteria occupying under-explored ecological niches has the potential to reveal such compounds, including bacteriocins. In this study, we determined the bacteriocin biosynthetic potential of the psychrophilic Clostridium estertheticum complex (CEC) through a combination of genome mining and phenotypic screening assays. The genome mining was performed in 40 CEC genomes using antiSMASH. The production of bacteriocin-like compounds was phenotypically validated through agar well (primary screening) and disk diffusion (secondary screening) assays using cell free supernatants (CFS) and partially purified extracts, respectively. Stability of four selected CFS against proteolytic enzymes, temperature and pH was determined while one CFS was analyzed by HRMS and MS/MS to identify potential bacteriocins. Twenty novel bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters (BBGC), which were classified into eight (six lantibiotics and two sactipeptides) distinct groups, were discovered in 18 genomes belonging to C. estertheticum (n = 12), C. tagluense (n = 3) and genomospecies2 (n = 3). Primary screening linked six BBGC with narrow antimicrobial activity against closely related clostridia species. All four preselected CFS retained activity after exposure to different proteolytic, temperature and pH conditions. Secondary screening linked BBGC1 and BBGC7 encoding a lantibiotic and sactipeptide, respectively, with activity against Bacillus cereus while lantibiotic-encoding BBGC2 and BBGC3 were linked with activity against B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MS/MS analysis revealed that C. estertheticum CF004 produces cesin A, a short natural variant of nisin, and HRMS indicated the production of a novel sactipeptide named estercticin A. Therefore, we have shown the CEC, in particular C. estertheticum, is a source of novel and stable bacteriocins that have activities against clinically relevant pathogens.	1
Title: Comparison of design strategies for promotion of beta-peptide 14-helix stability in water Abstract: Many short beta-peptides adopt well-defined conformations in organic solvents, but specialized stabilizing elements are required for folding to occur in aqueous solution. Several different strategies to stabilize the 14-helical secondary structure in water have been developed, and here we provide a direct comparison of three such strategies. We have synthesized and characterized beta-peptide heptamers in which variously a salt bridge between side chains, a covalent link between side chains, or two cyclically constrained residues have been incorporated to promote 14-helicity. The incorporation of a salt bridge does not generate significant 14-helicity in water, according to CD and 2D NMR data. In contrast, incorporation either of a lactam bridge between side chains or of cyclic residues results in stable 14-helices in water. The beta-peptides featuring trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues show the highest 14-helical backbone stability, with hardly any sensitivity to pH or ionic strength. The beta-peptides featuring side-chain-to-side-chain cyclization show lower 14-helical backbone stability and higher sensitivity to pH and ionic strength, but increased order between the side chains because of the cyclization.	0
Title: Response of ants to a deterrent factor(s) produced by the symbiotic bacteria of entomopathogenic nematodes Abstract: The production of an ant-deterrent factor(s) (ADF) by Xenorhabdus nematophila and Photorhabdus luminescens, the symbiotic bacteria of the nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, respectively, was examined. In addition to an in vivo assay in which bacteria were tested for their ability to produce ADF within insect cadavers (M.E. Baur, H. K. Kaya, and D. R. Strong, Biol. Control 12:231-236, 1998), an in vitro microtiter dish assay was developed to monitor ADF activity produced by bacteria grown in cultures. Using these methods, we show that ADF activity is present in the supernatants of bacterial cultures, is filterable, heat stable, and acid sensitive, and passes through a 10-kDa-pore-size membrane. Thus, ADF appears to be comprised of a small, extracellular, and possibly nonproteinaceous compound(s). The amount of ADF repellency detected depends on the ant species being tested, the sucrose concentration (in vitro assays), and the strain, form, and age of the ADF-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that the symbiotic bacteria of some species of entomopathogenic nematodes produce a compound(s) that deters scavengers such as ants and thus could protect nematodes from being eaten during reproduction within insect cadavers.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Complex Indole Alkaloids: Elucidation of the Concise Pathway of Okaramines Abstract: The okaramines are a class of complex indole alkaloids isolated from Penicillium and Aspergillus species. Their potent insecticidal activity arises from selectively activating glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) in invertebrates, not affecting human ligand-gated anion channels. Okaramines B (1) and D (2) contain a polycyclic skeleton, including an azocine ring and an unprecedented 2-dimethyl-3-methyl-azetidine ring. Owing to their complex scaffold, okaramines have inspired many total synthesis efforts, but the enzymology of the okaramine biosynthetic pathway remains unexplored. Here, we identified and characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster (oka) of 1 and 2, then elucidated the pathway with target gene inactivation, heterologous reconstitution, and biochemical characterization. Notably, we characterized an α-ketoglutarate-dependent non-heme FeII dioxygenase that forged the azetidine ring on the okaramine skeleton.	1
Title: Chemical Synthesis of GM2 Glycans, Bioconjugation with Bacteriophage Qβ, and the Induction of Anticancer Antibodies Abstract: The development of carbohydrate-based antitumor vaccines is an attractive approach towards tumor prevention and treatment. Herein, we focused on the ganglioside GM2 tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA), which is overexpressed in a wide range of tumor cells. GM2 was synthesized chemically and conjugated with a virus-like particle derived from bacteriophage Qβ. Although the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction efficiently introduced 237 copies of GM2 per Qβ, this construct failed to induce significant amounts of anti-GM2 antibodies compared to the Qβ control. In contrast, GM2 immobilized on Qβ through a thiourea linker elicited high titers of IgG antibodies that recognized GM2-positive tumor cells and effectively induced cell lysis through complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, bacteriophage Qβ is a suitable platform to boost antibody responses towards GM2, a representative member of an important class of TACA: the ganglioside.	0

Title: Azotobacter vinelandii gene clusters for two types of peptidic and catechol siderophores produced in response to molybdenum Abstract: Aim:                       To characterize the complementary production of two types of siderophores in Azotobacter vinelandii.                  Methods and results:                       In an iron-insufficient environment, nitrogen-fixing A. vinelandii produces peptidic (azotobactin) and catechol siderophores for iron uptake to be used as a nitrogenase cofactor. Molybdenum, another nitrogenase cofactor, was also found to affect the production level of siderophores. Wild-type cells excreted azotobactin into molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient medium, although catechol siderophores predominate in molybdenum-free environments. Two gene clusters were identified to be involved in the production of azotobactin and catechol siderophores through gene annotation and disruption. Azotobactin-deficient mutant cells produced catechol siderophores under the molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient conditions, whereas catechol siderophore-deficient mutant cells extracellularly secreted excess azotobactin under iron-deficient condition independent of the concentration of molybdenum. This evidence suggests that a complementary siderophore production system exists in A. vinelandii.                  Conclusions:                       Molybdenum was found to regulate the production level of two types of siderophores. Azotobacter vinelandii cells are equipped with a complementary production system for nitrogen fixation in response to a limited quantity of metals.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       This is the first study identifying A. vinelandii gene clusters for the biosynthesis of two types of siderophores and clarifying the relationship between them.	1
Title: Chalcomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces bikiniensis: novel features of an unusual ketolide produced through expression of the chm polyketide synthase in Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Chalcomycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic made by the bacterium Streptomyces bikiniensis, contains a 2,3-trans double bond and the neutral sugar D-chalcose in place of the amino sugar mycaminose found in most other 16-membered macrolides. Degenerate polyketide synthase (PKS)-specific primers were used to amplify DNA fragments from S. bikiniensis with very high identity to a unique ketosynthase domain of the tylosin PKS. The resulting amplimers were used to identify two overlapping cosmids encompassing the chm PKS. Sequencing revealed a contiguous segment of >60 kb carrying 25 putative genes for biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, the two deoxysugars, and enzymes involved in modification of precursors of chalcomycin or resistance to it. The chm PKS lacks the ketoreductase and dehydratase domains in the seventh module expected to produce the 2,3-double bond in chalcomycin. Expression of PKS in the heterologous host Streptomyces fradiae, from which the tyl genes encoding the PKS had been removed, resulted in production of at least one novel compound, characterized as a 3-keto 16-membered macrolactone in equilibrium with its 3-trans enol tautomer and containing the sugar mycaminose at the C-5 position, in agreement with the structure predicted on the basis of the domain organization of the chm PKS. The production of a 3-keto macrolide from the chm PKS indicates that a discrete set of enzymes is responsible for the introduction of the 2,3-trans double bond in chalcomycin. From comparisons of the open reading frames to sequences in databases, a pathway for the synthesis of nucleoside diphosphate-D-chalcose was proposed.	1
Title: Osmotic regulation of beta(1-2) glucan synthesis in members of the family Rhizobiaceae Abstract: High osmolarity in the culture medium of growing Agrobacterium tumefaciens strongly inhibited the accumulation of cellular beta(1-2) glucan. However, the enzymatic system required for the synthesis of this polysaccharide from UDP-glucose was not repressed by high osmolarity. Mutants of A. tumefaciens and Rhizobium meliloti affected in beta(1-2) glucan synthesis were unable to grow normally in low-osmolarity media.	0
Title: Microsclerodermins from terrestrial myxobacteria: an intriguing biosynthesis likely connected to a sponge symbiont Abstract: The microsclerodermins are unusual peptide natural products exhibiting potent antifungal activity reported from marine sponges of the genera Microscleroderma and Theonella . We here describe a variety of microbial producers of microsclerodermins and pedeins among myxobacteria along with the isolation of several new derivatives. A retrobiosynthetic approach led to the identification of microsclerodermin biosynthetic gene clusters in genomes of Sorangium and Jahnella species, allowing for the first time insights into the intriguing hybrid PKS/NRPS machinery required for microsclerodermin formation. This study reveals the biosynthesis of a "marine natural product" in a terrestrial myxobacterium where even the identical structure is available from both sources. Thus, the newly identified terrestrial producers provide access to additional chemical diversity; moreover, they are clearly more amenable to production optimization and genetic modification than the original source from the marine habitat. As sponge metagenome data strongly suggest the presence of associated myxobacteria, our findings underpin the recent notion that many previously described "sponge metabolites" might in fact originate from such microbial symbionts.	1
Title: Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that serine/threonine kinase is involved in Streptococcus suis virulence and adaption to stress conditions Abstract: The eukaryotic-type serine/threonine kinase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) performs critical roles in bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) MS/MS were used to analyze the protein profiles of wild type strain SS2-1 and its isogenic STK deletion mutant (Δstk). A total of 281 significant differential proteins, including 147 up-regulated and 134 down-regulated proteins, were found in Δstk. Moreover, 69 virulence factors (VFs) among these 281 proteins were predicted by the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), including 38 downregulated and 31 up-regulated proteins in Δstk, among which 15 down regulated VFs were known VFs of SS2. Among the down-regulated proteins, high temperature requirement A (HtrA), glutamine synthase (GlnA), ferrichrome ABC transporter substrate-binding protein FepB, and Zinc-binding protein AdcA are known to be involved in bacterial survival and/or nutrient and energy acquisition under adverse host conditions. Overall, our results indicate that STK regulates the expression of proteins involved in virulence of SS2 and its adaption to stress environments.	0
Title: Identification and functional analysis of gene cluster involvement in biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic pelgipeptin produced by Paenibacillus elgii Abstract: Background:                       Pelgipeptin, a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent, is a non-ribosomally synthesised lipopeptide antibiotic. This compound consists of a β-hydroxy fatty acid and nine amino acids. To date, there is no information about its biosynthetic pathway.                  Results:                       A potential pelgipeptin synthetase gene cluster (plp) was identified from Paenibacillus elgii B69 through genome analysis. The gene cluster spans 40.8 kb with eight open reading frames. Among the genes in this cluster, three large genes, plpD, plpE, and plpF, were shown to encode non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), with one, seven, and one module(s), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of the substrate specificity of all nine adenylation domains indicated that the sequence of the NRPS modules is well collinear with the order of amino acids in pelgipeptin. Additional biochemical analysis of four recombinant adenylation domains (PlpD A1, PlpE A1, PlpE A3, and PlpF A1) provided further evidence that the plp gene cluster involved in pelgipeptin biosynthesis.                  Conclusions:                       In this study, a gene cluster (plp) responsible for the biosynthesis of pelgipeptin was identified from the genome sequence of Paenibacillus elgii B69. The identification of the plp gene cluster provides an opportunity to develop novel lipopeptide antibiotics by genetic engineering.	1
Title: UCS1025A and B, new antitumor antibiotics from the fungus Acremonium species Abstract: [structure: see text] UCS1025A and B, novel pentacyclic polyketides with an unprecedented furopyrrolizidine skeleton, were isolated from the fungus Acremonium sp. KY4917. The structures and stereochemistry were elucidated by a combination of two-dimensional NMR and X-ray crystallographic analysis. UCS1025A showed unique chemical equilibria involving three tautomeric isomers and exhibited antimicrobial activity and antiproliferative activity against human tumor cell lines.	1
Title: Brucella abortus depends on pyruvate phosphate dikinase and malic enzyme but not on Fbp and GlpX fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases for full virulence in laboratory models Abstract: The brucellae are the etiological agents of brucellosis, a worldwide-distributed zoonosis. These bacteria are facultative intracellular parasites and thus are able to adjust their metabolism to the extra- and intracellular environments encountered during an infectious cycle. However, this aspect of Brucella biology is imperfectly understood, and the nutrients available in the intracellular niche are unknown. Here, we investigated the central pathways of C metabolism used by Brucella abortus by deleting the putative fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fbp and glpX), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdK), and malic enzyme (mae) genes. In gluconeogenic but not in rich media, growth of ΔppdK and Δmae mutants was severely impaired and growth of the double Δfbp-ΔglpX mutant was reduced. In macrophages, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants showed reduced multiplication, and studies with the ΔppdK mutant confirmed that it reached the replicative niche. Similarly, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants were attenuated in mice, the former being cleared by week 10 and the latter persisting longer than 12 weeks. We also investigated the glyoxylate cycle. Although aceA (isocitrate lyase) promoter activity was enhanced in rich medium, aceA disruption had no effect in vitro or on multiplication in macrophages or mouse spleens. The results suggest that B. abortus grows intracellularly using a limited supply of 6-C (and 5-C) sugars that is compensated by glutamate and possibly other amino acids entering the Krebs cycle without a critical role of the glyoxylate shunt.	0
Title: Influence of DNA topology on expression of the tdc operon in Escherichia coli K-12 Abstract: TdcB activity expressed from the chromosomal gene and LacZ expression from single-copy tdc-lacZ transcriptional and translational fusions were measured in Escherichia coli strains harboring mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase, topoisomerase I and the HU protein. The pattern of tdc operon expression in these mutants suggests that relaxation of supercoiled DNA enhances tdc transcription in vivo.	0
Title: Reciprocal regulation of pyoluteorin production with membrane transporter gene expression in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Abstract: Pyoluteorin is a chlorinated polyketide antibiotic secreted by the rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Genes encoding enzymes and transcriptional regulators involved in pyoluteorin production are clustered in the genome of Pf-5. Sequence analysis of genes adjacent to the known pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed the presence of an ABC transporter system. We disrupted two putative ABC transporter genes by inserting transcriptional fusions to an ice nucleation reporter gene. Mutations in pltI and pltJ, which are predicted to encode a membrane fusion protein and an ATP-binding cassette of the ABC transporter, respectively, greatly reduced pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. During the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase, populations of a pltI mutant were lower than those of a pltI+ strain in a culture medium containing pyoluteorin, suggesting a role for the transport system in efflux and the resistance of Pf-5 to the antibiotic. Although pltI or pltJ mutant strains displayed low pyoluteorin production, they did not accumulate proportionately more of the antibiotic intracellularly, indicating that pltI and pltJ do not encode an exclusive exporter for pyoluteorin. Transcription of the putative pyoluteorin efflux genes pltI and pltJ was enhanced by exogenous pyoluteorin. These new observations parallel an earlier finding that pyoluteorin enhances the transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes and pyoluteorin production in Pf-5. This report provides evidence of a coordination of pyoluteorin production and the transcription of genes encoding a linked transport apparatus, wherein each requires the other for optimal expression.	1
Title: Characterization of a novel, potent, and specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase Abstract: We have examined the mechanism of action of two natural products identified as broad spectrum antifungal agents (VanMiddlesworth, F., Dufresne, C., Wincott, F. E., Mosley, R. T., and Wilson, K. E. (1992) Tetrahedron Lett., in press; VanMiddlesworth, F., Giacobbe, R. A., Lopez, M. Garrity, G., Bland, J. A., Bartizal, K., Fromtling, R. A., Polishook, J., Zweerink, M. M., Edison, A. M., Rozdilsky, W., Wilson, K. E., and Monaghan, R. L. (1992) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 45, 861-867), designated sphingofungin B (2S-amino-3R,4R,5S,14-tetrahydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid) and sphingofungin C (2S-amino-5S-acetoxy-3R,4R,14-trihydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid), and find they are potent specific inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyze the committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to investigate the mechanism of the antifungal activity of these compounds. Macromolecular synthesis was not immediately affected by either sphingofungin B or C, synthesis continued for 60-90 min following the addition of drug to growing cultures. Significant loss of viability with sphingofungins required growing cultures and began only after several hours, with greater than 99.9% of drug-treated cells non-viable after 24 h. No lysis or other gross changes in cell morphology were observed in drug-treated cells. The structural similarity of sphingofungin B and C to sphingosine and phytosphingosine prompted us to investigate their effects on sphingolipid synthesis. Nanomolar levels of the drugs inhibited the incorporation of [3H]inositol into sphingolipid before incorporation into the sphingolipid precursor, phosphatidylinositol was affected, suggesting specific inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments in which the growth inhibitory activity of both drugs was completely ablated by the addition of phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or ketodihydrosphingosine to the culture medium. Reversal of antifungal activity by ketodihydrosphingosine suggested that serine palmitoyltransferase could be the actual target of these compounds. Direct evidence for this hypothesis was the observation of inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase activity in crude membrane preparations at nanomolar concentrations of each drug. The potent inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase coupled with the apparent lack of effect of these compounds on other cellular functions suggests that sphingofungin B and C will prove to be important new tools for studying the role of sphingolipids in yeast and perhaps in other organisms.	0
Title: Molecular networking and pattern-based genome mining improves discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters and their products from Salinispora species Abstract: Genome sequencing has revealed that bacteria contain many more biosynthetic gene clusters than predicted based on the number of secondary metabolites discovered to date. While this biosynthetic reservoir has fostered interest in new tools for natural product discovery, there remains a gap between gene cluster detection and compound discovery. Here we apply molecular networking and the new concept of pattern-based genome mining to 35 Salinispora strains, including 30 for which draft genome sequences were either available or obtained for this study. The results provide a method to simultaneously compare large numbers of complex microbial extracts, which facilitated the identification of media components, known compounds and their derivatives, and new compounds that could be prioritized for structure elucidation. These efforts revealed considerable metabolite diversity and led to several molecular family-gene cluster pairings, of which the quinomycin-type depsipeptide retimycin A was characterized and linked to gene cluster NRPS40 using pattern-based bioinformatic approaches.	1
Title: Moxifloxacin population pharmacokinetics in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and the effect of intermittent high-dose rifapentine Abstract: We described the population pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and the effect of high-dose intermittent rifapentine in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were randomized to a continuation-phase regimen of 400 mg moxifloxacin and 900 mg rifapentine twice weekly or 400 mg moxifloxacin and 1,200 mg rifapentine once weekly. A two-compartment model with transit absorption best described moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics. Although rifapentine increased the clearance of moxifloxacin by 8% during antituberculosis treatment compared to that after treatment completion without rifapentine, it did not result in a clinically significant change in moxifloxacin exposure.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of Ilicicolin H Biosynthetic Gene Cluster and Production of a New Potent Antifungal Reagent, Ilicicolin J Abstract: Ilicicolin H is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent targeting mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 reductase. Unfortunately, ilicicolin H shows reduced activities in vivo. Here, we report our effort on the identification of ilicicolin H biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by genomic sequencing a producing strain, Neonectria sp. DH2, and its heterologous production in Aspergillus nidulans. In addition, a shunt product with similar antifungal activities, ilicicolin J, was uncovered. This effort would provide a base for future combinatorial biosynthesis of ilicicolin H analogues. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the backbone of ilicicolin H is assembled by a polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthethase (IliA), and then offloaded with a tetramic acid moiety. Similar to tenellin biosynthesis, the tetramic acid is then converted to pyridone by a putative P450, IliC. The decalin portion is most possibly constructed by a S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent Diels-Alderase (IliD).	1
Title: Acyl-chain elongation drives ketosynthase substrate selectivity in trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases Abstract: Type I modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are responsible for the biosynthesis of many biologically active agents, possess a ketosynthase (KS) domain within each module to catalyze chain elongation. Acylation of the KS active site Cys residue is followed by transfer to malonyl-ACP to yield an extended β-ketoacyl chain (ACP = acyl carrier protein). To date, the precise contribution of KS selectivity in controlling product fidelity has been unclear. Six KS domains from trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) PKSs were subjected to a mass spectrometry based elongation assay, and higher substrate selectivity was identified for the elongating step than in preceding acylation. A close correspondence between the observed KS selectivity and that predicted by phylogenetic analysis was seen. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of KS selectivity in this important group of PKSs, can serve as guidance for engineering, and show that targeted mutagenesis can be used to expand the repertoire of acceptable substrates.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase in glycopeptide biosynthesis: the biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acid (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine Abstract: Balhimycin, a vancomycin-type antibiotic from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, contains the unusual amino acid (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (Dpg), with an acetate-derived carbon backbone. After sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster, one gene, dpgA, for a predicted polyketide synthase (PKS) was identified, sharing 20-30% identity with plant chalcone synthases. Inactivation of dpgA resulted in loss of balhimycin production, and restoration was achieved by supplementation with 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which is both a possible product of a PKS reaction and a likely precursor of Dpg. Enzyme assays with the protein expressed in Streptomyces lividans showed that this PKS uses only malonyl-CoA as substrate to synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. The PKS gene is organized in an operon-like structure with three downstream genes that are similar to enoyl-CoA-hydratase genes and a dehydrogenase gene. The heterologous co-expression of all four genes led to accumulation of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglyoxylic acid. Therefore, we now propose a reaction sequence. The final step in the pathway to Dpg is a transamination. A predicted transaminase gene was inactivated, resulting in abolished antibiotic production and accumulation of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglyoxylic acid. Interestingly, restoration was only possible by simultaneous supplementation with (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and (S)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, indicating that the transaminase is essential for the formation of both amino acids.	1
Title: Effect of increased dosage of the ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster on ML-236B production in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis has recently been characterized from P. citrinum No. 41520. Here, we describe how the ML-236B-producing strain was improved using a cosmid-mediated recombination technique. The introduction of the cosmid pML48, which contains seven of the nine ML-236B biosynthetic genes, into P. citrinum No. 41520 resulted in transformants which produced increased amounts of ML-236B. Southern analysis showed that pML48 had been incorporated by a homologous recombination event, and all high producers possessed two copies of each of the seven genes, mlcA- mlcF and mlcR, suggesting that increased dosage of the biosynthetic gene cluster was responsible for the enhanced production of ML-236B. On the other hand, various kinds of mutants with decreased titers of ML-236B were also obtained. Characterization of one such mutant, designated as T48.28, which was more sensitive to ML-236B than the parental strain, suggested that one of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes, mlcD, which encodes a putative HMG-CoA reductase, was involved in conferring resistance to ML-236B.	1
Title: Cpf1 proteins excise CRISPR RNAs from mRNA transcripts in mammalian cells Abstract: Cpf1 is a CRISPR effector protein that has greater specificity than Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) in genome-editing applications. Here we show that Lachnospiraceae bacterium (Lb) and Acidaminococus sp. (As) Cpf1 orthologs have RNase activities that can excise multiple CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from a single RNA polymerase II-driven RNA transcript expressed in mammalian cells. This property simplifies modification of multiple genomic targets and can be used to increase the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated editing.	0
Title: High glycolytic flux improves pyruvate production by a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain Abstract: We report pyruvate formation in Escherichia coli strain ALS929 containing mutations in the aceEF, pfl, poxB, pps, and ldhA genes which encode, respectively, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate oxidase, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The glycolytic rate and pyruvate productivity were compared using glucose-, acetate-, nitrogen-, or phosphorus-limited chemostats at a growth rate of 0.15 h(-1). Of these four nutrient limitation conditions, growth under acetate limitation resulted in the highest glycolytic flux (1.60 g/g . h), pyruvate formation rate (1.11 g/g h), and pyruvate yield (0.70 g/g). Additional mutations in atpFH and arcA (strain ALS1059) further elevated the steady-state glycolytic flux to 2.38 g/g h in an acetate-limited chemostat, with heterologous NADH oxidase expression causing only modest additional improvement. A fed-batch process with strain ALS1059 using defined medium with 5 mM betaine as osmoprotectant and an exponential feeding rate of 0.15 h(-1) achieved 90 g/liter pyruvate, with an overall productivity of 2.1 g/liter h and yield of 0.68 g/g.	0
Title: Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac-mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl-tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site-specific incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA-bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site-directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC-derived cell types and complex tissue models.	0
Title: Pederin-type pathways of uncultivated bacterial symbionts: analysis of o-methyltransferases and generation of a biosynthetic hybrid Abstract: The complex polyketide pederin is a potent antitumor agent isolated from Paederus spp. rove beetles. We have previously isolated a set of genes from a bacterial endosymbiont that are good candidates for pederin biosynthesis. To biochemically study this pathway, we expressed three methyltransferases from the putative pederin pathway and used the partially unmethylated analogue mycalamide A from the marine sponge Mycale hentscheli as test substrate. Analysis by high-resolution MS/MS and NMR revealed that PedO regiospecifically methylates the marine compound to generate the nonnatural hybrid compound 18-O-methylmycalamide A with increased cytotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first biochemical evidence that invertebrates can obtain defensive complex polyketides from bacterial symbionts.	1
