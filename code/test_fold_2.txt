Title: Characterization of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster that encodes the bisindolylmaleimide methylarcyriarubin Abstract: Bisindolylmaleimides represent a naturally occurring class of metabolites that are of interest because of their protein kinase inhibition activity. From a metagenomic library constructed with soil DNA, we identified the four gene mar cluster, a bisindolylmaleimide gene cluster that encodes for methylarcyriarubin (1) production. Heterologous expression of the mar gene cluster in E. coli revealed that the Rieske dioxygenase MarC facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of a chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) intermediate to yield the bisindolylmaleimide core. The characterization of the mar cluster defines a new role for CPA in the biosynthesis of structurally diverse bacterial tryptophan dimers.	1
Title: Description of an orthologous cluster of ochratoxin A biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus and Penicillium species. A comparative analysis Abstract: Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most important mycotoxins due to its toxic properties and worldwide distribution which is produced by several Aspergillus and Penicillium species. The knowledge of OTA biosynthetic genes and understanding of the mechanisms involved in their regulation are essential. In this work, we obtained a clear picture of biosynthetic genes organization in the main OTA-producing Aspergillus and Penicillium species (A. steynii, A. westerdijkiae, A. niger, A. carbonarius and P. nordicum) using complete genome sequences obtained in this work or previously available on databases. The results revealed a region containing five ORFs which predicted five proteins: halogenase, bZIP transcription factor, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase in all the five species. Genetic synteny was conserved in both Penicillium and Aspergillus species although genomic location seemed to be different since the clusters presented different flanking regions (except for A. steynii and A. westerdijkiae); these observations support the hypothesis of the orthology of this genomic region and that it might have been acquired by horizontal transfer. New real-time RT-PCR assays for quantification of the expression of these OTA biosynthetic genes were developed. In all species, the five genes were consistently expressed in OTA-producing strains in permissive conditions. These protocols might favour futures studies on the regulation of biosynthetic genes in order to develop new efficient control methods to avoid OTA entering the food chain.	1
Title: The promoter architectural landscape of the Salmonella PhoP regulon Abstract: The DNA-binding protein PhoP controls virulence and Mg²⁺ homeostasis in the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. PhoP regulates expression of a large number of genes that differ both in their ancestry and in the biochemical functions and physiological roles of the encoded products. This suggests that PhoP-regulated genes are differentially expressed. To understand how a bacterial activator might generate varied gene expression behaviour, we investigated the cis-acting promoter features (i.e. the number of PhoP binding sites, as well as their orientation and location with respect to the sites bound by RNA polymerase and the sequences that constitute the PhoP binding sites) in 23 PhoP-activated promoters. Our results show that natural PhoP-activated promoters utilize only a limited number of combinations of cis-acting features--or promoter architectures. We determine that PhoP activates transcription by different mechanisms, and that ancestral and horizontally acquired PhoP-activated genes have distinct promoter architectures.	0
Title: A New Meroditerpene and a New Tryptoquivaline Analog from the Algicolous Fungus Neosartorya takakii KUFC 7898 Abstract: A new meroditerpene sartorenol (1), a new natural product takakiamide (2) and a new tryptoquivaline analog (3) were isolated, together with nine known compounds, including aszonapyrone A, chevalone B, aszonalenin, acetylaszonalenin, 3'-(4-oxoquinazolin-3-yl) spiro[1H-indole-3,5'-oxolane]-2,2'-dione, tryptoquivalines L, F and H, and the isocoumarin derivative, 6-hydroxymellein, from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of the algicolous fungus Neosartorya takakii KUFC 7898. The structures of the new compounds were established based on 1D and 2D NMR spectral analysis, and, in the case of sartorenol (1) and tryptoquivaline U (3), X-ray analysis was used to confirm their structures and to determine the absolute configuration of their stereogenic carbons. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant isolates from the environment; however, none exhibited antibacterial activity (MIC ˃ 256 mg/mL). The three new compounds did not show any quorum sensing inhibition in the screening protocol based on the pigment production by Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 31532).	0
Title: Synergistic Interactions in Microbial Biofilms Facilitate the Establishment of Opportunistic Pathogenic Fungi in Household Dishwashers Abstract: Biofilms formed on rubber seals in dishwashers harbor diverse microbiota. In this study, we focussed on the microbial composition of bacteria and fungi, isolated from a defined area of one square centimeter of rubber from four domestic dishwashers and assessed their abilities to in vitro multispecies biofilm formation. A total of 80 isolates (64 bacterial and 16 fungal) were analyzed. Multiple combinations of bacterial isolates from each dishwasher were screened for synergistic interactions. 32 out of 140 tested (23%) four-species bacterial combinations displayed consistent synergism leading to an overall increase in biomass, in all experimental trails. Bacterial isolates from two of the four dishwashers generated a high number of synergistically interacting four-species consortia. Network based correlation analyses also showed higher co-occurrence patterns observed between bacterial members in the same two dishwasher samples, indicating cooperative effects. Furthermore, two synergistic four-species bacterial consortia were tested for their abilities to incorporate an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Exophiala dermatitidis and their establishment as biofilms on sterile ethylene propylene diene monomer M-class (EPDM) rubber and polypropylene (PP) surfaces. When the bacterial consortia included E. dermatitidis, the overall cell numbers of both bacteria and fungi increased and a substantial increase in biofilm biomass was observed. These results indicate a novel phenomenon of cross kingdom synergy in biofilm formation and these observations could have potential implications for human health.	0
Title: Thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone Inhibits Alg44 Binding to c-di-GMP and Reduces Alginate Production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that affects a large proportion of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF patients have dehydrated mucus within the airways that leads to the inability of the mucociliary escalator to expel inhaled microbes. Once inhaled, P. aeruginosa can persist in the lungs of the CF patients for the remainder of their lives. During this chronic infection, a phenomenon called mucoid conversion can occur in which P. aeruginosa can mutate and inactivate their mucA gene. As a consequence, transcription of the alg operon is highly expressed, leading to the copious secretion of the alginate exopolysaccharide, which is associated with decreased lung function and increased CF patient morbidity and mortality. Alginate biosynthesis by P. aeruginosa is post-translationally regulated by bis(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which binds to the receptor protein Alg44 to activate alginate production. The identification of small molecules that disrupt the binding of c-di-GMP to Alg44 could inhibit the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce alginate. In this work, a class of thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone compounds that inhibited Alg44 binding to c-di-GMP in vitro was identified after screening chemical libraries consisting of ∼50 000 chemical compounds. Thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinones were shown to specifically inhibit Alg44-c-di-GMP interactions by forming a disulfide bond with the cysteine residue in the PilZ domain of Alg44. The more potent thiol-benzo-triazolo-quinazolinone had the ability to reduce P. aeruginosa alginate secretion by up to 30%. These compounds serve as leads in the development of novel inhibitors of alginate production by P. aeruginosa after mucoid conversion.	0
Title: Metagenomic Analysis of the Sponge Discodermia Reveals the Production of the Cyanobacterial Natural Product Kasumigamide by 'Entotheonella' Abstract: Sponge metagenomes are a useful platform to mine cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for production of natural products involved in the sponge-microbe association. Since numerous sponge-derived bioactive metabolites are biosynthesized by the symbiotic bacteria, this strategy may concurrently reveal sponge-symbiont produced compounds. Accordingly, a metagenomic analysis of the Japanese marine sponge Discodermia calyx has resulted in the identification of a hybrid type I polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene (kas). Bioinformatic analysis of the gene product suggested its involvement in the biosynthesis of kasumigamide, a tetrapeptide originally isolated from freshwater free-living cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-87. Subsequent investigation of the sponge metabolic profile revealed the presence of kasumigamide in the sponge extract. The kasumigamide producing bacterium was identified as an 'Entotheonella' sp. Moreover, an in silico analysis of kas gene homologs uncovered the presence of kas family genes in two additional bacteria from different phyla. The production of kasumigamide by distantly related multiple bacterial strains implicates horizontal gene transfer and raises the potential for a wider distribution across other bacterial groups.	1
Title: Copper-catalyzed oxytrifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes Abstract: A mild, versatile, and convenient method for the efficient oxytrifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes based on a copper-catalyzed oxidative difunctionalization strategy has been developed. This methodology provides access to a variety of classes of synthetically useful CF(3)-containing building blocks from simple starting materials.	0
Title: Small-molecule inhibition of TLR8 through stabilization of its resting state Abstract: Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) are highly analogous sensors for various viral or bacterial RNA and DNA molecular patterns. Nonetheless, few small molecules can selectively modulate these TLRs. In this manuscript, we identified the first human TLR8-specific small-molecule antagonists via a novel inhibition mechanism. Crystal structures of two distinct TLR8-ligand complexes validated a unique binding site on the protein-protein interface of the TLR8 homodimer. Upon binding to this new site, the small-molecule ligands stabilize the preformed TLR8 dimer in its resting state, preventing activation. As a proof of concept of their therapeutic potential, we have demonstrated that these drug-like inhibitors are able to suppress TLR8-mediated proinflammatory signaling in various cell lines, human primary cells, and patient specimens. These results not only suggest a novel strategy for TLR inhibitor design, but also shed critical mechanistic insight into these clinically important immune receptors.	0
Title: The lipopeptide antibiotic A54145 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Ca(2+)-dependent cyclic lipodepsipeptides are an emerging class of antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. These compounds are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complexes encoded by large gene clusters. The gene cluster encoding biosynthetic pathway enzymes for the Streptomyces fradiae A54145 NRP was cloned from a cosmid library and characterized. Four NRPS-encoding genes, responsible for subunits of the synthetase, as well as genes for accessory functions such as acylation, methylation and hydroxylation, were identified by sequence analysis in a 127 kb region of DNA that appears to be located subterminally in the bacterial chromosome. Deduced epimerase domain-encoding sequences within the NRPS genes indicated a D: -stereochemistry for Glu, Lys and Asn residues, as observed for positionally analogous residues in two related compounds, daptomycin, and the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) produced by Streptomyces roseosporus and Streptomyces coelicolor, respectively. A comparison of the structure and the biosynthetic gene cluster of A54145 with those of the related peptides showed many similarities. This information may contribute to the design of experiments to address both fundamental and applied questions in lipopeptide biosynthesis, engineering and drug development.	1
Title: Multidimensional glycan arrays for enhanced antibody profiling Abstract: Carbohydrate-binding antibodies play a critical role in basic and clinical research. Monoclonal antibodies that bind glycans are used to measure carbohydrate expression, and serum antibodies to glycans can be important elements of the immune response to pathogens and vaccines. Carbohydrate antigen arrays, or glycan arrays, have emerged as powerful tools for the high-throughput analysis of carbohydrate-protein interactions. Our group has focused on the development and application of neoglycoprotein arrays, a unique array format wherein carbohydrates are covalently attached to a carrier protein prior to immobilization on the surface. The neoglycoprotein format permits variations of glycan structure, glycan density, and neoglycoprotein density on a single array. The focus of this study was on the effects of neoglycoprotein density on antibody binding. First, we evaluated binding of five monoclonal antibodies (81FR2.2, HE-195, HE-193, B480, and Z2A) to the blood group A antigen and found that neoglycoprotein density had a substantial effect on recognition. Next, we profiled serum antibodies in 15 healthy individuals and showed that inclusion of multiple neoglycoprotein densities helps distinguish different subpopulations of antibodies. Finally, we evaluated immune responses induced by a prostate cancer vaccine and showed that variations in neoglycoprotein density enable one to detect antibody responses that could not be detected otherwise. Neoglycoprotein density is a useful element of diversity for evaluating antibody recognition and, when combined with variations in glycan structure and glycan density, provides multidimensional glycan arrays with enhanced performance for monoclonal antibody development, biomarker discovery, and vaccine optimization.	0
Title: Prokaryotic Community Structure Driven by Salinity and Ionic Concentrations in Plateau Lakes of the Tibetan Plateau Abstract: The prokaryotic community composition and diversity and the distribution patterns at various taxonomic levels across gradients of salinity and physiochemical properties in the surface waters of seven plateau lakes in the Qaidam Basin, Tibetan Plateau, were evaluated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. These lakes included Lakes Keluke (salinity, <1 g/liter), Qing (salinity, 5.5 to 6.6 g/liter), Tuosu (salinity, 24 to 35 g/liter), Dasugan (salinity, 30 to 33 g/liter), Gahai (salinity, 92 to 96 g/liter), Xiaochaidan (salinity, 94 to 99 g/liter), and Gasikule (salinity, 317 to 344 g/liter). The communities were dominated by Bacteria in lakes with salinities of <100 g/liter and by Archaea in Lake Gasikule. The clades At12OctB3 and Salinibacter, previously reported only in hypersaline environments, were found in a hyposaline lake (salinity, 5.5 to 6.6 g/liter) at an abundance of ∼1.0%, indicating their ecological plasticity. Salinity and the concentrations of the chemical ions whose concentrations covary with salinity (Mg(2+), K(+), Cl(-), Na(+), SO4 (2-), and Ca(2+)) were found to be the primary environmental factors that directly or indirectly determined the composition and diversity at the level of individual clades as well as entire prokaryotic communities. The distribution patterns of two phyla, five classes, five orders, five families, and three genera were well predicted by salinity. The variation of the prokaryotic community structure also significantly correlated with the dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, the total nitrogen concentration, and the PO4 (3-) concentration. Such correlations varied depending on the taxonomic level, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive correlation analyses at various taxonomic levels in evaluating the effects of environmental variable factors on prokaryotic community structures. Our findings clarify the distribution patterns of the prokaryotic community composition in plateau lakes at the levels of individual clades as well as whole communities along gradients of salinity and ionic concentrations.	0
Title: High order quaternary arrangement confers increased structural stability to Brucella sp. lumazine synthase Abstract: The penultimate step in the pathway of riboflavin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase (LS). One of the most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is the structural quaternary divergence found in different species. The protein exists as pentameric and icosahedral forms, built from practically the same structural monomeric unit. The pentameric structure is formed by five 18-kDa monomers, each extensively contacting neighboring monomers. The icosahedrical structure consists of 60 LS monomers arranged as 12 pentamers giving rise to a capsid exhibiting icosahedral 532 symmetry. In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. The Brucella sp. lumazine synthase (BLS) sequence clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate its quaternary arrangement. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analyses that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for lumazine synthases. We also describe by spectroscopic studies the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of this macromolecular assembly. The higher molecular order of BLS increases its stability 20 degrees C compared with pentameric lumazine synthases. The decameric arrangement described in this work highlights the importance of quaternary interactions in the stabilization of proteins.	0
Title: ValC, a new type of C7-Cyclitol kinase involved in the biosynthesis of the antifungal agent validamycin A Abstract: The gene valC, which encodes an enzyme homologous to the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone kinase (AcbM) of the acarbose biosynthetic pathway, was identified in the validamycin A biosynthetic gene cluster. Inactivation of valC resulted in mutants that lack the ability to produce validamycin A. Complementation experiments with a replicating plasmid harboring full-length valC restored the production of validamycin A, thus suggesting a critical function of valC in validamycin biosynthesis. In vitro characterization of ValC revealed a new type of C7-cyclitol kinase, which phosphorylates valienone and validone--but not 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, 5-epi-valiolone, or glucose--to afford their 7-phosphate derivatives. The results provide new insights into the activity of this enzyme and also confirm the existence of two different pathways leading to the same end-product: the valienamine moiety common to acarbose and validamycin A.	1
Title: Fosfomycin suppresses RS-virus-induced Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells via the platelet-activating factor receptor Abstract: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sometimes causes acute and severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. The platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, is upregulated by RSV infection in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Fosfomycin, an antimicrobial agent, significantly suppressed PAF receptor induction by RSV infection at the mRNA and cell surface expression levels. Fosfomycin also suppressed RSV-induced adhesion of fluorescence-labeled S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae cells, as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The RSV-induced bacterial adhesion was suggested to be host-PAF-receptor and bacterial-phosphocholine mediated. Fosfomycin, which has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found here to suppress adhesion by disease-causing bacteria. Thus, fosfomycin might prevent secondary bacterial infection during RSV infection.	0
Title: "Frizzy" mutants: a new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants of Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: During fruiting-body formation in Myxococcus xanthus, cells aggregate into raised mounds, where they sporulate. A new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants was identified within a collection of nonfruiting mutants of M. xanthus. The mutants failed to aggregate into discrete mounds, but rather aggregated into "frizzy" filaments. Many cells within the filaments sporulated normally. Pairwise mixtures of representative frizzy mutants were unable to stimulate each other to aggregate normally. Two strains of M. xanthus were isolated which contained transposon Tn5 insertions mapping near one frizzy mutation. A search through 36 mutants exhibiting the frizzy phenotype showed that all were linked to the same Tn5 insertion sites. Three-factor cross-analysis of 22 of these mutants allowed the mapping of these mutations into many loci. The localization of Tn5 inserts adjacent to this region make possible further manipulation of these genes.	0
Title: Biosynthetic reconstitution of deoxysugar phosphoramidate metalloprotease inhibitors using an N-P-bond-forming kinase Abstract: Phosphoramidon is a potent metalloprotease inhibitor and a widespread tool in cell biology research. It contains a dipeptide backbone that is uniquely linked to a 6-deoxysugar via a phosphoramidate bridge. Herein, we report the identification of a gene cluster for the formation of phosphoramidon and its detailed characterization. In vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis established TalE as a phosphoramidate-forming kinase and TalC as the glycosyltransferase which installs the l-rhamnose moiety by phosphoester linkage.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of a proposed angucycline-like polyketide auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: A new polyketide gene cluster, aur1, was identified in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239 by using genes for the spore-pigment polyketide synthase of the Streptomyces coelicolor whiE operon as a probe. Sequence analysis of three overlapping DNA fragments (encompassing 15,100 bp) revealed 15 open reading frames, the majority of which showed high similarity to the previously characterized type II polyketide synthase genes. The highest similarity was to three Streptomyces polyketide gene clusters involved in biosynthesis of angucycline antibiotics, jadomycin, urdamycin and landomycin. The proposed S. aureofaciens ketosynthase (Aur1D) was phylogenetically more related to all known ketosynthases for polyketide antibiotics in Streptomyces than to spore-pigment ketosynthases. Interestingly, the aur1 gene cluster contained a gene encoding a proposed malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase that has not been identified in any of the previously characterized type II polyketide synthase cluster. Transcriptional analysis of aur1 revealed a single promoter upstream the first open reading frame (the aur1A gene) that was active in all stages of differentiation with increased activity at the time of aerial mycelium formation. The aur1 gene cluster was disrupted by a homologous recombination, replacing the three genes (aur1B,C,D) including ketosynthase, with antibiotic resistance marker gene in S. aureofaciens chromosome. Disruption did not affect growth and differentiation; disrupted strain produced spores with wild-type gray-pink pigmentation. The biochromatographic analysis of the culture extracts from S. aureofaciens wild-type and aur1-disrupted strains revealed an antibacterial compound that was missing in the mutant. The results indicated a role of the S. aureofaciens aur1 gene cluster in biosynthesis of a polyketide secondary metabolite (which we named auricin), and not in the spore pigment biosynthesis.	1
Title: Ac-induced disruption of the double Ds structure in tomato Abstract: The maize doubleDs element is stably maintained in the tomato genome. Upon the subsequent introduction of Ac into a plant containing doubleDs, disruption of the doubleDs structure and DNA rearrangements at the site of the doubleDs element were observed. No indications were obtained for excision of the complete doubleDs structure. The consequences of transactivation of doubleDs in these experiments are different from those described for transactivation of single Ds elements in tomato. The mechanisms by which such rearrangements could have occurred in tomato are discussed in relation to complex insertions containing doubleDs in maize.	0
Title: Genetic structure of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1-encoded cytolytic toxin system and its relationship to lantibiotic determinants Abstract: Pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids are unique to the species Enterococcus faecalis. Many pheromone-responsive plasmids, including those frequently isolated from sites of infection, express a novel cytolysin that possesses both hemolytic and bacteriocin activities. Further, this cytolysin has been shown to be a toxin in several disease models. In the present study, nucleotide sequence determination, mutagenesis, and complementation analysis were used to determine the organization of the E. faecalis plasmid pAD1 cytolysin determinant. Four open reading frames are required for expression of the cytolysin precursor (cylLL, cylLS, cylM, and cylB). The inferred products of two of these open reading frames, CyILL and CyILS, constitute the cytolysin precursor and bear structural resemblance to posttranslationally modified bacteriocins termed lantibiotics. Similarities between the organization of the E. faecalis cytolysin determinant and expression units for lantibiotics exist, indicating that the E. faecalis cytolysin represents a new branch of this class and is the first known to possess toxin activity.	1
Title: Biosynthetic intermediate analysis and functional homology reveal a saxitoxin gene cluster in cyanobacteria Abstract: Saxitoxin (STX) and its analogues cause the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) syndrome, which afflicts human health and impacts coastal shellfish economies worldwide. PSP toxins are unique alkaloids, being produced by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we describe a candidate PSP toxin biosynthesis gene cluster (sxt) from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3. The saxitoxin biosynthetic pathway is encoded by more than 35 kb, and comparative sequence analysis assigns 30 catalytic functions to 26 proteins. STX biosynthesis is initiated with arginine, S-adenosylmethionine, and acetate by a new type of polyketide synthase, which can putatively perform a methylation of acetate, and a Claisen condensation reaction between propionate and arginine. Further steps involve enzymes catalyzing three heterocyclizations and various tailoring reactions that result in the numerous isoforms of saxitoxin. In the absence of a gene transfer system in these microorganisms, we have revised the description of the known STX biosynthetic pathway, with in silico functional inferences based on sxt open reading frames combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the biosynthetic intermediates. Our results indicate the evolutionary origin for the production of PSP toxins in an ancestral cyanobacterium with genetic contributions from diverse phylogenetic lineages of bacteria and provide a quantum addition to the catalytic collective available for future combinatorial biosyntheses. The distribution of these genes also supports the idea of the involvement of this gene cluster in STX production in various cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Chromatin analyses of Zymoseptoria tritici: Methods for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) Abstract: The presence or absence of specific transcription factors, chromatin remodeling machineries, chromatin modification enzymes, post-translational histone modifications and histone variants all play crucial roles in the regulation of pathogenicity genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides an important tool to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions to help understand gene regulation in the context of native chromatin. ChIP-seq is a convenient in vivo technique to identify, map and characterize occupancy of specific DNA fragments with proteins against which specific antibodies exist or which can be epitope-tagged in vivo. We optimized existing ChIP protocols for use in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and closely related sister species. Here, we provide a detailed method, underscoring which aspects of the technique are organism-specific. Library preparation for Illumina sequencing is described, as this is currently the most widely used ChIP-seq method. One approach for the analysis and visualization of representative sequence is described; improved tools for these analyses are constantly being developed. Using ChIP-seq with antibodies against H3K4me2, which is considered a mark for euchromatin or H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which are considered marks for heterochromatin, the overall distribution of euchromatin and heterochromatin in the genome of Z. tritici can be determined. Our ChIP-seq protocol was also successfully applied to Z. tritici strains with high levels of melanization or aberrant colony morphology, and to different species of the genus (Z. ardabiliae and Z. pseudotritici), suggesting that our technique is robust. The methods described here provide a powerful framework to study new aspects of chromatin biology and gene regulation in this prominent wheat pathogen.	0
Title: Analysis of ALS5 and ALS6 allelic variability in a geographically diverse collection of Candida albicans isolates Abstract: The Candida albicans ALS (agglutinin-like sequence) gene family encodes eight cell-surface glycoproteins, some of which function in adhesion to host surfaces. ALS genes have a central tandem repeat-encoding domain comprised entirely of head-to-tail copies of a conserved 108-bp sequence. The number of copies of the tandemly repeated sequence varies between C. albicans strains and often between alleles within the same strain. Because ALS alleles can encode different-sized proteins that may have different functional characteristics, defining the range of allelic variability is important. Genomic DNA from C. albicans strains representing the major genetic clades was PCR amplified to determine the number of tandemly repeated sequence copies within the ALS5 and ALS6 central domain. ALS5 alleles had 2-10 tandem repeat sequence copies (mean=4.82 copies) while ALS6 alleles had 2-8 copies (mean=4.00 copies). Despite this variability, tandem repeat copy number was stable in C. albicans strains passaged for 3000 generations. Prevalent alleles and allelic distributions varied among the clades for ALS5 and ALS6. Overall, ALS6 exhibited less variability than ALS5. ALS5 deletions can occur naturally in C. albicans via direct repeats flanking the ALS5 locus. Deletion of both ALS5 alleles was associated particularly with clades III and SA. ALS5 exhibited allelic polymorphisms in the coding region 5' of the tandem repeats; some alleles resembled ALS1, suggesting recombination between these contiguous loci. Natural deletion of ALS5 and the sequence variation within its coding region suggest relaxed selective pressure on this locus, and that Als5p function may be dispensable in C. albicans or redundant within the Als family.	0
Title: A de novo peptide hexamer with a mutable channel Abstract: The design of new proteins that expand the repertoire of natural protein structures represents a formidable challenge. Success in this area would increase understanding of protein structure and present new scaffolds that could be exploited in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here we describe the design, characterization and X-ray crystal structure of a new coiled-coil protein. The de novo sequence forms a stand-alone, parallel, six-helix bundle with a channel running through it. Although lined exclusively by hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine side chains, the 6-Å channel is permeable to water. One layer of leucine residues within the channel is mutable, accepting polar aspartic acid and histidine side chains, which leads to subdivision and organization of solvent within the lumen. Moreover, these mutants can be combined to form a stable and unique (Asp-His)(3) heterohexamer. These new structures provide a basis for engineering de novo proteins with new functions.	0
Title: Versatile Enantioselective Synthesis of Functionalized Lactones via Copper-Catalyzed Radical Oxyfunctionalization of Alkenes Abstract: A versatile method for the rapid synthesis of diverse enantiomerically enriched lactones has been developed based on Cu-catalyzed enantioselective radical oxyfunctionalization of alkenes. The scope of this strategy encompasses a series of enantioselective difunctionalization reactions: oxyazidation, oxysulfonylation, oxyarylation, diacyloxylation, and oxyalkylation. These reactions provide straightforward access to a wide range of useful chiral lactone building blocks containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic centers, which are hard to access traditionally.	0
Title: Induction and inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing by synthetic autoinducer analogs Abstract: We synthesized a library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa autoinducer analogs with variation targeted to the homoserine lactone (HSL) moiety and discovered a new agonist, 3-oxo-C(12)-(2-aminocyclohexanol), capable of activating LasR as a transcription factor. We reconstructed two sets of focused libraries against the quorum-sensing transcription factors LasR and RhlR, respectively. Opposing the prediction that both proteins should have the same binding site for HSL, it was surprising to find that these two related proteins respond to different structural motifs. This suggests that the HSL binding site differs in these proteins. We also found that subtle structural modifications to the agonists yielded compounds with antagonist activity. We performed a series of assays to show that inhibition of quorum sensing by these antagonists significantly reduced the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation.	0
Title: Discovery, Biosynthetic Origin, and Heterologous Production of Massinidine, an Antiplasmodial Alkaloid Abstract: Bacteria of the genus Massilia represent an underexplored source of bioactive natural products. Here, we report the discovery of massinidine (1), a guanidine alkaloid with antiplasmodial activity, from these microbes. The unusual scaffold of massinidine is shown to originate from l-phenylalanine, acetate, and l-arginine. Massinidine biosynthesis genes were identified in the native producer and validated through heterologous expression in Myxococcus xanthus. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that the potential for massinidine biosynthesis is distributed in various proteobacteria.	1
Title: Light activation of the LOV protein vivid generates a rapidly exchanging dimer Abstract: The fungal photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) plays an important role in the adaptation of blue-light responses in Neurospora crassa. VVD, an FAD-binding LOV (light, oxygen, voltage) protein, couples light-induced cysteinyl adduct formation at the flavin ring to conformational changes in the N-terminal cap (Ncap) of the VVD PAS domain. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and static and dynamic light scattering show that these conformational changes generate a rapidly exchanging VVD dimer, with an expanded hydrodynamic radius. A three-residue N-terminal beta-turn that assumes two different conformations in a crystal structure of a VVD C71V variant is essential for light-state dimerization. Residue substitutions at a critical hinge between the Ncap and PAS core can inhibit or enhance dimerization, whereas a Tyr to Trp substitution at the Ncap-PAS interface stabilizes the light-state dimer. Cross-linking through engineered disulfides indicates that the light-state dimer differs considerably from the dark-state dimer found in VVD crystal structures. These results verify the role of Ncap conformational changes in gating the photic response of N. crassa and indicate that LOV-LOV homo- or heterodimerization may be a mechanism for regulating light-activated gene expression.	0
Title: Identification of a Gene Cluster for the Biosynthesis of a Long, Galactose-Rich Exopolysaccharide in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Functional Analysis of the Priming Glycosyltransferase Abstract: Cell surface polysaccharides have an established role as virulence factors in human bacterial pathogens. Less documented are the biosynthesis and biological functions of surface polysaccharides in beneficial bacteria. We identified a gene cluster that encodes the enzymes and regulatory and transporter proteins for the different steps in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) of the well-documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Subsequent mutation of the welE gene, encoding the priming glycosyltransferase within this cluster, and comparative phenotypic analyses of wild-type versus mutant strains confirmed the specific function of this gene cluster in the biosynthesis of high-molecular-weight, galactose-rich heteropolymeric EPS molecules. The phenotypic analyses included monomer composition determination, estimation of the polymer length of the isolated EPS molecules, and single-molecule force spectroscopy of the surface polysaccharides. Further characterization of the welE mutant also showed that deprivation of these long, galactose-rich EPS molecules results in an increased adherence and biofilm formation capacity of L. rhamnosus GG, possibly because of less shielding of adhesins such as fimbria-like structures.	1
Title: Genetic and functional characterization of the gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of putisolvin I and II in Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 secretes two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess a surface-tension-reducing ability, and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down biofilms of Pseudomonas species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The putisolvin synthetase gene cluster (pso) and its surrounding region were isolated, sequenced and characterized. Three genes, termed psoA, psoB and psoC, were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin biosynthesis. The gene products encode the 12 modules responsible for the binding of the 12 amino acids of the putisolvin peptide moiety. Sequence data indicate that the adenylation domain of the 11th module prioritizes the recognition of Val instead of Leu or Ile and consequently favours putisolvin I production over putisolvin II. Detailed analysis of the thiolation domains suggests that the first nine modules recognize the d form of the amino acid residues while the two following modules recognize the l form and the last module the l or d form, indifferently. The psoR gene, which is located upstream of psoA, shows high similarity to luxR-type regulatory genes and is required for the expression of the pso cluster. In addition, two genes, macA and macB, located downstream of psoC were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin production or export.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Fluorinated Natural Product Nucleocidin in Streptomyces calvus Is Dependent on the bldA-Specified Leu-tRNA(UUA) Molecule Abstract: Nucleocidin is one of the very few natural products known to contain fluorine. Mysteriously, the nucleocidin producer Streptomyces calvus ATCC 13382 has not been observed to synthesize the compound since its discovery in 1956. Here, we report that complementation of S. calvus ATCC 13382 with a functional bldA-encoded Leu-tRNA(UUA) molecule restores the production of nucleocidin. Nucleocidin was detected in culture extracts by (19) F NMR spectroscopy, HPLC-ESI-MS, and HPLC-continuum source molecular absorption spectroscopy for fluorine-specific detection. The molecule was purified from a large-scale culture and definitively characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution MS. The nucleocidin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by the presence of genes encoding the 5'-O-sulfamate moiety and confirmed by gene disruption. Two of the genes within the nucleocidin biosynthetic gene cluster contain TTA codons, thus explaining the dependence on bldA and resolving a 60-year-old mystery.	1
Title: Retinal conformation governs pKa of protonated Schiff base in rhodopsin activation Abstract: We have explored the relationship between conformational energetics and the protonation state of the Schiff base in retinal, the covalently bound ligand responsible for activating the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, using quantum chemical calculations. Guided by experimental structural determinations and large-scale molecular simulations on this system, we examined rotation about each bond in the retinal polyene chain, for both the protonated and deprotonated states that represent the dark and photoactivated states, respectively. Particular attention was paid to the torsional degrees of freedom that determine the shape of the molecule, and hence its interactions with the protein binding pocket. While most torsional degrees of freedom in retinal are characterized by large energetic barriers that minimize structural fluctuations under physiological temperatures, the C6-C7 dihedral defining the relative orientation of the β-ionone ring to the polyene chain has both modest barrier heights and a torsional energy surface that changes dramatically with protonation of the Schiff base. This surprising coupling between conformational degrees of freedom and protonation state is further quantified by calculations of the pKa as a function of the C6-C7 dihedral angle. Notably, pKa shifts of greater than two units arise from torsional fluctuations observed in molecular dynamics simulations of the full ligand-protein-membrane system. It follows that fluctuations in the protonation state of the Schiff base occur prior to forming the activated MII state. These new results shed light on important mechanistic aspects of retinal conformational changes that are involved in the activation of rhodopsin in the visual process.	0
Title: An overproduction of astellolides induced by genetic disruption of chromatin-remodeling factors in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae is an important industrial mold. Recent genomic analysis indicated that A. oryzae has a large number of biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites (SMs), but many of the SMs they produce have not been identified. For better understanding of SMs production by A. oryzae, we screened a gene-disruption library of transcription factors including chromatin-remodeling factors and found two gene disruptions that show similarly altered SM production profiles. One is a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans cclA, a component of the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex of proteins associated with Set1 complex, and the other, sppA, is an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPP1, another component of a complex of proteins associated with Set1 complex. The cclA and sppA disruptions in A. oryzae are deficient in trimethylation of H3K4. Furthermore, one of the SMs that increased in the cclA disruptant was identified as astellolide F (14-deacetyl astellolide B). These data indicate that both cclA and sppA affect production of SMs including astellolides by affecting the methylation status of H3K4 in A. oryzae.	1
Title: Analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyether antibiotic monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis and evidence for the role of monB and monC genes in oxidative cyclization Abstract: The analysis of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (97 kbp) for the polyether ionophore monensin from Streptomyces cinnamonensis has revealed a modular polyketide synthase composed of eight separate multienzyme subunits housing a total of 12 extension modules, and flanked by numerous other genes for which a plausible function in monensin biosynthesis can be ascribed. Deletion of essentially all these clustered genes specifically abolished monensin production, while overexpression in S. cinnamonensis of the putative pathway-specific regulatory gene monR led to a fivefold increase in monensin production. Experimental support is presented for a recently-proposed mechanism, for oxidative cyclization of a linear polyketide intermediate, involving four enzymes, the products of monBI, monBII, monCI and monCII. In frame deletion of either of the individual genes monCII (encoding a putative cyclase) or monBII (encoding a putative novel isomerase) specifically abolished monensin production. Also, heterologous expression of monCI, encoding a flavin-linked epoxidase, in S. coelicolor was shown to significantly increase the ability of S. coelicolor to epoxidize linalool, a model substrate for the presumed linear polyketide intermediate in monensin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Cyanobacterial polyketide synthase docking domains: a tool for engineering natural product biosynthesis Abstract: Modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are versatile biosynthetic systems that initiate, successively elongate, and modify acyl chains. Intermediate transfer between modules is mediated via docking domains, which are attractive targets for PKS pathway engineering to produce natural product analogs. We identified a class 2 docking domain in cyanobacterial PKSs and determined crystal structures for two docking domain pairs, revealing a distinct class 2 docking strategy for promoting intermediate transfer. The selectivity of class 2 docking interactions, demonstrated in binding and biochemical assays, could be altered by mutagenesis. We determined the ideal fusion location for exchanging class 1 and class 2 docking domains and demonstrated effective polyketide chain transfer in heterologous modules. Thus, class 2 docking domains are tools for rational bioengineering of a broad range of PKSs containing either class 1 or 2 docking domains.	0
Title: Application of an Acyl-CoA Ligase from Streptomyces aizunensis for Lactam Biosynthesis Abstract: ε-Caprolactam and δ-valerolactam are important commodity chemicals used in the manufacture of nylons, with millions of tons produced annually. Biological production of these highly valued chemicals has been limited due to a lack of enzymes that cyclize ω-amino fatty acid precursors to corresponding lactams under ambient conditions. In this study, we demonstrated production of these chemicals using ORF26, an acyl-CoA ligase involved in the biosynthesis of ECO-02301 in Streptomyces aizunensis. This enzyme has a broad substrate spectrum and can cyclize 4-aminobutyric acid into γ-butyrolactam, 5-aminovaleric acid into δ-valerolactam and 6-aminocaproic acid into ε-caprolactam. Recombinant E. coli expressing ORF26 produced valerolactam and caprolactam when 5-aminovaleric acid and 6-aminocaproic acid were added to the culture medium. Upon coexpressing ORF26 with a metabolic pathway that produced 5-aminovaleric acid from lysine, we were able to demonstrate production of δ-valerolactam from lysine.	0
Title: A novel antifungal antibiotic, FR-900848. I. Production, isolation, physico-chemical and biological properties Abstract: Streptoverticillium fervens produced a new antibiotic, FR-900848, which has a high specific activity against filamentous fungi. Purified by solvent extraction and column chromatography, the compound appears as colorless crystals. Its structure is C32H43N3O6, which consists of 5'-amino-5'-deoxy-5,6-dihydrouridine with an unsaturated fatty acid having unprecedented four serial and one isolated cyclopropane rings.	0
Title: Enzymatic function of the nor-1 protein in aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus Abstract: The nor-1 gene is involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus and was predicted to encode a norsolorinic acid ketoreductase. Recombinant Nor-1 expressed in Escherichia coli converted the 1' keto group of norsolorinic acid to the 1' hydroxyl group of averantin in crude E. coli cell extracts in the presence of NADPH. The results confirm that Nor-1 functions as a ketoreductase in vitro.	0
Title: Genome-Based Discovery of Enantiomeric Pentacyclic Sesterterpenes Catalyzed by Fungal Bifunctional Terpene Synthases Abstract: Genome-based discovery of two previously unreported fungal bifunctional terpene synthases (BFTSs) from phytopathogenic fungi are reported: FoFS catalyzing the formation of fusoxypenes A-C (1-3) and (-)-astellatene (4) and AtAS capable of synthesizing preaspterpenacid I (6). Interestingly, FoFS and AtAS catalyzed the formation of enantiomeric sesterterpenes with a 5-6-7-3-5 ring system. C22-oxidative modification of preaspterpenacid I by AtP450 was characterized as well. Plausible cyclization pathways of the fusoxypenes were illustrated by DFT calculations.	1
Title: Expression and promoter characterization of BbPacC, a pH response transcription factor gene of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: To survive, the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, which shows promise as a biocontrol agent for a variety of pests, including agricultural and forestry pests and vectors of human pathogens, must tailor gene expression to the particular pH of its environment. The pH response transcription factor gene BbPacC and its flanking sequence were cloned from this fungus. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed that it is highly induced by alkaline pH and salt stress, and the expression level achieved twice that of the housekeeping gene γ-actin. A microfluorometric assay indicated that the 1479 bp promoter region could activate the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the same conditions. Truncation analysis showed that the 1479, 1274, 1040, 888 and 742 bp promoters have similar efficiencies in activating expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS). The GUS activities of corresponding transformants reached approximately 50 % that of those containing the strong constitutive promoter PtrpC. A truncation upstream at the -572 bp position (referenced to the translation start codon ATG), however, resulted in a significant loss of GUS activity. Both the upstream absences of the -502 and -387 bp positions caused almost complete loss of GUS activity. These results suggest that PPacC is an efficient, alkaline, and salt-inducible promoter, the core cis-elements are mainly located within the -742 to -502 bp region, and promoters equal to or longer than 742 bp may be feasible for regulating gene expression in response to an ambient pH or salt stress.	0
Title: Soluble expression in Escherichia coli of active human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isoform 4B2 in fusion with maltose-binding protein Abstract: Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4B2 (hPDE4B2) fused to maltose-binding-protein (MBP-hPDE4B2) was investigated. hPDE4B2 DNA amplified via nested RT-PCR with total RNAs from U937 cells was ligated with pMAL-p2x. After induction at 18 degrees C for 16 h, soluble MBP-hPDE4B2 was produced in E. coli. MBP-hPDE4B2 after amylose-resin chromatography showed 35% homogeneity, and its Michaelis-Menten constant was 10+/-2 microM (n=3). Rolipram had a dissociation constant of 9+/-2 nM (n=2), and zinc ion was a potent inhibitor. Hence, MBP-hPDE4B2 was expressed in E. coli as a soluble active protein.	0
Title: Human G-CSF synthesis using stress-responsive bacterial proteins Abstract: We previously reported that under the stress condition caused by the addition of 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, a thiol-specific oxidant, to growing cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), a population of stress-responsive proteins [peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PpiB), bacterioferritin (Bfr), putative HTH-type transcriptional regulator yjdC (YjdC), dihydrofolate reductase (FolA), chemotaxis protein cheZ (CheZ), and glutathione synthetase (GshB)] were significantly upregulated when compared with the nonstress condition. When those stress-responsive proteins were used as fusion partners for the expression of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF), the solubility of hG-CSF was dramatically enhanced in E. coli cytoplasm, whereas almost all of the directly expressed hG-CSF were aggregated to inclusion bodies. In addition, the spectra of circular dichroism measured with the purified hG-CSF were identical to that of standard hG-CSF, implying that the synthesized hG-CSF has native conformation. These results indicate that the bacterial stress-responsive proteins could be potent fusion expression partners for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm.	0
Title: The gene cluster aur1 for the angucycline antibiotic auricin is located on a large linear plasmid pSA3239 in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: We previously identified a polyketide synthase gene cluster, aur1, responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. A sequence analysis of the aur1 flanking regions revealed the presence of several genes encoding proteins homologous to those for Streptomyces linear plasmid replication, partitioning and telomere-binding. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis detected the single, 240-kb linear plasmid, pSA3239, in S. aureofaciens CCM3239. The presence of the auricin cluster in pSA3239 was confirmed by several approaches. In addition to aur1, pSA3239 also carries a large number of regulatory genes, and two gene clusters involved in the production of secondary metabolites: the aur2 cluster for an unknown secondary metabolite and the bpsA cluster for the blue pigment indigoidine.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of hygrocins, antitumor naphthoquinone ansamycins produced by Streptomyces sp. LZ35 Abstract: Hygrocins are naphthoquinone ansamycins with significant antitumor activities. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the hygrocin biosynthetic gene cluster (hgc) in Streptomyces sp. LZ35. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed based on bioinformatics analysis of the hgc genes and intermediates accumulated in selected gene disruption mutants. One of the steps during the biosynthesis of hygrocins is a Baeyer–Villiger oxidation between C5 and C6, catalyzed by luciferase- like monooxygenase homologue Hgc3. Hgc3 represents the founding member of a previously uncharacterized family of enzymes acting as Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases.	1
Title: A single Streptomyces symbiont makes multiple antifungals to support the fungus farming ant Acromyrmex octospinosus Abstract: Attine ants are dependent on a cultivated fungus for food and use antibiotics produced by symbiotic Actinobacteria as weedkillers in their fungus gardens. Actinobacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis have been isolated from attine ant nests and shown to confer protection against a range of microfungal weeds. In previous work on the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus we isolated a Streptomyces strain that produces candicidin, consistent with another report that attine ants use Streptomyces-produced candicidin in their fungiculture. Here we report the genome analysis of this Streptomyces strain and identify multiple antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate, using gene disruptions and mass spectrometry, that this single strain has the capacity to make candicidin and multiple antimycin compounds. Although antimycins have been known for >60 years we report the sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the first time. Crucially, disrupting the candicidin and antimycin gene clusters in the same strain had no effect on bioactivity against a co-evolved nest pathogen called Escovopsis that has been identified in ∼30% of attine ant nests. Since the Streptomyces strain has strong bioactivity against Escovopsis we conclude that it must make additional antifungal(s) to inhibit Escovopsis. However, candicidin and antimycins likely offer protection against other microfungal weeds that infect the attine fungal gardens. Thus, we propose that the selection of this biosynthetically prolific strain from the natural environment provides A. octospinosus with broad spectrum activity against Escovopsis and other microfungal weeds.	1
Title: Human protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is a type III enzyme forming ω-NG-monomethylated arginine residues Abstract: Full-length human protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli was initially found to generate only ω-N(G)-monomethylated arginine residues in small peptides, suggesting that it is a type III enzyme. A later study, however, characterized fusion proteins of PRMT7 expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as a type II/type I enzyme, capable of producing symmetrically dimethylated arginine (type II activity) as well as small amounts of asymmetric dimethylarginine (type I activity). We have sought to clarify the enzymatic activity of human PRMT7. We analyzed the in vitro methylation products of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PRMT7 fusion protein with robust activity using a variety of arginine-containing synthetic peptides and protein substrates, including a GST fusion with the N-terminal domain of fibrillarin (GST-GAR), myelin basic protein, and recombinant human histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Regardless of the methylation reaction conditions (incubation time, reaction volume, and substrate concentration), we found that PRMT7 only produces ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine with these substrates. In control experiments, we showed that mammalian GST-PRMT1 and Myc-PRMT5 were, unlike PRMT7, able to dimethylate both peptide P-SmD3 and SmB/D3 to give the expected asymmetric and symmetric products, respectively. These experiments show that PRMT7 is indeed a type III human methyltransferase capable of forming only ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine, not asymmetric ω-N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine or symmetric ω-N(G),N(G')-dimethylarginine, under the conditions tested.	0
Title: Catalytic asymmetric γ-alkylation of carbonyl compounds via stereoconvergent Suzuki cross-couplings Abstract: With the aid of a chiral nickel catalyst, enantioselective γ- (and δ-) alkylations of carbonyl compounds can be achieved through the coupling of γ-haloamides with alkylboranes. In addition to primary alkyl nucleophiles, for the first time for an asymmetric cross-coupling of an unactivated alkyl electrophile, an arylmetal, a boronate ester, and a secondary (cyclopropyl) alkylmetal compound are shown to couple with significant enantioselectivity. A mechanistic study indicates that cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond of the electrophile is irreversible under the conditions for asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation.	0
Title: Synthesis and regioselective functionalization of perhalogenated BODIPYs Abstract: Three perhalogenated BODIPYs (1b-3b), bearing chloro and bromo groups at all carbon positions, were synthesized and characterized. The reactivity of BODIPY 3b was investigated under Stille cross-coupling reactions, and single crystal X-ray analysis was used to confirm the regioselectivity of the reactions. Further substitution at the boron atom produced nona-functionalized BODIPYs 7a,b, which show 676 and 739 nm emissions with 91 and 100 nm Stokes shifts, respectively.	0
Title: Nodularin, a cyanobacterial toxin, is synthesized in planta by symbiotic Nostoc sp Abstract: The nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Nostoc, is a commonly occurring cyanobacterium often found in symbiotic associations. We investigated the potential of cycad cyanobacterial endosymbionts to synthesize microcystin/nodularin. Endosymbiont DNA was screened for the aminotransferase domain of the toxin biosynthesis gene clusters. Five endosymbionts carrying the gene were screened for bioactivity. Extracts of two isolates inhibited protein phosphatase 2A and were further analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)/MS. Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' both contained nodularin. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HESI-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of nodularin at 9.55±2.4 ng μg-1 chlorophyll a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and 12.5±8.4 ng μg-1 Chl a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' extracts. Further scans indicated the presence of the rare isoform [L-Har(2)] nodularin, which contains L-homoarginine instead of L-arginine. Nodularin was also present at 1.34±0.74 ng ml(-1) (approximately 3 pmol per g plant ww) in the methanol root extracts of M. riedlei MZ65, while the presence of [L-Har(2)] nodularin in the roots of M. serpentina MZ73 was suggested by HPLC HESI-MS/MS analysis. The ndaA-B and ndaF genomic regions were sequenced to confirm the presence of the hybrid polyketide/non-ribosomal gene cluster. A seven amino-acid insertion into the NdaA-C1 domain of N. spumigena NSOR10 protein was observed in all endosymbiont-derived sequences, suggesting the transfer of the nda cluster from N. spumigena to terrestrial Nostoc species. This study demonstrates the synthesis of nodularin and [L-Har(2)] nodularin in a non-Nodularia species and the production of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin by a symbiont in planta.	1
Title: Porphyromonas gingivalis short fimbriae are regulated by a FimS/FimR two-component system Abstract: Porphyromonas gingivalis possesses two distinct fimbriae. The long (FimA) fimbriae have been extensively studied. Expression of the fimA gene is tightly controlled by a two-component system (FimS/FimR) through a cascade regulation. The short (Mfa1) fimbriae are less understood. The authors have recently demonstrated that both fimbriae are required for formation of P. gingivalis biofilms. Here, the novel finding that FimR, a member of the two-component regulatory system, is a transcriptional activator of the mfa1 gene is promoted. Unlike the regulatory mechanism of FimA by FimR, this regulation of the mfa1 gene is accomplished by FimR directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.	0
Title: Development of parathyroid hormone- and calcitonin-activated adenylate cyclases in embryonic chicken limb and in cultured cells from embryonic chicken limb Abstract: Activation of adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin was measured as a function of stage of development in embryonic chicken limb buds. Responsiveness to both hormones develops in the tissue at the time when nascent bone is forming. In addition, a temporal sequence of development of hormone response was observed, with a PTH-activated adenylate cyclase appearing earlier than the calcitonin-activated enzyme. The responsiveness to the two hormones was additive, indicating the presence of two receptor populations. Undifferentiated cells obtained from limb buds prior to appearance of hormonal responsiveness were cultured and were found to develop a PTH-activated adenylate cyclase in vitro. However, a calcitonin-stimulated enzyme did not appear in such cultures. The PTH-activated enzyme was found to be similar to that present in bone in regard to its sensitivity to PTH. The enzyme did not respond to other hormones, and myoblast cultures did not develop a PTH-activated adenylate cyclase, indicating that a true bone adenylate cyclase was being measured.	0
Title: Scribble sub-cellular localization modulates recruitment of YES1 to regulate YAP1 phosphorylation Abstract: The multi-domain scaffolding protein Scribble (Scrib) regulates cell polarity and growth signaling at cell-cell junctions. In epithelial cancers, Scrib mislocalization and overexpression paradoxically transform Scrib from a basolateral tumor suppressor to a cytosolic driver of tumorigenicity. To address the function of Scrib (mis)localization, a Scrib-HaloTag fusion was genome engineered in polarized epithelial cells. Expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transcription factor Snail displaced Scrib-HaloTag from cell junctions, mirroring the mislocalization observed in cancers. Interestingly, Snail expression promotes Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1) nuclear localization independent of hippo pathway-regulated YAP-S127 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Scrib HaloPROTAC degradation attenuates YAP1-Y357 phosphorylation. Halo-ligand affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis identified the Src family kinase YES1 as a mislocalized Scrib interaction partner, preferentially recruiting the kinase active and open global conformation (αC helix in). Altogether, mislocalized Scrib enhances YAP1 phosphorylation by scaffolding active YES1.	0
Title: Crystallographic analysis of human serum albumin complexed with 4Z,15E-bilirubin-IXalpha Abstract: Bilirubin, an insoluble yellow-orange pigment derived from heme catabolism, accumulates to toxic levels in individuals with impaired or immature liver function. The resulting jaundice may be managed with phototherapy to isomerize the biosynthetic 4Z,15Z-bilirubin-IXalpha to more soluble and excretable isomers, such as 4Z,15E-bilirubin. Bilirubin and its configurational isomers are transported to the liver by human serum albumin (HSA) but their precise binding location(s) on the protein have yet to be determined. To investigate the molecular details of their interaction, we co-crystallised bilirubin with HSA. Strikingly, the crystal structure--determined to 2.42 A resolution--revealed the 4Z,15E-bilirubin-IXalpha isomer bound to an L-shaped pocket in sub-domain IB. We also determined the co-crystal structure of HSA complexed with fusidic acid, an antibiotic that competitively displaces bilirubin from the protein, and showed that it binds to the same pocket. These results provide the first crystal structure of a natural bilirubin pigment bound to serum albumin, challenge some of the present conceptions about HSA-bilirubin interactions, and provide a sound structural framework for finally resolving the long-standing question of where 4Z,15Z-bilirubin-IXalpha binds to the protein.	0
Title: Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination Abstract: The neural pathways by which information about the acoustic world reaches the auditory cortex are well characterized, but how auditory representations are transformed into motor commands is not known. Here we use a perceptual decision-making task in rats to study this transformation. We demonstrate the role of corticostriatal projection neurons in auditory decisions by manipulating the activity of these neurons in rats performing an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Targeted channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated stimulation of corticostriatal neurons during the task biased decisions in the direction predicted by the frequency tuning of the stimulated neurons, whereas archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-mediated inactivation biased decisions in the opposite direction. Striatal projections are widespread in cortex and may provide a general mechanism for the control of motor decisions by sensory cortex.	0
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Himeic Acid A: A Ubiquitin-Activating Enzyme (E1) Inhibitor in Aspergillus japonicus MF275 Abstract: Himeic acid A, which is produced by the marine fungus Aspergillus japonicus MF275, is a specific inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To elucidate the mechanism of himeic acid biosynthesis, feeding experiments with labeled precursors have been performed. The long fatty acyl side chain attached to the pyrone ring is of polyketide origin, whereas the amide substituent is derived from leucine. These results suggest that a polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase (PKS-NRPS) is involved in himeic acid biosynthesis. A candidate gene cluster was selected from the results of genome sequencing analysis. Disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation confirms that HimA PKS-NRPS is involved in himeic acid biosynthesis. Thus, the him biosynthetic gene cluster for himeic acid in A. japonicus MF275 has been identified.	1
Title: Insect antimicrobial peptides and their applications Abstract: Insects are one of the major sources of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs). Since observation of antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of pupae from the giant silk moths Samia Cynthia and Hyalophora cecropia in 1974 and purification of first insect AMP (cecropin) from H. cecropia pupae in 1980, over 150 insect AMPs have been purified or identified. Most insect AMPs are small and cationic, and they show activities against bacteria and/or fungi, as well as some parasites and viruses. Insect AMPs can be classified into four families based on their structures or unique sequences: the α-helical peptides (cecropin and moricin), cysteine-rich peptides (insect defensin and drosomycin), proline-rich peptides (apidaecin, drosocin, and lebocin), and glycine-rich peptides/proteins (attacin and gloverin). Among insect AMPs, defensins, cecropins, proline-rich peptides, and attacins are common, while gloverins and moricins have been identified only in Lepidoptera. Most active AMPs are small peptides of 20-50 residues, which are generated from larger inactive precursor proteins or pro-proteins, but gloverins (~14 kDa) and attacins (~20 kDa) are large antimicrobial proteins. In this mini-review, we will discuss current knowledge and recent progress in several classes of insect AMPs, including insect defensins, cecropins, attacins, lebocins and other proline-rich peptides, gloverins, and moricins, with a focus on structural-functional relationships and their potential applications.	0
Title: An Uncommon Type II PKS Catalyzes Biosynthesis of Aryl Polyene Pigments Abstract: Aryl polyene (APE) pigments are a widely distributed class of bacterial polyketides. So far, little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds, which are produced by a novel type II polyketide synthase (PKS). We have identified all enzymes involved in APE biosynthesis and determined their peculiar functions. The biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro, and ACP-bound intermediates were assigned for each reaction step by HPLC-MS. Native mass spectrometry experiments identified four stable complexes: the acyl-carrier proteins ApeE and ApeF bound to the thioesterase ApeK, the dehydratases ApeI and ApeP, and the ketosynthase ApeO in complex with its chain-length factor ApeC. X-ray structures of the heterodimeric ApeO:ApeC and ApeI:ApeP complexes depict striking protein-protein interactions. Altogether, our study elucidated mechanistic aspects of APE biosynthesis that unifies elements of type II fatty acid and PKS systems, but in addition includes novel enzyme complexes.	1
Title: Simian virus 40 late gene expression is regulated by members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily Abstract: Transcription of the late genes of simian virus 40 (SV40) is repressed during the early phase of the lytic cycle of infection of binding of cellular factors, called IBP-s, to the SV40 late promoter; repression is relieved after the onset of viral DNA replication by titration of these repressors. Preliminary data indicated that one of the major components of IBP-s was human estrogen-related receptor 1 (hERR1). We show here that several members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, including testis receptor 2, thyroid receptor alpha 1 in combination with retinoid X receptor alpha, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors 1 and 2 (COUP-TF1 and COUP-TF2), as well as hERR1, possess the properties of IBP-s. These receptors bind specifically to hormone receptor binding sites present in the SV40 major late promoter. Recombinant COUP-TF1 specifically represses transcription from the SV40 major late promoter in a cell-free transcription system. Expression of COUP-TF1, COUP-TF2, or hERR1 in monkey cells results in repression of the SV40 late promoter, but not the early promoter, in the absence of the virally encoded large tumor antigen. Overexpression of COUP-TF1 leads to a delay in the early-to-late switch in SV40 gene expression during the lytic cycle of infection. Thus, members of this superfamily can play major direct roles in regulating expression of SV40. Possibly, natural or synthetic ligands to these receptors can serve as antiviral drugs. Our findings also provide the basis for the development of assays to screen for the ligands to testis receptor 2 and hERR1.	0
Title: New anthracycline metabolites from mutant strains of Streptomyces galilaeus MA144-M1. I. Isolation and characterization of various blocked mutants Abstract: During genetic study on obtaining high-yield variants of aclacinomycin A-producer, a variety of blocked mutants were isolated from Streptomyces galilaeus MA144-M1 and were characterized. The isolated mutants included those which accumulated only specific components of parental glycosides, those which produced new aklavinone glycosides devoid of parental rhodosamine or both rhodinose and cinerulose, those which produced non-glycosidic aglycones, and antibiotic-negative mutants, some of which were able to glycosidate exogenous aklavinone. By biotransformation with the aglycone feeding culture, the precursor activity of new aglycones was also tested. From the results and in relation to the characterization of isolated mutants, the biosynthetic pathway of aclacinomycin A and related antibiotics is discussed.	0
Title: Solvent and Temperature Probes of the Long-Range Electron-Transfer Step in Tyramine β-Monooxygenase: Demonstration of a Long-Range Proton-Coupled Electron-Transfer Mechanism Abstract: Tyramine β-monooxygenase (TβM) belongs to a family of physiologically important dinuclear copper monooxygenases that function with a solvent-exposed active site. To accomplish each enzymatic turnover, an electron transfer (ET) must occur between two solvent-separated copper centers. In wild-type TβM, this event is too fast to be rate limiting. However, we have recently shown [Osborne, R. L.; et al. Biochemistry 2013, 52, 1179] that the Tyr216Ala variant of TβM leads to rate-limiting ET. In this study, we present a pH-rate profile study of Tyr216Ala, together with deuterium oxide solvent kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). A solvent KIE of 2 on kcat is found in a region where kcat is pH/pD independent. As a control, the variant Tyr216Trp, for which ET is not rate determining, displays a solvent KIE of unity. We conclude, therefore, that the observed solvent KIE arises from the rate-limiting ET step in the Tyr216Ala variant, and show how small solvent KIEs (ca. 2) can be fully accommodated from equilibrium effects within the Marcus equation. To gain insight into the role of the enzyme in the long-range ET step, a temperature dependence study was also pursued. The small enthalpic barrier of ET (Ea = 3.6 kcal/mol) implicates a significant entropic barrier, which is attributed to the requirement for extensive rearrangement of the inter-copper environment during PCET catalyzed by the Tyr216Ala variant. The data lead to the proposal of a distinct inter-domain pathway for PCET in the dinuclear copper monooxygenases.	0
Title: Novel key metabolites reveal further branching of the roquefortine/meleagrin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Metabolic profiling and structural elucidation of novel secondary metabolites obtained from derived deletion strains of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum were used to reassign various previously ascribed synthetase genes of the roquefortine/meleagrin pathway to their corresponding products. Next to the structural characterization of roquefortine F and neoxaline, which are for the first time reported for P. chrysogenum, we identified the novel metabolite roquefortine L, including its degradation products, harboring remarkable chemical structures. Their biosynthesis is discussed, questioning the exclusive role of glandicoline A as key intermediate in the pathway. The results reveal that further enzymes of this pathway are rather unspecific and catalyze more than one reaction, leading to excessive branching in the pathway with meleagrin and neoxaline as end products of two branches.	1
Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro synergy of polymyxins and carbapenems Abstract: Our objective was to examine the evidence of in vitro synergy of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. All studies examining in vitro interactions of antibiotic combinations consisting of any carbapenem with colistin or polymyxin B against any GNB were used. A broad search was conducted with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. Synergy rates, defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index of ≤0.5 or a >2-log reduction in CFU, were pooled separately for time-kill, checkerboard, and Etest methods in a mixed-effect meta-analysis of rates. We examined whether the synergy rate depended on the testing method, type of antibiotic, bacteria, and resistance to carbapenems. Pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown. Thirty-nine published studies and 15 conference proceeding were included, reporting on 246 different tests on 1,054 bacterial isolates. In time-kill studies, combination therapy showed synergy rates of 77% (95% CI, 64 to 87%) for Acinetobacter baumannii, 44% (95% CI, 30 to 59%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 50% (95% CI, 30 to 69%) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with low antagonism rates for all. Doripenem showed high synergy rates for all three bacteria. For A. baumannii, meropenem was more synergistic than imipenem, whereas for P. aeruginosa the opposite was true. Checkerboard and Etest studies generally reported lower synergy rates than time-kill studies. The use of combination therapy led to less resistance development in vitro. The combination of a carbapenem with a polymyxin against GNB, especially A. baumannii, is supported in vitro by high synergy rates, with low antagonism and less resistance development. These findings should be examined in clinical studies.	0
Title: Preferential selection of deletion mutations of the outer membrane lipoprotein gene of Escherichia coli by globomycin Abstract: Globomycin is an antibiotic which inhibits the processing of the prolipoprotein. Eighty globomycin-resistant mutants were independently isolated from Escherichia coli K-12 which had a deletion mutation in chromosomal lipoprotein gene (lpp), but contained a plasmid carrying the wild-type lpp gene. Twenty-six of the mutants did not have the lipoprotein in the membrane fractions. From the analysis of the plasmids of these mutants, all of the lipoprotein-deficient mutations were found to be due to deletion mutations around the lpp gene.	0
Title: Proteomic Analysis of Single Mammalian Cells Enabled by Microfluidic Nanodroplet Sample Preparation and Ultrasensitive NanoLC-MS Abstract: We report on the quantitative proteomic analysis of single mammalian cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was employed to deposit cells into a newly developed nanodroplet sample processing chip, after which samples were analyzed by ultrasensitive nanoLC-MS. An average of circa 670 protein groups were confidently identified from single HeLa cells, which is a far greater level of proteome coverage for single cells than has been previously reported. We demonstrate that the single-cell proteomics platform can be used to differentiate cell types from enzyme-dissociated human lung primary cells and identify specific protein markers for epithelial and mesenchymal cells.	0
Title: Engineering the redox potential over a wide range within a new class of FeS proteins Abstract: MitoNEET is a newly discovered mitochondrial protein and a target of the TZD class of antidiabetes drugs. MitoNEET is homodimeric with each protomer binding a [2Fe-2S] center through a rare 3-Cys and 1-His coordination geometry. Both the fold and the coordination of the [2Fe-2S] centers suggest that it could have novel properties compared to other known [2Fe-2S] proteins. We tested the robustness of mitoNEET to mutation and the range over which the redox potential (E(M)) could be tuned. We found that the protein could tolerate an array of mutations that modified the E(M) of the [2Fe-2S] center over a range of ∼700 mV, which is the largest E(M) range engineered in an FeS protein and, importantly, spans the cellular redox range (+200 to -300 mV). These properties make mitoNEET potentially useful for both physiological studies and industrial applications as a stable, water-soluble, redox agent.	0
Title: Waikikiamides A-C: Complex Diketopiperazine Dimer and Diketopiperazine-Polyketide Hybrids from a Hawaiian Marine Fungal Strain Aspergillus sp. FM242 Abstract: Waikikiamides A-C (1-3), structurally complex diketopiperazine derivatives, and putative biogenic precursors, (+)-semivioxanthin (4), notoamide F (5), and (-)-notoamide A (6), were isolated from Aspergillus sp. FM242. 1 and 2, bearing a hendecacyclic ring system, represent a novel skeleton. 3 features the first unique heterodimer of two notoamide analogs with an N-O-C bridge. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibit antiproliferative activity with IC50 values in the range of 0.56 to 1.86 μM. The gene clusters mined from the sequenced genome support their putative biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Production of Diverse Beauveriolide Analogs in Closely Related Fungi: a Rare Case of Fungal Chemodiversity Abstract: Fungal chemodiversity is well known in part due to the production of diverse analogous compounds by a single biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Usually, similar or the same metabolites are produced by closely related fungal species under a given condition, the foundation of fungal chemotaxonomy. Here, we report a rare case of the production of the cyclodepsipeptide beauveriolides (BVDs) in three insect-pathogenic fungi. We found that the more closely related fungi Beauveria bassiana and Beauveria brongniartii produced structurally distinct analogs of BVDs, whereas the less-close relatives B. brongniartii and Cordyceps militaris biosynthesized structurally similar congeners under the same growth condition. It was verified that a conserved BGC containing four genes is responsible for BVD biosynthesis in three fungi, including a polyketide synthase (PKS) for the production of 3-hydroxy fatty acids (FAs) with chain length variations. In contrast to BVD production patterns, phylogenetic analysis of the BGC enzymes or enzyme domains largely resulted in the congruence relationship with fungal speciation. Feeding assays demonstrated that an FA with a chain length of eight carbon atoms was preferentially utilized, whereas an FA with a chain longer than 10 carbon atoms could not be used as a substrate for BVD biosynthesis. Insect survival assays suggested that the contribution of BVDs to fungal virulence might be associated with the susceptibility of insect species. The results of this study enrich the knowledge of fungal secondary metabolic diversity that can question the reliability of fungal chemotaxonomy.IMPORTANCE Fungal chemotaxonomy is an approach to classify fungi based on the fungal production profile of metabolites, especially the secondary metabolites. We found an atypical example that could question the reliability of fungal chemical classifications in this study, i.e., the more closely related entomopathogenic species Beauveria bassiana and Beauveria brongniartii produced structurally different congeners of the cyclodepsipeptide beauveriolides, whereas the rather divergent species B. brongniartii and Cordyceps militaris biosynthesized similar analogs under the same growth condition. The conserved biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) containing four genes present in each species is responsible for beauveriolide production. In contrast to the compound formation profiles, the phylogenies of biosynthetic enzymes or enzymatic domains show associations with fungal speciation. Dependent on the insect species, production of beauveriolides may contribute to fungal virulence against the susceptible insect hosts. The findings in this study augment the diversity of fungal secondary metabolisms.	1
Title: A putative ABC transporter gene, ZRA1, is required for zearalenone production in Gibberella zeae Abstract: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Fusarium species and causes estrogenic disorders in humans and animals. Recent studies have identified the ZEA biosynthesis gene cluster in F. graminearum, but other genes such as transporters responsible for ZEA export have not been identified in the cluster. In this study, we performed microarray analyses from the wild-type strain with and without ZEA supplementation and ZEA-nonproducing strain zeb2 to discover other genes responsible for ZEA biosynthesis. Three putative ABC transporters were significantly down-regulated in the zeb2 and were under positive regulation of the ZEB2 gene, which functions as a transcriptional activator for ZEA production in this fungus. However, only one gene (ZRA1) was found to be up-regulated by 20-fold in the wild-type strain supplemented with ZEA, and deletion of ZRA1 resulted in reduced ZEA production. Deletions of the other two genes showed similar ZEA productions as the wild-type strain. ZRA1 localized to the plasma membrane and vacuoles indicating possible roles of ZRA1 as a transporter. This study indicated that ZRA1 is involved in ZEA production and shares a common regulatory mode with ZEA cluster genes by ZEB2.	1
Title: Phorbol ester and calcium act synergistically to enhance neurotransmitter release by brain neurons in culture Abstract: Preincubation of intact fetal brain neurons in culture with the phorbol ester TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate) in the presence of calcium, resulted in the enhancement of the depolarization-induced, Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release by the cells. This effect was due to a marked decrease in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ required to provoke the release. The concentration of Ca2+ needed to produce half-maximal release shifted from approx 0.1 mM in the absence of TPA to 0.018 mM in its presence. This activity of TPA was concentration-dependent (half-maximal effect at 4 nM TPA) and was also dependent on the presence of calcium during the preincubation period. The TPA-induced enhancement of the stimulated release was also observed when Ca2+ entry into the depolarized cells was partially inhibited by Co2+. The results suggest that TPA acts synergistically with Ca2+ to activate neuronal component(s) involved in Ca2+-dependent neurosecretion.	0
Title: A blaVEB-1 variant, blaVEB-6, associated with repeated elements in a complex genetic structure Abstract: bla(VEB-6) was found on the Proteus mirabilis chromosome in a context similar to those of bla(VEB-1a) and bla(VEB-1b), in a truncated gene cassette flanked by 135-bp elements and duplications of the 3'-conserved segment of class 1 integrons. A linked aacA4-aadB-dfrA1-orfC cassette array includes components of Tn1331, illustrating the complex mosaicism of multiresistance regions.	0
Title: Synthesis of envelope polypeptides by Haemophilus influenzae during development of competence for genetic transformation Abstract: Six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 95,000, 90,000, 80,000, 67,000, 64,000, and 43,000 were found to be characteristic of the cell envelopes of competent Haemophilus influenzae, and were synthesized entirely during the period of competence development. Two polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 58,500 and 40,500 were synthesized during growth as well as during competence development, but were only associated with the envelope fraction of cells that had developed competence. The kinetics of synthesis of the competence-related envelope polypeptides showed a lag period of approximately 20 min. The observation of this lag period raises the question as to whether some of these competence-related polypeptides might be involved in the process of deoxyribonucleic acid uptake, since the development of this property also exhibits a sigmoid time course during competence development.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics Abstract: The advances in bioorthogonal ligation methods have provided new opportunities for proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins, posttranslational modifications, and specific enzyme families using azide/alkyne-functionalized chemical reporters and activity-based probes. Efficient enrichment and elution of azide/alkyne-labeled proteins with selectively cleavable affinity tags are essential for protein identification and quantification applications. Here, we report the synthesis and comparative analysis of Na₂S₂O₄-cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics. We demonstrated that ortho-hydroxyl substituent is required for efficient azobenzene-bond cleavage and show that these cleavable affinity tags can be used to identify newly synthesized proteins in bacteria targeted by amino acid chemical reporters as well as their sites of modification on endogenously expressed proteins. The azobenzene-based affinity tags are compatible with in-gel, in-solution, and on-bead enrichment strategies and should afford useful tools for diverse bioorthogonal proteomic applications.	0
Title: Biosynthetic investigations of lactonamycin and lactonamycin z: cloning of the biosynthetic gene clusters and discovery of an unusual starter unit Abstract: The antibiotics lactonamycin and lactonamycin Z provide attractive leads for antibacterial drug development. Both antibiotics contain a novel aglycone core called lactonamycinone. To gain insight into lactonamycinone biosynthesis, cloning and precursor incorporation experiments were undertaken. The lactonamycin gene cluster was initially cloned from Streptomyces rishiriensis. Sequencing of ca. 61 kb of S. rishiriensis DNA revealed the presence of 57 open reading frames. These included genes coding for the biosynthesis of l-rhodinose, the sugar found in lactonamycin, and genes similar to those in the tetracenomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Since lactonamycin production by S. rishiriensis could not be sustained, additional proof for the identity of the S. rishiriensis cluster was obtained by cloning the lactonamycin Z gene cluster from Streptomyces sanglieri. Partial sequencing of the S. sanglieri cluster revealed 15 genes that exhibited a very high degree of similarity to genes within the lactonamycin cluster, as well as an identical organization. Double-crossover disruption of one gene in the S. sanglieri cluster abolished lactonamycin Z production, and production was restored by complementation. These results confirm the identity of the genetic locus cloned from S. sanglieri and indicate that the highly similar locus in S. rishiriensis encodes lactonamycin biosynthetic genes. Precursor incorporation experiments with S. sanglieri revealed that lactonamycinone is biosynthesized in an unusual manner whereby glycine or a glycine derivative serves as a starter unit that is extended by nine acetate units. Analysis of the gene clusters and of the precursor incorporation data suggested a hypothetical scheme for lactonamycinone biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide bassianolide, an insecticidal virulence factor of Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauveria bassiana is a facultative entomopathogen with an extremely broad host range that is used as a commercial biopesticide for the control of insects of agricultural, veterinary and medical significance. B. bassiana produces bassianolide, a cyclooligomer depsipeptide secondary metabolite. We have cloned the bbBsls gene of B. bassiana encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Targeted inactivation of the B. bassiana genomic copy of bbBsls abolished bassianolide production, but did not affect the biosynthesis of beauvericin, another cyclodepsipeptide produced by the strain. Comparative sequence analysis of the BbBSLS bassianolide synthetase revealed enzymatic domains for the iterative synthesis of an enzyme-bound dipeptidol monomer intermediate from d-2-hydroxyisovalerate and l-leucine. Further BbBSLS domains are predicted to catalyze the formation of the cyclic tetrameric ester bassianolide by recursive condensations of this monomer. Comparative infection assays against three selected insect hosts established bassianolide as a highly significant virulence factor of B. bassiana.	1
Title: Primary and secondary metabolism, and post-translational protein modifications, as portrayed by proteomic analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The newly sequenced genome of Streptomyces coelicolor is estimated to encode 7825 theoretical proteins. We have mapped approximately 10% of the theoretical proteome experimentally using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Products from 770 different genes were identified, and the types of proteins represented are discussed in terms of their annotated functional classes. An average of 1.2 proteins per gene was observed, indicating extensive post-translational regulation. Examples of modification by N-acetylation, adenylylation and proteolytic processing were characterized using mass spectrometry. Proteins from both primary and certain secondary metabolic pathways are strongly represented on the map, and a number of these enzymes were identified at more than one two-dimensional gel location. Post-translational modification mechanisms may therefore play a significant role in the regulation of these pathways. Unexpectedly, one of the enzymes for synthesis of the actinorhodin polyketide antibiotic appears to be located outside the cytoplasmic compartment, within the cell wall matrix. Of 20 gene clusters encoding enzymes characteristic of secondary metabolism, eight are represented on the proteome map, including three that specify the production of novel metabolites. This information will be valuable in the characterization of the new metabolites.	1
Title: Bifunctional Nitrone-Conjugated Secondary Metabolite Targeting the Ribosome Abstract: Many microorganisms possess the capacity for producing multiple antibiotic secondary metabolites. In a few notable cases, combinations of secondary metabolites produced by the same organism are used in important combination therapies for treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, examples of conjoined roles of bioactive metabolites produced by the same organism remain uncommon. During our genetic functional analysis of oxidase-encoding genes in the everninomicin producer Micromonospora carbonacea var. aurantiaca, we discovered previously uncharacterized antibiotics everninomicin N and O, comprised of an everninomicin fragment conjugated to the macrolide rosamicin via a rare nitrone moiety. These metabolites were determined to be hydrolysis products of everninomicin P, a nitrone-linked conjugate likely the result of nonenzymatic condensation of the rosamicin aldehyde and the octasaccharide everninomicin F, possessing a hydroxylamino sugar moiety. Rosamicin binds the erythromycin macrolide binding site approximately 60 Å from the orthosomycin binding site of everninomicins. However, while individual ribosomal binding sites for each functional half of everninomicin P are too distant for bidentate binding, ligand displacement studies demonstrated that everninomicin P competes with rosamicin for ribosomal binding. Chemical protection studies and structural analysis of everninomicin P revealed that everninomicin P occupies both the macrolide- and orthosomycin-binding sites on the 70S ribosome. Moreover, resistance mutations within each binding site were overcome by the inhibition of the opposite functional antibiotic moiety binding site. These data together demonstrate a strategy for coupling orthogonal antibiotic pharmacophores, a surprising tolerance for substantial covalent modification of each antibiotic, and a potential beneficial strategy to combat antibiotic resistance.	1
Title: Gatekeeper of pluripotency: a common Oct4 transcriptional network operates in mouse eggs and embryonic stem cells Abstract: Background:                       Oct4 is a key factor of an expanded transcriptional network (Oct4-TN) that governs pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the inner cell mass from which ESCs are derived. A pending question is whether the establishment of the Oct4-TN initiates during oogenesis or after fertilisation. To this regard, recent evidence has shown that Oct4 controls a poorly known Oct4-TN central to the acquisition of the mouse egg developmental competence. The aim of this study was to investigate the identity and extension of this maternal Oct4-TN, as much as whether its presence is circumscribed to the egg or maintained beyond fertilisation.                  Results:                       By comparing the genome-wide transcriptional profile of developmentally competent eggs that express the OCT4 protein to that of developmentally incompetent eggs in which OCT4 is down-regulated, we unveiled a maternal Oct4-TN of 182 genes. Eighty of these transcripts escape post-fertilisation degradation and represent the maternal Oct4-TN inheritance that is passed on to the 2-cell embryo. Most of these 80 genes are expressed in cancer cells and 37 are notable companions of the Oct4 transcriptome in ESCs.                  Conclusions:                       These results provide, for the first time, a developmental link between eggs, early preimplantation embryos and ESCs, indicating that the molecular signature that characterises the ESCs identity is rooted in oogenesis. Also, they contribute a useful resource to further study the mechanisms of Oct4 function and regulation during the maternal-to-embryo transition and to explore the link between the regulation of pluripotency and the acquisition of de-differentiation in cancer cells.	0
Title: Protein phosphorylation and intermolecular electron transfer: a joint experimental and computational study of a hormone biosynthesis pathway Abstract: Protein phosphorylation is a common regulator of enzyme activity. Chemical modification of a protein surface, including phosphorylation, could alter the function of biological electron-transfer reactions. However, the sensitivity of intermolecular electron-transfer kinetics to post-translational protein modifications has not been widely investigated. We have therefore combined experimental and computational studies to assess the potential role of phosphorylation in electron-transfer reactions. We investigated the steroid hydroxylating system from bovine adrenal glands, which consists of adrenodoxin (Adx), adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), and a cytochrome P450, CYP11A1. We focused on the phosphorylation of Adx at Thr-71, since this residue is located in the acidic interaction domain of Adx, and a recent study has demonstrated that this residue is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in vitro.1 Optical biosensor experiments indicate that the presence of this phosphorylation slightly increases the binding affinity of oxidized Adx with CYP11A1ox but not AdRox. This tendency was confirmed by KA values extracted from Adx concentration-dependent stopped-flow experiments that characterize the interaction between AdRred and Adxox or between Adxred and CYP11A1ox. In addition, acceleration of the electron-transfer kinetics measured with stopped-flow is seen only for the phosphorylated Adx-CYP11A1 reaction. Biphasic reaction kinetics are observed only when Adx is phosphorylated at Thr-71, and the Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations suggest that this phosphorylation may enhance the formation of a secondary Adx-CYP11A1 binding complex that provides an additional electron-transfer pathway with enhanced coupling.	0
Title: Ustethylin Biosynthesis Implies Phenethyl Derivative Formation in Aspergillus ustus Abstract: A highly oxygenated phenethyl derivative ustethylin A was isolated from Aspergillus ustus. Gene deletion, isotope labeling, and heterologous expression proved that the phenethyl core structure is assembled from malonyl-CoA by a polyketide synthase harboring a methyltransferase domain. Propionate was converted via acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and incorporated into the molecule. Modifications on the core structure by three different oxidoreductases and one O-methyltransferase lead to the final product, ustethylin A.	1
Title: The biological buffer bicarbonate/CO2 potentiates H2O2-mediated inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide is a cell signaling agent that inactivates protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) via oxidation of their catalytic cysteine residue. PTPs are inactivated rapidly during H(2)O(2)-mediated cellular signal transduction processes, but, paradoxically, hydrogen peroxide is a rather sluggish PTP inactivator in vitro. Here we present evidence that the biological buffer bicarbonate/CO(2) potentiates the ability of H(2)O(2) to inactivate PTPs. The results of biochemical experiments and high-resolution crystallographic analysis are consistent with a mechanism involving oxidation of the catalytic cysteine residue by peroxymonocarbonate generated via the reaction of H(2)O(2) with HCO(3)(-)/CO(2).	0
Title: Genetic organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the indolocarbazole K-252a in Nonomuraea longicatena JCM 11136 Abstract: Indolocarbazole metabolite K-252a is a natural product that was previously reported as a potent protein kinase C inhibitor with in vitro and in vivo potency. From a biosynthetic viewpoint, this compound possesses structurally interesting features such as an unusual furanosyl sugar moiety, which are absent in the well-studied staurosporine and rebeccamycin. A cosmid library from genomic DNA of Nonomuraea longicatena JCM 11136 was constructed and screened for the presence of genes to be involved in the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole K-252a. Using as a probe an internal fragment of vioB, a Chromobacterium violaceum gene encoding a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes tryptophan decarboxylation and condensation reaction in violacein biosynthesis, we isolated a DNA region that directed the biosynthesis of K-252a when introduced into the heterologous expression host Streptomyces albus. Sequence analysis of 45 kb revealed genes for indolocarbazole core formation, glycosylation, and sugar methylation, as well as a regulatory gene and two resistance/secretion genes. The cloned genes should help to elucidate the molecular basis for indolocarbazole biosynthesis and generate new indolocarbazole analogues by genetic engineering.	1
Title: New natural product families from an environmental DNA (eDNA) gene cluster Abstract: Uncultured bacteria represent a potentially rich source of new and useful natural products. Studying these natural products requires the development of effective yet straightforward methods to access the small-molecule chemical diversity produced by uncultured bacteria. In this study, DNA extracted directly from soil samples (environmental DNA, eDNA) was used to construct cosmid libraries in Escherichia coli, and these clones were then assayed for the production of antibiosis. A 13 open reading frame (ORF) biosynthetic gene cluster (feeA-M) found in one of the antibacterial active clones, CSLC-2, confers to E. coli the production of two new families of natural products that are derived from long chain N-acyltyrosines. The fee gene cluster and three families of the long chain acyl phenols derived from tyrosine (families 1, 2, and 3) are described.	1
Title: A Gene Cluster for the Biosynthesis of Dibenzodioxocinons in the Endophyte Pestalotiopsis microspora, a Taxol Producer Abstract: The fungal products dibenzodioxocinones promise a novel class of inhibitors against cholesterol ester transfer protein (CEPT). Knowledge as to their biosynthesis is scarce. In this report, we characterized four more dibenzodioxocinones, which along with a previously described member pestalotiollide B, delimit the dominant spectrum of secondary metabolites in P. microspora. Through mRNA-seq profiling in gα1Δ, a process that halts the production of the dibenzodioxocinones, a gene cluster harboring 21 genes including a polyketide synthase, designated as pks8, was defined. Disruption of genes in the cluster led to loss of the compounds, concluding the anticipated role in the biosynthesis of the chemicals. The biosynthetic route to dibenzodioxocinones was temporarily speculated. This study reveals the genetic basis underlying the biosynthesis of dibenzodioxocinone in fungi, and may facilitate the practice for yield improvement in the drug development arena.	1
Title: Effects of four different meal types on the population pharmacokinetics of single-dose rifapentine in healthy male volunteers Abstract: Rifapentine and its primary metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine, are active against mycobacterium tuberculosis. The objectives of this study were to describe the population pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine in fasting and fed states. Thirty-five male healthy volunteers were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, sequential, five-way crossover study. Participants received a single 900-mg dose of rifapentine after meals with high fat (meal A), bulk and low fat (meal B), bulk and high fat (meal C), high fluid and low fat (meal D), or 200 ml of water (meal E). Venous blood samples were collected over 72 h after each rifapentine dose, and plasma was analyzed for rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling using NONMEM. Compared with the fasting state, meal A had the greatest effect on rifapentine oral bioavailability, increasing it by 86%. Meals B, C, and D resulted in 33%, 46%, and 49% increases in rifapentine oral bioavailability, respectively. Similar trends were observed for 25-desacetyl rifapentine. As meal behavior has a substantial impact on rifapentine exposure, it should be considered in the evaluation of optimal dosing approaches.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Total Synthesis of Pyrronazol B: a Secondary Metabolite from Nannocystis pusilla Abstract: The first stereoselective total synthesis of the natural product pyrronazol B, which contains a chlorinated pyrrole-oxazole-pyrone framework, has been achieved. Genome sequencing of the myxobacterial producer strain Nannocystis pusilla Ari7 led to the identification of the putative biosynthetic gene cluster. The proposed biosynthetic pathway was supported by feeding experiments with stable isotopes of three biosynthetic building blocks, namely l-proline, l-serine, and l-methionine.	1
Title: Nucleation of NaCl from Aqueous Solution: Critical Sizes, Ion-Attachment Kinetics, and Rates Abstract: Nucleation and crystal growth are important in material synthesis, climate modeling, biomineralization, and pharmaceutical formulation. Despite tremendous efforts, the mechanisms and kinetics of nucleation remain elusive to both theory and experiment. Here we investigate sodium chloride (NaCl) nucleation from supersaturated brines using seeded atomistic simulations, polymorph-specific order parameters, and elements of classical nucleation theory. We find that NaCl nucleates via the common rock salt structure. Ion desolvation-not diffusion-is identified as the limiting resistance to attachment. Two different analyses give approximately consistent attachment kinetics: diffusion along the nucleus size coordinate and reaction-diffusion analysis of approach-to-coexistence simulation data from Aragones et al. ( J. Chem. Phys. 2012, 136, 244508 ). Our simulations were performed at realistic supersaturations to enable the first direct comparison to experimental nucleation rates for this system. The computed and measured rates converge to a common upper limit at extremely high supersaturation. However, our rate predictions are between 15 and 30 orders of magnitude too fast. We comment on possible origins of the large discrepancy.	0
Title: Five-membered cyclic metal carbyne: synthesis of osmapentalynes by the reactions of osmapentalene with allene, alkyne, and alkene Abstract: The synthesis of small cyclic metal carbynes is challenging due to the large angle strain associated with the highly distorted nonlinear triple bonds. Herein, we report a general route for the synthesis of five-membered cyclic metal carbyne complexes, osmapentalynes, by the reactions of an osmapentalene derivative with allene, alkyne, and alkene. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations document the aromaticity in the fused five-membered rings of osmapentalynes. The realization of transforming osmapentalene to osmapentalyne through this general route would not only allow further exploration of metallapentalyne chemistry but also show promising applications of this novel aromatic system with broad absorption band and high molar absorption coefficient.	0
Title: Orthogonal ubiquitin transfer through engineered E1-E2 cascades for protein ubiquitination Abstract: Protein modification by ubiquitin (UB) controls diverse cellular processes. UB is conjugated to cellular proteins by sequential transfer through an E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade. The cross-activities of 2 E1s, 50 E2s and thousands of E3s encoded by the human genome make it difficult to identify the substrate proteins of a specific E3 enzyme in the cell. One way to solve this problem is to engineer an orthogonal UB transfer (OUT) cascade in which the engineered UB (xUB) is relayed by engineered E1, E2 and E3 enzymes (xE1, xE2, xE3) to modify the substrate proteins of a specific E3. Here, we use phage display and mutagenesis to construct xUB-xE1 and xE1-xE2 pairs that are orthogonal to the native E1 and E2 enzymes. Our work on engineering the UB transfer cascades will enable us to use OUT to map the signal transduction networks mediated by protein ubiquitination.	0
Title: Screening for Microbial Metal-Chelating Siderophores for the Removal of Metal Ions from Solutions Abstract: To guarantee the supply of critical elements in the future, the development of new technologies is essential. Siderophores have high potential in the recovery and recycling of valuable metals due to their metal-chelating properties. Using the Chrome azurol S assay, 75 bacterial strains were screened to obtain a high-yield siderophore with the ability to complex valuable critical metal ions. The siderophore production of the four selected strains Nocardioides simplex 3E, Pseudomonas chlororaphis DSM 50083, Variovorax paradoxus EPS, and Rhodococcus erythropolis B7g was optimized, resulting in significantly increased siderophore production of N. simplex and R. erythropolis. Produced siderophore amounts and velocities were highly dependent on the carbon source. The genomes of N. simplex and P. chlororaphis were sequenced. Bioinformatical analyses revealed the occurrence of an achromobactin and a pyoverdine gene cluster in P. chlororaphis, a heterobactin and a requichelin gene cluster in R. erythropolis, and a desferrioxamine gene cluster in N. simplex. Finally, the results of the previous metal-binding screening were validated by a proof-of-concept development for the recovery of metal ions from aqueous solutions utilizing C18 columns functionalized with siderophores. We demonstrated the recovery of the critical metal ions V(III), Ga(III), and In(III) from mixed metal solutions with immobilized siderophores of N. simplex and R. erythropolis.	1
Title: Functional analysis of the aureothin iterative type I polyketide synthase Abstract: The modular-type polyketide synthase (PKS) that is involved in aureothin (aur) biosynthesis represents one of the first examples in which a single PKS module (AurA) is used in an iterative fashion. Here we report on the heterologous expression of an engineered AurAB fusion protein that unequivocally proves the iterative nature of AurA. In addition, point mutations reveal that aur PKS module 4 participates in polyketide biosynthesis despite its aberrant acyltransferase domain.	1
Title: Activation and Characterization of Bohemamine Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces sp. CB02009 Abstract: Bohemamines (BHMs) are bacterial alkaloids containing a pyrrolizidine core with two unusual methyl groups. Herein we report the activation of BHMs biosynthesis using a ribosome engineering approach. Characterization of the bhm gene cluster reveals that nonribosomal peptide synthetase BhmJ and Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase BhmK are responsible for the formation of the pyrrolizidine core, which is further methylated on C-7 by methyltransferase BhmG. The 9-methyl group of BHMs is instead originated from a nonproteinogenic amino acid (2S,5S)-5-methylproline.	1
Title: Multidomain structure and cellulosomal localization of the Clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase CbhA Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum F7 cbhA gene, coding for the cellobiohydrolase CbhA, has been determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 1,230 amino acids was identified. Removal of a putative signal peptide yields a mature protein of 1,203 amino acids with a molecular weight of 135,139. Sequence analysis of CbhA reveals a multidomain structure of unusual complexity consisting of an N-terminal cellulose binding domain (CBD) homologous to CBD family IV, an immunoglobulin-like beta-barrel domain, a catalytic domain homologous to cellulase family E1, a duplicated domain similar to fibronectin type III (Fn3) modules, a CBD homologous to family III, a highly acidic linker region, and a C-terminal dockerin domain. The cellulosomal localization of CbhA was confirmed by Western blot analysis employing polyclonal antibodies raised against a truncated enzymatically active version of CbhA. CbhA was identified as cellulosomal subunit S3 by partial amino acid sequence analysis. Comparison of the multidomain structures indicates striking similarities between CbhA and a group of cellulases from actinomycetes. Average linkage cluster analysis suggests a coevolution of the N-terminal CBD and the catalytic domain and its spread by horizontal gene transfer among gram-positive cellulolytic bacteria.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of the citrinin biosynthetic gene cluster from Monascus aurantiacus Abstract: Monascus aurantiacus produces high amounts of citrinin which is a mycotoxin with nephrotoxic activity. Six putative citrinin biosynthesis genes have been discovered in M. purpureus and at least 10 genes are responsible for its biosynthesis. However, the sequence of citrinin pathway gene cluster in M. aurantiacus has not been reported. Here, the putative sequence of citrinin biosynthetic gene cluster was obtained by a PCR-based strategy for screening a genome fosmid library of M. aurantiacus. A sequence of 43 kb revealed 16 ORFs including the six putative biosynthetic genes reported previous. The putative gene cluster consists of a polytekide synthetase encoding one PKS module, an oxidoreductase gene, three dehydrogenase genes, an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase gene, a membrane transport protein gene, a transcriptional activator gene as well as genes encoding proteins of undefined function.	1
Title: Selective Small Molecule Induced Degradation of the BET Bromodomain Protein BRD4 Abstract: The Bromo- and Extra-Terminal (BET) proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 play important roles in transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, and cancer and are the targets of pan-BET selective bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. However, the lack of intra-BET selectivity limits the scope of current inhibitors as probes for target validation and could lead to unwanted side effects or toxicity in a therapeutic setting. We designed Proteolysis Targeted Chimeras (PROTACs) that tether JQ1 to a ligand for the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL, aimed at triggering the intracellular destruction of BET proteins. Compound MZ1 potently and rapidly induces reversible, long-lasting, and unexpectedly selective removal of BRD4 over BRD2 and BRD3. The activity of MZ1 is dependent on binding to VHL but is achieved at a sufficiently low concentration not to induce stabilization of HIF-1α. Gene expression profiles of selected cancer-related genes responsive to JQ1 reveal distinct and more limited transcriptional responses induced by MZ1, consistent with selective suppression of BRD4. Our discovery opens up new opportunities to elucidate the cellular phenotypes and therapeutic implications associated with selective targeting of BRD4.	0
Title: A Highly Versatile Expression System for the Production of Multiply Phosphorylated Proteins Abstract: Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) can use TAG stop codons to guide site-specific incorporation of phosphoserine (pSer) into proteins. To eliminate prematurely truncated peptides, improve yields, and enhance the production of multiphosphorylated proteins, Release Factor 1 (RF1)-deficient expression hosts were developed, yet these grew slowly and their use was associated with extensive misincorporation of natural amino acids instead of pSer. Here, we merge a healthy RF1-deficient E. coli cell line with a high-efficiency pSer GCE translation system to produce a versatile pSer GCE platform in which only trace misincorporation of natural amino acids is detected even when five phosphoserines were introduced into one protein. Approximately 400 and 200 mg of singly and doubly phosphorylated GFP per liter of culture were obtained. Importantly, the lack of truncated protein permits expression of oligomeric proteins and the use of N-terminal solubility-enhancing proteins to aid phospho-protein expression and purification. To illustrate the enhanced utility of this system, we produce doubly phosphorylated STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes), as well as triply phosphorylated BAD (Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death) complexed with 14-3-3, in quantity, purity, and homogeneity sufficient for structural biology applications. We anticipate that the facile access to phosphoproteins enabled by this system, which we call pSer-3.1G, will expand studies of the phospho-proteome.	0
Title: Pyrazinoic acid and its n-propyl ester inhibit fatty acid synthase type I in replicating tubercle bacilli Abstract: The activity of different analogs of pyrazinamide on Mycobacterium tuberculosis fatty acid synthase type I (FASI) in replicating bacilli was studied. Palmitic acid biosynthesis was diminished by 96% in bacilli treated with n-propyl pyrazinoate, 94% in bacilli treated with 5-chloro-pyrazinamide, and 97% in bacilli treated with pyrazinoic acid, the pharmacologically active agent of pyrazinamide. We conclude that the minimal structure of pyrazine ring with an acyl group is sufficient for FASI inhibition and antimycobacterial activity.	0
Title: A pathogenesis-related 10 protein catalyzes the final step in thebaine biosynthesis Abstract: The ultimate step in the formation of thebaine, a pentacyclic opiate alkaloid readily converted to the narcotic analgesics codeine and morphine in the opium poppy, has long been presumed to be a spontaneous reaction. We have detected and purified a novel enzyme from opium poppy latex that is capable of the efficient formation of thebaine from (7S)-salutaridinol 7-O-acetate at the expense of labile hydroxylated byproducts, which are preferentially produced by spontaneous allylic elimination. Remarkably, thebaine synthase (THS), a member of the pathogenesis-related 10 protein (PR10) superfamily, is encoded within a novel gene cluster in the opium poppy genome that also includes genes encoding the four biosynthetic enzymes immediately upstream. THS is a missing component that is crucial to the development of fermentation-based opiate production and dramatically improves thebaine yield in engineered yeast.	1
Title: Probing the Action of Chemical Denaturant on an Intrinsically Disordered Protein by Simulation and Experiment Abstract: Chemical denaturants are the most commonly used agents for unfolding proteins and are thought to act by better solvating the unfolded state. Improved solvation is expected to lead to an expansion of unfolded chains with increasing denaturant concentration, providing a sensitive probe of the denaturant action. However, experiments have so far yielded qualitatively different results concerning the effects of chemical denaturation. Studies using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other methods found an increase in radius of gyration with denaturant concentration, but most small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies found no change. This discrepancy therefore challenges our understanding of denaturation mechanism and more generally the accuracy of these experiments as applied to unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we use all-atom molecular simulations to investigate the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride on the structure of the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR, which can be studied by experiment over a wide range of denaturant concentration. Using unbiased molecular simulations with a carefully calibrated denaturant model, we find that the protein chain indeed swells with increasing denaturant concentration. This is due to the favorable association of urea or guanidinium chloride with the backbone of all residues and with the side-chains of almost all residues, with denaturant-water transfer free energies inferred from this association in reasonable accord with experimental estimates. Interactions of the denaturants with the backbone are dominated by hydrogen bonding, while interactions with side-chains include other contributions. By computing FRET efficiencies and SAXS intensities at each denaturant concentration, we show that the simulation trajectories are in accord with both experiments on this protein, demonstrating that there is no fundamental inconsistency between the two types of experiment. Agreement with experiment also supports the picture of chemical denaturation described in our simulations, driven by weak association of denaturant with the protein. Our simulations support some assumptions needed for each experiment to accurately reflect changes in protein size, namely, that the commonly used FRET chromophores do not qualitatively alter the results and that possible effects such as preferential solvent partitioning into the interior of the chain do not interfere with the determination of radius of gyration from the SAXS experiments.	0
Title: Synthetic molecular mimics of naturally occurring cyclopentenones exhibit antifungal activity towards pathogenic fungi Abstract: The naturally occurring reactive electrophilic species 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-oxo-PDA) is a potent antifungal agent, whereas the plant growth regulator jasmonic acid, which is synthesized from 12-oxo-PDA, is ineffective. To address what structural features of the molecule endow it with antifungal activity, we synthesized a series of molecular mimics of 12-oxo-PDA varying in the length of the alkyl chain at its C-4 ring position. The octyl analogue (4-octyl cyclopentenone) was the most effective at suppressing spore germination and subsequent mycelial growth of a range of fungal pathogens and was particularly effective against Cladosporium herbarum and Botrytis cinerea, with minimum fungicidal concentrations in the range 100-200 µM. Introduction of a carboxyl group to the end of the chain, mimicking natural fatty acids, markedly reduced antifungal efficacy. Electrolyte leakage, indicative of membrane perturbation, was evident in both C. herbarum and B. cinerea exposed to 4-octyl cyclopentenone. Lipid composition analysis of the fungal spores revealed that those species with a high oil content, namely Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria brassicicola, were less sensitive to 4-octyl cyclopentenone. The comparable hydrophobicity of 4-octyl cyclopentenone and 12-oxo-PDA accounts for the similar spore suppression activity of these two compounds. The relative ease of synthesis of 4-octyl cyclopentenone makes it an attractive compound for potential use as an antifungal agent.	0
Title: AmfS, an extracellular peptidic morphogen in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: The amf gene cluster was previously identified as a regulator for the onset of aerial-mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. The nucleotide sequences of amf and its counterparts in other species revealed a conserved gene organization consisting of five open reading frames. A nonsense mutation in amfS, encoding a 43-amino-acid peptide, caused significant blocking of aerial-mycelium formation and streptomycin production, suggesting its role as a regulatory molecule. Extracellular-complementation tests for the aerial-mycelium-deficient phenotype of the amfS mutant demonstrated that AmfS was secreted by the wild-type strain. A null mutation in amfBA, encoding HlyB-like membrane translocators, abolished the extracellular AmfS activity without affecting the wild-type morphology, which suggests that AmfBA is involved not in production but in export of AmfS. A synthetic C-terminal octapeptide partially induced aerial-mycelium formation in the amfS mutant, which suggests that an AmfS derivative, but not AmfS itself, serves as an extracellular morphogen.	1
Title: Influences of pH and Iron Concentration on the Salivary Microbiome in Individual Humans with and without Caries Abstract: This study aimed to identify the differences in the oral microbial communities in saliva from patients with and without caries by performing sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq platform, as well as to further assess their relationships with environmental factors (salivary pH and iron concentration). Forty-three volunteers were selected, including 21 subjects with and 22 without caries, from one village in Gansu, China. Based on 966,255 trimmed sequences and clustering at the 97% similarity level, 1,303 species-level operational taxonomic units were generated. The sequencing data for the two groups revealed that (i) particular distribution patterns (synergistic effects or competition) existed in the subjects with and without caries at both the genus and species levels and (ii) both the salivary pH and iron concentration had significant influences on the microbial community structure.                  Importance:                       The significant influences of the oral environment observed in this study increase the current understanding of the salivary microbiome in caries. These results will be useful for expanding research directions and for improving disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.	0
Title: The BaeSR two-component regulatory system mediates resistance to condensed tannins in Escherichia coli Abstract: The gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli strains grown anaerobically with or without Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) extract were compared to identify tannin resistance strategies. The cell envelope stress protein gene spy and the multidrug transporter-encoding operon mdtABCD, both under the control of the BaeSR two-component regulatory system, were significantly up-regulated in the presence of tannins. BaeSR mutants were more tannin sensitive than their wild-type counterparts.	0
Title: Coupling of the biosynthesis and export of the DNA gyrase inhibitor simocyclinone in Streptomyces antibioticus Abstract: Because most antibiotics are potentially lethal to the producing organism, there must be mechanisms to ensure that the machinery responsible for export of the mature antibiotic is in place at the time of biosynthesis. Simocyclinone D8 is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040. Within the simocyclinone biosynthetic cluster are two divergently transcribed genes, simR and simX, encoding proteins that resemble the TetR/TetA repressor-efflux pump pair that cause widespread resistance to clinically important tetracyclines. Engineered expression of simX from a strong, heterologous promoter conferred high level simocyclinone D8 resistance on Streptomyces lividans, showing that simX encodes a simocyclinone efflux pump. Transcription of simX is controlled by SimR, which directly represses the simX and simR promoters by binding to two operator sites in the simX-simR intergenic region. Simocyclinone D8 abolishes DNA binding by SimR, providing a mechanism that couples the biosynthesis of simocyclinone to its export. In addition, an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway, simocyclinone C4, which is essentially inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor, also induces simX expression in vivo and relieves simX repression by SimR in vitro.	1
Title: Iterative Mechanism of Macrodiolide Formation in the Anticancer Compound Conglobatin Abstract: Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment, encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through engineering of the polyketide synthase.	0
Title: A systematic analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters in the human microbiome reveals a common family of antibiotics Abstract: In complex biological systems, small molecules often mediate microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Using a systematic approach, we identified 3,118 small-molecule biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in genomes of human-associated bacteria and studied their representation in 752 metagenomic samples from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Remarkably, we discovered that BGCs for a class of antibiotics in clinical trials, thiopeptides, are widely distributed in genomes and metagenomes of the human microbiota. We purified and solved the structure of a thiopeptide antibiotic, lactocillin, from a prominent member of the vaginal microbiota. We demonstrate that lactocillin has potent antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive vaginal pathogens, and we show that lactocillin and other thiopeptide BGCs are expressed in vivo by analyzing human metatranscriptomic sequencing data. Our findings illustrate the widespread distribution of small-molecule-encoding BGCs in the human microbiome, and they demonstrate the bacterial production of drug-like molecules in humans.

Title: Long-Lived, Non-Geminate, Radiative Recombination of Photogenerated Charges in a Polymer/Small-Molecule Acceptor Photovoltaic Blend Abstract: Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency.	0
Title: Serotype identification of group B streptococci by PCR and sequencing Abstract: Group B streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is the most common cause of neonatal and obstetric sepsis and is an increasingly important cause of septicemia in elderly individuals and immunocompromised patients. Ongoing surveillance to monitor GBS serotype distribution will be needed to guide the development and use of GBS conjugate vaccines. We designed sequencing primers based on the previously published sequences of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene clusters to further define partial cps gene clusters for eight of the nine GBS serotypes (serotypes Ia to VII). Subsequently, we designed and evaluated primers to identify serotypes Ia, Ib, III, IV, V, and VI directly by PCR and all eight serotypes (serotypes Ia to VII) by sequence heterogeneity. A total of 206 clinical GBS isolates were used to compare our molecular serotype (MS) identification method with conventional serotyping (CS). All clinical isolates were assigned an MS, whereas 188 of 206 (91.3%) were assigned a serotype by use of antisera. A small number of isolates (serosubtypes III-3 and III-4) showed different serotype specificities between PCR and sequencing, but the PCR results correlated with those obtained by CS. The overall agreement between the MS identification method and CS for isolates for which results of both tests were available was 100% (188 of 188 isolates). The MS identification method is a specific and practical alternative to conventional GBS serotyping and will facilitate epidemiological studies.	1
Title: Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of serovar-specific glycopeptidolipids in Mycobacterium avium serovar 2 Abstract: Members of the Mycobacterium avium complex are distinguished by the presence of highly antigenic surface molecules called glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) and the oligosaccharide portion of the serovar-specific GPL defines the 28 serovars. Previously, the genomic region (ser2) encoding the enzymes responsible for the glycosylation of the lipopeptide core to generate the serovar-2-specific GPLs has been described. In this work, the ser2 gene clusters of M. avium serovar 2 strains 2151 and TMC 724 were fully sequenced and compared to the homologous regions of M. avium serovar 1 strain 104, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and M. avium subsp. silvaticum. It was also determined that 104Rg, a mutant of strain 104 that produces truncated GPLs, lost several GPL biosynthesis genes by deletion. This comparison, together with analysis of protein similarities, supports a biosynthetic model in which serovar-2-specific GPLs are synthesized from a serovar-1-specific GPL intermediate that is derived from a non-specific GPL precursor. We also identified a gene encoding an enzyme that is necessary for the biosynthesis of serovar-3- and 9-specific GPLs, but not serovar-2-specific GPLs, suggesting that the different serovars may have evolved from the acquisition or loss of genetic information. In addition, a subcluster of genes for the biosynthesis and transfer of fucose, which are needed to make serovar-specific GPLs such as those of serovar 2, is found in the non-GPL-producing M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis and silvaticum.	1
Title: The distinctive cell division interactome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Abstract: Background:                       Bacterial cell division is an essential process driven by the formation of a Z-ring structure, as a cytoskeletal scaffold at the mid-cell, followed by the recruitment of various proteins which form the divisome. The cell division interactome reflects the complement of different interactions between all divisome proteins. To date, only two cell division interactomes have been characterized, in Escherichia coli and in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The cell divison proteins encoded by Neisseria gonorrhoeae include FtsZ, FtsA, ZipA, FtsK, FtsQ, FtsI, FtsW, and FtsN. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the cell division interactome of N. gonorrhoeae using several different methods to identify protein-protein interactions. We also characterized the specific subdomains of FtsA implicated in interactions with FtsZ, FtsQ, FtsN and FtsW.                  Results:                       Using a combination of bacterial two-hybrid (B2H), glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), nine interactions were observed among the eight gonococcal cell division proteins tested. ZipA did not interact with any other cell division proteins. Comparisons of the N. gonorrhoeae cell division interactome with the published interactomes from E. coli and S. pneumoniae indicated that FtsA-FtsZ and FtsZ-FtsK interactions were common to all three species. FtsA-FtsW and FtsK-FtsN interactions were only present in N. gonorrhoeae. The 2A and 2B subdomains of FtsANg were involved in interactions with FtsQ, FtsZ, and FtsN, and the 2A subdomain was involved in interaction with FtsW.                  Conclusions:                       Results from this research indicate that N. gonorrhoeae has a distinctive cell division interactome as compared with other microorganisms.	0
Title: A Non-canonical Melanin Biosynthesis Pathway Protects Aspergillus terreus Conidia from Environmental Stress Abstract: Melanins are ubiquitous pigments found in all kingdoms of life. Most organisms use them for protection from environmental stress, although some fungi employ melanins as virulence determinants. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and related Ascomycetes produce dihydroxynaphthalene- (DHN) melanin in their spores, the conidia, and use it to inhibit phagolysosome acidification. However, biosynthetic origin of melanin in a related fungus, Aspergillus terreus, has remained a mystery because A. terreus lacks genes for synthesis of DHN-melanin. Here we identify genes coding for an unusual NRPS-like enzyme (MelA) and a tyrosinase (TyrP) that A. terreus expressed under conidiation conditions. We demonstrate that MelA produces aspulvinone E, which is activated for polymerization by TyrP. Functional studies reveal that this new pigment, Asp-melanin, confers resistance against UV light and hampers phagocytosis by soil amoeba. Unexpectedly, Asp-melanin does not inhibit acidification of phagolysosomes, thus likely contributing specifically to survival of A. terreus conidia in acidic environments.	1
Title: Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology evaluation of an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody produced by perfusion fermentation process Abstract: Anti-cluster of differentiation 52 (CD52) monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been employed in the treatment of chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple sclerosis. Previously we developed a perfusion process to produce the biosimilar mAb named "Mab-TH." A series of quality assessments was conducted in the fields of structural identification, purity analysis, and activity measurement. After these quality researches, this report laid emphasis on preclinical pharmacology and toxicology evaluation. Mab-TH was characterized in biological, pharmacological, and toxicological properties in comparison with the original drug, alemtuzumab. Binding activity and immune-dependent toxicity as in vitro activity were evaluated. Severe immunodeficient mice transplanted with a human leukemia cell line were also used as an in vivo pharmacological model and a 4-week repeated dosing study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the safety differences. Our results demonstrated that Mab-TH, the anti-CD52 antibody generated by a perfusion process, had high similarity in in vitro and in vivo activities compared with alemtuzumab in relevant preclinical models. The results supported it as a biosimilar candidate for clinical evaluation.	0
Title: Genome Sequence of Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 and Identification of the Exopolysaccharide EPS273 Biosynthesis Locus Abstract: Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 is a marine bacterium producing exopolysaccharide 273 (EPS273) with high anti-biofilm activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Here, the complete genome of P.stutzeri 273 was sequenced and the genome contained a circular 5.03 Mb chromosome. With extensive analysis of the genome, a genetic locus containing 18 genes was predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of EPS273. In order to confirm this prediction, two adjacent genes (eps273-H and eps273-I) encoding glycosyltransferases and one gene (eps273-O) encoding tyrosine protein kinase within the genetic locus were deleted and biosynthesis of EPS273 was checked in parallel. The molecular weight profile of EPS purified from the mutant Δeps273-HI was obviously different from that purified from wild-type P.stutzeri 273, while the corresponding EPS was hardly detected from the mutant Δeps273-O, which indicated the involvement of the proposed 18-gene cluster in the biosynthesis of EPS273. Moreover, the mutant Δeps273-HI had the biofilm formed earlier compared with the wild type, and the mutant Δeps273-O almost completely lost the ability of biofilm formation. Therefore, EPS273 might facilitate the biofilm formation for its producing strain P.stutzeri 273 while inhibiting the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1. This study can contribute to better understanding of the biosynthesis of EPS273 and disclose the biological function of EPS273 for its producing strain P.stutzeri 273.	1
Title: Pore Engineering for One-Step Ethylene Purification from a Three-Component Hydrocarbon Mixture Abstract: Ethylene production from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures through one separation step is desirable but challenging because of the similar size and physical properties of acetylene, ethylene, and ethane. Herein, we report three new isostructural porous coordination networks (NPU-1, NPU-2, NPU-3; NPU represents Northwestern Polytechnical University) that are sustained by 9-connected nodes based upon a hexanuclear metal cluster of composition [Mn6(μ3-O)2(CH3COO)3]6+. NPU-1/2/3 exhibit a dual cage structure that was systematically fine-tuned in terms of cage size to realize selective adsorption of C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated that NPU-1 produces ethylene in >99.9% purity from a three-component gas mixture (1:1:1 C2H2/C2H4/C2H6). Molecular modeling studies revealed that the dual adsorption preference for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4 originates from (a) strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between electronegative carboxylate O atoms and C2H2 molecules in one cage and (b) multiple non-covalent interactions between the organic linkers of the host network and C2H6 molecules in the second cage.	0
Title: Genetic localization of the orevactaene/epipyrone biosynthetic gene cluster in Epicoccum nigrum Abstract: Epipyrone (EPN)-A (syn. orevactaene) is a polyketide compound of 3-d-galactosyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone with a modified heptaene acyl moiety, produced from Epicoccum nigrum and was reported to have various biological activities. Genome analysis identified a hypothetical EPN biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) composed of the four genes epnABCD, which encode a highly-reducing fungal polyketide synthase, a glycosyltransferase, a cytochrome P450, and a transporter. The individual gene inactivation of epnABC resulted in the total loss of EPN production, while the inactivation of a nearby transcription factor-encoding gene had no effect on the production of EPN, substantiating that epnABCD is the EPN BGC. mRNA expression indicated no epnA transcription in the epnB knockout mutant and the occurrence of the bicistronic transcription of epnAB. This study defined an EPN BGC, which is the first blueprint reported for glycosylated 2-pyrone polyketide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Comparative Analysis of Extremely Thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor Species Reveals Common and Unique Cellular Strategies for Plant Biomass Utilization Abstract: Microbiological, genomic and transcriptomic analyses were used to examine three species from the bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor with respect to their capacity to convert the carbohydrate content of lignocellulosic biomass at 70°C to simple sugars, acetate, lactate, CO2, and H2. Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. saccharolyticus solubilized 38%, 36%, and 29% (by weight) of unpretreated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (5 g/liter), respectively, which was about half of the amount of crystalline cellulose (Avicel; 5 g/liter) that was solubilized under the same conditions. The lower yields with C. saccharolyticus, not appreciably greater than the thermal control for switchgrass, were unexpected, given that its genome encodes the same glycoside hydrolase 9 (GH9)-GH48 multidomain cellulase (CelA) found in the other two species. However, the genome of C. saccharolyticus lacks two other cellulases with GH48 domains, which could be responsible for its lower levels of solubilization. Transcriptomes for growth of each species comparing cellulose to switchgrass showed that many carbohydrate ABC transporters and multidomain extracellular glycoside hydrolases were differentially regulated, reflecting the heterogeneity of lignocellulose. However, significant differences in transcription levels for conserved genes among the three species were noted, indicating unexpectedly diverse regulatory strategies for deconstruction for these closely related bacteria. Genes encoding the Che-type chemotaxis system and flagellum biosynthesis were upregulated in C. kronotskyensis and C. bescii during growth on cellulose, implicating motility in substrate utilization. The results here show that capacity for plant biomass deconstruction varies across Caldicellulosiruptor species and depends in a complex way on GH genome inventory, substrate composition, and gene regulation.	0
Title: Heterologous reconstitution of the intact geodin gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans through a simple and versatile PCR based approach Abstract: Fungal natural products are a rich resource for bioactive molecules. To fully exploit this potential it is necessary to link genes to metabolites. Genetic information for numerous putative biosynthetic pathways has become available in recent years through genome sequencing. However, the lack of solid methodology for genetic manipulation of most species severely hampers pathway characterization. Here we present a simple PCR based approach for heterologous reconstitution of intact gene clusters. Specifically, the putative gene cluster responsible for geodin production from Aspergillus terreus was transferred in a two step procedure to an expression platform in A. nidulans. The individual cluster fragments were generated by PCR and assembled via efficient USER fusion prior to transformation and integration via re-iterative gene targeting. A total of 13 open reading frames contained in 25 kb of DNA were successfully transferred between the two species enabling geodin synthesis in A. nidulans. Subsequently, functions of three genes in the cluster were validated by genetic and chemical analyses. Specifically, ATEG_08451 (gedC) encodes a polyketide synthase, ATEG_08453 (gedR) encodes a transcription factor responsible for activation of the geodin gene cluster and ATEG_08460 (gedL) encodes a halogenase that catalyzes conversion of sulochrin to dihydrogeodin. We expect that our approach for transferring intact biosynthetic pathways to a fungus with a well developed genetic toolbox will be instrumental in characterizing the many exciting pathways for secondary metabolite production that are currently being uncovered by the fungal genome sequencing projects.	1
Title: Phenotypic and genetic characterization of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the tropics of Southeast Asia Abstract: Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem throughout the world. The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in hospital wastewater is a cause for great concern today. In this study, 276 Staph. aureus isolates were recovered from hospital wastewater samples in Malaysia. All of the isolates were screened for susceptibility to nine different classes of antibiotics: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and nalidixic acid. Screening tests showed that 100 % of Staph.aureus isolates exhibited resistance against kanamycin, vancomycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid. Additionally, 91, 87, 50, 43, 11 and 8.7 % of isolates showed resistance against erythromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline, respectively. Based on these results, 100 % of isolates demonstrated multidrug-resistant (MDR) characteristics, displaying resistance against more than three classes of antibiotics. Of 276 isolates, nine exhibited resistance to more than nine classes of tested antibiotics; these were selected for antibiotic susceptibility testing and examined for the presence of conserved ARGs. Interestingly, a high percentage of the selected MDR Staph.aureus isolates did not contain conserved ARGs. These results indicate that non-conserved MDR gene elements may have already spread into the environment in the tropics of Southeast Asia, and unique resistance mechanisms against several antibiotics may have evolved due to stable, moderate temperatures that support growth of bacteria throughout the year.	0
Title: Variochelins, Lipopeptide Siderophores from Variovorax boronicumulans Discovered by Genome Mining Abstract: Photoreactive siderophores have a major impact on the growth of planktonic organisms. To date, these molecules have mainly been reported from marine bacteria, although evidence is now accumulating that some terrestrial bacteria also harbor the biosynthetic potential for their production. In this paper, we describe the genomics-driven discovery and characterization of variochelins, lipopeptide siderophores from the bacterium Variovorax boronicumulans, which thrives in soil and freshwater habitats. Variochelins are different from most other lipopeptide siderophores in that their biosynthesis involves a polyketide synthase. We demonstrate that the ferric iron complex of variochelin A possesses photoreactive properties and present the MS-derived structures of two degradation products that emerge upon light exposure.	1
Title: An unusual organelle in Cryptococcus neoformans links luminal pH and capsule biosynthesis Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete that causes deadly infections in the immunocompromised. We previously generated a secretion mutant in this fungus by introducing a mutation in the SAV1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the Sec4/Rab8 subfamily GTPases. Under restrictive conditions there are two notable morphological changes in the sav1 mutant: accumulation of post-Golgi vesicles and the appearance of an unusual organelle, which we term the sav1 body (SB). The SB is an electron-transparent structure 0.2-1microm in diameter, with vesicles or other membranous structures associated with the perimeter. Surprisingly, the SB was heavily labeled with anti-glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) antibodies, suggesting that it contains a secreted capsule component, GXM. A structure similar to the SB, also labeled by anti-GXM antibodies, was induced in wild type cells treated with the vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A(1). Bafilomycin A(1) and other agents that increase intraluminal pH also inhibited capsule polysaccharide shedding and capsule growth. These studies highlight an unusual organelle observed in C. neoformans with a potential role in polysaccharide synthesis, and a link between luminal pH and GXM biosynthesis.	0
Title: Precise Formation of a Hollow Carbon Nitride Structure with a Janus Surface To Promote Water Splitting by Photoredox Catalysis Abstract: The precise modification of redox species on the inner and outer surfaces of hollow nanostructures is relevant in catalysis, surface science, and nanotechnology, but has proven difficult to achieve. Herein, we develop a facile approach to specifically fabricate Pt and Co3 O4 nanoparticles (NPs) onto the interior and exterior surface of hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNS), respectively, to promote the surface redox functions of the polymer semiconductors. The photocatalytic water splitting activities of HCNS with spatially separated oxidation and reduction centers at their nanodomains were enhanced. The origin of the enhanced activity was attributed to the spatially separated reactive sites for the evolution of H2 and O2 and also to the unidirectional migration of the electron and hole on the Janus surfaces, thereby preventing the unwanted reverse reaction of water splitting and decreasing charge recombination.	0
Title: Synthesis and pharmacological effects of the enantiomers of the N-phenethyl analogues of the ortho and para e- and f-oxide-bridged phenylmorphans Abstract: The N-phenethyl analogues of (1R*,4aR*,9aS*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol and (1R*,4aR*,9aR*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2.3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol, the ortho- (43) and para-hydroxy e- (20), and f-oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans (53 and 26) were prepared in racemic and enantiomerically pure forms from a common precursor, the quaternary salt 12. Optical resolutions were accomplished by salt formation with suitable enantiomerically pure chiral acids or by preparative HPLC on a chiral support. The N-phenethyl (-)- para-e enantiomer (1S,4aS,9aR-(-)-20) was found to be a mu-opioid agonist with morphine-like antinociceptive activity in a mouse assay. In contrast, the N-phenethyl (-)-ortho-f enantiomer (1R,4aR,9aR-(-)-53) had good affinity for the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 7 nM) and was found to be a mu-antagonist both in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S assay and in vivo. The molecular structures of these rigid enantiomers were energy minimized with density functional theory at the level B3LYP/6-31G* level, and then overlaid on a known potent mu-agonist. This superposition study suggests that the agonist activity of the oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans can be attributed to formation of a seven membered ring that is hypothesized to facilitate a proton transfer from the protonated nitrogen to a proton acceptor in the mu-opioid receptor.	0
Title: Did granny know best? Evaluating the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral efficacy of acetic acid for home care procedures Abstract: Background:                       Acetic acid has been used to clean and disinfect surfaces in the household for many decades. The antimicrobial efficacy of cleaning procedures can be considered particularly important for young, old, pregnant, immunocompromised people, but may also concern other groups, particularly with regards to the COVID-19 pandemics. This study aimed to show that acetic acid exhibit an antibacterial and antifungal activity when used for cleaning purposes and is able to destroy certain viruses. Furthermore, a disinfecting effect of laundry in a simulated washing cycle has been investigated.                  Results:                       At a concentration of 10% and in presence of 1.5% citric acid, acetic acid showed a reduction of > 5-log steps according to the specifications of DIN EN 1040 and DIN EN 1275 for the following microorganisms: P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, K. pneumoniae, E. hirae and A. brasiliensis. For MRSA a logarithmic reduction of 3.19 was obtained. Tests on surfaces according to DIN EN 13697 showed a complete reduction (> 5-log steps) for P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, E. hirae, A. brasiliensis and C. albicans at an acetic acid concentration of already 5%. Virucidal efficacy tests according to DIN EN 14476 and DIN EN 16777 showed a reduction of ≥4-log-steps against the Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) for acetic acid concentrations of 5% or higher. The results suggest that acetic acid does not have a disinfecting effect on microorganisms in a dosage that is commonly used for cleaning. However, this can be achieved by increasing the concentration of acetic acid used, especially when combined with citric acid.                  Conclusions:                       Our results show a disinfecting effect of acetic acid in a concentration of 10% and in presence of 1.5% citric acid against a variety of microorganisms. A virucidal effect against enveloped viruses could also be proven. Furthermore, the results showed a considerable antimicrobial effect of acetic acid when used in domestic laundry procedures.	0
Title: Comparison of the receptor FGFRL1 from sea urchins and humans illustrates evolution of a zinc binding motif in the intracellular domain Abstract: Background:                       FGFRL1, the gene for the fifth member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, is found in all vertebrates from fish to man and in the cephalochordate amphioxus. Since it does not occur in more distantly related invertebrates such as insects and nematodes, we have speculated that FGFRL1 might have evolved just before branching of the vertebrate lineage from the other invertebrates (Beyeler and Trueb, 2006).                  Results:                       We identified the gene for FGFRL1 also in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cloned its mRNA. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 62% sequence similarity with the human protein and shows conservation of all disulfides and N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites. Similar to the human protein, the S. purpuratus protein contains a histidine-rich motif at the C-terminus, but this motif is much shorter than the human counterpart. To analyze the function of the novel motif, recombinant fusion proteins were prepared in a bacterial expression system. The human fusion protein bound to nickel and zinc affinity columns, whereas the sea urchin protein barely interacted with such columns. Direct determination of metal ions by atomic absorption revealed 2.6 mole zinc/mole protein for human FGFRL1 and 1.7 mole zinc/mole protein for sea urchin FGFRL1.                  Conclusion:                       The FGFRL1 gene has evolved much earlier than previously assumed. A comparison of the intracellular domain between sea urchin and human FGFRL1 provides interesting insights into the shaping of a novel zinc binding domain.	0
Title: Penetration depth tunable BODIPY derivatives for pH triggered enhanced photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy Abstract: Improving the deep-tissue phototherapy (PDT) efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) region has become one of the major challenges in clinics for cancer treatment. Developing intelligent photosensitizers (PSs) responding to tumor-specific signals sensitively to minimize side effects is another major challenge for tumor phototherapy. Herein, three phenyl-based boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) compounds with different numbers of diethylaminophenyl groups introduced onto the BODIPY core have been designed and synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The absorbance of these compounds (BDPmPh, BDPbiPh, and BDPtriPh) can be controlled easily for realizing the tunable penetration depth. Moreover, the diethylamino groups in these designed PSs can serve as proton acceptors triggered by the low pH in lysosomes which can enhance the efficacy of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) of the compounds are prepared through a nanoprecipitation method and in vitro studies demonstrate that the ultra-low drug dosage of BDPtriPh NPs (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 4.16 μM) is much lower than that of BDPmPh NPs (50.09 μM) and BDPbiPh NPs (22.4 μM). In vivo fluorescence imaging shows that these NPs can be passively targeted to tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and BDPtriPh NPs exhibit the fastest accumulation (about 4 hours). In vivo phototherapy indicates that BDPtriPh NPs with the longest NIR absorbance (813 nm) and highest photothermal conversion efficiency (60.5%) can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce side effects to normal tissues. This study provides a strategy to modulate the photoconversion characteristics of PSs for both penetration-depth-tunable and pH-dependent PDT/PTT synergistic cancer therapy in clinics.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the carbapenem MM 4550 and its gene cluster in Streptomyces argenteolus ATCC 11009 Abstract: Nearly 50 naturally occurring carbapenem β-lactam antibiotics, most produced by Streptomyces, have been identified. The structural diversity of these compounds is limited to variance of the C-2 and C-6 side chains as well as the stereochemistry at C-5/C-6. These structural motifs are of interest both for their antibiotic effects and their biosynthesis. Although the thienamycin gene cluster is the only active gene cluster publically available in this group, more comparative information is needed to understand the genetic basis of these structural differences. We report here the identification of MM 4550, a member of the olivanic acids, as the major carbapenem produced by Streptomyces argenteolus ATCC 11009. Its gene cluster was also identified by degenerate PCR and targeted gene inactivation. Sequence analysis revealed that the genes encoding the biosynthesis of the bicyclic core and the C-6 and C-2 side chains are well conserved in the MM 4550 and thienamycin gene clusters. Three new genes, cmmSu, cmm17 and cmmPah were found in the new cluster, and their putative functions in the sulfonation and epimerization of MM 4550 are proposed. Gene inactivation showed that, in addition to cmmI, two new genes, cmm22 and -23, encode a two-component response system thought to regulate the production of MM 4550. Overexpression of cmmI, cmm22 and cmm23 promoted MM 4550 production in an engineered strain. Finally, the involvement and putative roles of all genes in the MM 4550 cluster are proposed based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, gene inactivation, and analysis of disruption mutants. Overall, the differences between the thienamycin and MM 4550 gene clusters are reflected in characteristic structural elements and provide new insights into the biosynthesis of the complex carbapenems.	1
Title: Coordination of auxin and ethylene biosynthesis by the aminotransferase VAS1 Abstract: We identify an Arabidopsis pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, VAS1, whose loss-of-function simultaneously increases amounts of the phytohormone auxin and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. VAS1 uses the ethylene biosynthetic intermediate methionine as an amino donor and the auxin biosynthetic intermediate indole-3-pyruvic acid as an amino acceptor to produce L-tryptophan and 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid. Our data indicate that VAS1 serves key roles in coordinating the amounts of these two vital hormones.	0
Title: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Unprotected β2-Amino Acids Abstract: We report here a scalable, catalytic one-pot approach to enantiopure and unmodified β2-amino acids. A newly developed confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalyzes a broadly applicable reaction of diverse bis-silyl ketene acetals with a silylated aminomethyl ether, followed by hydrolytic workup, to give free β2-amino acids in high yields, purity, and enantioselectivity. Importantly, both aromatic and aliphatic β2-amino acids can be obtained using this method. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the aminomethylation to proceed via silylium-based asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis (Si-ACDC) and a transition state to explain the enantioselectivity is suggested on the basis of density functional theory calculation.	0
Title: Prion nucleation site unmasked by transient interaction with phospholipid cofactor Abstract: Infectious mammalian prions can be formed de novo from purified recombinant prion protein (PrP) substrate through a pathway that requires the sequential addition of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) and RNA cofactor molecules. Recent studies show that the initial interaction between PrP and POPG causes widespread and persistent conformational changes to form an insoluble intermediate species, termed PrP(Int1). Here, we characterize the mechanism and functional consequences of the interaction between POPG and PrP. Negative-stain electron microscopy of PrP(Int1) revealed the presence of amorphous aggregates. Pull-down and photoaffinity label experiments indicate that POPG induces the formation of a PrP(C) polybasic-domain-binding neoepitope within PrP(Int1). The ongoing presence of POPG is not required to maintain PrP(Int1) structure, as indicated by the absence of stoichiometric levels of POPG in solid-state NMR measurements of PrP(Int1). Together, these results show that a transient interaction with POPG cofactor unmasks a PrP(C) binding site, leading to PrP(Int1) aggregation.	0
Title: The primary binding subunit of the human interleukin-4 receptor is also a component of the interleukin-13 receptor Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-13 elicits a subset of the biological activities of the related IL-4. The basis of this functional similarity is that their specific cell-surface receptors (called IL-13R and IL-4R) are distinct, yet are complex and share a common subunit(s). The IL-4R primary binding subunit (called IL-4R alpha) does not by itself bind IL-13. We show that the ability of IL-13 to partially compete for IL-4 binding to some human cell types depended on co-expression of IL-4R and IL-13R. However, IL-13 binding was always associated with IL-4 binding. Hyper-expression of IL-4R alpha on cells expressing both IL-4R and IL-13R decreased their binding affinity for IL-4, abrogated the ability of IL-13 to compete for IL-4 binding, and yet had no effect on IL-13R properties. Anti-human IL-4R alpha monoclonal antibodies which blocked the biological function and binding of IL-4 also blocked the function and binding of IL-13. These data show that IL-4R alpha is a secondary component of IL-13R.	0
Title: Template-free synthesis of mesoporous N-doped SrTiO3 perovskite with high visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity Abstract: An effective, template-free synthesis methodology has been developed for preparing mesoporous nitrogen-doped SrTiO(3) (meso-STON) using glycine as both a nitrogen source and a mesopore creator. The N-doping, large surface area and developed porosity endow meso-STON with excellent activity in visible-light-responsive photodegradation of organic dyes.	0
Title: Modulation of the ligand-field anisotropy in a series of ferric low-spin cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 and Nitrosomonas europaea cytochrome c-552: a nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance study Abstract: Cytochromes of the c type with histidine-methionine (His-Met) heme axial ligation play important roles in electron-transfer reactions and in enzymes. In this work, two series of cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa c-551) and from the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea (Ne c-552) were engineered and overexpressed. In these proteins, point mutations were induced in a key residue (Asn64) near the Met axial ligand; these mutations have a considerable impact both on heme ligand-field strength and on the Met orientation and dynamics (fluxionality), as judged by low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Ne c-552 has a ferric low-spin (S = 1/2) EPR signal characterized by large g anisotropy with g(max) resonance at 3.34; a similar large g(max) value EPR signal is found in the mitochondrial complex III cytochrome c1. In Ne c-552, deletion of Asn64 (NeN64Delta) changes the heme ligand field from more axial to rhombic (small g anisotropy and g(max) at 3.13) and furthermore hinders the Met fluxionality present in the wild-type protein. In Pa c-551 (g(max) at 3.20), replacement of Asn64 with valine (PaN64V) induces a decrease in the axial strain (g(max) at 3.05) and changes the Met configuration. Another set of mutants prepared by insertion (ins) and/or deletion (Delta) of a valine residue adjacent to Asn64, resulting in modifications in the length of the axial Met-donating loop (NeV65Delta, NeG50N/V65Delta, PaN50G/V65ins), did not result in appreciable alterations of the originally weak (Ne c-552) or very weak (Pa c-551) axial field but had an impact on Met orientation, fluxionality, and relaxation dynamics. Comparison of the electronic fingerprints in the overexpressed proteins and their mutants reveals a linear relationship between axial strain and average paramagnetic heme methyl shifts, irrespective of Met orientation or dynamics. Thus, for these His-Met axially coordinated Fe(III), the large g(max) value EPR signal does not represent a special case as is observed for bis-His axially coordinated Fe(III) with the two His planes perpendicular to each other.	0
Title: Enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles in oxygen reduction by chlorophenyl functionalization Abstract: Chlorophenyl-stabilized platinum nanoparticles (1.85 nm) exhibited electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction up to 3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Similar enhancement was observed with naked Pt/C functionalized by the same chlorophenyl fragments, suggesting the important role of organic capping ligands in the manipulation of nanoparticle electrocatalytic performance.	0
Title: Activation and characterization of a cryptic gene cluster reveals a cyclization cascade for polycyclic tetramate macrolactams Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) are a growing class of natural products and are derived from a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway. PTM biosynthetic gene clusters are conserved and widely distributed in bacteria, however, most of them remain silent. Herein we report the activation of a PTM gene cluster in marine-derived Streptomyces pactum SCSIO 02999 by promoter engineering and heterologous expression, leading to the discovery of six new PTMs, pactamides A-F (11-16), with potent cytotoxic activity upon several human cancer cell lines. In vivo gene disruption experiments and in vitro biochemical assays reveal a reductive cyclization cascade for polycycle formation, with reactions sequentially generating the 5, 5/5 and 5/5/6 carbocyclic ring systems, catalysed by the phytoene dehydrogenase PtmB2, the oxidoreductase PtmB1, and the alcohol dehydrogenase PtmC, respectively. Furthermore, PtmC was demonstrated as a bifunctional cyclase for catalyzing the formation of the inner five-membered ring in ikarugamycin. This study suggests the possibility of finding more bioactive PTMs by genome mining and discloses a general mechanism for the formation of 5/5/6-type carbocyclic rings in PTMs.	1
Title: Optical Electrophysiology: Toward the Goal of Label-Free Voltage Imaging Abstract: Measuring and monitoring the electrical signals transmitted between neurons is key to understanding the communication between neurons that underlies human perception, information processing, and decision-making. While electrode-based electrophysiology has been the gold standard, optical electrophysiology has opened up a new area in the past decade. Voltage-dependent fluorescent reporters enable voltage imaging with high spatial resolution and flexibility to choose recording locations. However, they exhibit photobleaching as well as phototoxicity and may perturb the physiology of the cell. Label-free optical electrophysiology seeks to overcome these hurdles by detecting electrical activities optically, without the incorporation of exogenous fluorophores in cells. For example, electrochromic optical recording detects neuroelectrical signals via a voltage-dependent color change of extracellular materials, and interferometric optical recording monitors membrane deformations that accompany electrical activities. Label-free optical electrophysiology, however, is in an early stage, and often has limited sensitivity and temporal resolution. In this Perspective, we review the recent progress to overcome these hurdles. We hope this Perspective will inspire developments of label-free optical electrophysiology techniques with high recording sensitivity and temporal resolution in the near future.	0
Title: First Ring-Expanded Maytansin Lactone Accessed by a New Mutasynthetic Variant Abstract: A multiblocked mutant strain (ΔAHBA and Δasm12, asm21) of Actinosynnema pretiosum, the producer of the highly toxic maytansinoid ansamitocin, has been used for the mutasynthetic production of new proansamitocin derivatives. The use of mutant strains that are blocked in the biosynthesis of an early building block as well as in the expression of two tailoring enzymes broadens the scope of chemo-biosynthetic access to new maytansinoids. Remarkably, a ring-expanded macrolactone derived from ansamitocin was created for the first time.	0
Title: Identification and sequence analysis of the genes encoding a polyketide synthase required for pyoluteorin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Abstract: Pyoluteorin is a chlorinated antifungal metabolite of mixed polyketide/amino-acid origin produced by certain strains of Pseudomonas spp., including the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Sequence analysis of a gene cluster required for pyoluteorin biosynthesis by Pf-5 (Kraus, J., Loper, J., 1995. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61, 849-854) has identified two genes whose deduced peptide sequences exhibit characteristics of both fungal and bacterial Type I polyketide synthases (PKSs). The pyoluteorin PKS does not contain a loading domain that is typically present in bacterial Type I PKSs. Furthermore, this PKS possesses an acyltransferase domain that does not contain the conserved residues surrounding the active-site motif typically found in domains of similar function. Based on the organization of the functional domains within the pyoluteorin PKS, we propose a biosynthetic pathway analogous to non-aromatic polyketide biosynthesis within the Actinomycete bacteria that is responsible for the formation of the resorcinol moiety of pyoluteorin.	1
Title: Tryptophan Synthase: Biocatalyst Extraordinaire Abstract: Tryptophan synthase (TrpS) has emerged as a paragon of noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) synthesis and is an ideal biocatalyst for synthetic and biological applications. TrpS catalyzes an irreversible, C-C bond-forming reaction between indole and serine to make l-tryptophan; native TrpS complexes possess fairly broad specificity for indole analogues, but are difficult to engineer to extend substrate scope or to confer other useful properties due to allosteric constraints and their heterodimeric structure. Directed evolution freed the catalytically relevant TrpS β-subunit (TrpB) from allosteric regulation by its TrpA partner and has enabled dramatic expansion of the enzyme's substrate scope. This review examines the long and storied career of TrpS from the perspective of its application in ncAA synthesis and biocatalytic cascades.	0

Title: Biosynthesis of Chlorinated Lactylates in Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249 Abstract: Lactylates are an important group of molecules in the food and cosmetic industries. A series of natural halogenated 1-lactylates, chlorosphaerolactylates (1-4), were recently reported from Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249. Here, we identify the cly biosynthetic gene cluster, containing all the necessary functionalities for the biosynthesis of the natural lactylates, based on in silico analyses. Using a combination of stable isotope incorporation experiments and bioinformatic analysis, we propose that dodecanoic acid and pyruvate are the key building blocks in the biosynthesis of 1-4. We additionally report minor analogues of these molecules with varying alkyl chains. This work paves the way to accessing industrially relevant lactylates through pathway engineering.	1
Title: Acinetodin and Klebsidin, RNA Polymerase Targeting Lasso Peptides Produced by Human Isolates of Acinetobacter gyllenbergii and Klebsiella pneumoniae Abstract: We report the bioinformatic prediction and structural validation of two lasso peptides, acinetodin and klebsidin, encoded by the genomes of several human-associated strains of Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Computation of the three-dimensional structures of these peptides using NMR NOESY constraints verifies that they contain a lasso motif. Despite the lack of sequence similarity to each other or to microcin J25, a prototypical lasso peptide and transcription inhibitor from Escherichia coli, acinetodin and klebsidin also inhibit transcript elongation by the E. coli RNA polymerase by binding to a common site. Yet, unlike microcin J25, acinetodin and klebsidin are unable to permeate wild type E. coli cells and inhibit their growth. We show that the E. coli cells become sensitive to klebsidin when expressing the outer membrane receptor FhuA homologue from Klebsiella pneumoniae. It thus appears that specificity to a common target, the RNA polymerase secondary channel, can be attained by a surprisingly diverse set of primary sequences folded into a common threaded-lasso fold. In contrast, transport into cells containing sensitive targets appears to be much more specific and must be the major determinant of the narrow range of bioactivity of known lasso peptides.	1
Title: CRAGE enables rapid activation of biosynthetic gene clusters in undomesticated bacteria Abstract: It is generally believed that exchange of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) among closely related bacteria is an important driver of BGC evolution and diversification. Applying this idea may help researchers efficiently connect many BGCs to their products and characterize the products' roles in various environments. However, existing genetic tools support only a small fraction of these efforts. Here, we present the development of chassis-independent recombinase-assisted genome engineering (CRAGE), which enables single-step integration of large, complex BGC constructs directly into the chromosomes of diverse bacteria with high accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the efficacy of CRAGE, we expressed three known and six previously identified but experimentally elusive non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and NRPS-polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid BGCs from Photorhabdus luminescens in 25 diverse γ-Proteobacteria species. Successful activation of six BGCs identified 22 products for which diversity and yield were greater when the BGCs were expressed in strains closely related to the native strain than when they were expressed in either native or more distantly related strains. Activation of these BGCs demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting their underlying catalytic activity and plasticity, and provides evidence that systematic approaches based on CRAGE will be useful for discovering and identifying previously uncharacterized metabolites.	1
Title: Characterization of yatakemycin gene cluster revealing a radical S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase and highlighting spirocyclopropane biosynthesis Abstract: Yatakemycin (YTM), an antitumor natural product, represents the most potent member of a class of potent anticancer natural products including CC-1065 and duocarmycins. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of YTM, which was identified by genome scanning of Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356. This cluster consists of 31 open reading frames (ORFs) and was localized to a 36 kb DNA segment. Moreover, its involvement in YTM biosynthesis was confirmed by cluster deletion, gene replacement, and complementation. Inactivation of ytkT, which encodes a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein, created a mutant strain that failed to produce YTM but accumulated a new metabolite, which was structurally elucidated as a precursor that was related to the formation of the cyclopropane ring. More importantly, biochemical characterization of the radical SAM-dependent enzyme YtkT revealed that it is a novel C-methyltransferase and contributes to an advanced intermediate during formation of the cyclopropane ring through a radical mechanism in the YTM biosynthetic pathway. On the basis of in silico analysis, genetic experiments, structure elucidation of the novel intermediate, and biochemical characterization, a biosynthetic pathway for yatakemycin was proposed, which sets the stage to further investigate the novel enzymatic mechanisms and engineer the biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues.	1
Title: Identification of three additional femAB-like open reading frames in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Three new proteins, FmhA, FmhB and FmhC, with significant identities to FemA and FemB were identified in the Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 55748) genome database. They were mapped to the SmaI-C, SmaI-H and SmaI-A fragments of the S. aureus 8325 chromosome, respectively. Whereas insertional inactivation of fmhA and fmhC had no effects on growth, antibiotic susceptibility, lysostaphin resistance, or peptidoglycan composition of the strains, fmhB could not be inactivated, strongly suggesting that fmhB may be an essential gene. As deduced from the functions of FemA and FemB which are involved in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan pentaglycine interpeptide, FmhB may be a candidate for the postulated FemX thought to add the first glycine to the nascent interpeptide.	0
Title: An in planta-expressed polyketide synthase produces (R)-mellein in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: Parastagonospora nodorum is a pathogen of wheat that affects yields globally. Previous transcriptional analysis identified a partially reducing polyketide synthase (PR-PKS) gene, SNOG_00477 (SN477), in P. nodorum that is highly upregulated during infection of wheat leaves. Disruption of the corresponding SN477 gene resulted in the loss of production of two compounds, which we identified as (R)-mellein and (R)-O-methylmellein. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast heterologous expression system, we successfully demonstrated that SN477 is the only enzyme required for the production of (R)-mellein. This is the first identification of a fungal PKS that is responsible for the synthesis of (R)-mellein. The P. nodorum ΔSN477 mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type strain in its virulence against wheat. However, (R)-mellein at 200 μg/ml inhibited the germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seeds. Comparative sequence analysis identified the presence of mellein synthase (MLNS) homologues in several Dothideomycetes and two sodariomycete genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the MLNSs in fungi and bacteria evolved convergently from fungal and bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthases.	1
Title: Biosynthetic multitasking facilitates thalassospiramide structural diversity in marine bacteria Abstract: Thalassospiramides A and B are immunosuppressant cyclic lipopeptides first reported from the marine α-proteobacterium Thalassospira sp. CNJ-328. We describe here the discovery and characterization of an extended family of 14 new analogues from four Tistrella and Thalassospira isolates. These potent calpain 1 protease inhibitors belong to six structure classes in which the length and composition of the acylpeptide side chain varies extensively. Genomic sequence analysis of the thalassospiramide-producing microbes revealed related, genus-specific biosynthetic loci encoding hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthases consistent with thalassospiramide assembly. The bioinformatics analysis of the gene clusters suggests that structural diversity, which ranges from the 803.4 Da thalassospiramide C to the 1291.7 Da thalassospiramide F, results from a complex sequence of reactions involving amino acid substrate channeling and enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration. Preliminary biochemical analysis of the N-terminal nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from the Thalassospira TtcA megasynthase supports a biosynthetic model in which in cis amino acid activation competes with in trans activation to increase the range of amino acid substrates incorporated at the N terminus.	1
Title: Matlystatins, new inhibitors of type IV collagenases from Actinomadura atramentaria. IV. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of matlystatin B and its stereoisomers Abstract: The first total synthesis of matlystatin B (1a), a low molecular weight inhibitor of type IV collagenases, was accomplished, and its absolute configuration was unambiguously determined. Furthermore, ten stereoisomers of 1a were synthesized, and the inhibition of the 92 kDa type IV collagenase and of other metalloproteinases by each stereoisomer was investigated.	1
Title: Selective removal of aberrant extender units by a type II thioesterase for efficient FR-008/candicidin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. strain FR-008 Abstract: Gene fscTE, encoding a putative type II thioesterase (TEII), was associated with the FR-008/candicidin gene cluster. Deletion of fscTE reduced approximately 90% of the FR-008/candicidin production, while the production level was well restored when fscTE was added back to the mutant in trans. FscTE was unable to compensate for the release of the maturely elongated polyketide as site-directed inactivation of the type I thioesterase (TEI) totally abolished FR-008/candicidin production. Direct biochemical analysis of FscTE in parallel with its homologue TylO from the tylosin biosynthetic pathway demonstrated their remarkable preferences for acyl-thioesters (i.e., propionyl-S-N-acetylcysteamine [SNAC] over methylmalonyl-SNAC and acetyl-SNAC over malonyl-SNAC) and thus concluded that TEII could maintain effective polyketide biosynthesis by selectively removing the nonelongatable residues bound to acyl carrier proteins. Overexpression of FscTE under the strong constitutive ermE*p promoter in the wild-type strain did not suppress FR-008/candicidin formation, which confirmed its substrate specificity in vivo. Furthermore, successful complementation of the fscTE mutant was obtained with fscTE and tylO, whereas no complementation was detected with nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) TEII tycF and srfAD, reflecting substrate specificities of TEIIs distinctive from those of either polyketide synthases or NRPSs.	0
Title: The Fusarium verticillioides FUM gene cluster encodes a Zn(II)2Cys6 protein that affects FUM gene expression and fumonisin production Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by some Fusarium species and can contaminate maize or maize products. Ingestion of fumonisins is associated with diseases, including cancer and neural tube defects, in humans and animals. In fungi, genes involved in the synthesis of mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites are often located adjacent to each other in gene clusters. Such genes can encode structural enzymes, regulatory proteins, and/or proteins that provide self-protection. The fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster includes 16 genes, none of which appear to play a role in regulation. In this study, we identified a previously undescribed gene (FUM21) located adjacent to the fumonisin polyketide synthase gene, FUM1. The presence of a Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding domain in the predicted protein suggested that FUM21 was involved in transcriptional regulation. FUM21 deletion (Deltafum21) mutants produce little to no fumonisin in cracked maize cultures but some FUM1 and FUM8 transcripts in a liquid GYAM medium. Complementation of a Deltafum21 mutant with a wild-type copy of the gene restored fumonisin production. Analysis of FUM21 cDNAs identified four alternative splice forms (ASFs), and microarray analysis indicated the ASFs were differentially expressed. Based on these data, we present a model for how FUM21 ASFs may regulate fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Enacyloxins are products of an unusual hybrid modular polyketide synthase encoded by a cryptic Burkholderia ambifaria Genomic Island Abstract: Gram-negative Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against cystic fibrosis microbial pathogens, and the ability of B. ambifaria to inhibit B. multivorans was identified. The activity was mapped to a cluster of cryptic, quorum-sensing-regulated modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. Enacyloxin IIa and its stereoisomer designated iso-enacyloxin IIa were identified as metabolic products of the gene cluster, which encoded an unusual hybrid modular PKS consisting of multiple proteins with sequence similarity to cis-acyltransferase (cis-AT) PKSs and a single protein with sequence similarity to trans-AT PKSs. The discovery of the potent activity of enacyloxins against drug-resistant bacteria and the gene cluster that directs their production provides an opportunity for engineered biosynthesis of innovative enacyloxin derivatives and highlights the potential of Bcc bacteria as an underexploited resource for antibiotic discovery.	1
Title: A gene cluster involved in nogalamycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces nogalater: sequence analysis and complementation of early-block mutations in the anthracycline pathway Abstract: We have analyzed an anthracycline biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces nogalater. Based on sequence analysis, a contiguous region of 11 kb is deduced to include genes for the early steps in anthracycline biosynthesis, a regulatory gene (snoA) promoting the expression of the biosynthetic genes, and at least one gene whose product might have a role in modification of the glycoside moiety. The three ORFs encoding a minimal polyketide synthase (PKS) are separated from the regulatory gene (snoA) by a comparatively AT-rich region (GC content 60%). Subfragments of the DNA region were transferred to Streptomyces galilaeus mutants blocked in aclacinomycin biosynthesis, and to a regulatory mutant of S. nogalater. The S. galilaeus mutants carrying the S. nogalater minimal PKS genes produced auramycinone glycosides, demonstrating replacement of the starter unit for polyketide biosynthesis. The product of snoA seems to be needed for expression of at least the genes for the minimal PKS.	1
Title: The transgenic expression of highly inhibitory monomeric forms of phospholamban in mouse heart impairs cardiac contractility Abstract: Transgenic mice were generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of the monomeric, dominant-acting, superinhibitory L37A and I40A mutant forms of phospholamban (PLN), and their phenotypes were compared with wild-type (wt) mice or 2-fold overexpressors of wt PLN (wtOE). The level of PLN monomer in cardiac microsomes was increased 11-13-fold, and the apparent affinity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase for Ca(2+) was decreased from pCa 6.22 in wt or 6.12 in wtOE to 5.81 in L37A and 5.72 in I40A. Basal physiological parameters, measured in isolated myocytes, indicated a significant reduction in the rates of shortening (+dL/dt) and relengthening (-dL/dt). Hemodynamic measurements indicated that peak systolic pressure was unaffected but that pressure changes (+dP/dt and -dP/dt) were lowered significantly in both mutant lines, and relaxation time (tau) was also lengthened significantly. Echocardiography for both mutants showed depressed systolic function and an increase in left ventricular mass of over 1.4-fold. Significant decreases in left ventricular shortening fraction and velocity of circumferential shortening and increases in ejection time were corrected by isoproterenol. The use of antibodies specific against Ser(16)- and Thr(17)-PLN peptides showed that phosphorylation of both pentameric and monomeric PLN were increased between 1.2- and 2.4-fold in both the L37A and I40A lines but not in the wtOE line. These observations show that overexpression of superinhibitory mutant forms of PLN causes depression of contractile parameters with induction of cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed with echocardiography.	0
Title: Purification of mutacin III from group III Streptococcus mutans UA787 and genetic analyses of mutacin III biosynthesis genes Abstract: Previously, members of our group reported the isolation and characterization of mutacin II from Streptococcus mutans T8 and the genetic analyses of the mutacin II biosynthesis genes (J. Novak, P. W. Caufield, and E. J. Miller, J. Bacteriol. 176:4316-4320, 1994; F. Qi, P. Chen, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:652-658, 1999; P. Chen, F. Qi, J. Novak, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:1356-1360, 1999). In this study, we cloned and sequenced the mutacin III biosynthesis gene locus from a group III strain of S. mutans, UA787. DNA sequence analysis revealed eight open reading frames, which we designated mutR, -A, -A', -B, -C, -D, -P, and -T. MutR bears strong homology with MutR of mutacin II, while MutA, -B, -C, -D, -P, and -T are counterparts of proteins in the lantibiotic epidermin group. MutA' has 60% amino acid identity with MutA and therefore appears to be a duplicate of MutA. Insertional inactivation demonstrated that mutA is an essential gene for mutacin III production, while mutA' is not required. Mutacin III was purified to homogeneity by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. N-terminal peptide sequencing of the purified mutacin III determined mutA to be the structural gene for prepromutacin III. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was measured by laser disorption mass spectrophotometry and found to be 2,266.43 Da, consistent with our supposition that mutacin III has posttranslational modifications similar to those of the lantibiotic epidermin.	1
Title: The association of genetic markers for type 2 diabetes with prediabetic status - cross-sectional data of a diabetes prevention trial Abstract: Objective:                       To investigate the association of risk alleles for type 2 diabetes with prediabetes accounting for age, anthropometry, inflammatory markers and lifestyle habits.                  Design:                       Cross-sectional study of 129 men and 157 women of medium-sized companies in northern Germany in the Delay of Impaired Glucose Tolerance by a Healthy Lifestyle Trial (DELIGHT).                  Methods:                       Besides established risk factors, 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been found to be associated with type 2 diabetes were analyzed. As a nonparametric test a random forest approach was used that allows processing of a large number of predictors. Variables with the highest impact were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate their association with prediabetes.                  Results:                       Individuals with prediabetes were characterized by a slightly, but significantly higher number of type 2 diabetes risk alleles (42.5±4.1 vs. 41.3±4.1, p = 0.013). After adjustment for age and waist circumference 6 SNPs with the highest impact in the random forest analysis were associated with risk for prediabetes in a logistic regression model. At least 5 of these SNPs were positively related to prediabetic status (odds ratio for prediabetes 1.57 per allele (Cl 1.21-2.10, p = 0.001)).                  Conclusions:                       This explorative analysis of data of DELIGHT demonstrates that at least 6 out of 41 genetic variants characteristic of individuals with type 2 diabetes may also be associated with prediabetes. Accumulation of these risk alleles may markedly increase the risk for prediabetes. However, prospective studies are required to corroborate these findings and to demonstrate the predictive value of these genetic variants for the risk to develop prediabetes.	0
Title: Deep sequencing reveals exceptional diversity and modes of transmission for bacterial sponge symbionts Abstract: Marine sponges contain complex bacterial communities of considerable ecological and biotechnological importance, with many of these organisms postulated to be specific to sponge hosts. Testing this hypothesis in light of the recent discovery of the rare microbial biosphere, we investigated three Australian sponges by massively parallel 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing. Here we show bacterial diversity that is unparalleled in an invertebrate host, with more than 250,000 sponge-derived sequence tags being assigned to 23 bacterial phyla and revealing up to 2996 operational taxonomic units (95% sequence similarity) per sponge species. Of the 33 previously described 'sponge-specific' clusters that were detected in this study, 48% were found exclusively in adults and larvae - implying vertical transmission of these groups. The remaining taxa, including 'Poribacteria', were also found at very low abundance among the 135,000 tags retrieved from surrounding seawater. Thus, members of the rare seawater biosphere may serve as seed organisms for widely occurring symbiont populations in sponges and their host association might have evolved much more recently than previously thought.	0
Title: The t(10;14)(q24;q11) of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia juxtaposes the delta T-cell receptor with TCL3, a conserved and activated locus at 10q24 Abstract: We cloned the t(10;14) recurrent translocation from CD3-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The breakpoint at 14q11 involved an intermediate rearrangement of the delta T-cell receptor locus, suggesting that the translocation arose at the time of antigen receptor assemblage. Translocation introduced chromosome segment 10q24 as proven by hybridization of a breakpoint-derived probe to flow-sorted chromosomes and metaphase chromosomes. Two t(10;14) breakpoints were clustered within a 600-base-pair region of 10q24 but no heptamer-spacer-nonamer motifs resembling T-cell receptor/immunoglobulin rearrangement signals were noted at the breakpoint. A locus distinct from terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was found at 10q24. Evolutionarily conserved regions surrounding the 10q24 breakpoint were examined for transcriptional activity. A region telomeric to the 10q24 breakpoint, expected to translocate to the der(14) chromosome, recognized an abundant 2.9-kilobase RNA in a t(10;14) T-cell leukemia. This locus was not active in a variety of other normal and neoplastic T cells, arguing that it was deregulated by the introduction of the T-cell receptor. This locus is a candidate for a putative protooncogene, TCL3, involved in T-cell neoplasia.	0
Title: Total counts of marine bacteria include a large fraction of non-nucleoid-containing bacteria (ghosts) Abstract: Counts of heterotrophic bacteria in marine waters are usually in the order of 5 x 10(sup5) to 3 x 10(sup6) bacteria ml(sup-1). These numbers are derived from unspecific fluorescent staining techniques (J. E. Hobbie, R. J. Daley, and S. Jasper, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 33:1225-1228, 1977; K. G. Porter and Y. S. Feig, Limnol. Oceanogr. 25:943-948, 1980) and are subsequently defined as total counts of bacteria. In samples from the Baltic Sea, the North Sea (Skagerrak), and the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, we found that only a minor fraction (2 to 32%) of total counts can be scored as bacteria with nucleoids. Lack of DNA no doubt means inactive cells; therefore, a much lower number of bacteria that grow at rates higher than those previously estimated must be responsible for the measured bacterial production in these seas. The remaining bacterium-sized and/or -shaped particles included in total counts may be cell residues of virus-lysed bacteria (ghosts) or remains of protozoan grazing.	0
Title: Expressed sequence tags and genes associated with loline alkaloid expression by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum Abstract: Loline alkaloids (LA), which are 1-aminopyrrolizidines with an oxygen bridge, are produced by Epichloë (anamorph=Neotyphodium) species, endophytes of grasses. LA are insecticidal, thus, helping to protect host plants from insect herbivory. The objective of this study was to identify genes associated with LA biosynthesis. Suppression subtractive hybridization PCR was used to isolate transcripts up-regulated during LA production in cultures of Neotyphodium uncinatum. Subtracted cDNAs were cloned and a lambda-phage cDNA library from an LA-expressing N. uncinatum culture was screened with subtracted cDNA. In BLAST searches, several cDNAs identified had sequence similarities to aspartate kinases and another with O-acetylhomoserine-(thiol)lyase. Differential expression of these two genes in LA-producing cultures of N. uncinatum was confirmed and in a survey of 23 isolates from 21 Neotyphodium and Epichloë species these two genes strictly correlated with LA production. These findings open up the possibility for detailed studies on genes and enzymes involved in LA production.	1
Title: Myxovirescin A biosynthesis is directed by hybrid polyketide synthases/nonribosomal peptide synthetase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthases, and trans-acting acyltransferases Abstract: Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 is shown to be a producer of myxovirescin (antibiotic TA) antibiotics. The myxovirescin biosynthetic gene cluster spans at least 21 open reading frames (ORFs) and covers a chromosomal region of approximately 83 kb. In silico analysis of myxovirescin ORFs in conjunction with genetic studies suggests the involvement of four type I polyketide synthases (PKSs; TaI, TaL, TaO, and TaP), one major hybrid PKS/NRPS (Ta-1), and a number of monofunctional enzymes similar to the ones involved in type II fatty-acid biosynthesis (FAB). Whereas deletion of either taI or taL causes a dramatic drop in myxovirescin production, deletion of both genes (DeltataIL) leads to the complete loss of myxovirescin production. These results suggest that both TaI and TaL PKSs might act in conjunction with a methyltransferase, reductases, and a monooxygenase to produce the 2-hydroxyvaleryl-S-ACP starter that is proposed to act as the biosynthetic primer in the initial condensation reaction with glycine. Polymerization of the remaining 11 acetates required for lactone formation is directed by 12 modules of Ta-1, TaO, and TaP megasynthetases. All modules, except for the first module of TaL, lack cognate acyltransferase (AT) domains. Furthermore, deletion of a discrete tandem AT-encoded by taV-blocks myxovirescin production; this suggests an "in trans" mode of action. To embellish the macrocycle with methyl and ethyl moieties, assembly of the myxovirescin scaffold is proposed to switch twice from PKS to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)-like biochemistry during biosynthesis. Disruption of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, TaQ, shifts production toward two novel myxovirescin analogues, designated myxovirescin Q(a) and myxovirescin Q(c). NMR analysis of purified myxovirescin Q(a) revealed the loss of the methoxy carbon atom. This novel analogue lacks bioactivity against E. coli.	1
Title: Community dynamics and functional characteristics of naphthalene-degrading populations in contaminated surface sediments and hypoxic/anoxic groundwater Abstract: Earlier research on the biogeochemical factors affecting natural attenuation in coal-tar contaminated groundwater, at South Glens Falls, NY, revealed the importance of anaerobic metabolism and trophic interactions between degrader and bacterivore populations. Field-based characterizations of both phenomena have proven challenging, but advances in stable isotope probing (SIP), single-cell imaging and shotgun metagenomics now provide cultivation-independent tools for their study. We tracked carbon from 13 C-labelled naphthalene through microbial populations in contaminated surface sediments over 6 days using respiration assays, secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging and shotgun metagenomics to disentangle the contaminant-based trophic web. Contaminant-exposed communities in hypoxic/anoxic groundwater were contrasted with those from oxic surface sediments to identify putative features of anaerobic catabolism of naphthalene. In total, six bacteria were responsible for naphthalene degradation. Cupriavidus, Ralstonia and Sphingomonas predominated at the earliest stages of SIP incubations and were succeeded in later stages by Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus. Metagenome-assembled genomes provided evidence for the ecological and functional characteristics underlying these temporal shifts. Identical species of Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus were abundant in the most contaminated, anoxic groundwater. Apparent increases in bacterivorous protozoa were observed following exposure to naphthalene, though insignificant amounts of carbon were transferred between bacterial degraders and populations of secondary feeders.	0
Title: The fumagillin gene cluster, an example of hundreds of genes under veA control in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of invasive aspergillosis, leading to infection-related mortality in immunocompromised patients. We previously showed that the conserved and unique-to-fungi veA gene affects different cell processes such as morphological development, gliotoxin biosynthesis and protease activity, suggesting a global regulatory effect on the genome of this medically relevant fungus. In this study, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that veA controls the expression of hundreds of genes in A. fumigatus, including those comprising more than a dozen known secondary metabolite gene clusters. Chemical analysis confirmed that veA controls the synthesis of other secondary metabolites in this organism in addition to gliotoxin. Among the secondary metabolite gene clusters regulated by veA is the elusive but recently identified gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of fumagillin, a meroterpenoid known for its anti-angiogenic activity by binding to human methionine aminopeptidase 2. The fumagillin gene cluster contains a veA-dependent regulatory gene, fumR (Afu8g00420), encoding a putative C6 type transcription factor. Deletion of fumR results in silencing of the gene cluster and elimination of fumagillin biosynthesis. We found expression of fumR to also be dependent on laeA, a gene encoding another component of the fungal velvet complex. The results in this study argue that veA is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus, and that veA may be a conduit via which chemical development is coupled to morphological development and other cellular processes.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Immunosuppressant (-)-FR901483 Abstract: We report characterization of the biosynthetic pathway of the potent immunosuppressant (-)-FR901483 (1) through heterologous expression and enzymatic assays. The biosynthetic logic to form the azatricyclic alkaloid is consistent with those proposed in biomimetic syntheses and involves aza-spiro annulation of dityrosyl-piperazine to form a ketoaldehyde intermediate, followed by regioselective aldol condensation, stereoselective ketoreduction, and phosphorylation. A possible target of 1 is proposed based on the biosynthetic studies.	1
Title: Anthracycline metabolites from baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788. I. Isolation of antibiotic-blocked mutants and their characterization Abstract: Biosynthetically blocked mutants were obtained from a baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788 newly isolated from soil. The first mutant isolated was a baumycin-negative but daunorubicin-accumulating mutant with a loss of 4'-substitution activity, from which all other blocked mutants were successively derived. These included a known 11-deoxydaunorubicin-producing mutant and several new types of mutants which produced mainly 10-carboxy-13-deoxocarminomycin, 10-methoxycarbonyl-13-deoxocarminomycin, their 11-deoxy derivatives or a precursor aglycone, respectively. In this paper, all the anthracycline components produced by the parent strain and its two known blocked mutants, a daunorubicin producer and a 11-deoxydaunorubicin producer, are also determined by HPLC and five new components are isolated. Cytotoxicities in vitro of all the components against L1210 cell culture are also described.	0
Title: A Proteomic Connectivity Map for Characterizing the Tumor Adaptive Response to Small Molecule Chemical Perturbagens Abstract: A powerful means to understand the cellular function of corrupt oncogenic signaling programs requires perturbing the system and monitoring the downstream consequences. Here, using a unique pair of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)/normal lung epithelial patient-derived cell lines (HCC4017/HBEC30KT), we systematically interrogated the remodeling of the NSCLC proteome upon treatment with 35 chemical perturbagens targeting a diverse array of mechanistic classes. HCC4017 and HBEC30KT cells differ significantly in their proteomic response to the same compound treatment. Using protein covariance analyses, we identified a large number of functional protein networks. For example, we found that a poorly studied protein, C5orf22, is a novel component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex. Depletion of C5orf22 leads to the aberrant splicing and expression of genes involved in cell growth and immunomodulation. In summary, we show that by systematically measuring the tumor adaptive responses at the proteomic level, an understanding could be generated that provides critical circuit-level biological insights for these pharmacologic perturbagens.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and structure of aeruginoside 126A and 126B, cyanobacterial peptide glycosides bearing a 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole moiety Abstract: Aeruginosins represent a group of peptide metabolites isolated from various cyanobacterial genera and from marine sponges that potently inhibit different types of serine proteases. Members of this family are characterized by the presence of a 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole (Choi) moiety. We have identified and fully sequenced a NRPS gene cluster in the genome of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii CYA126/8. Insertional mutagenesis of a NRPS component led to the discovery and structural elucidation of two glycopeptides that were designated aeruginoside 126A and aeruginoside 126B. One variant of the aglycone contains a 1-amino-2-(N-amidino-Delta(3)-pyrrolinyl)ethyl moiety at the C terminus, the other bears an agmatine residue. In silico analyses of the aeruginoside biosynthetic genes aerA-aerI as well as additional mutagenesis and feeding studies allowed the prediction of enzymatic steps leading to the formation of aeruginosides and the unusual Choi moiety.	1
Title: The gene cluster for fluorometabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces cattleya: a thioesterase confers resistance to fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A Abstract: A genomic library of Streptomyces cattleya was screened to isolate a gene cluster encoding enzymes responsible for the production of fluorine-containing metabolites. In addition to the previously described fluorinase FlA which catalyzes the formation of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine from S-adenosylmethionine and fluoride, 11 other putative open reading frames have been identified. Three of the proteins encoded by these genes have been characterized. FlB was determined to be the second enzyme in the pathway, catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine to produce 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate. The enzyme FlI was found to be an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which may act to relieve S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the fluorinase. Finally, flK encodes a thioesterase which catalyzes the selective breakdown of fluoroacetyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA, suggesting that it provides the producing strain with a mechanism for resistance to fluoroacetate.	1
Title: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acid D Abstract: A convergent total synthesis of the architecturally complex indole diterpenoid (-)-nodulisporic acid D has been achieved. Key synthetic transformations include vicinal difunctionalization of an advanced α,β-unsaturated aldehyde to form the E,F-trans-fused 5,6-ring system of the eastern hemisphere and a cascade cross-coupling/indolization protocol leading to the CDE multisubstituted indole core.	0
Title: Semisynthesis and Kappa-Opioid Receptor Activity of Derivatives of Columbin, a Furanolactone Diterpene Abstract: Columbin (1) is a furanolactone diterpene isolated from the roots of Jateorhiza and Tinospora species. These species generally grow in Asia and Africa and have been used in folk medicine for their apparent analgesic and antipyretic activities. Columbin (1) is of particular interest due to its structural similarity to the known kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist salvinorin A. Given that the KOR is of interest in the study of many serious diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction, obtaining natural or semisynthetic molecules with KOR activity recently has gained much interest. For this reason, in the present study, derivatives of 1 were designed and synthesized using known structure-activity relationships of salvinorin A at KORs. The structures of the columbin analogues prepared were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, and their KOR activity was investigated in vitro by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Slight improvements in KOR activity were observed in columbin derivatives over their parent compound. However, despite the structural similarities to salvinorin A, neither columbin (1) nor its derivatives were potent KOR ligands. This work represents not only the first evaluation of columbin (1) at the KOR but also one of the first works to explore synthetic strategies that are tolerated on the columbin core.	0
Title: Protective effects of voltage-gated calcium channel antagonists against zinc toxicity in SN56 neuroblastoma cholinergic cells Abstract: One of the pathological site effects in excitotoxic activation is Zn2+ overload to postsynaptic neurons. Such an effect is considered to be equivalent to the glutamate component of excitotoxicity. Excessive uptake of Zn2+ by active voltage-dependent transport systems in these neurons may lead to significant neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and which antagonists of the voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) might modify this Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells. Our data demonstrates that depolarized SN56 neuronal cells may take up large amounts of Zn2+ and store these in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial sub-fractions. The mitochondrial Zn2+ excess suppressed pyruvate uptake and oxidation. Such suppression was caused by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, aconitase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase activities, resulting in the yielding of acetyl-CoA and ATP shortages. Moreover, incoming Zn2+ increased both oxidized glutathione and malondialdehyde levels, known parameters of oxidative stress. In depolarized SN56 cells, nifedipine treatment (L-type VGCC antagonist) reduced Zn2+ uptake and oxidative stress. The treatment applied prevented the activities of PDHC, aconitase and NADP-IDH enzymes, and also yielded the maintenance of acetyl-CoA and ATP levels. Apart from suppression of oxidative stress, N- and P/Q-type VGCCs presented a similar, but weaker protective influence. In conclusion, our data shows that in the course of excitotoxity, impairment to calcium homeostasis is tightly linked with an excessive neuronal Zn2+ uptake. Hence, the VGCCs types L, N and P/Q share responsibility for neuronal Zn2+ overload followed by significant energy-dependent neurotoxicity. Moreover, Zn2+ affects the target tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, yields acetyl-CoA and energy deficits as well.	0
Title: Catalytic activities of cocaine hydrolases against the most toxic cocaine metabolite norcocaethylene Abstract: A majority of cocaine users also consume alcohol. The concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol produces the pharmacologically active metabolites cocaethylene and norcocaethylene, in addition to norcocaine. Both cocaethylene and norcocaethylene are more toxic than cocaine itself. Hence, a truly valuable cocaine-metabolizing enzyme for cocaine abuse/overdose treatment should be effective for the hydrolysis of not only cocaine, but also its metabolites norcocaine, cocaethylene, and norcocaethylene. However, there has been no report on enzymes capable of hydrolyzing norcocaethylene (the most toxic metabolite of cocaine). The catalytic efficiency parameters (kcat and KM) of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and two mutants (known as cocaine hydrolases E14-3 and E12-7) against norcocaethylene have been characterized in the present study for the first time, and they are compared with those against cocaine. According to the obtained kinetic data, wild-type human BChE showed a similar catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (kcat = 9.5 min-1, KM = 11.7 μM, and kcat/KM = 8.12 × 105 M-1 min-1) to that against (-)-cocaine (kcat = 4.1 min-1, KM = 4.5 μM, and kcat/KM = 9.1 × 105 M-1 min-1). E14-3 and E12-7 showed an improved catalytic activity against norcocaethylene compared to wild-type BChE. E12-7 showed a 39-fold improved catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (kcat = 210 min-1, KM = 6.6 μM, and kcat/KM = 3.18 × 107 M-1 min-1). It has been demonstrated that E12-7 as an exogenous enzyme can efficiently metabolize norcocaethylene in rats.	0
Title: Secoiridoids and Iridoids from Morinda asteroscepa Abstract: The new 2,3-secoiridoids morisecoiridoic acids A (1) and B (2), the new iridoid 8-acetoxyepishanzilactone (3), and four additional known iridoids (4-7) were isolated from the leaf and stem bark methanol extracts of Morinda asteroscepa using chromatographic methods. The structure of shanzilactone (4) was revised. The purified metabolites were identified using NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques, with the absolute configuration of 1 having been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crude leaf extract (10 μg/mL) and compounds 1-3 and 5 (10 μM) showed mild antiplasmodial activities against the chloroquine-sensitive malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (3D7).	0
Title: Molecular investigation and phylogeny of Anaplasma spp. in Mediterranean ruminants reveal the presence of neutrophil-tropic strains closely related to A. platys Abstract: Few data are available on the prevalence and molecular typing of species belonging to the genus Anaplasma in Mediterranean ruminants. In this study, PCR analysis and sequencing of both 16S rRNA and groEL genes were combined to investigate the presence, prevalence, and molecular traits of Anaplasma spp. in ruminants sampled on the Island of Sardinia, chosen as a subtropical representative area. The results demonstrate a high prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in ruminants, with animals infected by at least four of six Anaplasma species (Anaplasma marginale, A. bovis, A. ovis, and A. phagocytophilum). Moreover, ruminants host a number of neutrophil-tropic strains genetically closely related to the canine pathogen A. platys. The high Anaplasma spp. prevalence and the identification of as-yet-unclassified neutrophil-tropic strains raise concerns about the specificity of serological tests routinely used in ruminants and provide additional background for reconstructing the evolutionary history of species genetically related to A. phagocytophilum.	0
Title: Discovery of the Tiancilactone Antibiotics by Genome Mining of Atypical Bacterial Type II Diterpene Synthases Abstract: Although genome mining has advanced the identification, discovery, and study of microbial natural products, the discovery of bacterial diterpenoids continues to lag behind. Herein, we report the identification of 66 putative producers of novel bacterial diterpenoids, and the discovery of the tiancilactone (TNL) family of antibiotics, by genome mining of type II diterpene synthases that do not possess the canonical DXDD motif. The TNLs, which are broad-spectrum antibiotics with moderate activities, are produced by both Streptomyces sp. CB03234 and Streptomyces sp. CB03238 and feature a highly functionalized diterpenoid skeleton that is further decorated with chloroanthranilate and γ-butyrolactone moieties. Genetic manipulation of the tnl gene cluster resulted in TNL congeners, which provided insights into their biosynthesis and structure-activity relationships. This work highlights the biosynthetic potential that bacteria possess to produce diterpenoids and should inspire continued efforts to discover terpenoid natural products from bacteria.	1
Title: Bacterial community shift for monitoring the co-composting of oil palm empty fruit bunch and palm oil mill effluent anaerobic sludge Abstract: A recently developed rapid co-composting of oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) and palm oil mill effluent (POME) anaerobic sludge is beginning to attract attention from the palm oil industry in managing the disposal of these wastes. However, a deeper understanding of microbial diversity is required for the sustainable practice of the co-compositing process. In this study, an in-depth assessment of bacterial community succession at different stages of the pilot scale co-composting of OPEFB-POME anaerobic sludge was performed using 454-pyrosequencing, which was then correlated with the changes of physicochemical properties including temperature, oxygen level and moisture content. Approximately 58,122 of 16S rRNA gene amplicons with more than 500 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) were obtained. Alpha diversity and principal component analysis (PCoA) indicated that bacterial diversity and distributions were most influenced by the physicochemical properties of the co-composting stages, which showed remarkable shifts of dominant species throughout the process. Species related to Devosia yakushimensis and Desemzia incerta are shown to emerge as dominant bacteria in the thermophilic stage, while Planococcus rifietoensis correlated best with the later stage of co-composting. This study proved the bacterial community shifts in the co-composting stages corresponded with the changes of the physicochemical properties, and may, therefore, be useful in monitoring the progress of co-composting and compost maturity.	0
Title: Genome-based deletion analysis reveals the prenyl xanthone biosynthesis pathway in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Xanthones are a class of molecules that bind to a number of drug targets and possess a myriad of biological properties. An understanding of xanthone biosynthesis at the genetic level should facilitate engineering of second-generation molecules and increasing production of first-generation compounds. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been found to produce two prenylated xanthones, shamixanthone and emericellin, and we report the discovery of two more, variecoxanthone A and epishamixanthone. Using targeted deletions that we created, we determined that a cluster of 10 genes including a polyketide synthase gene, mdpG, is required for prenyl xanthone biosynthesis. mdpG was shown to be required for the synthesis of the anthraquinone emodin, monodictyphenone, and related compounds, and our data indicate that emodin and monodictyphenone are precursors of prenyl xanthones. Isolation of intermediate compounds from the deletion strains provided valuable clues as to the biosynthetic pathway, but no genes accounting for the prenylations were located within the cluster. To find the genes responsible for prenylation, we identified and deleted seven putative prenyltransferases in the A. nidulans genome. We found that two prenyltransferase genes, distant from the cluster, were necessary for prenyl xanthone synthesis. These genes belong to the fungal indole prenyltransferase family that had previously been shown to be responsible for the prenylation of amino acid derivatives. In addition, another prenyl xanthone biosynthesis gene is proximal to one of the prenyltransferase genes. Our data, in aggregate, allow us to propose a complete biosynthetic pathway for the A. nidulans xanthones.	1
Title: WS75624 A and B, new endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors isolated from Saccharothrix sp. No. 75624. II. Structure elucidation of WS75624 A and B Abstract: The structures of WS75624 A and B, novel endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors, were determined to be 1 and 2A, respectively, by a combination of chemical evidence and a series of 2D NMR spectral analyses.	0
Title: Phylogenetic characterization and promoter expression analysis of a novel hybrid protein disulfide isomerase/cargo receptor subfamily unique to plants and chromalveolates Abstract: Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) play critical roles in protein folding by catalyzing the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in nascent secretory proteins. There are six distinct PDI subfamilies in terrestrial plants. A unique feature of PDI-C subfamily members is their homology to the yeast retrograde (Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum) cargo receptor proteins, Erv41p and Erv46p. Here, we demonstrate that plant Erv41p/Erv46p-like proteins are divided into three subfamilies: ERV-A, ERV-B and PDI-C, which all possess the N-proximal and C-proximal conserved domains of yeast Erv41p and Erv46p. However, in PDI-C isoforms, these domains are separated by a thioredoxin domain. The distribution of PDI-C isoforms among eukaryotes indicates that the PDI-C subfamily likely arose through an ancient exon-shuffling event that occurred before the divergence of plants from stramenopiles and rhizarians. Arabidopsis has three PDI-C genes: PDI7, PDI12, and PDI13. PDI12- and PDI13-promoter: β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusions are co-expressed in pollen and stipules, while PDI7 is distinctly expressed in the style, hydathodes, and leaf vasculature. The PDI-C thioredoxin domain active site motif CxxS is evolutionarily conserved among land plants. Whereas PDI12 and PDI13 retain the CxxS motif, PDI7 has a CxxC motif similar to classical PDIs. We hypothesize that PDI12 and PDI13 maintain the ancestral roles of PDI-C in Arabidopsis, while PDI7 has undergone neofunctionalization. The unusual PDI/cargo receptor hybrid arrangement in PDI-C isoforms has no counterpart in animals or yeast, and predicts the need for pairing redox functions with cargo receptor processes during protein trafficking in plants and other PDI-C containing organisms.	0
Title: CIRCE, a novel heat shock element involved in regulation of heat shock operon dnaK of Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The dnaK and groESL operons of Bacillus subtilis are preceded by a potential sigma 43 promoter sequence (recognized by the vegetative sigma factor) and by an inverted repeat (IR) consisting of 9 bp separated by a 9-bp spacer. Since this IR has been found in many bacterial species, we suspected that it might be involved in heat shock regulation. In order to test this hypothesis, three different mutational alterations of three bases were introduced within the IR preceding the dnaK operon. These mutations were crossed into the chromosome of B. subtilis, and expression of the dnaK and of the unlinked groESL operons was studied. The dnaK operon exhibited increased expression at low temperature and a reduction in the stimulation after temperature upshift. Furthermore, these mutations reduced expression of the groESL operon at low temperature by 50% but did not interfere with stimulation after heat shock. These experiments show that the IR acts as a negative cis element of the dnaK operon. This conclusion was strengthened by the observation that the IR reduced expression of two different transcriptional fusions significantly after its insertion between the promoter and the reporter gene. Since this IR has been described in many bacterial species as preceding only genes of the dnaK and groESL operons, both encoding molecular chaperones (39 cases are documented so far), we designated this heat shock element CIRCE (controlling IR of chaperone expression). Furthermore, we suggest that this novel mechanism is more widespread among eubacteria than the regulation mechanism described for Escherichia coli and has a more ancient origin.	0
Title: A Salmonella inositol polyphosphatase acts in conjunction with other bacterial effectors to promote host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial internalization Abstract: A central feature of Salmonella pathogenicity is the bacterium's ability to enter into non-phagocytic cells. Bacterial internalization is the consequence of cellular responses characterized by Cdc42- and Rac-dependent actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. These responses are triggered by the co-ordinated function of bacterial proteins delivered into the host cell by a specialized protein secretion system termed type III. We report here that SopB, a Salmonella inositol polyphosphatase delivered to the host cell by this secretion system, mediates actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial entry in a Cdc42-dependent manner. SopB exhibits overlapping functions with two other effectors of bacterial entry, the Rho family GTPase exchange factors SopE and SopE2. Thus, Salmonella strains deficient in any one of these proteins can enter into cells at high efficiency, whereas a strain lacking all three effectors is completely defective for entry. Consistent with an important role for inositol phosphate metabolism in Salmonella-induced cellular responses, a catalytically defective mutant of SopB failed to stimulate actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial entry. Furthermore, bacterial infection of intestinal cells resulted in a marked increase in Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, a consumption of InsP5 and the activation of phospholipase C. In agreement with the in vivo findings, purified SopB specifically dephosphorylated InsP5 to Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 in vitro. Surprisingly, the inositol phosphate fluxes induced by Salmonella were not caused exclusively by SopB. We show that the SopB-independent inositol phosphate fluxes are the consequence of the SopE-dependent activation of an endogenous inositol phosphatase. The ability of Salmonella to stimulate Rho GTPases signalling and inositol phosphate metabolism through alternative mechanisms is an example of the remarkable ability of this bacterial pathogen to manipulate host cellular functions.	0
Title: Generalized Verhulst laws for population growth Abstract: The growth or decay of population of a single species interacting with a large number of other species (or environment) according to the Volterra-Lotka model is investigated. When the environment is initially very close to its equilibrium level, the growth of a single species follows a generalized Verhulst law, containing hereditary effects. The derivation, modeled on statistical mechanical theories of Brownian motion, leads also to a "noise" source and to its relation to the heredity kernel. A special case, where the hereditary kernel is a damped exponential function of time, is solved numerically. When growth starts at a level much below equilibrium, the population first overshoots equilibrium and then approaches it. When decay starts at a level much higher than equilibrium, the population first decays precipitously to a very low level and then slowly grows toward equilibrium.	0
Title: Association of a Mr 50,000 cap-binding protein with the cytoskeleton in baby hamster kidney cells Abstract: A monoclonal antibody directed against eukaryotic mRNA 5'-cap-binding protein (anti-CBP antibody) was used to localize cap-binding protein (CBP) in BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. It was found that the antibody reacts with a fibrous network extending through the cytoplasm in a radial arrangement. The network behaves like intermediate filaments in colchicine-treated cells, suggesting a direct or indirect linkage of CBP with intermediate filaments. The association of CBP with a cytoskeletal element was further confirmed by isolation of proteins from Triton X-100-extracted cells and identification of CBP in the cytoskeletal fraction with anti-CBP antibody. The major polypeptide reacting with anti-CBP antibody is a Mr 50,000 component. Tryptic peptide mapping showed that this polypeptide is related to a Mr 24,000 polypeptide identified as CBP in earlier experiments [Sonenberg, N., Morgan, M. A., Testa, D., Colonna, R. J. & Shatkin, A. J. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 4843-4847].	0
Title: Protective effect of probiotics on Salmonella infectivity assessed with combined in vitro gut fermentation-cellular models Abstract: Background:                       Accurate assessment of probiotics with targeted anti-Salmonella activity requires suitable models accounting for both, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in gut environments. Here we report the combination of two original in vitro intestinal models closely mimicking the complex in vivo conditions of the large intestine. Effluents from continuous in vitro three-stage fermentation colonic models of Salmonella Typhimurium infection inoculated with immobilized child microbiota and Salmonella were directly applied to confluent mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cell layers. The effects of Salmonella, addition of two bacteriocinogenic strains, Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 (thermophilicin B67) and Escherichia coli L1000 (microcin B17), and inulin were tested on Salmonella growth and interactions with epithelial cell layers. Salmonella adhesion and invasion were investigated and epithelial integrity assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurements and confocal microscopy observation. Data from complex effluents were compared with pure Salmonella cultures.                  Results:                       Salmonella in effluents of all reactors of the colonic fermentation model stabilized at mean values of 5.3 ± 0.8 log10 cfu/ml effluent. Invasion of cell-associated Salmonella was up to 50-fold lower in complex reactor samples compared to pure Salmonella cultures. It further depended on environmental factors, with 0.2 ± 0.1% being measured with proximal, 0.6 ± 0.2% with transverse and 1.3 ± 0.7% with distal reactor effluents, accompanied by a similar high decrease of TER across cell monolayers (minus 45%) and disruption of tight junctions. Subsequent addition of E. coli L1000 stimulated Salmonella growth (6.4 ± 0.6 log10 cfu/ml effluent of all 3 reactors) and further decreased TER, but led to 10-fold decreased invasion efficiency when tested with distal reactor samples. In contrast, presence of B. thermophilum RBL67 revealed a protective effect on epithelial integrity compared to previous E. coli L1000 periods, as reflected by a significant mean increase of TER by 58% in all reactors. Inulin addition enhanced Salmonella growth and invasion when tested with distal and proximal reactor samples, respectively, but induced a limited decrease of TER (minus 18%) in all reactors.                  Conclusions:                       Our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to assess strain-specific first-level host protection properties of probiotics during Salmonella infection, providing an efficient system biology tool for preclinical development of new antimicrobials.	0
Title: Inhibition of Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase by norfloxacin and 10 other quinolone carboxylic acids Abstract: The ability of norfloxacin, amifloxacin, cinoxacin, ciprofloxacin, flumequine, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin (OFL), oxolinic acid, perfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and rosoxacin to inhibit the in vitro supercoiling activity of Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase was compared with the ability of each drug to inhibit the growth of the M. luteus strain from which the gyrase was purified. The potency of the quinolones as DNA gyrase inhibitors did not always correlate with antimicrobial potency. For example, OFL was a less potent inhibitor of gyrase than rosoxacin, yet the MIC of OFL was 16-fold lower than that of rosoxacin. Similarly, the MICs of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (the most potent of the antibiotics tested in these assays) were several hundredfold lower than the MIC of nalidixic acid (the least potent of these antibiotics), but the inhibition of purified gyrase by these two quinolones was only 8- to 16-fold lower than that of nalidixic acid. These results suggest that factors in addition to inhibition of gyrase supercoiling activity are important in determining the potency of these drugs. Further studies indicated that the uptake of norfloxacin, OFL, and amifloxacin by M. luteus cells may not account for the large differences in MICs observed for these drugs (MICs of 0.8, 2.0, and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively).	0
Title: Discovery and Biosynthesis of Azabicyclene, a Conserved Nonribosomal Peptide in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Azabicyclene, an azetidine-containing natural product, was identified using quorum-sensing molecules to upregulate expression of a gene cluster highly conserved in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutational studies of the gene cluster revealed essential genes for biosynthesis, including an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Reconstitution of this enzyme in vitro identified key biosynthetic intermediates. This work demonstrates a useful strategy for discovering quorum-sensing-regulated natural products. It sets the stage for understanding the biosynthesis and bioactivity of azabicyclene.	1
Title: Heterologous biosynthesis of elsinochrome A sheds light on the formation of the photosensitive perylenequinone system Abstract: Perylenequinones are a class of aromatic polyketides characterised by a highly conjugated pentacyclic core, which confers them with potent light-induced bioactivities and unique photophysical properties. Despite the biosynthetic gene clusters for the perylenequinones elsinochrome A (1), cercosporin (4) and hypocrellin A (6) being recently identified, key biosynthetic aspects remain elusive. Here, we first expressed the intact elc gene cluster encoding 1 from the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum heterologously in Aspergillus nidulans on a yeast-fungal artificial chromosome (YFAC). This led to the identification of a novel flavin-dependent monooxygenase, ElcH, responsible for oxidative enolate coupling of a perylenequinone intermediate to the hexacyclic dihydrobenzo(ghi)perylenequinone in 1. In the absence of ElcH, the perylenequione intermediate formed a hexacyclic cyclohepta(ghi)perylenequinone system via an intramolecular aldol reaction resulting in 6 and a novel hypocrellin 12 with opposite helicity to 1. Theoretical calculations supported that 6 and 12 resulted from atropisomerisation upon formation of the 7-membered ring. Using a bottom-up pathway reconstruction approach on a tripartite YFAC system developed in this study, we uncovered that both a berberine bridge enzyme-like oxidase ElcE and a laccase-like multicopper oxidase ElcG are involved in the double coupling of two naphthol intermediates to form the perylenequinone core. Gene swapping with the homologs from the biosynthetic pathway of 4 showed that cognate pairing of the two classes of oxidases is required for the formation of the perylenequinone core, suggesting the involvement of protein-protein interactions.	1
Title: FUM9 is required for C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and complements the meitotically defined Fum3 locus in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Deletion of the Gibberella moniliformis FUM9 gene resulted in mutants that produce only fumonisins that lack a C-5 hydroxyl group. This phenotype is identical to that of previously described mutants with defective alleles at the meiotically defined Fum3 locus. Transformation with a wild-type FUM9 gene into a Fum3-defective mutant restored wild-type fumonisin production. These results indicate that the FUM9 protein catalyzes the C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and that FUM9 and the Fum3 locus are the same gene.	1
Title: Organization and expression of a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic lactocin S Abstract: Some 8.8 kb of the Lactobacillus sake plasmid pCIM1 was sequenced, revealing eight tightly clustered open reading frames (ORFs) downstream from lasA, which encodes pre-lactocin S. Transcription analyses demonstrated that the genes are expressed as an operon, with transcription initiating upstream of lasA and terminating immediately 3' to the ninth ORF x lasA is also represented by two small RNAs (RNAI and RNAII) which differ in size by approximately 90 nucleotides, and primer extension experiments demonstrated a corresponding difference in the 5' termini. A palindromie sequence constitutes the 3' terminus of both RNAI and RNAII, and we propose that this sequence has a dual regulatory function in controlling the expression of las operon, acting both as a barrier to 3'-5' exonuclease degradation of the lasA-specific transcript(s), and as a "leaky" transcriptional terminator which limits the expression of down-stream genes. Three of the genes in the las operon have identifiable counterparts in other lantibiotic systems: lasM is likely to be involved in prepeptide modification, lasT, which encodes an ATP-dependent transport protein, is probably involved in the secretion of lactocin S, while lasP specifies a subtilisin-type serine protease which may be the lactocin S leader peptidase. Insertional mutation of either lasT or lasM by the resident transposable element IS1163 abolishes lactocin S production. The remaining five ORFs in the las operon are apparently unique, and their significance with respect to the lactocin S phenotype is presently not known.	1
Title: Natural enemies drive geographic variation in plant defenses Abstract: Plants defend themselves against attack by natural enemies, and these defenses vary widely across populations. However, whether communities of natural enemies are a sufficiently potent force to maintain polymorphisms in defensive traits is largely unknown. Here, we exploit the genetic resources of Arabidopsis thaliana, coupled with 39 years of field data on aphid abundance, to (i) demonstrate that geographic patterns in a polymorphic defense locus (GS-ELONG) are strongly correlated with changes in the relative abundance of two specialist aphids; and (ii) demonstrate differential selection by the two aphids on GS-ELONG, using a multigeneration selection experiment. We thereby show a causal link between variation in abundance of the two specialist aphids and the geographic pattern at GS-ELONG, which highlights the potency of natural enemies as selective forces.	0
Title: HDL mimetic peptide ATI-5261 forms an oligomeric assembly in solution that dissociates to monomers upon dilution Abstract: ATI-5261 is a 26-mer peptide that stimulates cellular cholesterol efflux with high potency. This peptide displays high aqueous solubility, despite having amphipathic α-helix structure and a broad nonpolar surface. These features suggested to us that ATI-5261 may adopt a specific form in solution, having favorable structural characteristics and dynamics. To test this, we subjected ATI-5261 to a series of biophysical studies and correlated self-association with secondary structure and activity. Gel-filtration chromatography and native gel electrophoresis indicated ATI-5261 adopted a discrete self-associated form of low molecular weight at concentrations >1 mg/mL. Formation of a discrete molecular species was verified by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which further revealed the peptide formed a tetrameric assembly having an elongated shape and hollow central core. This assembly dissociated to individual peptide strands upon dilution to concentrations required for promoting high-affinity cholesterol efflux from cells. Moreover, the α-helical content of ATI-5261 was exceptionally high (74.1 ± 6.8%) regardless of physical form and concentration. Collectively, these results indicate ATI-5261 displays oligomeric behavior generally similar to native apolipoproteins and dissociates to monomers of high α-helical content upon dilution. Optimizing self-association behavior and secondary structure may prove useful for improving the translatability and efficacy of apolipoprotein mimetic peptides.	0
Title: Structural Insights into Anthranilate Priming during Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis Abstract: The incorporation of nonacetate starter units during type II polyketide biosynthesis helps diversify natural products. Currently, there are few enzymatic strategies for the incorporation of nonacetate starter units in type II polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of AuaEII, the anthranilate:CoA ligase responsible for the generation of anthraniloyl-CoA, which is used as a starter unit by a type II PKS in aurachin biosynthesis. We present structural and protein sequence comparisons to other aryl:CoA ligases. We also compare the AuaEII crystal structure to a model of a CoA ligase homologue, AuaE, which is present in the same gene cluster. AuaE is predicted to have the same fold as AuaEII, but instead of CoA ligation, AuaE catalyzes acyl transfer of anthranilate from anthraniloyl-CoA to the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Together, this work provides insight into the molecular basis for starter unit selection of anthranilate in type II PKS biosynthesis.	1
Title: Substrate specificity of the lanthipeptide peptidase ElxP and the oxidoreductase ElxO Abstract: The final step in lanthipeptide biosynthesis involves the proteolytic removal of an N-terminal leader peptide. In the class I lanthipeptide epilancin 15X, this step is performed by the subtilisin-like serine peptidase ElxP. Bioinformatic, kinetic, and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ElxP recognizes the stretch of amino acids DLNPQS located near the proteolytic cleavage site of its substrate, ElxA. When the ElxP recognition motif was inserted into the noncognate lanthipeptide precursor NisA, ElxP was able to proteolytically remove the leader peptide from NisA. Proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP during the biosynthesis of epilancin 15X exposes an N-terminal dehydroalanine on the core peptide of ElxA that hydrolyzes to a pyruvyl group. The short-chain dehydrogenase ElxO reduces the pyruvyl group to a lactyl moiety in the final step of epilancin 15X maturation. Using synthetic peptides, we also investigated the substrate specificity of ElxO and determined the 1.85 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme.	1
Title: Biochemical characterization of the SgcA1 alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase from the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthetic pathway and overexpression of sgcA1 in Streptomyces globisporus to improve C-1027 production Abstract: Sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 from Streptomyces globisporus has previously suggested that the sgcA1 gene encodes a alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (Glc-1-P-TT) catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the 4-deoxy-4-(dimethylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-d-ribopyranose moiety by activating alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) into deoxythymidine diphosphate-alpha-d-glucose (dTDP-Glc). Here we report the overexpression of sgcA1 in E. coli, purification of the overproduced SgcA1 to homogenetity, biochemical and kinetic characterization of the purified SgcA1 as a Glc-1-P-TT, and yield improvement for C-1027 production by overexpression of sgcA1 and its flanking gene in S. globisporus. These findings provide biochemical evidence supporting the genetics-based hypothesis for C-1027 biosynthesis, set the stage for further investigation of the deoxysugar biosynthetic pathway, and demonstrate the utility of sugar biosynthesis genes in natural product yield improvement via combinatorial biosynthesis methods. In contrast to the homotetrameric quaternary structure known for Glc-1-P-TT enzymes from primary metabolic pathways, Glc-1-P-TT enzymes such as SgcA1 from secondary metabolic pathways are monomeric in solution. Sequence differences between the two subclasses of Glc-1-P-TT enzymes were noted. The monomeric structural feature of the latter enzymes could be exploited in engineering Glc-1-P-TT enzymes with broad substrate specificity for structural diversity via the glycorandomization strategy.	1
Title: The Biosynthesis of Capuramycin-type Antibiotics: IDENTIFICATION OF THE A-102395 BIOSYNTHETIC GENE CLUSTER, MECHANISM OF SELF-RESISTANCE, AND FORMATION OF URIDINE-5'-CARBOXAMIDE Abstract: A-500359s, A-503083s, and A-102395 are capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics that were discovered using a screen to identify inhibitors of bacterial translocase I, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Like the parent capuramycin, A-500359s and A-503083s consist of three structural components: a uridine-5'-carboxamide (CarU), a rare unsaturated hexuronic acid, and an aminocaprolactam, the last of which is substituted by an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide in A-102395. The biosynthetic gene clusters for A-500359s and A-503083s have been reported, and two genes encoding a putative non-heme Fe(II)-dependent α-ketoglutarate:UMP dioxygenase and an l-Thr:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase were uncovered, suggesting that C-C bond formation during assembly of the high carbon (C6) sugar backbone of CarU proceeds from the precursors UMP and l-Thr to form 5'-C-glycyluridine (C7) as a biosynthetic intermediate. Here, isotopic enrichment studies with the producer of A-503083s were used to indeed establish l-Thr as the direct source of the carboxamide of CarU. With this knowledge, the A-102395 gene cluster was subsequently cloned and characterized. A genetic system in the A-102395-producing strain was developed, permitting the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the dioxygenase (cpr19) and transaldolase (cpr25), which abolished the production of A-102395, thus confirming their role in biosynthesis. Heterologous production of recombinant Cpr19 and CapK, the transaldolase homolog involved in A-503083 biosynthesis, confirmed their expected function. Finally, a phosphotransferase (Cpr17) conferring self-resistance was functionally characterized. The results provide the opportunity to use comparative genomics along with in vivo and in vitro approaches to probe the biosynthetic mechanism of these intriguing structures.	1
Title: Methyltransferase Contingencies in the Pathway of Everninomicin D Antibiotics and Analogues Abstract: Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act by disrupting ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs. We employed microporous intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli to manipulate Micromonospora for targeted gene-replacement studies of multiple putative methyltransferases across the octasaccharide scaffold of everninomicin effecting the A1 , C, F, and H rings. Analyses of gene-replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of 12 previously unreported analogues and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in vitro activity of A1 - and H-ring-modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late-stage modification of the scaffold on an A1 -ring phenol and H-ring C-4' hydroxy moiety. Together these results establish the potential of the everninomicin scaffold for modification through mutagenesis and in vitro modification of advanced biosynthetic intermediates.	1
Title: Functional characterization of a veA-dependent polyketide synthase gene in Aspergillus flavus necessary for the synthesis of asparasone, a sclerotium-specific pigment Abstract: The filamentous fungus, Aspergillus flavus, produces the toxic and carcinogenic, polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived family of secondary metabolites termed aflatoxins. While analysis of the A. flavus genome has identified many other PKSs capable of producing secondary metabolites, to date, only a few other metabolites have been identified. In the process of studying how the developmental regulator, VeA, affects A. flavus secondary metabolism we discovered that mutation of veA caused a dramatic down-regulation of transcription of a polyketide synthase gene belonging to cluster 27 and the loss of the ability of the fungi to produce sclerotia. Inactivation of the cluster 27 pks (pks27) resulted in formation of greyish-yellow sclerotia rather than the dark brown sclerotia normally produced by A. flavus while conidial pigmentation was unaffected. One metabolite produced by Pks27 was identified by thin layer chromatography and mass spectral analysis as the known anthraquinone, asparasone A. Sclerotia produced by pks27 mutants were significantly less resistant to insect predation than were the sclerotia produced by the wild-type and more susceptible to the deleterious effects of ultraviolet light and heat. Normal sclerotia were previously thought to be resistant to damage because of a process of melanization similar to that known for pigmentation of conidia. Our results show that the dark brown pigments in sclerotia derive from anthraquinones produced by Pks27 rather than from the typical tetrahydronapthalene melanin production pathway. To our knowledge this is the first report on the genes involved in the biosynthesis of pigments important for sclerotial survival.	1
Title: Transactivation of Ds by Ac-transposase gene fusions in tobacco Abstract: To study regulation of the (Ds) transposition process in heterologous plant species, the transposase gene of Ac was fused to several promoters that are active late during plant development. These promoters are the flower-specific chalcone synthase A promoter (CHS A), the anther-specific chalcone isomerase B promoter CHI B and the pollen-specific chalcone isomerase A2 promoter CHI A2. The modified transposase genes were introduced into a tobacco tester plant. This plant contains Ds stably inserted within the leader sequence of the hygromycin resistance (HPT II) gene. As confirmed with positive control elements, excision of Ds leads to the restoration of a functional HPT II gene and to a hygromycin resistant phenotype. No hygromycin resistance was observed in negative control experiments with Ac derivatives lacking 5' regulatory sequences. Although transactivation of Ds was observed after the introduction of transposase gene fusions in calli, excision in regenerated plants was observed only for the CHS A- or CHI B-transposase gene fusions. With these modified transposase genes, somatic excision frequencies were increased (68%) and decreased (22%), respectively, compared to the situation with the Ac element itself (38%). The shifts in transactivation frequencies were not associated with significant differences in the frequencies of germinally transmitted excision events (approximately 5%). The relative somatic stability of Ds insertions bearing the CHI B-transposase gene fusion suggests the usefulness of this activator element for transposon tagging experiments.	0
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for 3-methylarginine, a toxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 22d/93 Abstract: The epiphyte Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 22d/93 (Pss22d) produces the rare amino acid 3-methylarginine (MeArg), which is highly active against the closely related soybean pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. Since these pathogens compete for the same habitat, Pss22d is a promising candidate for biocontrol of P. syringae pv. glycinea. The MeArg biosynthesis gene cluster codes for the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase MrsA, the putative aminotransferase MrsB, and the amino acid exporter MrsC. Transfer of the whole gene cluster into Escherichia coli resulted in heterologous production of MeArg. The methyltransferase MrsA was overexpressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and functionally characterized (K(m), 7 mM; k(cat), 85 min(-1)). The highly selective methyltransferase MrsA transfers the methyl group from SAM into 5-guanidino-2-oxo-pentanoic acid to yield 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxo-pentanoic acid, which then only needs to be transaminated to result in the antibiotic MeArg.	1
Title: Molecular genetic characterization of a cluster in A. terreus for biosynthesis of the meroterpenoid terretonin Abstract: Meroterpenoids are natural products produced from polyketide and terpenoid precursors. A gene targeting system for A. terreus NIH2624 was developed, and a gene cluster for terretonin biosynthesis was characterized. The intermediates and shunt products were isolated from the mutant strains, and a pathway for terretonin biosynthesis is proposed. Analysis of two meroterpenoid pathways corresponding to terretonin in A. terreus and austinol in A. nidulans reveals that they are closely related evolutionarily.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: A method was developed for the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters in different Streptomyces strains and for the modification of these clusters by single or multiple gene replacements or gene deletions with unprecedented speed and versatility. Lambda-Red-mediated homologous recombination was used for genetic modification of the gene clusters, and the attachment site and integrase of phage phiC31 were employed for the integration of these clusters into the heterologous hosts. This method was used to express the gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and clorobiocin in the well-studied strains Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans, which, in contrast to the natural producers, can be easily genetically manipulated. S. coelicolor M512 derivatives produced the respective antibiotic in yields comparable to those of natural producer strains, whereas S. lividans TK24 derivatives were at least five times less productive. This method could also be used to carry out functional investigations. Shortening of the cosmids' inserts showed which genes are essential for antibiotic production.	1
Title: Characterization of new class III lantibiotics--erythreapeptin, avermipeptin and griseopeptin from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, Streptomyces avermitilis and Streptomyces griseus demonstrates stepwise N-terminal leader processing Abstract: Lantibiotics are a large group of ribosomally synthesized peptides post-translationally modified to incorporate the amino acid lanthionine. They are classified, according to their biosynthetic pathway and bioactivity, into three major subtypes. Of Actinomycetes type III lantibiotics, only four peptides (SapB, SapT, LabA1, and LabA2) have been described and structurally characterized, although homologous gene clusters are abundant in other Actinomycetes. All these gene clusters share a similar architecture with a characteristic Ser/Ser/Cys motif in precursor peptides, which has previously been suggested to act as a precursor for lanthionine (SapB) and labionin (LabA2) rings. Mass spectrometry screening led to the discovery and characterization of three new representatives of type III lantibiotics: Avermipeptin (Avi), Erythreapeptin (Ery), and Griseopeptin (Gri) from Streptomyces avermitilis DSM 46492, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338, and Streptomyces griseus DSM 40236, respectively. Apart from the assignment of these peptides to their corresponding gene clusters, additional investigations on Avi, Ery and Gri peptides indicate stepwise leader processing by putative aminopeptidase-like protease(s), thus yielding mixtures of differently N-terminal-processed lantibiotic peptides. Similar peptide processing was observed for a heterologously expressed eryth biosynthetic gene cluster expressed in a Streptomyces host system. Remarkably, all isolates of the new type III lantibiotics contain both the amino acids lanthionine and labionin, thus implying dual-mode cyclase activity of the processing lyase-kinase-cyclase enzymes. These findings have implications for the structures and maturation of other type III lantibiotics from Actinomycetes.	1
Title: An iterative type I polyketide synthase initiates the biosynthesis of the antimycoplasma agent micacocidin Abstract: Micacocidin is a thiazoline-containing natural product from the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum that shows significant activity against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The presence of a pentylphenol moiety distinguishes micacocidin from the structurally related siderophore yersiniabactin, and this residue also contributes to the potent antimycoplasma effects. The biosynthesis of the pentylphenol moiety, as deduced from bioinformatic analysis and stable isotope feeding experiments, involves an iterative type I polyketide synthase (iPKS), which generates a linear tetraketide intermediate from acyl carrier protein-tethered hexanoic acid by three consecutive, decarboxylative Claisen condensations with malonyl-coenzyme A. The final conversion into 6-pentylsalicylic acid depends on a ketoreductase domain within the iPKS, as demonstrated by heterologous expression in E. coli and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Our results unveil the early steps in micacocidin biosynthesis and illuminate a bacterial enzyme that functionally resembles fungal polyketide synthases.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the new broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic paenibacterin in Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE Abstract: Paenibacterin is a novel lipopeptide antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive human pathogens. The antibiotic consists of a cyclic 13-residue peptide and an N-terminal C₁₅ fatty acyl chain. To elucidate the biosynthesis of paenibacterin, we determined the whole genome sequence of the producer strain Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, and the function of the peptide synthetase was confirmed experimentally. The gene cluster of paenibacterin was identified within a 52-kb DNA region, encoding thee non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, PbtA, PbtB and PbtC, and two ABC-transporters, PbtD and PbtE. Both PbtA and PbtB consist of five modules, whereas PbtC comprises three modules. Each of these 13 modules consists of three essential domains (condensation-adenylation-thiolation) and assembles an amino acid into the paenibacterin peptide. Selected adenylation domains in the NRPS were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the substrate specificity of each recombinant A-domain was studied in vitro by protein function analysis. The presence of four epimerization domains in paenibacterin peptide synthetases suggests that Orn₁, Orn₄, Lys₇ and Ser₈ in the paenibacterin molecule have d-configuration; the absolute configuration of two ornithine residues in paenibacterin was confirmed by chiral amino acid analysis using Marfey's reagents. Taken together, the findings enabled us to propose the biosynthetic pathway of paenibacterin.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the C(7)-cyclitol moiety of acarbose in Actinoplanes species SE50/110. 7-O-phosphorylation of the initial cyclitol precursor leads to proposal of a new biosynthetic pathway Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the C(7)-cyclitol, called valienol (or valienamine), of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose starts from the cyclization of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (Stratmann, A., Mahmud, T., Lee, S., Distler, J., Floss, H. G., and Piepersberg, W. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 10889-10896). Synthesis of the intermediate 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is catalyzed by the cyclase AcbC encoded in the biosynthetic (acb) gene cluster of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. The acbC gene lies in a possible transcription unit, acbKLMNOC, cluster encompassing putative biosynthetic genes for cyclitol conversion. All genes were heterologously expressed in strains of Streptomyces lividans 66 strains 1326, TK23, and TK64. The AcbK protein was identified as the acarbose 7-kinase, which had been described earlier (Drepper, A., and Pape, H. (1996) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 49, 664-668). The multistep conversion of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone to the final cyclitol moiety was studied by testing enzymatic mechanisms such as dehydration, reduction, epimerization, and phosphorylation. Thus, a phosphotransferase activity was identified modifying 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone by ATP-dependent phosphorylation. This activity could be attributed to the AcbM protein by verifying this activity in S. lividans strain TK64/pCW4123M, expressing His-tagged AcbM. The His-tagged AcbM protein was purified and subsequently characterized as a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-kinase, presumably catalyzing the first enzyme reaction in the biosynthetic route, leading to an activated form of the intermediate 1-epi-valienol. The AcbK protein could not catalyze the same reaction nor convert any of the other C(7)-cyclitol monomers tested. The 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate was further converted by the AcbO protein to another isomeric and phosphorylated intermediate, which was likely to be the 2-epimer 5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate. The products of both enzyme reactions were characterized by mass spectrometric methods. The product of the AcbM-catalyzed reaction, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate, was purified on a preparative scale and identified by NMR spectroscopy. A biosynthetic pathway for the pseudodisaccharidic acarviosyl moiety of acarbose is proposed on the basis of these data.	1
Title: Discovery and synthetic refactoring of tryptophan dimer gene clusters from the environment Abstract: Here we investigate bacterial tryptophan dimer (TD) biosynthesis by probing environmental DNA (eDNA) libraries for chromopyrrolic acid (CPA) synthase genes. Functional and bioinformatics analyses of TD clusters indicate that CPA synthase gene sequences diverge in concert with the functional output of their respective clusters, making this gene a powerful tool for guiding the discovery of novel TDs from the environment. Twelve unprecedented TD biosynthetic gene clusters that can be arranged into five groups (A-E) based on their ability to generate distinct TD core substructures were recovered from eDNA libraries. Four of these groups contain clusters from both cultured and culture independent studies, while the remaining group consists entirely of eDNA-derived clusters. The complete synthetic refactoring of a representative gene cluster from the latter eDNA specific group led to the characterization of the erdasporines, cytotoxins with a novel carboxy-indolocarbazole TD substructure. Analysis of CPA synthase genes in crude eDNA suggests the presence of additional TD gene clusters in soil environments.	1
Title: Isolation and Structure Elucidation of Fujikurins A-D: Products of the PKS19 Gene Cluster in Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Fusarium fujikuroi is a member of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex and well known for the production of gibberellins and mycotoxins including fusarins and fusaric acid. A recent genome sequencing study revealed that the fungus has the genetic potential to produce many more secondary metabolites than have been reported. This paper describes the structure elucidation of the products of the cryptic and silent PKS19 gene cluster that were recently identified (fujikurins A-D). We present the complete NMR data for the structure elucidation of the main compound fujikurin D, which shows tautomeric 1,3-diketo elements. The different tautomeric structures could be confirmed using quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, the structures of the minor compounds fujikurins A-C were elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometric fragmentation experiments. It emerged that fujikurin A was identical to the bioactive compound CR377 of the taxonomically unclassified Fusarium strain CR377, while fujikurins B-D have not been reported from other fungi.	1
Title: Liver X Receptor Agonists Inhibit the Phospholipid Regulatory Gene CTP: Phosphoethanolamine Cytidylyltransferase-Pcyt2 Abstract: Metabolic pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), the endogenous activator of the liver X receptor (LXR), significantly reduced the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine via CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway at the step catalyzed by CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2). In the mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2, the LXR synthetic agonist TO901317 lowered Pcyt2 promoter-luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, 25-OH and TO901317 reduced mouse Pcyt2 mRNA and protein levels by 35-60%. The inhibitory effects of oxysterols and TO901317 on the Pcyt2 promoter function, mRNA and protein expression were conserved in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. These studies identify the Pcyt2 gene as a novel target whereby LXR agonists may indirectly modulate inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis.	0
Title: Resistance genes of aminocoumarin producers: two type II topoisomerase genes confer resistance against coumermycin A1 and clorobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin resistance genes of the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin, coumermycin A(1), and clorobiocin were investigated. All three clusters contained a gyrB(R) resistance gene, coding for a gyrase B subunit. Unexpectedly, the clorobiocin and the coumermycin A(1) clusters were found to contain an additional, similar gene, named parY(R). Its predicted gene product showed sequence similarity with the B subunit of type II topoisomerases. Expression of gyrB(R) and likewise of parY(R) in Streptomyces lividans TK24 resulted in resistance against novobiocin and coumermycin A(1), suggesting that both gene products are able to function as aminocoumarin-resistant B subunits of gyrase. Southern hybridization experiments showed that the genome of all three antibiotic producers and of Streptomyces coelicolor contained two additional genes which hybridized with either gyrB(R) or parY(R) and which may code for aminocoumarin-sensitive GyrB and ParY proteins. Two putative transporter genes, novA and couR5, were found in the novobiocin and the coumermycin A(1) cluster, respectively. Expression of these genes in S. lividans TK24 resulted in moderate levels of resistance against novobiocin and coumermycin A(1), suggesting that these genes may be involved in antibiotic transport.	1
Title: Cwp22, a novel peptidoglycan cross-linking enzyme, plays pleiotropic roles in Clostridioides difficile Abstract: Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, toxin-producing anaerobe pathogen, and can induce nosocomial antibiotic-associated intestinal disease. While production of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) contribute to the main pathogenesis of C. difficile, adhesion and colonization of C. difficile in the host gut are prerequisites for disease onset. Previous cell wall proteins (CWPs) were identified that were implicated in C. difficile adhesion and colonization. In this study, we predicted and characterized Cwp22 (CDR20291_2601) from C. difficile R20291 to be involved in bacterial adhesion based on the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool. The ClosTron-generated cwp22 mutant showed decreased TcdA and TcdB production during early growth, and increased cell permeability and autolysis. Importantly, the cwp22 mutation impaired cellular adherence in vitro and decreased cytotoxicity and fitness over the parent strain in a mouse infection model. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay, live-dead cell staining and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the decreased cell viability of the cwp22 mutant. Thus, Cwp22 is involved in cell wall integrity and cell viability, which could affect most phenotypes of R20291. Our data suggest that Cwp22 is an attractive target for C. difficile infection therapeutics and prophylactics.	0
Title: Isolation of sabin-like polioviruses from wastewater in a country using inactivated polio vaccine Abstract: From 2001 to 2004, Switzerland switched from routine vaccination with oral polio vaccine (OPV) to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), using both vaccines in the intervening period. Since IPV is less effective at inducing mucosal immunity than OPV, this change might allow imported poliovirus to circulate undetected more easily in an increasingly IPV-immunized population. Environmental monitoring is a recognized tool for identifying polioviruses in a community. To look for evidence of poliovirus circulation following cessation of OPV use, two sewage treatment plants located in the Zurich area were sampled from 2004 to 2006. Following virus isolation using either RD or L20B cells, enteroviruses and polioviruses were identified by reverse transcription-PCR. A total of 20 out of 174 wastewater samples were positive for 62 Sabin-like isolates. One isolate from each poliovirus-positive sample was analyzed in more detail. Sequencing the complete viral protein 1 (VP1) capsid coding region, as well as intratypic differentiation (ITD), identified 3 Sabin type 1, 13 Sabin type 2, and 4 Sabin type 3 strains. One serotype 1 strain showed a discordant result in the ITD. Three-quarters of the strains showed mutations within the 5' untranslated region and VP1, known to be associated with reversion to virulence. Moreover, three strains showed heterotypic recombination (S2/S1 and S3/S2/S3). The low number of synonymous mutations and the partial temperature sensitivity are not consistent with extended circulation of these Sabin virus strains. Nevertheless, the continuous introduction of polioviruses into the community emphasizes the necessity for uninterrupted child vaccination to maintain high herd immunity.	0
Title: A fluorogenic screening platform enables directed evolution of an alkyne biosynthetic tool Abstract: Directed evolution was used to improve the activity of JamB, a membrane-bound bifunctional desaturase/acetylenase. To quickly assess the protein engineering outcomes, we developed a new platform for quantifying extracellular alkyne-tagged metabolites through a fluorogenic click reaction. Random mutagenesis yielded the best JamB variant with ∼20-fold increased activity in E. coli.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of sibiromycin, a potent antitumor antibiotic Abstract: Pyrrolobenzodiazepines, a class of natural products produced by actinomycetes, are sequence selective DNA alkylating compounds with significant antitumor properties. Among the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) sibiromycin, one of two identified glycosylated PBDs, displays the highest affinity for DNA and the most potent antitumor properties. Despite the promising antitumor properties clinical trials of sibiromycin were precluded by the cardiotoxicity effect in animals attributed to the presence of the C-9 hydroxyl group. As a first step toward the development of sibiromycin analogs, we have cloned and localized the sibiromycin gene cluster to a 32.7-kb contiguous DNA region. Cluster boundaries tentatively assigned by comparative genomics were verified by gene replacement experiments. The sibiromycin gene cluster consisting of 26 open reading frames reveals a "modular" strategy in which the synthesis of the anthranilic and dihydropyrrole moieties is completed before assembly by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes. In addition, the gene cluster identified includes open reading frames encoding enzymes involved in sibirosamine biosynthesis, as well as regulatory and resistance proteins. Gene replacement and chemical complementation studies are reported to support the proposed biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Palladium(II)-catalyzed dehydrogenative alkenylation of cyclic enaminones via the Fujiwara-Moritani reaction Abstract: A new Pd(II)-catalyzed dehydrogenative alkenylation reaction involving two alkenes was developed. A variety of nonaromatic, cyclic enaminones were successfully coupled to primary and secondary alkenes yielding a series of unique 1,3-dienes. The generality of this transformation presents a useful strategy for directly cross-coupling alkenes and offers an attractive new approach to functionalize enaminones.	0
Title: Prophage, phiPV83-pro, carrying panton-valentine leukocidin genes, on the Staphylococcus aureus P83 chromosome: comparative analysis of the genome structures of phiPV83-pro, phiPVL, phi11, and other phages Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus P83 has Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-like genes, lukM and lukF-PV. Here, lukM and lukF-PV genes were found on the genome of a prophage, which was designated as phiPV83-pro. The precise genome size was 45,636 bp with att core sequences of 10 base pairs. Sixty-four ORFs were identified on the phiPV83-pro genome, including two extra operons, lukM-lukF-PV and orfs63-64. The lukM-lukF-PV cluster was located 2.1 kb upstream of the attL site. The most striking feature of the phiPV83-pro genome was a constituent of at least 4 regions from phi11, phiPVL, and other phages, i.e., (i) att sites identical with those of phi11, (ii) a cos sequence and the genes encoding packaging and head proteins of phiPVL (occupied half region of phiPV83-pro), and (iii) the other two regions which showed no significant similarity with known phages (occupied about 40% of phiPV83-pro). Furthermore, two insertion sequences, ISSA1 and ISSA2 were integrated into attL site and orf44, respectively. PhiPV83-pro was not induced as phage particles from S. aureus P83 regardless of its treatment with mitomycin C. The insertion of ISSA1 into the attL site was one of the reasons of the failure of the induction of the phage particles by mitomycin C treatment of the strain P83.	0
Title: Direct Pathway Cloning Combined with Sequence- and Ligation-Independent Cloning for Fast Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Refactoring and Heterologous Expression Abstract: The need for new pharmacological lead structures, especially against drug resistances, has led to a surge in natural product research and discovery. New biosynthetic gene cluster capturing methods to efficiently clone and heterologously express natural product pathways have thus been developed. Direct pathway cloning (DiPaC) is an emerging synthetic biology strategy that utilizes long-amplification PCR and HiFi DNA assembly for the capture and expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Here, we have further streamlined DiPaC by reducing cloning time and reagent costs by utilizing T4 DNA polymerase (sequence- and ligation-independent cloning, SLIC) for gene cluster capture. As a proof of principle, the majority of the cyanobacterial hapalosin gene cluster was cloned as a single piece (23 kb PCR product) using this approach, and predicted transcriptional terminators were removed by simultaneous pathway refactoring, leading to successful heterologous expression. The complementation of DiPaC with SLIC depicts a time and cost-efficient method for simple capture and expression of new natural product pathways.	1
Title: A unique lantibiotic, thermophilin 1277, containing a disulfide bridge and two thioether bridges Abstract: Aims:                       To identify the chemical structure of a bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277.                  Methods and results:                       Thermophilin 1277 was purified and partial N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 6 unidentified amino acids amongst 31 amino acids residues. A 2.7-kbp region containing the thermophilin 1277 structural gene (tepA) encoding 58 amino acids was cloned and sequenced. Mature thermophilin 1277 (33 amino acids) was preceded by a 25-amino acid putative leader peptide containing a double glycine cleavage motif. Peptide sequence analysis following chemical modification of thermophilin 1277 revealed that the Cys21 and Cys29 residues form a disulfide bridge and that Thr8 or Thr10 forms two 3-methyllanthionines with Cys13 or Cys32 via thioether bridges. Antimicrobial activity was disrupted by ethanethiol or reductive agent treatments, indicating that the internal amino acid modifications are crucial for the activity.                  Conclusions:                       Thermophilin 1277 from Strep. thermophilus SBT1277 belongs to the class of AII-type lantibiotics that has a disulfide and two thioether bridges.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       This is the first report of a lantibiotic produced by a GRAS species of Strep. thermophilus; thermophilin 1277 has a unique structure containing both a disulfide bridge and two thioether bridges that are crucial for its activity.	1
Title: The genetic basis of natural variation in mushroom body size in Drosophila melanogaster Abstract: Genetic variation in brain size may provide the basis for the evolution of the brain and complex behaviours. The genetic substrate and the selective pressures acting on brain size are poorly understood. Here we use the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to map polymorphic variants affecting natural variation in mushroom body morphology. We identify 139 genes and 39 transcription factors and confirm effects on development and adult plasticity. We show correlations between morphology and aggression, sleep and lifespan. We propose that natural variation in adult brain size is controlled by interaction of the environment with gene networks controlling development and plasticity.	0
Title: Donor strand sequence, rather than donor strand orientation, determines the stability and non-equilibrium folding of the type 1 pilus subunit FimA Abstract: FimA is the main structural subunit of adhesive type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains. Up to 3000 copies of FimA assemble to the helical pilus rod through a mechanism termed donor strand complementation, in which the incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold of each FimA subunit is complemented by the N-terminal extension (Nte) of the next subunit. The Nte of FimA, which exhibits a pseudo-palindromic sequence, is inserted in an antiparallel orientation relative to the last β-strand of the preceding subunit in the pilus. The resulting subunit-subunit interactions are extraordinarily stable against dissociation and unfolding. Alternatively, FimA can fold to a self-complemented monomer with anti-apoptotic activity, in which the Nte inserts intramolecularly into the FimA core in the opposite, parallel orientation. The FimA monomers, however, show dramatically lower thermodynamic stability compared with FimA subunits in the assembled pilus. Using self-complemented FimA variants with reversed, pseudo-palindromic extensions, we demonstrate that the high stability of FimA polymers is primarily caused by the specific interactions between the side chains of the Nte residues and the FimA core and not by the antiparallel orientation of the donor strand alone. In addition, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium two-state folding, a hallmark of FimA with the Nte inserted in the pilus rod-like, antiparallel orientation, only depends on the identity of the inserted Nte side chains and not on Nte orientation.	0
Title: RNA-protein complexes mediate in vitro capping of the spliced-leader primary transcript and U-RNAs in Trypanosoma cruzi Abstract: A 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL) is joined to the 5' ends of trypanosome mRNAs in a bimolecular or trans-splicing process. The SL in Trypanosoma cruzi is transcribed as an approximately 110-nucleotide RNA (SL-RNA or SL primary transcript) bearing the 39-nucleotide SL at the 5' end. The SL-RNA is 5' capped by a guanylyltransferase activity prior to trans-splicing and trypanosome mRNAs thus obtain their mature caps from the SL by trans-splicing. We have previously characterized a guanylyltransferase activity from T. cruzi nuclear extracts and shown that this capping activity has an unusual ATP dependence and an apparent specificity for the SL-RNA and U-RNAs. Herein, we show that the capping activity sediments as a 12-15S particle during velocity sedimentation in glycerol gradients and fractionates as a greater than 150-kDa particle during large-pore gel filtration chromatography. Moreover, the endogenous substrate RNAs--the SL-RNA and U-RNAs--consistently copurify with the capping activity, suggesting that the activity and the substrates form a ribonucleoprotein particle. The capping activity and substrate RNAs are not dissociated in isopycnic Cs2SO4 gradients and band at a density expected for an RNA-protein complex, confirming the existence of ribonucleoprotein particles bearing both the activity and its substrate RNAs. Finally, we partially purified these ribonucleoprotein particles and showed that the capping activity remains ATP dependent and highly specific for the SL-RNA and the U-RNAs. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the functions of trans-splicing is for mRNA capping.	0
Title: Analysis of the indanomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL 8167 Abstract: Metabolites that harbor a core indane scaffold are found to have diverse biological properties. Indanomycin and related pyrroloketoindanes are ionophores and have demonstrated antiparasitic, insecticidal, and antibacterial activities. To understand the biochemical mechanisms guiding formation of the central indane ring, the biosynthetic gene cluster for indanomycin was identified from Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL 8167 and sequenced to approximately 80 kb; this revealed five genes encoding subunits of a polyketide synthase (PKS) and 18 other open reading frames. The involvement of this cluster in indanomycin biosynthesis was confirmed by deletion mutagenesis. The indanomycin PKS lacks the expected thioesterase at the carboxy terminus of the final module, and instead appears to house an incomplete module containing an unusual cyclase domain. These findings now enable additional detailed genetic and biochemical studies of the mechanisms guiding the generation of pyrroloketoindanes.	1
Title: Lomaiviticin biosynthesis employs a new strategy for starter unit generation Abstract: Lomaiviticin biosynthesis is thought to utilize a propionyl starter unit for a type II polyketide synthase (PKS). Discovery of the lomaiviticin (lom) biosynthetic gene cluster suggested an unusual method for starter unit generation involving a bifunctional acyltransferase/decarboxylase (AT/DC) thus far observed only in type I PKS pathways. In vitro biochemical characterization of AT/DC Lom62 confirmed its ability to generate a propionyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), revealing a new role for this enzymatic activity within natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: High-Quality Draft Genome Sequence of the Actinobacterium Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406, Producer of the Immunosuppressant Brasilicardins, Using Illumina and PacBio Technologies Abstract: The bacterium Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 is known as the producer of the immunosuppressant brasilicardin A. Here, we report the completely sequenced genome of strain IFM 0406, which facilitates the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin biosynthetic gene cluster but also unveils the intriguing biosynthetic capacity of the strain to produce secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Selective utilization of exogenous amino acids by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and its effects on growth and dechlorination activity Abstract: Bacteria of the genus Dehalococcoides are important members of bioremediation communities because of their ability to detoxify chloroethenes to the benign end product ethene. Genome-enabled studies conducted with Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 have revealed that two ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type amino acid transporters are expressed during its exponential growth stages. In light of previous findings that Casamino Acids enhanced its dechlorination activity, we hypothesized that strain 195 is capable of importing amino acids from its environment to facilitate dechlorination and growth. To test this hypothesis, we applied isotopomer-based dilution analysis with (13)C-labeled acetate to differentiate the amino acids that were taken up by strain 195 from those synthesized de novo and to determine the physiological changes caused by the significantly incorporated amino acids. Our results showed that glutamate/glutamine and aspartate/asparagine were almost exclusively synthesized by strain 195, even when provided in excess in the medium. In contrast, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and methionine were identified as the four most highly incorporated amino acids, at levels >30% of respective proteinogenic amino acids. When either phenylalanine or all four highly incorporated amino acids were added to the defined mineral medium, the growth rates, dechlorination activities, and yields of strain 195 were enhanced to levels similar to those observed with supplementation with 20 amino acids. However, genes for the putative ABC-type amino acids transporters and phenylalanine biosynthesis exhibited insignificant regulation in response to the imported amino acids. This study also demonstrates that using isotopomer-based metabolite analysis can be an efficient strategy for optimizing nutritional conditions for slow-growing microorganisms.	0
Title: On a psychophysical transformed-rule up and down method converging on a 75% level of correct responses Abstract: Transformed-rule up and down psychophysical methods have gained great popularity, mainly because they combine criterion-free responses with an adaptive procedure allowing rapid determination of an average stimulus threshold at various criterion levels of correct responses. The statistical theory underlying the methods now in routine use is based on sets of consecutive responses with assumed constant probabilities of occurrence. The response rules requiring consecutive responses prevent the possibility of using the most desirable response criterion, that of 75% correct responses. The earliest transformed-rule up and down method, whose rules included nonconsecutive responses, did not contain this limitation but failed to become generally accepted, lacking a published theoretical foundation. Such a foundation is provided in this article and is validated empirically with the help of experiments on human subjects and a computer simulation. In addition to allowing the criterion of 75% correct responses, the method is more efficient than the methods excluding nonconsecutive responses in their rules.	0
Title: Mechanistic Insights into the Role of Atg11 in Selective Autophagy Abstract: Macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy) is an intracellular degradation pathway in which the formation of a double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome is a key event in the transport of multiple cytoplasmic cargo (e.g., proteins, protein aggregates, lipid droplets or organelles) to the vacuole (lysosome in mammals) for degradation and recycling. During this process, autophagosomes are formed de novo by membrane fusion events leading to phagophore formation initiated at the phagophore assembly site. In yeast, Atg11 and Atg17 function as protein scaffolds, essential for selective and non-selective types of autophagy, respectively. While Atg17 functions in non-selective autophagy are well-defined in the literature, less attention is concentrated on recent findings regarding the roles of Atg11 in selective autophagy. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the Atg11 scaffold protein and review recent findings in the context of its role in selective autophagy initiation and autophagosome formation.	0
Title: In Lactobacillus plantarum, carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized by two carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases (CPS): carbon dioxide differentiates the arginine-repressed from the pyrimidine-regulated CPS Abstract: Carbamoyl phosphate (CP) is an intermediate in pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) contains a small amidotransferase subunit (GLN) that hydrolyzes glutamine and transfers ammonia to the large synthetase subunit (SYN), where CP biosynthesis occurs in the presence of ATP and CO(2). Lactobacillus plantarum, a lactic acid bacterium, harbors a pyrimidine-inhibited CPS (CPS-P; Elagöz et al., Gene 182:37-43, 1996) and an arginine-repressed CPS (CPS-A). Sequencing has shown that CPS-A is encoded by carA (GLN) and carB (SYN). Transcriptional studies have demonstrated that carB is transcribed both monocistronically and in the carAB arginine-repressed operon. CP biosynthesis in L. plantarum was studied with three mutants (DeltaCPS-P, DeltaCPS-A, and double deletion). In the absence of both CPSs, auxotrophy for pyrimidines and arginine was observed. CPS-P produced enough CP for both pathways. In CO(2)-enriched air but not in ordinary air, CPS-A provided CP only for arginine biosynthesis. Therefore, the uracil sensitivity observed in prototrophic wild-type L. plantarum without CO(2) enrichment may be due to the low affinity of CPS-A for its substrate CO(2) or to regulation of the CP pool by the cellular CO(2)/bicarbonate level.	1
Title: A copper-containing oxidase catalyzes C-nitrosation in nitrosobenzamide biosynthesis Abstract: Although C-nitroso aromatic compounds have several bioactivities of medicinal interest, the biosynthetic enzymes involved in C-nitrosation have remained unknown until now. Here, we report the entire biosynthesis pathway of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in Streptomyces murayamaensis, in which a tyrosinase-like copper-containing monooxygenase is responsible for the C-nitrosation. This finding indicates diverse catalytic functions of tyrosinase-like copper-containing monooxygenases in nature.	1
Title: The K1 Toxin of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kills Spheroplasts of Many Yeast Species Abstract: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae K1 toxin killed spheroplasts from the genera Candida, Kluyveromyces, and Schwanniomyces. Cells of these organisms were toxin insensitive. The toxin bound poorly to Kluyveromyces lactis cells. In contrast, Candida albicans bound the toxin to an extent similar to that seen with S. cerevisiae. Thus, wall receptors can define toxin specificity and are necessary but not sufficient for toxin action on intact cells.	0
Title: Potent antiviral activity of north-methanocarbathymidine against Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Abstract: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection is a prerequisite for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Blocking lytic KSHV replication may hinder KS tumorigenesis. Here, we report potent in vitro anti-KSHV activity of 2'-exo-methanocarbathymidine [North-methanocarbathymidine (N-MCT)], a thymidine analog with a pseudosugar ring locked in the northern conformation, which has previously been shown to block the replication of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. N-MCT inhibited KSHV virion production in lytically induced KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cells with a substantially lower 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) than those of cidofovir (CDV) and ganciclovir (GCV) (IC50, mean +/- standard deviation: 0.08 +/- 0.03, 0.42 +/- 0.07, and 0.96 +/- 0.49 microM for N-MCT, CDV, and GCV, respectively). The reduction in KSHV virion production was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in KSHV DNA levels in the N-MCT-treated BCBL-1 cells, indicating that the compound blocked lytic KSHV DNA replication. A time- and dose-dependent accumulation of N-MCT-triphosphate (TP) was demonstrated in lytically induced BCBL-1 cells, while uninfected cells showed virtually no accumulation. The levels of N-MCT-TP were significantly decreased in the presence of 5'-ethynylthymidine, a potent inhibitor of herpesvirus thymidine kinase, resulting in the abrogation of anti-KSHV activity of N-MCT. N-MCT-TP more effectively blocked in vitro DNA synthesis by KSHV DNA polymerase with an IC50 of 6.24 +/- 0.08 microM (mean +/- standard deviation) compared to CDV-diphosphate (14.70 +/-2.47 microM) or GCV-TP (24.59 +/- 5.60 microM). Taken together, N-MCT is a highly potent and target-specific anti-KSHV agent which inhibits lytic KSHV DNA synthesis through its triphosphate metabolite produced in KSHV-infected cells expressing a virally encoded thymidine kinase.	0
Title: Portability and Structure of the Four-Helix Bundle Docking Domains of trans-Acyltransferase Modular Polyketide Synthases Abstract: The polypeptides of multimodular polyketide synthases self-assemble into biosynthetic factories. While the docking domains that mediate the assembly of cis-acyltransferase polyketide synthase polypeptides are well-studied, those of the more recently discovered trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases have just started to be described. Located at the C- and N-termini of many polypeptides, these 25-residue, two-helix, pseudosymmetric motifs noncovalently connect domains both between and within modules. Domains expressed with their natural, cognate docking motifs formed complexes stable to size-exclusion chromatography with 1-10 μM dissociation constants as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Deletion and swapping experiments demonstrate portability of the docking motifs. A 1.72 Å-resolution structure of the N-terminal portion of the macrolactin synthase polypeptide MlnE shows an uncomplexed N-terminal docking motif to be preorganized in the conformation it assumes within the docking domain complex.	0
Title: Genome Mining Reveals Endopyrroles from a Nonribosomal Peptide Assembly Line Triggered in Fungal-Bacterial Symbiosis Abstract: The bacterial endosymbiont (Burkholderia rhizoxinica) of the rice seedling blight fungus (Rhizopus microsporus) harbors a large number of cryptic biosynthesis gene clusters. Genome mining and sequence similarity networks based on an encoded nonribosomal peptide assembly line and the associated pyrrole-forming enzymes in the symbiont indicated that the encoded metabolites are unique among a large number of tentative pyrrole natural products in diverse and unrelated bacterial phyla. By performing comparative metabolic profiling using a mutant generated with an improved pheS Burkholderia counterselection marker, we found that the symbionts' biosynthetic pathway is mainly activated under salt stress and exclusively in symbiosis with the fungal host. The cryptic metabolites were fully characterized as novel pyrrole-substituted depsipeptides (endopyrroles). A broader survey showed that endopyrrole production is a hallmark of geographically distant endofungal bacteria, which produce the peptides solely under symbiotic conditions.	1
Title: DNA damage recognition of mutated forms of UvrB proteins in nucleotide excision repair Abstract: The DNA repair protein UvrB plays an indispensable role in the stepwise and sequential damage recognition of nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli. Our previous studies suggested that UvrB is responsible for the chemical damage recognition only upon a strand opening mediated by UvrA. Difficulties were encountered in studying the direct interaction of UvrB with adducts due to the presence of UvrA. We report herein that a single point mutation of Y95W in which a tyrosine is replaced by a tryptophan results in an UvrB mutant that is capable of efficiently binding to structure-specific DNA adducts even in the absence of UvrA. This mutant is fully functional in the UvrABC incisions. The dissociation constant for the mutant-DNA adduct interaction was less than 100 nM at physiological temperatures as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. In contrast, similar substitutions at other residues in the beta-hairpin with tryptophan or phenylalanine do not confer UvrB such binding ability. Homology modeling of the structure of E. coli UvrB shows that the aromatic ring of residue Y95 and only Y95 directly points into the DNA binding cleft. We have also examined UvrB recognition of both "normal" bulky BPDE-DNA and protein-cross-linked DNA (DPC) adducts and the roles of aromatic residues of the beta-hairpin in the recognition of these lesions. A mutation of Y92W resulted in an obvious decrease in the efficiency of UvrABC incisions of normal adducts, while the incision of the DPC adduct is dramatically increased. Our results suggest that Y92 may function differently with these two types of adducts, while the Y95 residue plays an unique role in stabilizing the interaction of UvrB with DNA damage, most likely by a hydrophobic stacking.	0
Title: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. II. Kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of stable and unstable ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus growing in a defined medium was determined. Under these conditions, M. xanthus contains one chromosome which is replicated during 80% of the cell cycle. Stable RNA synthesis was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radioactive uridine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of stable RNA synthesis as a function of cell size was determined. Unstable RNA synthesis during the division cycle was determined by correlating the data for stable RNA synthesis with the relative amounts of stable and unstable RNA labeled during the short pulse. The data reported here demonstrate that: (i) cells synthesize both stable and unstable RNA throughout the division cycle; (ii) the rate of stable RNA synthesis increases in two discrete steps, corresponding to average ages of 0.15 and 0.75 generations; (iii) the rate of unstable RNA synthesis exhibits an initial rise, followed by a relatively constant rate of synthesis, and finally, a burst of unstable RNA synthesis prior to septum formation. The half-life of unstable RNA of M. xanthus, generation time of 390 min at 30 C, was 4 min. Comparison of the rates of stable and unstable RNA synthesis indicates noncoordinate RNA synthesis within the normal division cycle.	0
Title: Biochemical and genetic characterization of fungal proline hydroxylase in echinocandin biosynthesis Abstract: An intriguing structural feature of echinocandins is the incorporation of hydroxylated amino acids. Elucidation of the machinery and the mechanism responsible for this modification is critical to generate new echinocandin derivatives with enhanced antifungal activity. In our present study, we biochemically characterized the α-ketoglutarate/Fe2+-dependent proline hydroxylase (HtyE) from two Aspergillus species, Aspergillus pachycristatus and Aspergillus aculeatus, in the respective echinocandin B and aculeacin A biosynthetic gene clusters. Our results showed that both Ap- and Aa-HtyE converted L-proline to trans-4- and trans-3-hydroxyproline, but at different ratios. Both enzymes also effectively hydroxylated C-3 of 4R-methyl-proline, L-pipecolic acid, and D-proline. Our homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified Leu182 of Ap-HtyE as a key residue in determining the regioselectivity of Ap-HtyE. Notably, we found that the efficiency in C-3 hydroxylation of 4R-methyl-proline has no direct correlation with the ratio of trans-4-hydroxylproline to trans-3-hydroxylproline catalyzed by HtyE. Deletion of Ap-htyE abolished A. pachycristatus anti-Candida activity and the production of echinocandin B, demonstrating that HtyE is the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation of L-proline and 4R-methyl-proline in vivo and is essential for the anti-Candida activity of echinocandin B. Our present study thus sheds light on the biochemical basis for the selective hydroxylation of L-proline and 4R-methyl-proline and reveals a new type of biocatalyst with potential for the custom production of hydroxylated proline and pipecolic acid derivatives.	1
Title: Multicolored pH-tunable and activatable fluorescence nanoplatform responsive to physiologic pH stimuli Abstract: Tunable, ultra-pH responsive fluorescent nanoparticles with multichromatic emissions are highly valuable in a variety of biological studies, such as endocytic trafficking, endosome/lysosome maturation, and pH regulation in subcellular organelles. Small differences (e.g., <1 pH unit) and yet finely regulated physiological pH inside different endocytic compartments present a huge challenge to the design of such a system. Herein, we report a general strategy to produce pH-tunable, highly activatable multicolored fluorescent nanoparticles using commonly available pH-insensitive dyes with emission wavelengths from green to near IR range. The primary driving force of fluorescence activation between the ON (unimer) and OFF (micelle) states is the pH-induced micellization. Among three possible photochemical mechanisms, homo Förster resonance energy transfer (homoFRET)-enhanced decay was found to be the most facile strategy to render ultra-pH response over the H-dimer and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) mechanisms. Based on this insight, we selected several fluorophores with small Stoke shifts (<40 nm) and established a panel of multicolored nanoparticles with wide emission range (500-820 nm) and different pH transitions. Each nanoparticle maintained the sharp pH response (ON/OFF < 0.25 pH unit) with corresponding pH transition point at pH 5.2, 6.4, 6.9, and 7.2. Incubation of a mixture of multicolored nanoparticles with human H2009 lung cancer cells demonstrated sequential activation of the nanoparticles inside endocytic compartments directly correlating with their pH transitions. This multicolored, pH-tunable nanoplatform offers exciting opportunities for the study of many important cell physiological processes, such as pH regulation and endocytic trafficking of subcellular organelles.	0
Title: Characterisation of the biosynthetic pathway to agnestins A and B reveals the reductive route to chrysophanol in fungi Abstract: Two new dihydroxy-xanthone metabolites, agnestins A and B, were isolated from Paecilomyces variotii along with a number of related benzophenones and xanthones including monodictyphenone. The structures were elucidated by NMR analyses and X-ray crystallography. The agnestin (agn) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and targeted gene disruptions of the PKS, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, and other oxido-reductase genes revealed new details of fungal xanthone biosynthesis. In particular, identification of a reductase responsible for in vivo anthraquinone to anthrol conversion confirms a previously postulated essential step in aromatic deoxygenation of anthraquinones, e.g. emodin to chrysophanol.	1
Title: Radical [3 + 2]-annulation of divinylcyclopropanes: rapid synthesis of complex meloscine analogs Abstract: A radical [3 + 2]-divinylcyclopropane annulation cascade has been extended to encompass five D-ring variants of the meloscine/epimeloscine core structure. Representative ABCD tetracyclic intermediates were further elaborated with novel substituted E-rings through subsequent transformations of advanced intermediates that provided opportunities for late-stage variation of the B-ring (lactam) N-substituents which were also developed.	0
Title: The phosphopantetheinyl transferase KirP activates the ACP and PCP domains of the kirromycin NRPS/PKS of Streptomyces collinus Tü 365 Abstract: The main steps in the biosynthesis of complex secondary metabolites such as the antibiotic kirromycin are catalyzed by modular polyketide synthases (PKS) and/or nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). During antibiotic assembly, the biosynthetic intermediates are attached to carrier protein domains of these megaenzymes via a phosphopantetheinyl arm. This functional group of the carrier proteins is attached post-translationally by a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). No experimental evidence exists about how such an activation of the carrier proteins of the kirromycin PKS/NRPS is accomplished. Here we report on the characterization of the PPTase KirP, which is encoded by a gene located in the kirromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. An inactivation of the kirP gene resulted in a 90% decrease in kirromycin production, indicating a substantial role for KirP in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. In enzymatic assays, KirP was able to activate both acyl carrier protein and petidyl carrier domains of the kirromycin PKS/NRPS. In addition to coenzyme A (CoA), which is the natural substrate of KirP, the enzyme was able to transfer acyl-phosphopantetheinyl groups to the apo forms of the carrier proteins. Thus, KirP is very flexible in terms of both CoA substrate and carrier protein specificity. Our results indicate that KirP is the main PPTases that activates the carrier proteins in kirromycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Natural Product Discovery through Improved Functional Metagenomics in Streptomyces Abstract: Because the majority of environmental bacteria are not easily culturable, access to many bacterially encoded secondary metabolites will be dependent on the development of improved functional metagenomic screening methods. In this study, we examined a collection of diverse Streptomyces species for the best innate ability to heterologously express biosynthetic gene clusters. We then optimized methods for constructing high quality metagenomic cosmid libraries in the best Streptomyces host. An initial screen of a 1.5 million-membered metagenomic library constructed in Streptomyces albus, the species that exhibited the highest propensity for heterologous expression of gene clusters, led to the identification of the novel natural product metatricycloene (1). Metatricycloene is a tricyclic polyene encoded by a reductive, iterative polyketide-like gene cluster. Related gene clusters found in sequenced genomes appear to encode a largely unexplored collection of structurally diverse, polyene-based metabolites.	1
Title: Lighting up FGFR signaling Abstract: In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Kim and colleagues describe their work on optogenetic control of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling. By engineering a chimeric receptor, the authors demonstrate that FGFR intracellular signaling can be controlled in space and time by blue light.	0
Title: The Profile and Dynamics of RNA Modifications in Animals Abstract: More than a hundred distinct modified nucleosides have been identified in RNA, but little is known about their distribution across different organisms, their dynamic nature and their response to cellular and environmental stress. Mass-spectrometry-based methods have been at the forefront of identifying and quantifying modified nucleosides. However, they often require synthetic reference standards, which do not exist in the case of many modified nucleosides, and this therefore impedes their analysis. Here we use a metabolic labelling approach to achieve rapid generation of bio-isotopologues of the complete Caenorhabditis elegans transcriptome and its modifications and use them as reference standards to characterise the RNA modification profile in this multicellular organism through an untargeted liquid-chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) approach. We furthermore show that several of these RNA modifications have a dynamic response to environmental stress and that, in particular, changes in the tRNA wobble base modification 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5 s2 U) lead to codon-biased gene-expression changes in starved animals.	0
Title: An adaptable luminescence resonance energy transfer assay for measuring and screening protein-protein interactions and their inhibition Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to biological processes and represent an important class of therapeutic targets. Here we show that the interaction between FK506-binding protein 12 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-FKBP) and the rapamycin-binding domain of mTor fused to Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (FRB-eDHFR) can be sensitively detected (signal-to-background ratio (S/B)>100) and accurately quantified within an impure cell lysate matrix using a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) assay. Ascomycin-mediated inhibition of GFP-FKBP-rapamycin-FRB-eDHFR complex formation was also detected at high S/B ratio (>80) and Z'-factor (0.89). The method leverages the selective, stable binding of trimethoprim (TMP)-terbium complex conjugates to eDHFR, and time-resolved, background-free detection of the long-lifetime (∼ms) terbium-to-GFP LRET signal that indicates target binding. TMP-eDHFR labeling can be adapted to develop high-throughput screening assays and complementary, quantitative counter-screens for a wide variety of PPI targets with a broad range of affinities that may not be amenable to purification.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ATPase) inhibitor bongkrekic acid in Burkholderia gladioli Abstract: Biosynthetic studies with (13)C-labelled acetates and methionine revealed that the infamous, food-related toxin bongkrekic acid from Burkholderia gladioli is a polyketide with acetate-derived beta-branches and a carboxylate terminus derived from the methyl group of an acetate.	1
Title: Agrobacterium tumefasciens-mediated transformation of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii Abstract: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely used for plant DNA transformation and more recently, has also been used to transform yeast, filamentous fungi and even human cells. Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of fungal phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 h of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill Agrobacterium tumefsciens and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores were shown to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class.	0
Title: Use of Slightly Pressurized Carbon Dioxide to Enhance the Antimicrobial Properties of Brines in Naturally Processed Black Table Olives Abstract: Naturally fermented black table olives are processed at low pH in the presence of high sodium chloride concentrations ranging from 8 to 12% (w v-1). Reducing the salt content of brine has become an urgent issue as it is responsible for several health and environmental problems. The study aim was to evaluate slightly pressurized CO2 (spCO2) as a third barrier to microbial growth in naturally processed black table olives with low pH and a reduced NaCl concentration. Based on the assessments performed on a pilot plant scale, an spCO2 of 1 bar completely inhibited the growth of the bacteria and molds in the presence of reduced saline concentrations. Furthermore, the amount of yeast decreased in the brine as a function of the NaCl content. Laboratory tests performed under spCO2 conditions using a single yeast species from the same habitat confirmed the high sensitivity of some oxidizing yeasts and indicated that the fermenting yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the most tolerant species. Overall, in the brine of naturally processed olives with a low pH between 4 and 4.2, the antimicrobial properties observed with the high concentrations of NaCl can be achieved with a lower salt dose of 5% (w v-1) when combined with spCO2.	0
Title: Total synthesis of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate enantiomers: substrates for characterization of 2,3-O-digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase Abstract: To determine the enantioselectivity of (S)-2,3-di-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (DGGGPS) from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, we developed an efficient enantioselective route to the enantiomeric geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphates (R)-GGGP and (S)-GGGP. Previous routes to these substrates involved enzymatic conversions due to the lability of the polyprenyl chains toward common phosphorylation reaction conditions. The synthesis described herein employs a mild trimethyl phosphite/carbon tetrabromide oxidative phosphorylation to circumvent this problem. In contrast to previous results suggesting that only (S)-GGGP can act as the prenyl acceptor substrate, both (R)-GGGP and (S)-GGGP were found to be substrates for DGGGPS.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Trehangelin in Polymorphospora rubra K07-0510: Identification of Metabolic Pathway to Angelyl-CoA Abstract: Trehangelins are trehalose angelates discovered from endophytic actinomycete Polymorphospora rubra K07-0510. We identified the trehangelin biosynthetic gene cluster, including genes that encode a glycoside hydrolase-like protein (thgC), α-amylase (thgD), 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (thgI), 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (thgK), enoyl-CoA hydratase (thgH) and acyl transferase (thgJ). Heterologous expression of thgH, thgI, thgJ and thgK confirmed the importance of these genes in the biosynthesis of trehangelin A. Enzymatic activity studies showed that ThgI catalyses the condensation of acetyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA to 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA (MAA-CoA), ThgK catalyses NADPH-dependent reduction of MAA-CoA to 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA (HMB-CoA) and ThgH catalyses the dehydration of HMB-CoA to angelyl-CoA (AN-CoA). This is the first report on the elucidation of the enzymatic formation of AN-CoA.	1
Title: Computational Investigation of the Mechanism of Diels-Alderase PyrI4 Abstract: We studied the mechanisms of activation and stereoselectivity of a monofunctional Diels-Alderase (PyrI4)-catalyzed intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction that leads to formation of the key spiro-tetramate moiety in the biosynthesis of the pyrroindomycin family of natural products. Key activation effects of PyrI4 include acid catalysis and an induced-fit mechanism that cooperate with the unique "lid" feature of PyrI4 to stabilize the Diels-Alder transition state. PyrI4 enhances the intrinsic Diels-Alder stereoselectivity of the substrate and leads to stereospecific formation of the product.	0
Title: Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6-5-3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl-CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl-CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme-encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.	1
Title: Analysis of the role of the type III effector inventory of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a in interaction with the plant Abstract: In Pseudomonas syringae, the type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential for disease in compatible hosts and for eliciting the hypersensitive response in incompatible hosts. P. syringae pathovars secrete a variable number of type III effectors that form their secretomes. The secretome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a (Pph1448a) currently includes 22 experimentally validated effectors, one HrpL-regulated candidate for which translocation results have been inconsistent, two translocated candidates for which in planta expression has not been established, one bioinformatically identified candidate, and six candidates that have been experimentally discarded. We analyzed the translocation and/or expression of these and other candidates to complete the Pph1448a effector inventory, bringing this inventory to 27 bona fide effectors, including a new one that does not belong to any of the previously described effector families. We developed a simple process for rapidly making single and double knockout mutants and apply it to the generation of an effector mutant collection that includes single knockouts for the majority of the Pph1448a effector inventory. We also generated two double mutant strains containing effectors with potentially redundant functions and analyzed the virulence of the single and double mutant strains as well as strains expressing each of the effectors from a plasmid. We demonstrate that AvrB4-1 and AvrB4-2, as well as HopW1-1 and HopW1-2, are fully redundant and contribute to virulence in bean plants, thus validating this approach for dissecting the contribution of the Pph1448a type III effector inventory to virulence. We also analyzed the effect that the expression of these four effectors from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) has during its interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing that AvrB4-1, but not the others, determines a restriction of bacterial growth that takes place mostly independently of the salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway.	0
Title: The reversible change in the redox state of type I Cu in Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase depending on pH Abstract: The redox state of type I Cu in Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (BO), a multicopper oxidase utilized in the clinical investigation of liver, is an equilibrium state of the oxidized and reduced forms, reflected in the reversible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral changes depending on pH.	0
Title: Microbial community structure and dynamics during anaerobic digestion of various agricultural waste materials Abstract: The influence of the feedstock type on the microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion was investigated in laboratory-scale biogas reactors fed with different agricultural waste materials. Community composition and dynamics over 2 months of reactors' operation were investigated by amplicon sequencing and profiling terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of 16S rRNA genes. Major bacterial taxa belonged to the Clostridia and Bacteroidetes, whereas the archaeal community was dominated by methanogenic archaea of the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales. Correlation analysis revealed that the community composition was mainly influenced by the feedstock type with the exception of a temperature shift from 38 to 55 °C which caused the most pronounced community shifts. Bacterial communities involved in the anaerobic digestion of conventional substrates such as maize silage combined with cattle manure were relatively stable and similar to each other. In contrast, special waste materials such as chicken manure or Jatropha press cake were digested by very distinct and less diverse communities, indicating partial ammonia inhibition or the influence of other inhibiting factors. Anaerobic digestion of chicken manure relied on syntrophic acetate oxidation as the dominant acetate-consuming process due to the inhibition of aceticlastic methanogenesis. Jatropha as substrate led to the enrichment of fiber-degrading specialists belonging to the genera Actinomyces and Fibrobacter.	0
Title: Identification of two GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases synthesizing GDP-D-rhamnose in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T Abstract: The glycan repeats of the surface layer glycoprotein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T contain d-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose, both of which are also constituents of lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative plant and human pathogenic bacteria. The two genes required for biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated precursor GDP-d-rhamnose, gmd and rmd, were cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The corresponding enzymes Gmd and Rmd were purified to homogeneity, and functional studies were performed. GDP-d-mannose dehydratase (Gmd) converted GDP-d-mannose to GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, with NADP+ as cofactor. The reductase Rmd catalyzed the second step in the pathway, namely the reduction of the keto-intermediate to the final product GDP-d-rhamnose using both NADH and NADPH as hydride donor. The elution behavior of the intermediate and end product was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify the structure of the final product of the reaction sequence as GDP-alpha-d-rhamnose. This is the first characterization of a GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase. In addition, Gmd has been shown to be a bifunctional enzyme with both dehydratase and reductase activities. So far, no enzyme catalyzing these two types of reactions has been identified. Both Gmd and Rmd are members of the SDR (short chain dehydrogenase/reductase) protein family.	1
Title: Isolation and analysis of genes specifically expressed during fruiting body development in the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes by fluorescence differential display Abstract: Using fluorescence differential display, cDNAs specifically expressed at the primordial stage of fruiting body development were isolated from the basidiomycete, Flammulina velutipes. Seventy-five cDNAs were sequenced and compared with the amino-acid sequences of proteins in the database by BLASTX search. Significant similarity was found for 29 cDNAs coding for proteins with known function, GTP-binding protein, growth factor, ubiquitin-proteasome, cytochrome P450 and hydrophobin, all of which would be associated with fruiting body development. Seventeen cDNAs were not similar to proteins in the database and may represent unique genes that play specific roles in the process of fruiting in F. velutipes.	0
Title: Nongenetic reprogramming of a fungal highly reducing polyketide synthase Abstract: The biosynthesis of the fungal metabolite tenellin from Beauveria bassiana CBS110.25 was investigated in the presence of the epigenetic modifiers 5-azacytidine and suberoyl bis-hydroxamic acid and under conditions where individual genes from the tenellin biosynthetic gene cluster were silenced. Numerous new compounds were synthesized, indicating that the normal predominant biosynthesis of tenellin is just one outcome out of a diverse array of possible products. The structures of the products reveal key clues about the programming selectivities of the tenellin polyketide synthase.	1
Title: Methanogenesis in a Thermophilic (58 degrees C) Anaerobic Digestor: Methanothrix sp. as an Important Aceticlastic Methanogen Abstract: Aceticlastic methanogens and other microbial groups were enumerated in a 58 degrees C laboratory-scale (3 liter) anaerobic digestor which was fed air-classified municipal refuse, a lignocellulosic waste (loading rate = 1.8 to 2.7 g of volatile solids per liter per day; retention time = 10 days). Two weeks after start-up, Methanosarcina sp. was present in high numbers (10 to 10 CFU/ml) and autofluorescent Methanosarcina-like clumps were abundant in sludge examined by using epifluorescence microscopy. After about 4 months of digestor operation, numbers of Methanosarcina sp. dropped 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and large numbers (most probable number = 10 to 10/ml) of a thermophilic aceticlastic methanogen morphologically resembing Methanothrix sp. were found. Methanothrix sp. had apparently displaced Methanosarcina sp. as the dominant aceticlastic methanogen in the digestor. During the period when Methanothrix sp. was apparently dominant, acetate concentrations varied between 0.3 and 1.5 mumol/ml during the daily feeding cycle, and acetate was the precursor of 63 to 66% of the methane produced during peak digestor methanogenesis. The apparent K(m) value obtained for methanogenesis from acetate, 0.3 mumol/ml, indicated that the aceticlastic methanogens were nearly saturated for substrate during most of the digestor cycle. CO(2)-reducing methanogens were capable of methanogenesis at rates more than 12 times greater than those usually found in the digestor. Added propionate (4.5 mumol/ml) was metabolized slowly by the digestor populations and slightly inhibited methanogenesis. Added n-butyrate, isobutyrate, or n-valerate (4.5 mumol/ml each) were broken down within 24 h. Isobutyrate was oxidized to acetate, a novel reaction possibly involving isomerization to n-butyrate. The rapid growth rate and versatile metabolism of Methanosarcina sp. make it a likely organism to be involved in start-up, whereas the low K(m) value of Methanothrix sp. for acetate may cause it to be favored in stable digestors operated with long retention times.	0
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide antitumor macrolide, pladienolide, in Streptomyces platensis Mer-11107 Abstract: Pladienolides are novel 12-membered macrolides produced by Streptomyces platensis Mer-11107. They show strong antitumor activity and are a potential lead in the search for novel antitumor agents. We sequenced the 65-kb region covering the biosynthetic gene cluster, and found four polyketide synthase genes (pldAI-pldAIV) composed of 11 modules, three genes involved in post-modifications (pldB-D), and a luxR-family regulatory gene (pldR). The thioesterase domain of pldAIV was more dissimilar to that of polyketide synthase systems synthesizing 12/14-membered macrolide polyketides than to that of systems synthesizing other cyclic polyketides. The pldB gene was identified as a 6-hydroxylase belonging to a cytochrome P450 of the CYP107 family. This was clarified by a disruption experiment on pldB, in which the disruptant produced 6-dehydroxy pladienolide B. Two genes located downstream of pldB, designated pldC and pldD, are thought to be a probable genes for 7-O-acetylase and 18, 19-epoxydase respectively.	1
Title: Dual-color click beetle luciferase heteroprotein fragment complementation assays Abstract: Understanding the functional complexity of protein interactions requires mapping biomolecular complexes within the cellular environment over biologically relevant time scales. Herein, we describe a set of reversible multicolored heteroprotein complementation fragments based on various firefly and click beetle luciferases that utilize the same substrate, D-luciferin. Luciferase heteroprotein fragment complementation systems enabled dual-color quantification of two discrete pairs of interacting proteins simultaneously or two distinct proteins interacting with a third shared protein in live cells. Using real-time analysis of click beetle green and click beetle red luciferase heteroprotein fragment complementation applied to β-TrCP, an E3-ligase common to the regulation of both β-catenin and IκBα, GSK3β was identified as a candidate kinase regulating IκBα processing. These dual-color protein interaction switches may enable directed dynamic analysis of a variety of protein interactions in living cells.	0
Title: Functional analysis of genes responsible for the synthesis of the B-band O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O6 lipopolysaccharide Abstract: This study reports the organization of the wbp gene cluster and characterization of a number of genes that are essential for B-band O antigen biosynthesis in the clinically prevalent Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06. Twelve genes were identified that share homology with other LPS and polysaccharide biosynthetic genes. This cluster contains homologues of wzx (encoding the O antigen flippase/translocase) and wzz (which modulates O antigen chain length distribution) genes, typical of a wzy-dependent pathway. However, a complete wzy gene (encoding the O-polymerase) was not found within the cluster. Four biosynthetic genes, wbpO, wbpP, wbpV and wbpM, and four putative glycosyltransferase genes, wbpR, wbpT, wbpU and wbpL, were identified in the cluster. To characterize their roles in LPS biosynthesis, null mutants of wbpO, wbpP, wbpV, wbpL and wbpM were generated using a gene-replacement strategy. Mutations in each of these genes caused deficiency in B-band synthesis. The wbpL mutant was deficient in both A-band and B-band LPS. WbpL(O6) is a bi-functional enzyme which could initiate B-band synthesis through the addition of QuiNAc to undecaprenol phosphate, and A-band synthesis by transferring either a GalNAc or a GlcNAc residue. Another approach used to assign function to the wbp(O6) genes was by complementation analysis. Two genes from Salmonella typhi, wcdA and wcdB, responsible for the synthesis of a homopolymer of GalNAcA called Vi antigen were used in complementation experiments to verify the functions of wbpO and wbpP. wcdA and wcdB restored B-band synthesis in wbpO and wbpP mutants respectively, implying that wbpO and wbpP are involved in UDP-GalNAcA synthesis. Although wbpV has homology to wbpK of the serotype O5 B-band LPS synthesis cluster, complementation analysis using the respective null mutants showed that the genes are not interchangeable. A knockout mutation of wbpN (located downstream of wbpM) did not abrogate LPS synthesis in either 05 or 06; therefore, it has been renamed orf48.5. These results establish the organization of genes involved in P. aeruginosa B-band O antigen synthesis and provide the evidence to assign functions to a number of LPS biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: Arginyltransferase is an ATP-independent self-regulating enzyme that forms distinct functional complexes in vivo Abstract: Posttranslational arginylation mediated by arginyl transferase (ATE1) plays an important role in cardiovascular development, cell motility, and regulation of cytoskeleton and metabolic enzymes. This protein modification was discovered decades ago, however, the arginylation reaction and the functioning of ATE1 remained poorly understood because of the lack of good biochemical models. Here, we report the development of an in vitro arginylation system, in which ATE1 function and molecular requirements can be tested using purified recombinant ATE1 isoforms supplemented with a controlled number of components. Our results show that arginylation reaction is a self-sufficient, ATP-independent process that can affect different sites in a polypeptide and that arginyl transferases form different molecular complexes in vivo, associate with components of the translation machinery, and have distinct, partially overlapping subsets of substrates, suggesting that these enzymes play different physiological functions.	0
Title: A B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in oxetanocin A biosynthesis Abstract: Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the catalytic repertoire of Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes.	1
Title: Evidence for production of a new lantibiotic (butyrivibriocin OR79A) by the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OR79: characterization of the structural gene encoding butyrivibriocin OR79A Abstract: The ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OR79 produces a bacteriocin-like activity demonstrating a very broad spectrum of activity. An inhibitor was isolated from spent culture fluid by a combination of ammonium sulfate and acidic precipitations, reverse-phase chromatography, and high-resolution gel filtration. N-terminal analysis of the isolated inhibitor yielded a 15-amino-acid sequence (G-N/Q-G/P-V-I-L-X-I-X-H-E-X-S-M-N). Two different amino acid residues were detected in the second and third positions from the N terminus, indicating the presence of two distinct peptides. A gene with significant homology to one combination of the determined N-terminal sequence was cloned, and expression of the gene was confirmed by Northern blotting. The gene (bvi79A) encoded a prepeptide of 47 amino acids and a mature peptide, butyrivibriocin OR79A, of 25 amino acids. Significant sequence homology was found between this peptide and previously reported lantibiotics containing the double-glycine leader peptidase processing site. Immediately downstream of bvi79A was a second, partial open reading frame encoding a peptide with significant homology to proteins which are believed to be involved in the synthesis of lanthionine residues. These findings indicate that the isolated inhibitory peptides represent new lantibiotics. Results from both total and N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the second peptide was identical to butyrivibriocin OR79A except for amino acid substitutions in positions 2 and 3 of the mature lantibiotic. Only a single coding region was detected when restriction enzyme digests of total DNA were probed either with an oligonucleotide based on the 5' region of bvi79A or with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the predicted sequence of the second peptide.	1
Title: Evaluation of a 7-Methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic Acid Ester Derivative as a Fluorescent, Cell-Cleavable, Phosphonate Protecting Group Abstract: Cell-cleavable protecting groups often enhance cellular delivery of species that are charged at physiological pH. Although several phosphonate protecting groups have achieved clinical success, it remains difficult to use these prodrugs in live cells to clarify biological mechanisms. Here, we present a strategy that uses a 7-methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid ester as a fluorescent protecting group. This strategy was applied to synthesis of an (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate (HMBPP) analogue to assess cellular uptake and human Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation. The fluorescent ester displayed low cellular toxicity (IC50 >100 μm) and strong T cell activation (EC50 =0.018 μm) relative to the unprotected anion (EC50 =23 μm). The coumarin-derived analogue allowed no-wash analysis of biological deprotection, which revealed rapid internalization of the prodrug. These results demonstrate that fluorescent groups can be applied both as functional drug delivery tools and useful biological probes of drug uptake.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of rebeccamycin from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole antibiotic, from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 has 11 ORFs. To clarify their functions, mutants with rebG, rebD, rebC, rebP, rebM, rebR, rebH, rebT, or orfD2 disrupted were constructed, and the gene products were examined. rebP disruptants produced 11,11'-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid, found to be a biosynthetic intermediate by a bioconversion experiment. Other genes encoded N-glycosyltransferase (rebG), monooxygenase (rebC), methyltransferase (rebM), a transcriptional activator (rebR), and halogenase (rebH). rebT disruptants produced rebeccamycin as much as the wild strain, so rebT was probably not involved in rebeccamycin production. Biosynthetic genes of staurosporine, an another indolocarbazole antibiotic, were cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274. staO, staD, and staP were similar to rebO, rebD, and rebP, respectively, all of which are responsible for indolocarbazole biosynthesis, But a rebC homolog, encoding a putative enzyme oxidizing the C-7 site of pyrrole rings, was not found in the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster. These results suggest that indolocarbazole is constructed by oxidative decarboxylation of chromopyrrolic acid (11,11'-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid in rebeccamycin) generated from two molecules of tryptophan by coupling and that the oxidation state at the C-7 position depends on the additional enzyme(s) encoded by the biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus p27 and its isoforms affect symptom expression and potentiate virus movement in kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) Abstract: Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a member of the genus Carmovirus, encodes p27 (27-kDa protein) and two other in-frame isoforms (p25 and p22.5) that are coterminal at the carboxyl end. Only p27, which initiates at the 2570CUG codon, was detected in transfected kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) protoplasts through fusion to a Flag tag at either its N or C terminus. Subcellular localization of a p27-green fluorescent fusion protein in kenaf epidermal cells showed that it was localized to membrane structures close to cell walls. To study the functions of these proteins, a number of start codon mutants and premature translation termination mutants were constructed. Phenotypic differences were observed between the wild-type virus and these mutants during infection. Infectivity assays on plants indicated that p27 is a determinant of symptom severity. Without p25, appearance of symptoms on systemically infected kenaf leaves was delayed by 4 to 8 days. In a timecourse analysis, Western blot assays revealed that the delay corresponded to retardation in virus systemic movement, which suggested that p25 is probably involved in virus systemic movement. Mutations disrupting expression of p22.5 did not affect symptoms or virus movement.	0
Title: Type II thioesterase ScoT is required for coelimycin production by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Type II thioesterases were shown to maintain efficiency of modular type I polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases by removing acyl residues blocking extension modules. We found that thioesterase ScoT from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is required for the production of the yellow-pigmented coelimycin by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk. No production of coelimycin was observed in cultures of scoT disruption mutant. Polyketide production was restored upon complementation with an intact copy of the scoT gene. An enzymatic assay showed that ScoT thioesterase can hydrolyse a 12-carbon acyl chain but the activity is too low to play a role in product release from the polyketide synthase. We conclude that ScoT is an editing enzyme necessary to maintain the activity of polyketide synthase Cpk. We provide a HPLC based method to measure the amount of coelimycin P2 in a culture medium.	1
Title: Membrane localization of the HflA regulatory protease of Escherichia coli by immunoelectron microscopy Abstract: The hflA locus of Escherichia coli specifies a multisubunit protease that selectively degrades the cII transcriptional activator of phage lambda. The regulated turnover of cII is critical for the choice between the lytic and lysogenic pathways of viral development. Previous cell fractionation work has indicated that HflA is associated with the inner membrane fraction. We have sought to demonstrate that the HflA protease is localized in the cell membrane of intact cells. To achieve this goal, we have combined electron microscopy of thin-sectioned E. coli cells with antibody tagging by a colloidal gold label. Using antibody to purified HflA protein, we have found preferential membrane labeling for hflA+ cells but not for hflA mutant cells. We conclude that HflA protease is localized in the cell membrane. The membrane location for HflA protein may serve as a component of a targeting mechanism to limit the action of the regulatory protease to selected cytoplasmic proteins.	0
Title: Microbial community assembly differs across minerals in a rhizosphere microcosm Abstract: Mineral-associated microbes drive many critical soil processes, including mineral weathering, soil aggregation and cycling of mineral-sorbed organic matter. To investigate the interactions between soil minerals and microbes in the rhizosphere, we incubated three types of minerals (ferrihydrite, kaolinite and quartz) and a native soil mineral fraction near roots of a common Californian annual grass, Avena barbata, growing in its resident soil. We followed microbial colonization of these minerals for up to 2.5 months - the plant's lifespan. Bacteria and fungi that colonized mineral surfaces during this experiment differed across mineral types and differed from those in the background soil, implying that microbial colonization was the result of processes in addition to passive movement with water to mineral surfaces. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was a dominant factor structuring mineral-associated microbial communities for all mineral types. Once bacteria arrived at a mineral surface, capacity for rapid growth appeared important, as ribosomal copy number was significantly correlated with relative enrichment on minerals. Glomeromycota (a phylum associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) appeared to preferentially associate with ferrihydrite surfaces. The mechanisms enabling the colonization of soil minerals may be foundational in shaping the overall soil microbiome composition and development of persistent organic matter in soils.	0
Title: Ultrafast and long-time excited state kinetics of an NIR-emissive vanadium(iii) complex II. Elucidating triplet-to-singlet excited-state dynamics Abstract: We report the non-adiabatic dynamics of VIIICl3(ddpd), a complex based on the Earth-abundant first-row transition metal vanadium with a d2 electronic configuration which is able to emit phosphorescence in solution in the near-infrared spectral region. Trajectory surface-hopping dynamics based on linear vibronic coupling potentials obtained with CASSCF provide molecular-level insights into the intersystem crossing from triplet to singlet metal-centered states. While the majority of the singlet population undergoes back-intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold, 1-2% remains stable during the 10 ps simulation time, enabling the phosphorescence described in Dorn et al. Chem. Sci., 2021, DOI: 10.1039/D1SC02137K. Competing with intersystem crossing, two different relaxation channels via internal conversion through the triplet manifold occur. The nuclear motion that drives the dynamics through the different electronic states corresponds mainly to the increase of all metal-ligand bond distances as well as the decrease of the angles of trans-coordinated ligand atoms. Both motions lead to a decrease in the ligand-field splitting, which stabilizes the interconfigurational excited states populated during the dynamics. Analysis of the electronic character of the states reveals that increasing and stabilizing the singlet population, which in turn can result in enhanced phosphorescence, could be accomplished by further increasing the ligand-field strength.	0
Title: Precursor-centric genome-mining approach for lasso peptide discovery Abstract: Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized posttranslationally modified natural products found in bacteria. Currently known lasso peptides have a diverse set of pharmacologically relevant activities, including inhibition of bacterial growth, receptor antagonism, and enzyme inhibition. The biosynthesis of lasso peptides is specified by a cluster of three genes encoding a precursor protein and two enzymes. Here we develop a unique genome-mining algorithm to identify lasso peptide gene clusters in prokaryotes. Our approach involves pattern matching to a small number of conserved amino acids in precursor proteins, and thus allows for a more global survey of lasso peptide gene clusters than does homology-based genome mining. Of more than 3,000 currently sequenced prokaryotic genomes, we found 76 organisms that are putative lasso peptide producers. These organisms span nine bacterial phyla and an archaeal phylum. To provide validation of the genome-mining method, we focused on a single lasso peptide predicted to be produced by the freshwater bacterium Asticcacaulis excentricus. Heterologous expression of an engineered, minimal gene cluster in Escherichia coli led to the production of a unique lasso peptide, astexin-1. At 23 aa, astexin-1 is the largest lasso peptide isolated to date. It is also highly polar, in contrast to many lasso peptides that are primarily hydrophobic. Astexin-1 has modest antimicrobial activity against its phylogenetic relative Caulobacter crescentus. The solution structure of astexin-1 was determined revealing a unique topology that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between segments of the peptide.	1
Title: Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was measured during microcyst germination in Myxococcus xanthus by radioactive thymidine incorporation, autoradiography, and chemical analysis. Microcysts contained an average of 6.6 conserved units of DNA, corresponding to 3 to 4 chromosomes per cell. Correlation of the DNA content and chromosome number of microcysts indicated that the molecular weight of the nonreplicating M. xanthus chromosome is 4.9 x 10(9) daltons. DNA synthesis was initiated 3.5 to 4 hr after induction of germination. From 4 to 6 hr, the rate of synthesis was constant and the accumulation was linear. After a lag period (6 to 6.5 hr), the rate of DNA synthesis increased, reaching a second plateau at 9 hr. From 9 to 11 hr, the rate was again constant and the accumulation was linear. Cellular division during germination showed an unusual kind of synchrony. A model is presented that accounts for chromosomal replication and cell division during microcyst germination.	0
Title: Tumor initiators and promoters in the induction of Epstein-Barr virus Abstract: The effect of various tumor initiators and promoters on induction of persisting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in different lines of lymphoblastoid cells was analyzed. Neither five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, amongst them potent tumor initiators (e.g., 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene), nor the potent (ultimate) liver carcinogen N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylamino-fluorene induced EBV. A series of compounds, representing three classes of tumor-promoting diterpene esters (e.g., 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), efficiently induced EBV in persistently infected cells. The concentration required for maximal induction ranged between 0.5 and 100 nM. Some nonpromoting diterpenes (phorbol, 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, and ingenol) did not induce EBV. However, the nonpromoters, resiniferatoxin and 12-deoxyphorbol-13-decatrienoate, were effective, whereas anthralin, a tumor promoter, did not induce EBV. In three lines of EBV genome-carrying cells (Raji, NC-37, and RPMI 64-10) only abortive induction was noted, leading exclusively to synthesis of early antigen. In cells of lines with low spontaneous virus release (P3HR-1, B95-8, and QIMR-Wil), upon treatment with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, approximately 20-40 times more viral DNA was recovered as compared to untreated controls. Viral DNA from tetradeca-noylphorbol acetate-induced cultures revealed the same restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern as viral DNA obtained from noninduced cells. Within 10 days after induction, release of infectious virus increased approximately by one order of magnitude. Prostaglandins, reported to be released after treatment with tumor promoters, were ineffective in virus induction under the conditions tested.	0
Title: The Production of γ-Aminobutyric Acid from Free and Immobilized Cells of Levilactobacillus brevis Cultivated in Anaerobic and Aerobic Conditions Abstract: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has several beneficial effects on human health. GABA may be produced via chemical synthesis or through microbial metabolism, and Levilactobacillus brevis is recognized as a GABA-producing species. In this study, 11 Lvb. brevis strains were screened for GABA production, and the best producers were selected to verify the effect of aerobic (AE) and respiratory (RS) cultivations on growth parameters, biomass, and GABA accumulation. Lvb. brevis LB12 was then used to evaluate the combined effect of the incubation atmosphere (anaerobiosis vs. aerobiosis), cell protection (free vs. immobilized cells), and cell recycling (fresh vs. starved cells) on GABA production. Glutamate (GLU) consumption and GABA accumulation were detected by Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC) and RP-HPLC analyses. The ability to produce GABA was widespread among the strains. AE and RS growth improved biomass production, but oxygen availability impaired GLU to GABA conversion, and the anaerobically growing cells had the highest GABA productivity. Immobilized strains had lower efficiency in both GLU uptake and conversion compared to free cells, probably due to the poor diffusion in alginate beads. The use of resting cells allowed further GABA production without the cultivation step, but cell activity was exhausted after three cycles of reutilization. Lvb. brevis LB12 is an excellent GABA producer, and AE cultivation can be exploited to improve the final cell density; however, the conditions for boosting GLU to GABA conversion and cell regeneration need to be further investigated.	0
Title: Two different polyketide synthase genes are required for synthesis of zearalenone in Gibberella zeae Abstract: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a polyketide mycotoxin produced by some species of Gibberella/Fusarium and causes hyperestrogenic syndrome in animals. ZEA occurs naturally in cereals infected by Gibberella zeae in temperate regions and threatens animal health. In this study, we report on a set of genes that participate in the biosynthesis of ZEA in G. zeae. Focusing on the non-reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) genes of the G. zeae genome, we demonstrated that PKS13 is required for ZEA production. Subsequent analyses revealed that a continuous, 50 kb segment of DNA carrying PKS13 consisted of three additional open reading frames that were coexpressed as a cluster during the condition for ZEA biosynthesis. These genes, in addition to PKS13, were essential for the ZEA biosynthesis. They include another PKS gene (PKS4) encoding a fungal reducing PKS; zearalenone biosynthesis gene 1 (ZEB1), which shows a high similarity to putative isoamyl alcohol oxidase genes; and ZEB2 whose deduced product carries a conserved, basic-region leucine zipper domain. ZEB1 is responsible for the chemical conversion of beta-zearalenonol (beta-ZOL) to ZEA in the biosynthetic pathway, and ZEB2 controls transcription of the cluster members. Transcription of these genes was strongly influenced by different culture conditions such as nutrient starvations and ambient pH. Furthermore, the same set of genes regulated by ZEB2 was dramatically repressed in the transgenic G. zeae strain with the deletion of PKS13 or PKS4 but not in the ZEB1 deletion strain, suggesting that ZEA or beta-ZOL may be involved in transcriptional activation of the gene cluster required for ZEA biosynthesis in G. zeae. This is the first published report on the molecular characterization of genes required for ZEA biosynthesis.	1
Title: The first study about the relationship between the extractability of thiacalix[4]arene derivatives and the position of the coordination binding sites Abstract: Three organic ionophores (2-4) based on the p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene backbone, blocked in the 1,3-alternate conformation, bearing two pyridyl coordinating moieties (ortho for 2, meta for 3 and para for 4), have been synthesized and characterized in the solid state. The solvent extraction experiments with the metal ions showed that the ability of these derivatives to complex with Ag(+) appeared to be largely dependent on the position of the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl ring. Two different complexation modes have been confirmed by 1H NMR titration. Ionophore 2 armed with two pyridyl moieties, complexed with Ag(+) cation through N···Ag(+)···S interactions; however, ionophore 3 and ionophore 4 complexed with Ag(+) through metal-nitrogen (N···Ag(+)) interactions. The DFT computational studies were consistent with the experimental findings. These findings will provide us with an important rule to design an appropriate thiacalix[4]arene ionophore in the future. Another study on the possibility for application of ionophores 2-4 for the treatment of waste water containing Cr(VI) and Cr(III), showed that ionophore 3 was useful in the application of the solvent extraction method in selective treatment of waste water containing Cr(VI) and Cr(III) prior to discharge.	0
Title: The erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aeromicrobium erythreum Abstract: The erythromycin-biosynthetic (ery) gene cluster of Aeromicrobium erythreum was cloned and characterized. The 55.4-kb cluster contains 25 ery genes. Homologues were found for each gene in the previously characterized ery gene cluster from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In addition, four new predicted ery genes were identified. Two of the new predicted genes, coding for a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (eryP) and a type II thioesterase (eryTII), were internal to the ery cluster. The other two new genes, coding for a thymidine 5'-diphosphate-glucose synthase (eryDI) and a MarR-family transcriptional repressor (ery-ORF25), were found at the two ends of the ery cluster. A knockout in eryDI showed it to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. The gene order of the two ery clusters was conserved within a core region of 15 contiguous genes, with the exception of IS1136 which was not found in the A. erythreum cluster. Beyond the core region, gene shuffling had occurred between the two sides of the cluster. The flanking regions of the two ery clusters were not alike in the type of genes found.	1
Title: Mechanisms and Dynamics of Synthetic and Biosynthetic Formation of Delitschiapyrones: Solvent Control of Ambimodal Periselectivity Abstract: The mechanism and dynamics for the formation of the delitschiapyrone family of natural products are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and quasiclassical molecular dynamics simulations with DFT and xTB. In the uncatalyzed reaction, delitschiapyrones A and B are formed by Diels-Alder reactions through a single transition state and a post-transition state bifurcation that favors formation of delitschiapyrone B. In water and most likely in the enzyme, the acidic hydroxyquinone ionizes, and the resulting conjugate base undergoes cycloaddition preferentially to delitschiapyrone A. We demonstrate a new type of biosynthetic transformation and variable selectivity from a (4 + 2)/(4 + 3) ambimodal transition state.	0
Title: Characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans biotin biosynthetic gene cluster and use of the bioDA gene as a new transformation marker Abstract: The genes involved in the biosynthesis of biotin were identified in the hyphal fungus Aspergillus nidulans through homology searches and complementation of Escherichia coli biotin-auxotrophic mutants. Whereas the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase and dethiobiotin synthetase are encoded by distinct genes in bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both activities are performed in A. nidulans by a single enzyme, encoded by the bifunctional gene bioDA. Such a bifunctional bioDA gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the ascomycete filamentous fungi and basidiomycetes, as well as in plants and oömycota. However, unlike in other eukaryota, the three bio genes contributing to the four enzymatic steps from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin are organized in a gene cluster in pezizomycotina. The A. nidulans auxotrophic mutants biA1, biA2 and biA3 were all found to have mutations in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase domain of the bioDA gene. Although biotin auxotrophy is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic manipulations due to cross-feeding of biotin, transformation of the biA1 mutant with the bioDA gene from either A. nidulans or Aspergillus fumigatus led to the recovery of well-defined biotin-prototrophic colonies. The usefulness of bioDA gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in co-transformation experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the laccase (yA) gene via homologous recombination in a mutant lacking non-homologous end-joining activity.	1
Title: Characterization of a silent azaphilone gene cluster from Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 reveals a hydroxylation-mediated pyran-ring formation Abstract: Azaphilones are a class of fungal metabolites characterized by a highly oxygenated pyrano-quinone bicyclic core and exhibiting a broad range of bioactivities. Although widespread among various fungi, their biosynthesis has not been thoroughly elucidated. By activation of a silent (aza) gene cluster in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015, we discovered six azaphilone compounds, azanigerones A-F (1, 3-7). Transcriptional analysis and deletion of a key polyketide synthase (PKS) gene further confirmed the involvement of the aza gene cluster. The biosynthetic pathway was shown to involve the convergent actions of a highly reducing PKS and a non-reducing PKS. Most significantly, in vitro reaction of a key flavin-dependent monooxygenase encoded in the cluster with an early benzaldehyde intermediate revealed its roles in hydroxylation and pyran-ring formation to afford the characteristic bicylic core shared by azaphilones.	0
Title: The BBA33 lipoprotein binds collagen and impacts Borrelia burgdorferi pathogenesis Abstract: Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, adapts to the mammalian hosts by differentially expressing several genes in the BosR and Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS dependent pathways, resulting in a distinct protein profile relative to that seen for survival in the Ixodes spp. tick. Previous studies indicate that a putative lipoprotein, BBA33, is produced in an RpoS-dependent manner under conditions that mimic the mammalian component of the borrelial lifecycle. However, the significance and function for BBA33 is not known. Given its linkage to the BosR/Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS regulatory cascade, we hypothesized that BBA33 facilitates B. burgdorferi infection in the mammalian host. The deletion of bba33 eliminated B. burgdorferi infectivity in C3H mice, which was rescued by genetic complementation with intact bba33. With regard to function, a combinatorial peptide approach, coupled with subsequent in vitro binding assays, indicated that BBA33 binds to collagen type VI and, to a lesser extent, collagen type IV. Whole cell binding assays demonstrated BBA33-dependent binding to human collagen type VI. Taken together, these results suggest that BBA33 interacts with collagenous structures and may function as an adhesin in a process that is required to prevent bacterial clearance.	0
Title: Identification of the Anti-Infective Aborycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Deep-Sea-Derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO ZS0098 Enables Production in a Heterologous Host Abstract: Aborycin is a ribosomally synthesized member of the type I lasso peptide natural products. In the present study, aborycin was isolated and identified from the deep-sea-derived microbe Streptomyces sp. SCSIO ZS0098. The aborycin biosynthetic gene cluster (abo) was identified on the basis of genome sequence analyses and then heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 to effectively produce aborycin. Aborycin generated in this fashion exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against 13 Staphylococcus aureus strains from various sources with minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs = 8.0~128 µg/mL, against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 with an MIC = 8.0 µg/mL, and against Bacillus thuringiensis with MIC = 2.0 µg/mL. Additionally, aborycin displayed potent antibacterial activity (MIC = 0.5 µg/mL) against the poultry pathogen Enterococcus gallinarum 5F52C. The reported abo cluster clearly has the potential to provide a means of expanding the repertoire of anti-infective type I lasso peptides.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a bacterial iterative type I polyketide synthase gene encoding the 6-methylsalicyclic acid synthase Abstract: Unusual polyketide synthases (PKSs), that are structurally type I but act in an iterative manner for aromatic polyketide biosynthesis, are a new family found in bacteria. Here we report the cloning of the iterative type I PKS gene chlB1 from the chlorothricin (CHL) producer Streptomyces antibioticus DSM 40725 by a rapid PCR approach, and characterization of the function of the gene product as a 6-methylsalicyclic acid synthase (6-MSAS). Sequence analysis of various iterative type I PKSs suggests that the resulting aromatic or aliphatic structure of the products might be intrinsically determined by a catalytic feature of the paired KR-DH domains in the control of the double bond geometry. The finding of ChlB1 as a 6-MSAS not only enriches the current knowledge of aromatic polyketide biosynthesis in bacteria, but will also contribute to the generation of novel polyketide analogs via combinatorial biosynthesis with engineered PKSs.	1
Title: Genome mining expands the chemical diversity of the cyanobactin family to include highly modified linear peptides Abstract: Ribosomal peptides are produced through the posttranslational modification of short precursor peptides. Cyanobactins are a growing family of cyclic ribosomal peptides produced by cyanobacteria. However, a broad systematic survey of the genetic capacity to produce cyanobactins is lacking. Here we report the identification of 31 cyanobactin gene clusters from 126 genomes of cyanobacteria. Genome mining suggested a complex evolutionary history defined by horizontal gene transfer and rapid diversification of precursor genes. Extensive chemical analyses demonstrated that some cyanobacteria produce short linear cyanobactins with a chain length ranging from three to five amino acids. The linear peptides were N-prenylated and O-methylated on the N and C termini, respectively, and named aeruginosamide and viridisamide. These findings broaden the structural diversity of the cyanobactin family to include highly modified linear peptides with rare posttranslational modifications.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the anti-parasitic agent megalomicin: transformation of erythromycin to megalomicin in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Megalomicin is a therapeutically diverse compound which possesses antiparasitic, antiviral and antibacterial properties. It is produced by Micromonospora megalomicea and differs from the well-known macrolide antibiotic erythromycin by the addition of a unique deoxyamino sugar, megosamine, to the C-6 hydroxyl. We have cloned and sequenced a 48 kb segment of the megalomicin (meg) biosynthetic gene cluster which contains the modular polyketide synthase (PKS) and the complete pathway for megosamine biosynthesis. The similarities and distinctions between the related megalomicin and erythromycin gene clusters are discussed. Heterologous expression of the megalomicin PKS in Streptomyces lividans led to production of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the same macrolactone intermediate for erythromycin. A 12 kb fragment harbouring the putative megosamine pathway was expressed in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, resulting in the conversion of erythromycin to megalomicin. Considering the extensive knowledge surrounding the genetic engineering of the erythromycin PKS and the familiarity with genetic manipulation and fermentation of S. erythraea, the ability to produce megalomicin in this strain should allow the engineering of novel megalomicin analogues with potentially improved therapeutic activities.	1
Title: Organization of the teicoplanin gene cluster in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus Abstract: The glycopeptide teicoplanin is used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. The tcp gene cluster, devoted to teicoplanin biosynthesis in the actinomycete Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, was isolated and characterized. From sequence analysis, the tcp cluster spans approximately 73 kb and includes 39 ORFs participating in teicoplanin biosynthesis, regulation, resistance and export. Of these, 34 ORFs find a match in at least one of the five glycopeptide gene clusters previously characterized. Putative roles could be assigned for most of the tcp genes. The two glycosyltransferases responsible for attaching amino sugars to amino acids 4 and 6 of the teicoplanin aglycon were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. They both recognize N-acetylglucosamine as the substrate. tGtfA can add a sugar residue in the presence or absence of N-acetylglucosamine at amino acid 4, while tGtfB can only glycosylate the teicoplanin aglycon.	1
Title: Saccharochelins A-H, Cytotoxic Amphiphilic Siderophores from the Rare Marine Actinomycete Saccharothrix sp. D09 Abstract: Siderophores are secreted by microorganisms to survive in iron-depleted conditions, and they also possess tremendous therapeutic potential. Genomic-inspired isolation facilitated the identification of eight amphiphilic siderophores, saccharochelins A-H (1-8), from a rare marine-derived Saccharothrix species. Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 μM. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.	1
Title: Unveiling the Biosynthetic Pathway of the Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptide Ustiloxin B in Filamentous Fungi Abstract: The biosynthetic machinery of the first fungal ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) ustiloxin B was elucidated through a series of gene inactivation and heterologous expression studies. The results confirmed an essential requirement for novel oxidases possessing the DUF3328 motif for macrocyclization, and highly unique side-chain modifications by three oxidases (UstCF1F2) and a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme (UstD). These findings provide new insight into the expression of the RiPP gene clusters found in various fungi.	1
Title: Rapamycin-mediated G1 arrest involves regulation of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The rapamycin-sensitive (TOR) signalling pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls growth and cell proliferation in response to nutrient availability. Rapamycin treatment causes cells to arrest growth in G1 phase. The mechanism by which the inhibition of the TOR pathway regulates cell cycle progression is not completely understood. Here we show that rapamycin causes G1 arrest by a dual mechanism that comprises downregulation of the G1-cyclins Cln1-3 and upregulation of the Cdk inhibitor protein Sic1. The increase of Sic1 level is mostly independent of the downregulation of the G1 cyclins, being unaffected by ectopic CLN2 expression, but requires Sic1 phosphorylation of Thr173, because it is lost in cells expressing Sic1(T173A). Rapamycin-mediated Sic1 upregulation involves nuclear accumulation of a more stable, non-ubiquitinated protein. Either SIC1 deletion or CLN3 overexpression results in non-cell-cycle-specific arrest upon rapamycin treatment and makes cells sensitive to a sublethal dose of rapamycin and to nutrient starvation. In conclusion, our data indicate that Sic1 is involved in rapamycin-induced G1 arrest and that deregulated entrance into S phase severely decreases the ability of a cell to cope with starvation conditions induced by nutrient depletion or which are mimicked by rapamycin treatment.	0
Title: Actinorhodin biosynthesis: structural requirements for post-PKS tailoring intermediates revealed by functional analysis of ActVI-ORF1 reductase Abstract: Actinorhodin (ACT) produced by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic, whose basic carbon skeleton is derived from type II polyketide synthase (PKS). Although an acyl carrier protein (ACP) serves as an anchor of nascent intermediates during chain elongation in the type II PKS complex, it generally remains unknown when an ACP-free intermediate is released from the complex to post-PKS modification ("tailoring") steps. In ACT biosynthesis, a stereospecific ketoreductase (RED1) encoded by actVI-ORF1 reduces the 3beta-keto group of a proposed bicyclic intermediate to an (S) secondary alcohol. The bicyclic intermediate is formed from the steps of PKS and its closely associated enzymes and lies at the interface toward ACT-tailoring steps. To clarify whether RED1 recognizes the ACP-bound bicyclic intermediate or the ACP-free bicyclic intermediate, recombinant RED1 was purified for enzymatic characterization. RED1 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni-chelate and gel filtration column chromatographies to homogeneity in soluble form. Enzymatic studies in vitro on RED1 with synthetic analogues, in place of an unstable bicyclic intermediate, showed that RED1 recognizes 3-oxo-4-naphthylbutyric acid (ONBA) as a preferred substrate and not its N-acetylcysteamine thioester. This strongly suggests that RED1 recognizes ACP-free bicyclic beta-keto acid as the first committed intermediate of tailoring steps. Kinetic studies of RED1 showed high affinity with ONBA, consistent with the requirement for an efficient reduction of a labile beta-keto carboxylic acid. Interestingly, the methyl ester of ONBA acted as a competitive inhibitor of RED1, indicating the presence of strict substrate recognition toward the terminal acid functionality.	1
Title: Tracking down the molecular architecture of the synaptonemal complex by expansion microscopy Abstract: The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific nuclear multiprotein complex that is essential for proper synapsis, recombination and segregation of homologous chromosomes. We combined structured illumination microscopy (SIM) with different expansion microscopy (ExM) protocols including U-ExM, proExM, and magnified analysis of the proteome (MAP) to investigate the molecular organization of the SC. Comparison with structural data obtained by single-molecule localization microscopy of unexpanded SCs allowed us to investigate ultrastructure preservation of expanded SCs. For image analysis, we developed an automatic image processing software that enabled unbiased comparison of structural properties pre- and post-expansion. Here, MAP-SIM provided the best results and enabled reliable three-color super-resolution microscopy of the SCs of a whole set of chromosomes in a spermatocyte with 20-30 nm spatial resolution. Our data demonstrate that post-expansion labeling by MAP-SIM improves immunolabeling efficiency and allowed us thus to unravel previously hidden details of the molecular organization of SCs.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Guanitoxin Enables Global Environmental Detection in Freshwater Cyanobacteria Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cyanoHABs) cause recurrent toxic events in global watersheds. Although public health agencies monitor the causal toxins of most cyanoHABs and scientists in the field continue developing precise detection and prediction tools, the potent anticholinesterase neurotoxin, guanitoxin, is not presently environmentally monitored. This is largely due to its incompatibility with widely employed analytical methods and instability in the environment, despite guanitoxin being among the most lethal cyanotoxins. Here, we describe the guanitoxin biosynthesis gene cluster and its rigorously characterized nine-step metabolic pathway from l-arginine in the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024. Through environmental sequencing data sets, guanitoxin (gnt) biosynthetic genes are repeatedly detected and expressed in municipal freshwater bodies that have undergone past toxic events. Knowledge of the genetic basis of guanitoxin biosynthesis now allows for environmental, biosynthetic gene monitoring to establish the global scope of this neurotoxic organophosphate.	1
Title: A mass spectrometry-guided genome mining approach for natural product peptidogenomics Abstract: Peptide natural products show broad biological properties and are commonly produced by orthogonal ribosomal and nonribosomal pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To harvest this large and diverse resource of bioactive molecules, we introduce here natural product peptidogenomics (NPP), a new MS-guided genome-mining method that connects the chemotypes of peptide natural products to their biosynthetic gene clusters by iteratively matching de novo tandem MS (MS(n)) structures to genomics-based structures following biosynthetic logic. In this study, we show that NPP enabled the rapid characterization of over ten chemically diverse ribosomal and nonribosomal peptide natural products of previously unidentified composition from Streptomycete bacteria as a proof of concept to begin automating the genome-mining process. We show the identification of lantipeptides, lasso peptides, linardins, formylated peptides and lipopeptides, many of which are from well-characterized model Streptomycetes, highlighting the power of NPP in the discovery of new peptide natural products from even intensely studied organisms.	1
Title: Nonlinear biosynthetic gene cluster dose effect on penicillin production by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Industrial penicillin production levels by the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum increased dramatically by classical strain improvement. High-yielding strains contain multiple copies of the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes three key enzymes of the β-lactam biosynthetic pathway. We have analyzed the gene cluster dose effect on penicillin production using the high-yielding P. chrysogenum strain DS17690 that was cured from its native clusters. The amount of penicillin V produced increased with the penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster number but was saturated at high copy numbers. Likewise, transcript levels of the biosynthetic genes pcbAB [δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase], pcbC (isopenicillin N synthase), and penDE (acyltransferase) correlated with the cluster copy number. Remarkably, the protein level of acyltransferase, which localizes to peroxisomes, was saturated already at low cluster copy numbers. At higher copy numbers, intracellular levels of isopenicillin N increased, suggesting that the acyltransferase reaction presents a limiting step at a high gene dose. Since the number and appearance of the peroxisomes did not change significantly with the gene cluster copy number, we conclude that the acyltransferase activity is limiting for penicillin biosynthesis at high biosynthetic gene cluster copy numbers. These results suggest that at a high penicillin production level, productivity is limited by the peroxisomal acyltransferase import activity and/or the availability of coenzyme A (CoA)-activated side chains.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of new Δ-17 fatty acid desaturases Abstract: ω-3 fatty acid desaturase is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids via the oxidative desaturase/elongase pathways. Here we report the identification of three ω-3 desaturases from oomycetes, Pythium aphanidermatum, Phytophthora sojae, and Phytophthora ramorum. These new ω-3 desaturases share 55 % identity at the amino acid level with the known Δ-17 desaturase of Saprolegnia diclina, and about 31 % identity with the bifunctional Δ-12/Δ-15 desaturase of Fusarium monoliforme. The three enzymes were expressed in either wild-type or codon optimized form in an engineered arachidonic acid producing strain of Yarrowia lipolytica to study their activity and substrate specificity. All three were able to convert the ω-6 arachidonic acid to the ω-3 eicosapentanoic acid, with a substrate conversion efficiency of 54-65 %. These enzymes have a broad ω-6 fatty acid substrate spectrum, including both C18 and C20 ω-6 fatty acids although they prefer the C20 substrates, and have strong Δ-17 desaturase activity but weaker Δ-15 desaturase activity. Thus, they belong to the Δ-17 desaturase class. Unlike the previously identified bifunctional Δ-12/Δ-15 desaturase from F. monoliforme, they lack Δ-12 desaturase activity. The newly identified Δ-17 desaturases could use fatty acids in both acyl-CoA and phospholipid fraction as substrates. The identification of these Δ-17 desaturases provides a set of powerful new tools for genetic engineering of microbes and plants to produce ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid, at high levels.	0
Title: Enzymatic Thioamide Formation in a Bacterial Antimetabolite Pathway Abstract: 6-Thioguanine (6TG) is a DNA-targeting therapeutic used in the treatment of various cancers. While 6TG was rationally designed as a proof of concept for antimetabolite therapy, it is also a rare thioamide-bearing bacterial natural product and critical virulence factor of Erwinia amylovorans, plant pathogens that cause fire blight. Through gene expression, biochemical assays, and mutational analyses, we identified a specialized bipartite enzyme system, consisting of an ATP-dependent sulfur transferase (YcfA) and a sulfur-mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), that is responsible for the peculiar oxygen-by-sulfur substitution found in the biosynthesis of 6TG. Mechanistic and phylogenetic studies revealed that YcfA-mediated 6TG biosynthesis evolved from ancient tRNA modifications that support translational fidelity. The successful in vitro reconstitution of 6TG thioamidation showed that YcfA employs a specialized sulfur shuttle that markedly differs from universal RNA-related systems. This study sheds light on underexplored enzymatic C-S bond formation in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of the aurantimycin biosynthetic gene cluster and enhancing its production by manipulating two pathway-specific activators in Streptomyces aurantiacus JA 4570 Abstract: Background:                       Aurantimycin (ATM), produced by Streptomyces aurantiacus JA 4570, is a potent antimicrobial and antitumor antibiotic. Although the chemical structure of ATM is highly distinctive and features a cyclohexadepsipeptide scaffold attached with a C14 acyl side chain, little is known about its biosynthetic pathway and regulatory mechanism.                  Results:                       In this work, we report the identification and characterization of the ATM biosynthetic gene cluster from S. aurantiacus JA 4570. Targeted inactivation of artG, coding for a NRPS enzyme, completely abolished ATM production, thereof demonstrating the target gene cluster (art) is responsible for ATM biosynthesis. Moreover, four NRPS adenylation (A) domains including a freestanding enzyme ArtC have been characterized in vitro, whose substrate specificities are consistent with in silico analysis. Further genetic analysis of the two regulatory genes artB and artX unambiguously suggested both of them play positive roles in ATM biosynthesis, and ATM-A production was thus rationally enhanced to about 2.5 fold via tandem overexpression of artB and artX in S. aurantiacus JA 4570.                  Conclusions:                       These results will provide the basis for the understanding of precise mechanisms for ATM biosynthesis, and open the way for both rational construction of high-production ATM producer and orient-directed generation of designer ATM derivatives via synthetic biology strategies.	1
Title: Characterization of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Benzoxazole Antibiotics A33853 Reveals Unusual Assembly Logic Abstract: A33853, which shows excellent bioactivity against Leishmania, is a benzoxazole-family compound formed from two moieties of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and one 3-hydroxypicolinic acid. In this study, we have identified the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of A33853 in Streptomyces sp. NRRL12068 through genome mining and heterologous expression. Bioinformatics analysis and functional characterization of the orfs contained in the gene cluster revealed that the biosynthesis of A33853 is directed by a group of unusual enzymes. In particular, BomK, annotated as a ketosynthase, was found to catalyze the amide bond formation between 3-hydroxypicolinic and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid during the assembly of A33853. BomJ, a putative ATP-dependent coenzyme A ligase, and BomN, a putative amidohydrolase, were further proposed to be involved in the benzoxazole formation in A33853 according to gene deletion experiments. Finally, we have successfully utilized mutasynthesis to generate two analogs of A33853, which were reported previously to possess excellent anti-leishmanial activity.	1
Title: Differences in the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases involved in landomycins A and E biosynthesis Abstract: A lanGT4 mutant of the landomycin A producer Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 was constructed, leading to the production of landomycin D with two deoxy sugars in the side chain and proving that LanGT4 is responsible for attaching the third deoxy sugar of the hexasaccharide side chain. Heterologous expression of lndGT4 of the landomycin E producer Streptomyces globisporus 1912 in the lanGT4 mutant restored landomycin A production, indicating that LndGT4, like LanGT4, also has the ability to work iteratively. A S. cyanogenus S136 mutant with a mutation in lanGT1, encoding a D: -olivosyltransferase, was shown to produce landomycin I with one deoxy sugar and, surprisingly, a new landomycin derivative (landomycin L) containing a D: -olivose followed by an L: -rhodinose. Heterologous expression of lndGT1 of S. globisporus 1912 in the lanGT1 mutant did not restore landomycin A production but led to the formation of a second new landomycin derivative (landomycin K) containing an unusual pentasaccharide chain (D: -olivose-D: -olivose-L: -rhodinose-D: -olivose-L: -rhodinose). The formation of landomycin L and landomycin K is most probably attributed to the high substrate flexibility of the rhodinosyltransferase LanGT4.	1
Title: A gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of vanchrobactin, a chromosome-encoded siderophore produced by Vibrio anguillarum Abstract: Vibrio anguillarum serotype O2 strains produce a catechol siderophore named vanchrobactin, which has been identified as N-[N'-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-arginyl]-serine. This work describes a chromosomal region that harbours the genetic determinants necessary for the biosynthesis of vanchrobactin. The authors have identified the genes involved in 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) biosynthesis (vabA, vabB and vabC) and activation (vabE), and a gene (vabF) encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, which is putatively involved in the assembly of the siderophore components. Also described are the identification and characterization of genes encoding a putative vanchrobactin exporter (vabS) and a siderophore esterase (vabH). In-frame deletion mutants in vabA, vabB, vabC, vabE, vabF and vabH were impaired for growth under conditions of iron limitation, and the analysis of culture supernatants by chrome azurol-S and cross-feeding assays showed almost no production of siderophores in any of the vabABCEF mutants. In addition, deletion mutations of vabA, vabB and vabC abolished production of DHBA, as assessed by chemical and biological analyses. Complementation of each mutant with the corresponding gene provided in trans confirmed the involvement of this gene cluster in the biosynthesis of DHBA and vanchrobactin in V. anguillarum strain RV22. Based on chemical and genetic data, and on published models for other catechol siderophores, a model for vanchrobactin biosynthesis is proposed.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of the lantibiotic salivaricin A and its structural gene salA from Streptococcus salivarius 20P3 Abstract: A bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance, salivaricin A, was purified from cultures of Streptococcus salivarius 20P3 and was shown by ion spray mass spectrometry to have a molecular mass of 2,315 +/- 1.1 Da. Amino acid composition analysis demonstrated the presence of lanthionine, indicating that salivaricin A may be a member of the lantibiotic class of antibiotic substances. The sequence of eight amino acids at the N terminus of the molecule was determined by Edman degradation, and mixed oligonucleotide probes based on part of this sequence (GSGWIA) were used to detect the salivaricin A structural gene. A 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment of chromosomal DNA from strain 20P3 that hybridized with the probes was cloned, and the hybridizing region was further localized to a 379-bp DraI-AluI fragment. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment indicated that salivaricin A is synthesized as a 51-amino-acid prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified and cleaved to give a biologically active 22-residue peptide containing one lanthionine and two beta-methyllanthionine residues. The secondary structure of presalivaricin A was predicted to be similar to that of type A lantibiotics, with a hydrophilic alpha-helical leader sequence and a propeptide region with potential for beta-turn formation and a lack of alpha-helicity. The sequence around the cleavage site of presalivaricin A differed from that of other type A lantibiotics but was similar to that of several bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.	1
Title: Synthesis of Bridged Cyclopentane Derivatives by Catalytic Decarbonylative Cycloaddition of Cyclobutanones and Olefins Abstract: Herein, we report an intramolecular rhodium-catalyzed decarbonylative coupling between cyclobutanones and alkenes that proceeds by C-C activation and provides a distinct approach to a diverse range of saturated bridged cyclopentane derivatives. In this reaction, cyclobutanones serve as cyclopropane surrogates, reacting in a formal (4+2-1) transformation. To demonstrate the efficacy of this method, it was applied in a concise synthesis of the antifungal drug Tolciclate.	0
Title: Bartolosides E-K from a Marine Coccoid Cyanobacterium Abstract: The glycosylated and halogenated dialkylresorcinol (DAR) compounds bartolosides A-D (1-4) were recently discovered from marine cyanobacteria and represent a novel family of glycolipids, encoded by the brt biosynthetic gene cluster. Here, we report the isolation and NMR- and MS-based structure elucidation of monoglycosylated bartolosides E-K (5-11), obtained from Synechocystis salina LEGE 06099, a strain closely related to the cyanobacterium that produces the diglycosylated 2-4. In addition, a genome region containing orthologues of brt genes was identified in this cyanobacterium. Interestingly, the major bartoloside in S. salina LEGE 06099 was 1 (above 0.5% dry wt), originally isolated from the phylogenetically distant filamentous cyanobacterium Nodosilinea sp. LEGE 06102. Compounds 5-11 are analogues of 1, with different alkyl chain lengths or halogenation patterns. Their structures and the organization of the brt genes suggest that the DAR-forming ketosynthase BrtD can generate structural diversity by accepting fatty acyl-derived substrates of varying length. Compound 9 features a rare midchain gem-dichloro moiety, indicating that the putative halogenase BrtJ is able to act twice on the same midchain carbon.	1
Title: DNA sequence of human chromosome 17 and analysis of rearrangement in the human lineage Abstract: Chromosome 17 is unusual among the human chromosomes in many respects. It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome, mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome. It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes. Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution, the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.	0
Title: The adenovirus-mediated transfer of PTEN inhibits the growth of esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo Abstract: The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome, including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that compared to control cells, overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression. Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo. Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer.	0
Title: Detection of antitumor and antimicrobial activities in marine organism associated actinomycetes isolated from the Taiwan Strait, China Abstract: The purpose of this work was to screen the actinomycetes having antitumor or antimicrobial activity, which were isolated from the surface, epidermis and intestines of sea plants and animals collected from the Taiwan Strait, China. Antitumor activity was studied by the MTT assay and DNA target activity was studied by the biochemical induction assay while antimicrobial activity was determined by observing bacterial and fungal growth inhibition. 20. 6% of marine actinomycete cultures displayed cytotoxic activity on P388 cells at dilutions at and below 1:320 and 18.6% on KB cells. 2. 96% of marine actinomycete cultures displayed inducing activity. Among all marine actinomycetes isolated, the genus Micromonospora has the highest positive rate of inducing activity. However, most antimicrobial activity was found in the genus Streptomyces. These results indicate that marine organism associated actinomycetes could be a promising source for antitumor and antimicrobial bioactive agents.	0
Title: Molecular characterization of vulnibactin biosynthesis in Vibrio vulnificus indicates the existence of an alternative siderophore Abstract: Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic estuarine bacterium that causes fatal septicemia and necrotizing wound infections in humans. Virulent V. vulnificus isolates produce a catechol siderophore called vulnibactin, made up of one residue of 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 3-DHBA) and two residues of salicylic acid (SA). Vulnibactin biosynthetic genes (VV2_0828 to VV2_0844) are clustered at one locus of chromosome 2, expression of which is significantly up-regulated in vivo. In the present study, we decipher the biosynthetic network of vulnibactin, focusing specifically on genes around SA and 2, 3-DHBA biosynthetic steps. Deletion mutant of isochorismate pyruvate lyase (VV2_0839) or 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoate-2, 3-dehydrogenase (VV2_0834) showed retarded growth under iron-limited conditions though the latter showed more significant growth defect than the former, suggesting a dominant role of 2, 3-DHBA in the vulnibactin biosynthesis. A double deletion mutant of VV2_0839 and VV2_0834 manifested additional growth defect under iron limitation. Though the growth defect of respective single deletion mutants could be restored by exogenous SA or 2, 3-DHBA, only 2, 3-DHBA could rescue the double mutant when supplied alone. However, double mutant could be rescued with SA only when hydrogen peroxide was supplied exogenously, suggesting a chemical conversion of SA to 2, 3-DHBA. Assembly of two SA and one 2, 3-DHBA into vulnibactin was mediated by two AMP ligase genes (VV2_0836 and VV2_0840). VV2_0836 deletion mutant showed more significant growth defect under iron limitation, suggesting its dominant function. In conclusion, using molecular genetic analytical tools, we confirm that vulnibactin is assembled of both 2, 3-DHBA and SA. However, conversion of SA to 2, 3-DHBA in presence of hydrogen peroxide and growth profile of AMP ligase mutants suggest a plausible existence of yet unidentified alternative siderophore that may be composed solely of 2, 3-DHBA.	1
Title: Protein synthesis by intact Coxiella burnetii cells Abstract: Coxiella burnetii was isolated from persistently infected fibroblast host cells by a rapid mechanical lysis technique. Macromolecular synthesis was initiated in these otherwise dormant cells by incubation at pH 4.5. The synthesis of protein proceeded for as long as 24 h. Initiation of protein synthesis in C. burnetii was dependent upon RNA synthesis. Approximately 24 species of polypeptides were synthesized, and some of these appeared to be major synthetic products. Increases in protein biomass of 15 to 30% were calculated to occur during incubation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis affected protein synthesis after 12 h of incubation. The results suggest that although these parasitic bacteria did not grow in the axenic media devised, significant biosynthetic processes occurred.	0
Title: Differential Survivability of Two Genetically Similar Salmonella Thompson Strains on Pre-harvest Sweet Basil ( Ocimum basilicum) Leaves Abstract: Although conventionally considered an animal pathogen, recent evidence increasingly suggests that fresh produce may act as significant transmission vehicles and alternative hosts to Salmonella. This study reports the differential survivability of two genetically similar Salmonella Thompson strains (ST 889B and ST 688C) on the adaxial surface of pre-harvest basil (Ocimum basilicum) leaves. Upon inoculation, two distinct phenomena, a dried water-print or a macroscopic lesion, were observed within 24 h. ST 889B survived better than ST 688C on healthy-looking leaves without lesions, possibly due to its higher biofilm-forming ability. Both strains survived better on the leaves with lesions than on the healthy-looking leaves (ST 688C: 4.39 ± 0.68 vs. 2.18 ± 0.29; ST 889B: 4.78 ± 0.12 vs. 2.83 ± 0.18 log CFU per sample at 6 days post-inoculation). ST 889B caused the formation of lesions at a higher frequency [70/117 leaves (59.8%)] than ST 688C [35/96 leaves (36.5%)]. Thus, we highlighted two distinct Salmonella survival strategies in the basil pathosystem and demonstrated gene expression polymorphism (variations in the expression of the same set of genes) as an indispensable strategy in the colonization of plants as hosts by the human pathogens.	0
Title: Two of a Kind--The Biosynthetic Pathways of Chlorotonil and Anthracimycin Abstract: Chlorotonil A is a novel polyketide isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce1525 that features a unique gem-dichloro-1,3-dione moiety. It exhibits potent bioactivity, most notably against the problematic malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum in the nanomolar range. In addition, strong antibacterial and moderate antifungal activity were determined. The outstanding biological activity of chlorotonil A as well as its unusual chemical structure triggered our interest in elucidating its biosynthesis, a prerequisite for alteration of the scaffold by synthetic biology approaches. This endeavor was facilitated by a recent report describing the strikingly similar structure of anthracimycin from a marine streptomycete, a compound of considerable interest due to its potent antibacterial activity. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the chlorotonil A biosynthetic gene cluster from So ce1525 and compare it with that for anthracimycin biosynthesis. Access to both gene clusters allowed us to highlight commonalities between the two pathways and revealed striking differences, some of which can plausibly explain the structural differences observed between these intriguing natural products.	1
Title: Enzymology of aminoglycoside biosynthesis-deduction from gene clusters Abstract: The classical aminoglycosides are, with very few exceptions, typically actinobacterial secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities all mediated by inhibiting translation on the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Some chemically related natural products inhibit glucosidases by mimicking oligo-alpha-1,4-glucosides. The biochemistry of the aminoglycoside biosynthetic pathways is still a developing field since none of the pathways has been analyzed to completeness as yet. In this chapter we treat the enzymology of aminoglycoside biosyntheses as far as it becomes apparent from recent investigations based on the availability of DNA sequence data of biosynthetic gene clusters for all major structural classes of these bacterial metabolites. We give a more general overview of the field, including descriptions of some key enzymes in various aminoglycoside pathways, whereas in Chapter 20 provides a detailed account of the better-studied enzymology thus far known for the neomycin and butirosin pathways.	1
Title: Hypoxia enhances stimulus-dependent induction of E-selectin on aortic endothelial cells Abstract: In many diseases, tissue hypoxia occurs in conjunction with other inflammatory processes. Since previous studies have demonstrated a role for leukocytes in ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that endothelial hypoxia may "superinduce" expression of an important leukocyte adhesion molecule, E-selectin (ELAM-1, CD62E). Bovine aortic endothelial monolayers were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell surface E-selectin was quantitated by whole cell ELISA or by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-E-selectin sera. Endothelial mRNA levels were assessed using ribonuclease protection assays. Hypoxia alone did not induce endothelial E-selectin expression. However, enhanced induction of E-selectin was observed with the combination of hypoxia and TNF-alpha (270% increase over normoxia and TNF-alpha) or hypoxia and LPS (190% increase over normoxia and LPS). These studies revealed that a mechanism for such enhancement may be hypoxia-elicited decrements in endothelial intracellular levels of cAMP (<50% compared with normoxia). Addition of forskolin and isobutyl-methyl-xanthine during hypoxia resulted in reversal of cAMP decreases and a loss of enhanced E-selectin surface expression with the combination of TNF-alpha and hypoxia. We conclude that endothelial hypoxia may provide a novel signal for superinduction of E-selectin during states of inflammation.	0
Title: Studies of aluminum reinsertion into borosilicate zeolites with intersecting channels of 10- and 12-ring channel systems Abstract: The work here describes the kinetic analyses of aluminum replacement for boron in a suite of borosilicate molecular sieves. While the method has been described before as a means of converting synthesized borosilicates (with weak inherent acidity) to aluminosilicates (with much stronger acid strength) when there are large pores in the structure, here we carry out the transformation under less than optimal replacement concentrations, in order to better follow the kinetics. We examined several zeolite structures with boundary conditions of boron MEL where there are only 10-ring (or intermediate) pore structures and no Al is taken up, to multidimensional large pore zeolites, like boron beta, where Al substitution can occur everywhere. We also studied materials with both intermediate and large pores, SSZ-56, 57, 70, and 82. In the case of 57 up to 90% of the structure is made up of boron MEL. We observe that the pH drop is proportional to the Al reinsertion and is the same for all zeolites we studied. In one case, we compared a zeolite (SSZ-24) with boron and then no boron sites and found that Al does not go into defect sites. It was again confirmed (shown in earlier work) that Al will go into nest sites created by boron hydrolysis out of the substrate before Al treatment. Along those lines we also made two new observations: (1) the profile for Al uptake, as followed by pH drop, is the same kinetically, whether the boron is there or not; and (2) NMR showed that the boron is leaving the structure faster than Al can go back in (SSZ-33 study), even when we treat a material with boron in the lattice.	0
Title: Cytotoxic oleanane-type saponins from Albizia inundata Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of a CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH extract of the aerial parts of Albizia inundata resulted in the isolation of two new natural oleanane-type triterpene saponins {3-O-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (1) and 3-O-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl acacic acid lactone (2)} along with seven known saponins {3-O-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl echinocystic acid (3), 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl (l→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(l→6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl acacic acid lactone (concinnoside D) (4), 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(l→2)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (5), 3-O-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(l→6)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (6), 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl(1→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(l→6)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (7), 3-O-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl(l→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→6)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(l→2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside echinocystic acid (8), and 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl(l→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl(1→6)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(l→2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside echinocystic acid (9)}. The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of extensive 2D NMR ((1)H-(1)H COSY or DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, TOCSY, and HSQC-TOCSY) spectroscopic, ESIMS, and chemical methods. Saponins 1, 3, 6, and 7 showed cytotoxicity against human head and neck squamous cells (JMAR, MDA1986) and melanoma cells (B16F10, SKMEL28) with IC(50) values in the range 1.8-12.4 μM, using the MTS assay.	0
Title: Genome Mining and Heterologous Expression Reveal Two Distinct Families of Lasso Peptides Highly Conserved in Endofungal Bacteria Abstract: Genome mining identified the fungal-bacterial endosymbiosis Rhizopus microsporus-Mycetohabitans (previously Burkholderia) rhizoxinica as a rich source of novel natural products. However, most of the predicted compounds have remained cryptic. In this study, we employed heterologous expression to isolate and characterize three ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides with lariat topology (lasso peptides) from the endosymbiont M. rhizoxinica: burhizin-23, mycetohabin-16, and mycetohabin-15. Through coexpression experiments, it was shown that an orphan gene product results in mature mycetohabin-15, albeit encoded remotely from the core biosynthetic gene cluster. Comparative genomics revealed that mycetohabins are highly conserved among M. rhizoxinica and related endosymbiotic bacteria. Gene knockout and reinfection experiments indicated that the lasso peptides are not crucial for establishing symbiosis; instead, the peptides are exported into the environment during endosymbiosis. This is the first report on lasso peptides from endosymbiotic bacteria.	1
Title: CGP 9000: a new orally active, broad-spectrum cephalosporin Abstract: CGP 9000, (7-[D-2-amino-2-(1,4-cyclohexadienyl)-acetamido]-3-methoxy-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid), is a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. Its antibacterial activity in vitro (MIC) is similar, but its bactericidal efficacy superior to that of cephalexin and cephradine. Upon oral administration to mice infected with various bacteria, CGP 9000 is, in general, 2 to 7 times more effective than either cephalexin or cephradine.	0
Title: Characterization of the tautomycetin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces griseochromogenes provides new insight into dialkylmaleic anhydride biosynthesis Abstract: Tautomycetin (TTN) is a highly potent and specific protein phosphatase inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes. The biological activity of TTN makes it an important lead for drug discovery, whereas its rare dialkylmaleic anhydride moiety and structural similarity to tautomycin (TTM), another potent phosphatase inhibitor with tremendous medicinal potential, draws attention to novel biosynthetic chemistries responsible for its production. To elucidate the biosynthetic machinery associated with TTN production, the ttn biosynthetic gene cluster from S. griseochromogenes was isolated and characterized, and its involvement in TTN biosynthesis confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation experiments. The ttn cluster was localized to a 79 kb DNA region, consisting of 19 open reading frames that encode two modular type I polyketide synthases (TtnAB), one type II thioesterase (TtnH), eight proteins for dialkylmaleic anhydride biosynthesis (TtnKLMNOPRS), four tailoring enzymes (TtnCDFI), two regulatory proteins (TtnGQ), and one resistance protein (TtnJ). A model for TTN biosynthesis is proposed on the basis of functional assignments from sequence analysis, which agrees well with previous feeding experiments, has been supported by in vivo gene inactivation experiments, and is supported by analogy to the recently reported ttm cluster. These findings set the stage to fully investigate TTN biosynthesis and to biosynthetically engineer new TTN analogues.	1
Title: A ketosynthase homolog uses malonyl units to form esters in cervimycin biosynthesis Abstract: Ketosynthases produce the carbon backbones of a vast number of biologically active polyketides by catalyzing Claisen condensations of activated acyl and malonyl building blocks. Here we report that a ketosynthase homolog from Streptomyces tendae, CerJ, unexpectedly forms malonyl esters during the biosynthesis of cervimycin, a glycoside antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Deletion of cerJ yielded a substantially more active cervimycin variant lacking the malonyl side chain, and in vitro biotransformations revealed that CerJ is capable of transferring malonyl, methylmalonyl and dimethylmalonyl units onto the glycoside. According to phylogenetic analyses and elucidation of the crystal structure, CerJ is functionally and structurally positioned between the ketosynthase catalyzing Claisen condensations and acyl-ACP shuttles, and it features a noncanonical catalytic triad. Site-directed mutagenesis and structures of CerJ in complex with substrates not only allowed us to establish a model for the reaction mechanism but also provided insights into the evolution of this important subclass of the thiolase superfamily.	1
Title: Discovery of Key Dioxygenases that Diverged the Paraherquonin and Acetoxydehydroaustin Pathways in Penicillium brasilianum Abstract: Paraherquonin (1), a fungal meroterpenoid produced by Penicillium brasilianum NBRC 6234, possesses a unique, highly congested hexacyclic molecular architecture. Here we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 (the prh cluster) and elucidated the pathway up to berkeleydione (2), which serves as the key intermediate for the biosynthesis of 1 as well as many other meroterpenoids. Interestingly, the nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase PrhA constructs the cycloheptadiene moiety to afford 2 from preaustinoid A1 (6), probably via the homoallyl-homoallyl radical rearrangement. Additionally, another fungal strain, P. brasilianum MG11, which produces acetoxydehydroaustin instead of 1, was found to have a gene cluster nearly identical to the prh cluster. The dioxygenase encoded by the cluster shares 92% sequence identity with PrhA, and also accepts 6 but produces preaustinoid A3 (17) with a spiro-lactone system, generating a diverging point for the two different meroterpenoid pathways in the same species.	1
Title: Enhanced Cytosolic Delivery and Release of CRISPR/Cas9 by Black Phosphorus Nanosheets for Genome Editing Abstract: A biodegradable two-dimensional (2D) delivery platform based on loading black phosphorus nanosheets (BPs) with Cas9 ribonucleoprotein engineered with three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) at C terminus (Cas9N3) is successfully established. The Cas9N3-BPs enter cells effectively via membrane penetration and endocytosis pathways, followed by a BPs biodegradation-associated endosomal escape and cytosolic releases of the loaded Cas9N3 complexes. The Cas9N3-BPs thus provide efficient genome editing and gene silencing in vitro and in vivo at a relatively low dose as compared with other nanoparticle-based delivery platforms. This biodegradable 2D delivery platform offers a versatile cytosolic delivery approach for CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and other bioactive macromolecules for biomedical applications.	0
Title: The highly modified microcin peptide plantazolicin is associated with nematicidal activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 has been shown to stimulate plant growth and to suppress the growth of plant pathogenic organisms including nematodes. However, the mechanism underlying its effect against nematodes remains unknown. In this study, we screened a random mutant library of B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 generated by the mariner transposon TnYLB-1 and identified a mutant strain F5 with attenuated nematicidal activity. Reversible polymerase chain reaction revealed that three candidate genes RAMB_007470, yhdY, and prkA that were disrupted by the transposon in strain F5 potentially contributed to its decreased nematicidal activity. Bioassay of mutants impaired in the three candidate genes demonstrated that directed deletion of gene RBAM_007470 resulted in loss of nematicidal activity comparable with that of the F5 triple mutant. RBAM_007470 has been reported as being involved in biosynthesis of plantazolicin, a thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin with hitherto unknown function. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) analyses of surface extracts revealed that plantazolicin bearing a molecular weight of 1,354 Da was present in wild-type B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, but absent in the ΔRABM_007470 mutant. Furthermore, bioassay of the organic extract containing plantazolicin also showed a moderate nematicidal activity. We conclude that a novel gene RBAM_007470 and its related metabolite are involved in the antagonistic effect exerted by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 against nematodes.	1
Title: Efficient Synthesis of Light-Triggered Circular Antisense Oligonucleotides Targeting Cellular Protein Expression Abstract: Light-activated ("caged") antisense oligonucleotides are powerful molecules for regulating gene expression at submicron spatial resolution through the focal modulation of endogenous cellular processes. Cyclized caged oligos are particularly promising structures because of their inherent stability and similarity to naturally occurring circular DNA and RNA molecules. Here, we introduce an efficient route for cyclizing an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide incorporating a photocleavable linker. Oligo cyclization was achieved for several sequences in nearly quantitative yields through intramolecular copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Caging stability and light activation were characterized by FRET efficiency, denaturing gel assay, and melting temperature measurements. Finally, a cyclized caged oligo was designed to target gfap, and it gave a tenfold reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein upon photoactivation in astrocytes.	0
Title: Synthetic biology based construction of biological activity-related library of fungal decalin-containing diterpenoid pyrones Abstract: A synthetic biology method based on heterologous biosynthesis coupled with genome mining is a promising approach for increasing the opportunities to rationally access natural product with novel structures and biological activities through total biosynthesis and combinatorial biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of the synthetic biology method to explore biological activity-related chemical space through the comprehensive heterologous biosynthesis of fungal decalin-containing diterpenoid pyrones (DDPs). Genome mining reveals putative DDP biosynthetic gene clusters distributed in five fungal genera. In addition, we design extended DDP pathways by combinatorial biosynthesis. In total, ten DDP pathways, including five native pathways, four extended pathways and one shunt pathway, are heterologously reconstituted in a genetically tractable heterologous host, Aspergillus oryzae, resulting in the production of 22 DDPs, including 15 new analogues. We also demonstrate the advantage of expanding the diversity of DDPs to probe various bioactive molecules through a wide range of biological evaluations.	1
Title: Structural basis of transfer between lipoproteins by cholesteryl ester transfer protein Abstract: Human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the net transfer of cholesteryl ester mass from atheroprotective high-density lipoproteins to atherogenic low-density lipoproteins by an unknown mechanism. Delineating this mechanism would be an important step toward the rational design of new CETP inhibitors for treating cardiovascular diseases. Using EM, single-particle image processing and molecular dynamics simulation, we discovered that CETP bridges a ternary complex with its N-terminal β-barrel domain penetrating into high-density lipoproteins and its C-terminal domain interacting with low-density lipoprotein or very-low-density lipoprotein. In our mechanistic model, the CETP lipoprotein-interacting regions, which are highly mobile, form pores that connect to a hydrophobic central cavity, thereby forming a tunnel for transfer of neutral lipids from donor to acceptor lipoproteins. These new insights into CETP transfer provide a molecular basis for analyzing mechanisms for CETP inhibition.	0
Title: Identification of a hybrid PKS/NRPS required for pseurotin A biosynthesis in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: The genome sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus revealed the presence of a single hybrid polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) gene that is present within a cluster of five genes suggestive of its involvement in secondary metabolism. Here, we present evidence that it is required for the biosynthesis of pseurotin A, a compound with an unusual heterospirocyclic gamma-lactam structure. We have confirmed that the genome reference strain A. fumigatus Af293 produces pseurotin A, a compound previously reported to be a competitive inhibitor of chitin synthase and an inducer of nerve-cell proliferation. Deletion or overexpression of the PKS/NRPS gene psoA in A. fumigatus leads to the absence or accumulation of pseurotin A, respectively; this indicates that this gene is essential for the biosynthesis of pseurotin A. It is likely that the first product of psoA is converted to pseurotin A by the products of other genes in this cluster.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of fumonisin mycotoxins in Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A Abstract: Fumonisins are toxins associated with several mycotoxicoses and are produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A (MP-A). Biochemical analyses indicate that fumonisins are a product of either polyketide or fatty acid biosynthesis. To isolate a putative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, we employed PCR with degenerate PKS primers and a cDNA template prepared from a fumonisin-producing culture of G. fujikuroi. Sequence analysis of the single PCR product and its flanking DNA revealed a gene (FUM5) with a 7.8-kb coding region. The predicted FUM5 translation product was highly similar to bacterial and fungal Type I PKSs. Transformation of a cosmid clone carrying FUM5 into G. fujikuroi enhanced production in three strains and restored wild-type production in a fumonisin nonproducing mutant. Disruption of FUM5 reduced fumonisin production by over 99% in G. fujikuroi MP-A. Together, these results indicate that FUM5 is a PKS gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genetic organization and sequence of the Pseudomonas cepacia genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase Abstract: The locations of the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome were determined. This was accomplished through the construction of several subclones into the broad-host-range cloning vectors pRO2317, pRO2320, and pRO2321. The ability of each subclone to complement mutations in protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcaA) was tested in mutant strains derived from P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. These complementation studies also showed that the two subunits were expressed from the same promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence matched that determined by N-terminal analysis of regions of the isolated enzyme. Although over 400 nucleotides were sequenced before the start of the genes, no homology to known promoters was found. However, a terminator stem-loop structure was found immediately after the genes. The deduced amino acid sequence showed extensive homology with the previously determined amino acid sequence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from another Pseudomonas species.	0
Title: Distinct and redundant roles of exonucleases in Cryptococcus neoformans: implications for virulence and mating Abstract: Opportunistic pathogens like Cryptococcus neoformans are constantly exposed to changing environments, in their natural habitat as well as when encountering a human host. This requires a coordinated program to regulate gene expression that can act at the levels of mRNA synthesis and also mRNA degradation. Here, we find that deletion of the gene encoding the major cytoplasmic 5'→3' exonuclease Xrn1p in C. neoformans has important consequences for virulence associated phenotypes such as growth at 37 °C, capsule and melanin. In an invertebrate model of cryptococcosis the alteration of these virulence properties corresponds to avirulence of the xrn1Δ mutant strains. Additionally, deletion of XRN1 impairs uni- and bisexual mating. On a molecular level, the absence of XRN1 is associated with the upregulation of other major exonuclease encoding genes (i.e. XRN2 and RRP44). Using inducible alleles of RRP44 and XRN2, we show that artificial overexpression of these genes alters LAC1 gene expression and mating. Our data thus suggest the existence of a complex interdependent regulation of exonuclease encoding genes that impact upon virulence and mating in C. neoformans.	0
Title: Genome mining of a fungal endophyte of Taxus yunnanensis (Chinese yew) leads to the discovery of a novel azaphilone polyketide, lijiquinone Abstract: Genome mining of Ascomycete sp. F53 (F53), a fungal endophyte of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Taxus yunnanensis (Chinese yew), revealed 35 putative specialized metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, one of which encodes a rarely seen tandem polyketide synthase pathway with close homology to azaphilone biosynthesis pathways. A novel compound, lijiquinone 1, was subsequently isolated from F53 and structurally and functionally characterized. The m/z 385 [M + H+ ]+ compound, comprised of a cyclohexenone side group attached to a core bicyclic ring, displayed cytotoxicity against human myeloma cells (IC50 = 129 μM), as well as antifungal activity against Candida albicans (IC50 = 79 μM) and Cryptococcus albidus (IC50 = 141 μM). Our results suggest that enzymes encoded on the lij gene cluster are responsible for the synthesis of 1 and that the medicinal properties of T. yunnanensis could be partially mediated by this novel azaphilone. This study highlights the utility of combining traditional knowledge with contemporary genomic approaches for the discovery of new bioactive compounds.	1
Title: Toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1: genetic organization of the tod operon Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PpF1 degrades toluene through cis-toluene dihydrodiol to 3-methylcatechol. The latter compound is metabolized through the well-established meta pathway for catechol degradation. The first four steps in the pathway involve the sequential action of toluene dioxygenase (todABC1C2), cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (todD), 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE), and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate hydrolase (todF). The genes for these enzymes form part of the tod operon which is responsible for the degradation of toluene by this organism. A combination of transposon mutagenesis of the PpF1 chromosome, as well as analysis of cloned chromosomal fragments, was used to determine the physical order of the genes in the tod operon. The genes were determined to be transcribed in the order todF, todC1, todC2, todB, todA, todD, todE.	0
Title: Catalytic and Photochemical Strategies to Stabilized Radicals Based on Anomeric Nucleophiles Abstract: Carbohydrates, one of the three primary macromolecules of living organisms, play significant roles in various biological processes such as intercellular communication, cell recognition, and immune activity. While the majority of established methods for the installation of carbohydrates through the anomeric carbon rely on nucleophilic displacement, anomeric radicals represent an attractive alternative because of their functional group compatibility and high anomeric selectivities. Herein, we demonstrate that anomeric nucleophiles such as C1 stannanes can be converted into anomeric radicals by merging Cu(I) catalysis with blue light irradiation to achieve highly stereoselective C(sp3)-S cross-coupling reactions. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the C-S bond-forming step occurs via the transfer of the anomeric radical directly to a sulfur electrophile bound to Cu(II) species. This pathway complements a radical chain observed for photochemical metal-free conditions where a disulfide initiator can be activated by a Lewis base additive. Both strategies utilize anomeric nucleophiles as efficient radical donors and achieve a switch from an ionic to a radical pathway. Taken together, the stability of glycosyl nucleophiles, a broad substrate scope, and high anomeric selectivities observed for the thermal and photochemical protocols make this novel C-S cross coupling a practical tool for late-stage glycodiversification of bioactive natural products and drug candidates.	0
Title: Transcriptional activation of the pathway-specific regulator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The Streptomyces produce a plethora of secondary metabolites including antibiotics and undergo a complex developmental cycle. As a means of establishing the pathways that regulate secondary metabolite production by this important bacterial genus, the model species Streptomyces coelicolor and its relatives have been the subject of several genetic screens. However, despite the identification and characterization of numerous genes that affect antibiotic production, there is still no overall understanding of the network that integrates the various environmental and growth signals to bring about changes in the expression of biosynthetic genes. To establish new links, we are taking a biochemical approach to identify transcription factors that regulate antibiotic production in S. coelicolor. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a transcription factor, designated AtrA, that regulates transcription of actII-ORF4, the pathway-specific activator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. coelicolor. Disruption of the corresponding atrA gene, which is not associated with any antibiotic gene cluster, reduced the production of actinorhodin, but had no detectable effect on the production of undecylprodigiosin or the calcium-dependent antibiotic. These results indicate that atrA has specificity with regard to the biosynthetic genes it influences. An orthologue of atrA is present in the genome of Streptomyces avermitilis, the only other streptomycete for which there is a publicly available complete sequence. We also show that S. coelicolor AtrA can bind in vitro to the promoter of strR, a transcriptional activator unrelated to actII-ORF4 that is the final regulator of streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus. These findings provide further evidence that the path leading to the expression of pathway-specific activators of antibiotic biosynthesis genes in disparate Streptomyces may share evolutionarily conserved components in at least some cases, even though the final activators are not related, and suggests that the regulation of streptomycin production, which serves an important paradigm, may be more complex than represented by current models.	1
Title: Unprecedented Noncanonical Features of the Nonlinear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Assembly Line for WS9326A Biosynthesis Abstract: Systematic inactivation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains and translocation of the thioesterase (TE) domain revealed several unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of the cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A in Streptomyces sp. SNM55. First, two sets of type ΙΙ TE (TEΙΙ)-like enzymes mediate the shuttling of activated amino acids between two sets of stand-alone adenylation (A)-thiolation (T) didomain modules and an "A-less" condensation (C)-T module with distinctive specificities and flexibilities. This was confirmed by the elucidation of the affinities of the A-T didomains for the TEΙΙs and its structure. Second, the C-T didomain module operates iteratively and independently from other modules in the same protein to catalyze two chain elongation cycles. Third, this biosynthetic pathway includes the first example of module skipping, where the interpolated C and T domains are required for chain transfer.	1
Title: Reevaluation of the violacein biosynthetic pathway and its relationship to indolocarbazole biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic pathways for violacein and for indolocarbazoles (rebeccamycin, staurosporine) include a decarboxylative fusion of two tryptophan units. However, in the case of violacein, one of the tryptophans experiences an unusual 1-->2 shift of the indole ring. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster was previously reported to consist of four genes, vioABCD. Here we studied the violacein pathway through expression of vio genes in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces albus. A pair of genes (vioAB), responsible for the earliest steps in violacein biosynthesis, was functionally equivalent to the homologous pair in the indolocarbazole pathway (rebOD), directing the formation of chromopyrrolic acid. However, chromopyrrolic acid appeared to be a shunt product, not a violacein intermediate. In addition to vioABCD, a fifth gene (vioE) was essential for violacein biosynthesis, specifically for production of the characteristic 1-->2 shift of the indole ring. We also report new findings on the roles played by the VioC and VioD oxygenases, and on the origin of violacein derivatives of the chromoviridans type.	1
Title: The insect pathogen Serratia marcescens Db10 uses a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase to produce the antibiotic althiomycin Abstract: There is a continuing need to discover new bioactive natural products, such as antibiotics, in genetically-amenable micro-organisms. We observed that the enteric insect pathogen, Serratia marcescens Db10, produced a diffusible compound that inhibited the growth of Bacillis subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus. Mapping the genetic locus required for this activity revealed a putative natural product biosynthetic gene cluster, further defined to a six-gene operon named alb1-alb6. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by alb1-6 predicted a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) assembly line (Alb4/5/6), tailoring enzymes (Alb2/3) and an export/resistance protein (Alb1), and suggested that the machinery assembled althiomycin or a related molecule. Althiomycin is a ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic whose biosynthetic machinery had been elusive for decades. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed that wild type S. marcescens produced althiomycin and that production was eliminated on disruption of the alb gene cluster. Construction of mutants with in-frame deletions of specific alb genes demonstrated that Alb2-Alb5 were essential for althiomycin production, whereas Alb6 was required for maximal production of the antibiotic. A phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was also identified. Expression of Alb1, a predicted major facilitator superfamily efflux pump, conferred althiomycin resistance on another, sensitive, strain of S. marcescens. This is the first report of althiomycin production outside of the Myxobacteria or Streptomyces and paves the way for future exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery, since S. marcescens represents a convenient and tractable producing organism.	1
Title: Bioprospection of actinobacteria derived from freshwater sediments for their potential to produce antimicrobial compounds Abstract: Background:                       Actinobacteria from freshwater habitats have been explored less than from other habitats in the search for compounds of pharmaceutical value. This study highlighted the abundance of actinobacteria from freshwater sediments of two rivers and one lake, and the isolates were studied for their ability to produce antimicrobial bioactive compounds.                  Results:                       16S rRNA gene sequencing led to the identification of 84 actinobacterial isolates separated into a common genus (Streptomyces) and eight rare genera (Nocardiopsis, Saccharopolyspora, Rhodococcus, Prauserella, Amycolatopsis, Promicromonospora, Kocuria and Micrococcus). All strains that showed significant inhibition potentials were found against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeast pathogens. Further, three biosynthetic genes, polyketide synthases type II (PKS II), nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and aminodeoxyisochorismate synthase (phzE), were detected in 38, 71 and 29% of the strains, respectively. Six isolates based on their antimicrobial potentials were selected for the detection and quantification of standard antibiotics using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Four antibiotics (fluconazole, trimethoprim, ketoconazole and rifampicin) and 35 VOCs were quantified and determined from the methanolic crude extract of six selected Streptomyces strains.                  Conclusion:                       Infectious diseases still remain one of the leading causes of death globally and bacterial infections caused millions of deaths annually. Culturable actinobacteria associated with freshwater lake and river sediments has the prospects for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites.	0
Title: Mechanism of the Zn(II)Phthalocyanines' Photochemical Reactions Depending on the Number of Substituents and Geometry Abstract: In this work, the synthesis and the nonlinear absorption and population dynamics investigation of a series of zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) dissolved in chloroform are reported. In order to determine the relevant spectroscopic parameters, such as absorption cross-sections of singlet and triplet excited states, fluorescence relaxation times, intersystem crossing, radiative decay and internal conversion, different optical and spectroscopic techniques were used. By single pulse and pulse train Z-scan techniques, respectively, singlet and triplet excited states' absorption cross-section were determined at 532 nm. Furthermore, the intersystem crossing time was obtained by using both techniques combined with the fluorescence lifetime determined by time-resolved fluorescence. The radiative and internal conversion rates were determined from the fluorescence quantum yield of the samples. Such spectroscopy parameters are fundamental for selecting photosensitizers used in photodynamic therapy, as well as for many other applications.	0
Title: Minimization of the Thiolactomycin Biosynthetic Pathway Reveals that the Cytochrome P450 Enzyme TlmF Is Required for Five-Membered Thiolactone Ring Formation Abstract: Thiolactomycin (TLM) belongs to a class of rare and unique thiotetronate antibiotics that inhibit bacterial fatty acid synthesis. Although this group of natural product antibiotics was first discovered over 30 years ago, the study of TLM biosynthesis remains in its infancy. We recently discovered the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for TLM from the marine bacterium Salinispora pacifica CNS-863. Here, we report the investigation of TLM biosynthetic logic through mutagenesis and comparative metabolic analyses. Our results revealed that only four genes (tlmF, tlmG, tlmH, and tlmI) are required for the construction of the characteristic γ-thiolactone skeleton of this class of antibiotics. We further showed that the cytochrome P450 TlmF does not directly participate in sulfur insertion and C-S bond formation chemistry but rather in the construction of the five-membered thiolactone ring as, upon its deletion, we observed the alternative production of the six-membered δ-thiolactomycin. Our findings pave the way for future biochemical investigation of the biosynthesis of this structurally unique group of thiotetronic acid natural products.	1
Title: A kinase-independent activity of Cdk9 modulates glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene induction Abstract: A gene induction competition assay has recently uncovered new inhibitory activities of two transcriptional cofactors, NELF-A and NELF-B, in glucocorticoid-regulated transactivation. NELF-A and -B are also components of the NELF complex, which participates in RNA polymerase II pausing shortly after the initiation of gene transcription. We therefore asked if cofactors (Cdk9 and ELL) best known to affect paused polymerase could reverse the effects of NELF-A and -B. Unexpectedly, Cdk9 and ELL augmented, rather than prevented, the effects of NELF-A and -B. Furthermore, Cdk9 actions are not blocked either by Ckd9 inhibitors (DRB or flavopiridol) or by two Cdk9 mutants defective in kinase activity. The mode and site of action of NELF-A and -B mutants with an altered NELF domain are similarly affected by wild-type and kinase-dead Cdk9. We conclude that Cdk9 is a new modulator of GR action, that Ckd9 and ELL have novel activities in GR-regulated gene expression, that NELF-A and -B can act separately from the NELF complex, and that Cdk9 possesses activities that are independent of Cdk9 kinase activity. Finally, the competition assay has succeeded in ordering the site of action of several cofactors of GR transactivation. Extension of this methodology should be helpful in determining the site and mode of action of numerous additional cofactors and in reducing unwanted side effects.	0
Title: Strict control of auricin production in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 involves a feedback mechanism Abstract: The polyketide gene cluster aur1 is responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Auricin production is regulated in a complex manner involving several regulators, including a key pathway-specific positive regulator Aur1P that belongs to the family of 'atypical' response regulators. Production of auricin is induced after entry into stationary phase. However, auricin was produced in only a short time interval of several hours. We found that the decrease of auricin production was due to a strict regulation of auricin biosynthetic genes at the transcriptional level by a feedback mechanism; auricin and/or its intermediate(s) inhibited binding of Aur1P to its cognate biosynthetic promoter aur1Ap and consequently stopped its activation. In addition, we also determined that synthesised auricin is unstable during growth of S. aureofaciens CCM3239 in the production medium even though purified auricin is stable for days in various organic solvents. The critical parameter affecting its stability was pH. Auricin is stable at acid pH and unstable at neutral and alkaline pH. The drop in auricin concentration was due to an increase of pH shortly after induction of auricin production during cultivation of S. aureofaciens CCM3239.	1
Title: Induced biosynthesis of cryptic polyketide metabolites in a Burkholderia thailandensis quorum sensing mutant Abstract: Genetic manipulation of the LuxR-type quorum sensing regulator system in Burkholderia thailandensis caused a significant change in the metabolic profile: it led to activation of the thailandamide biosynthesis gene cluster, dramatically increased thailandamide production, and induced strong pigmentation. A novel polyketide metabolite, thailandamide lactone (2), which cannot be detected in the wild type, was isolated from the mutant broth, and its structure was elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometry and IR and NMR spectroscopy. In a biological assay using tumor cell lines, 2 showed moderate antiproliferative activities. This finding not only points to complex regulation but also serves as a proof of concept that engineering quorum sensing mutants may enable the discovery of novel bioactive natural products encoded by silent or only weakly expressed biosynthetic pathway genes.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the structural and transporter genes for, and the chemical and biological properties of, sublancin 168, a novel lantibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis 168 Abstract: An antimicrobial peptide produced by Bacillus subtilis 168 was isolated and characterized. It was named sublancin 168, and its behavior during Edman sequence analysis and its NMR spectrum suggested that sublancin is a dehydroalanine-containing lantibiotic. A hybridization probe based on the peptide sequence was used to clone the presublancin gene, which encoded a 56-residue polypeptide consisting of a 19-residue leader segment and a 37-residue mature segment. The mature segment contained one serine, one threonine, and five cysteine residues. Alkylation of mature sublancin showed no free sulfhydryl groups, suggesting that one sulfydryl had formed a beta-methyllanthionine bridge with a dehydrobutyrine derived by posttranslational modification of threonine; with the other four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges. It is unprecedented for a lantibiotic to contain a disulfide bridge. The sublancin leader was similar to known type AII lantibiotics, containing a double-glycine motif that is typically recognized by dual-function transporters. A protein encoded immediately downstream from the sublancin gene possessed features of a dual-function ABC transporter with a proteolytic domain and an ATP-binding domain. The antimicrobial activity spectrum of sublancin was like other lantibiotics, inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria; and like the lantibiotics nisin and subtilin in its ability to inhibit both bacterial spore outgrowth and vegetative growth. Sublancin is an extraordinarily stable lantibiotic, showing no degradation or inactivation after being stored in aqueous solution at room temperature for 2 years. The fact that sublancin is a natural product of B. subtilis 168, for which a great deal of genetic information is available, including the entire sequence of its genome, suggests that sublancin will be an especially good model for studying the potential of lantibiotics as sources of novel biomaterials.	1
Title: Identification of the Bacterial Maytansinoid Gene Cluster asc Provides Insights into the Post-PKS Modifications of Ansacarbamitocin Biosynthesis Abstract: A new biosynthetic gene cluster for the bacterial maytansinoids, ansacarbamitocins (ASCs), was identified in Amycolatopsis alba DSM 44262. The post-PKS modifications of ASCs were elucidated on the basis of bioinformatics analysis. Specific gene disruption and heterologous expression led to the isolation of seven new bacterial maytansinoids. The 3'-O-methyltransferase and 3-O-carbamyltransferase involved in bacterial maytansinoid biosynthesis were identified for the first time. The new bacterial maytansinoids 7 and 13 showed strong antitumor activities against four human cancer cell lines.	1
Title: A cytochrome P450 serves as an unexpected terpene cyclase during fungal meroterpenoid biosynthesis Abstract: Viridicatumtoxin (1) is a tetracycline-like fungal meroterpenoid with a unique, fused spirobicyclic ring system. Puzzlingly, no dedicated terpene cyclase is found in the gene cluster identified in Penicillium aethiopicum. Cytochrome P450 enzymes VrtE and VrtK in the vrt gene cluster were shown to catalyze C5-hydroxylation and spirobicyclic ring formation, respectively. Feeding acyclic previridicatumtoxin to Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing VrtK confirmed that VrtK is the sole enzyme required for cyclizing the geranyl moiety. Thus, VrtK is the first example of a P450 that can catalyze terpene cyclization, most likely via initial oxidation of C17 to an allylic carbocation. Quantum chemical modeling revealed a possible new tertiary carbocation intermediate E that forms after allylic carbocation formation. Intermediate E can readily undergo concerted 1,2-alkyl shift/1,3-hydride shift, either spontaneously or further aided by VrtK, followed by C7 Friedel-Crafts alkylation to afford 1. The most likely stereochemical course of the reaction was proposed on the basis of the results of our computations.	1
Title: The biosynthesis of methanobactin Abstract: Metal homeostasis poses a major challenge to microbes, which must acquire scarce elements for core metabolic processes. Methanobactin, an extensively modified copper-chelating peptide, was one of the earliest natural products shown to enable microbial acquisition of a metal other than iron. We describe the core biosynthetic machinery responsible for the characteristic posttranslational modifications that grant methanobactin its specificity and affinity for copper. A heterodimer comprising MbnB, a DUF692 family iron enzyme, and MbnC, a protein from a previously unknown family, performs a dioxygen-dependent four-electron oxidation of the precursor peptide (MbnA) to install an oxazolone and an adjacent thioamide, the characteristic methanobactin bidentate copper ligands. MbnB and MbnC homologs are encoded together and separately in many bacterial genomes, suggesting functions beyond their roles in methanobactin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Lapcin, a potent dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor discovered by soil metagenome guided total chemical synthesis Abstract: In natural product discovery programs, the power of synthetic chemistry is often leveraged for the total synthesis and diversification of characterized metabolites. The synthesis of structures that are bioinformatically predicted to arise from uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) provides a means for synthetic chemistry to enter this process at an early stage. The recent identification of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) containing multiple ρ-aminobenzoic acids (PABAs) led us to search soil metagenomes for BGCs that polymerize PABA. Here, we use PABA-specific adenylation-domain sequences to guide the cloning of the lap BGC directly from soil. This BGC was predicted to encode a unique N-acylated PABA and thiazole containing structure. Chemical synthesis of this structure gave lapcin, a dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor with nM to pM IC50s against diverse cancer cell lines. The discovery of lapcin highlights the power of coupling metagenomics, bioinformatics and total chemical synthesis to unlock the biosynthetic potential contained in even complex uncharacterized BGCs.	1
Title: A theoretical study on NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes and 3-aroylcoumarins: mechanism and enantioselectivity Abstract: NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes to 3-aroylcoumarins to yield dihydrocoumarin-fused dihydropyranones has been investigated using DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* and MPWB1K/6-311G** computational levels. Two plausible mechanisms have been studied: the "ketene-first" mechanism A and the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. An analysis of the activation Gibbs free energies involved in the two competitive pathways makes it possible to rule out the pathway associated with the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. The first step of the "ketene-first" mechanism A is the formation of zwitterionic intermediate IN1-Zvia a nucleophilic attack of NHC 1 on ketene 2. A [4 + 2] cycloaddition through the nucleophilic attack of enolate IN1-Z on the conjugated double bond of the benzoyl group of coumarin 3, viaTS3-SS-a2 or TS3-RR-a2, yields IN3. Finally, the extrusion of the catalyst through TS5 leads to the final products, either 4-SS or 4-RR. Enantioselectivity observed in the experimental results is determined in the transition states TS3-SS-a2/TS3-RR-a2. In this pathway, the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding between the hydroxyl group of the IN1-Z adduct and the carbonyl oxygen of the original ketene group directs the final stereochemistry throughout the entire process.	0

Title: Distinct mechanisms for spiro-carbon formation reveal biosynthetic pathway crosstalk Abstract: Spirotryprostatins, an indole alkaloid class of nonribosomal peptides isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus, are known for their antimitotic activity in tumor cells. Because spirotryprostatins and many other chemically complex spiro-carbon-bearing natural products exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding the mechanism of spiro-carbon biosynthesis is of great interest. Here we report a detailed study of spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatins from tryprostatins derived from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, using reactants and products prepared with engineered yeast and fungal strains. Unexpectedly, FqzB, an FAD-dependent monooxygenase from the unrelated fumiquinazoline biosynthetic pathway, catalyzed spiro-carbon formation in spirotryprostatin A via an epoxidation route. Furthermore, FtmG, a cytochrome P450 from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, was determined to catalyze the spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatin B. Our results highlight the versatile role of oxygenating enzymes in the biosynthesis of structurally complex natural products and indicate that cross-talk of different biosynthetic pathways allows product diversification in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of the gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus Abstract: Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a food-grade isolate from naturally fermented Greek Kasseri cheese, produces a lantibiotic named macedocin that has been previously purified and characterized. In the present study, a 15,171 bp region in the S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of macedocin, has been sequenced. This region consists of 10 ORFs, which correspond to the genes (mcd genes) involved in macedocin biosynthesis, regulation and immunity. The mcd genes are organized in two operons and their role is predicted on the basis of similarities to genes of known lantibiotics. Compared with its closest match, the streptococcin A-FF22 gene cluster, the macedocin one contains an additional structural gene and an insertion sequence between the regulatory and the biosynthetic operons.	1
Title: Bacteriophage T4D receptor and the Escherichia coli cell wall structure: binding of endotoxin-like particles to the cell wall Abstract: A variety of degradative treatments have been used to investigate the nature of the structure and components of the cell walls of Escherichia coli B. The binding and localization of the endotoxin-like particles found on the cell walls were of special interest because some of them are associated with the site where the inner tail tube of bacteriophage T4D penetrates the cell wall. Modified cell walls were obtained by heating a suspension of bacterial cells originally in 0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.0, after the addition of 12.5 M NaOH to a final concentration of 0.25 M. With regard to the endotoxin-like particles, it was found that: (i) at least part of them still remained bound to the modified cell wall after the alkali treatment; (ii) the subsequent incubation of alkali-treated cell walls with lysozyme destroyed the bacterial form and released a complex of endotoxin-like particles together with a fibrous material; (iii) on the other hand, treatment with 45% phenol at 70 degrees C removed the endotoxin-like particles from the surface of the alkali-treated cell walls, but most of the fibrous material was left on the cell wall; and (iv) incubation of alkali-treated cell walls with 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 20 degrees C also removed the endotoxin-like particles, but did not disrupt the rodlike bacterial form. However, if the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment was performed at 55 degrees C, the bacterium-like form was destroyed. These differential sensitivities to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid suggested that loosely bound divalent metal ions normally hold these endotoxin-like particles on the cell wall surface, but that probably more tightly bound metal ions are involved in the determination of cell shape. Analysis of the protein components of the alkalitreated cell walls showed that only one protein was present in significant amounts, and this protein had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the Braun lipoprotein. This protein was released from the alkali-treated cell walls upon heating with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 degrees C. Phospholipids were also absent from this structure. The distribution of the remaining cell wall components on the alkali-treated cell walls is discussed.	0
Title: Bacterial biosynthesis and maturation of the didemnin anti-cancer agents Abstract: The anti-neoplastic agent didemnin B from the Caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum was the first marine drug to be clinically tested in humans. Because of its limited supply and its complex cyclic depsipeptide structure, considerable challenges were encountered during didemnin B's development that continue to limit aplidine (dehydrodidemnin B), which is currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials. Herein we show that the didemnins are bacterial products produced by the marine α-proteobacteria Tistrella mobilis and Tistrella bauzanensis via a unique post-assembly line maturation process. Complete genome sequence analysis of the 6,513,401 bp T. mobilis strain KA081020-065 with its five circular replicons revealed the putative didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster (did) on the 1,126,962 bp megaplasmid pTM3. The did locus encodes a 13-module hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase enzyme complex organized in a collinear arrangement for the synthesis of the fatty acylglutamine ester derivatives didemnins X and Y rather than didemnin B as first anticipated. Imaging mass spectrometry of T. mobilis bacterial colonies captured the time-dependent extracellular conversion of the didemnin X and Y precursors to didemnin B, in support of an unusual post-synthetase activation mechanism. Significantly, the discovery of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster may provide a long-term solution to the supply problem that presently hinders this group of marine natural products and pave the way for the genetic engineering of new didemnin congeners.	1
Title: Efficient transposition of Tn4556 by alterations in inverted repeats using a delivery vector carrying a counter-selectable marker for Streptomyces Abstract: A 6625-base pair transposon, Tn4556, was initially isolated from a Streptomyces strain and a sequence analysis was performed; however, its annotation data remain incomplete. At least three positions were identified as frameshift and base-exchange errors by resequencing. The revised sequence revealed that Tn4556 contains four open reading frames that encode transposase, methyltransferase, isoprenyl diphosphate transferase, and resolvase, respectively. Thirty-eight-base pair inverted repeat (IR) sequences at both ends contained a 1-bp mismatch flanked by a target duplication site, and transposition efficiency was improved by the replacement of imperfectly matched IR-L to perfectly matched IR-L. The detection of Tn4556 transposition was markedly facilitated using a delivery vector carrying a strictly counter-selectable marker for Streptomyces strains.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic angustmycins: identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster reveal unprecedented dehydratase required for exo-glycal formation Abstract: The nucleoside antibiotic angustmycin, produced by some Streptomyces strains, is composed of adenine and C6 sugar and shows antibiotic and antitumor activities. In this study, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for angustmycin using a heterologous expression experiment coupled with in silico analysis of the angustmycin biosynthetic gene (agm) cluster. The biochemical characterization of Agm6 demonstrated its role in angustmycin biosynthesis as an unprecedented dehydratase.	1
Title: Development of antibiotic activity profile screening for the classification and discovery of natural product antibiotics Abstract: Despite recognition of the looming antibiotic crisis by healthcare professionals, the number of new antibiotics reaching the clinic continues to decline sharply. This study aimed to establish an antibiotic profiling strategy using a panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains to create unique biological fingerprints for all major classes of antibiotics. Antibiotic mode of action profile (BioMAP) screening has been shown to effectively cluster antibiotics by structural class based on these fingerprints. Using this approach, we have accurately predicted the presence of known antibiotics in natural product extracts and have discovered a naphthoquinone-based antibiotic from our marine natural product library that possesses a unique carbon skeleton. We have demonstrated that bioactivity fingerprinting is a successful strategy for profiling antibiotic lead compounds and that BioMAP can be applied to the discovery of new natural product antibiotics leads.	0
Title: Complementary Genomic, Bioinformatics, and Chemical Approaches Facilitate the Absolute Structure Assignment of Ionostatin, a Linear Polyketide from a Rare Marine-Derived Actinomycete Abstract: A new linear type-1 polyketide, ionostatin (1), has been fully defined using a combined genomic and bioinformatics approach coupled with confirmatory chemical analyses. The 41 carbon-containing polyether is the product of the 101 kbp ion biosynthetic cluster containing seven modular type-1 polyketide synthases. Ionostatin is composed of 15 chiral centers that were proposed using the stereospecificities installed by the different classes of ketoreductases and enoylreductases and confirmed by rigorous NMR analyses. Incorporated into the structure are two tetrahydrofuran rings that appear to be the product of stereospecific epoxidation, followed by stereospecific ring opening and cyclization. These transformations are proposed to be catalyzed by conserved enzymes analogous to those found in other bacterial-derived polyether biosynthetic clusters. Ionostatin shows moderate cancer cell cytotoxicity against U87 glioblastoma and SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma at 7.4 μg/mL.	1
Title: Total Synthesis of Bioactive Marine Meroterpenoids: The Cases of Liphagal and Frondosin B Abstract: Liphagal and frondosin B are two marine-derived secondary metabolites sharing a very similar polyfused-benzofuran skeleton. The two tetracyclic meroterpenoids were isolated from marine sponges, both featuring a 6-5-7-6 fused ring system. A preliminary bioactive study shows that (+)-liphagal is a selective kinase (PI3K α) inhibitor, while (+)-frondosin B is shown to inhibit the binding of the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) to its receptor, CX-CLR1/2. The unique structures and interesting biological profiles of these two meroterpenoids have attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists. Herein we summarize the synthetic efforts with respect to (+)-liphagal and (+)-frondosin B during the past two decades.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the thioviridamide biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces olivoviridis Abstract: Thioviridamide is a unique peptide antibiotic containing five thioamide bonds from Streptomyces olivoviridis. Draft genome sequencing revealed a gene (the tvaA gene) encoding the thioviridamide precursor peptide. The thioviridamide biosynthesis gene cluster was identified by heterologous production of thioviridamide in Streptomyces lividans.	1
Title: Amylocyclicin, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a Gram-positive plant growth-promoting bacterium with an impressive capacity to synthesize nonribosomal secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. Here we report on a novel circular bacteriocin which is ribosomally synthesized by FZB42. The compound displayed high antibacterial activity against closely related Gram-positive bacteria. Transposon mutagenesis and subsequent site-specific mutagenesis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy revealed that a cluster of six genes covering 4,490 bp was responsible for the production, modification, and export of and immunity to an antibacterial compound, here designated amylocyclicin, with a molecular mass of 6,381 Da. Peptide sequencing of the fragments obtained after tryptic digestion of the purified peptide revealed posttranslational cleavage of an N-terminal extension and head-to-tail circularization of the novel bacteriocin. Homology to other putative circular bacteriocins in related bacteria let us assume that this type of peptide is widespread among the Bacillus/Paenibacillus taxon.	1
Title: Radical-mediated enzymatic carbon chain fragmentation-recombination Abstract: The radical S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) superfamily contains thousands of proteins that catalyze highly diverse conversions, most of which are poorly understood, owing to a lack of information regarding chemical products and radical-dependent transformations. We here report that NosL, involved in forming the indole side ring of the thiopeptide nosiheptide (NOS), is a radical S-AdoMet 3-methyl-2-indolic acid (MIA) synthase. NosL catalyzed an unprecedented carbon chain reconstitution of L-tryptophan to give MIA, showing removal of the Cα-N unit and shift of the carboxylate to the indole ring. Dissection of the enzymatic process upon the identification of products and a putative glycyl intermediate uncovered a radical-mediated, unusual fragmentation-recombination reaction. This finding unveiled a key step in radical S-AdoMet enzyme-catalyzed structural rearrangements during complex biotransformations. Additionally, NosL tolerated fluorinated L-tryptophan as the substrate, allowing for production of a regiospecifically halogenated thiopeptide that has not been found among the more than 80 members of the naturally occurring thiopeptide family.	0
Title: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-acylamino-2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids Abstract: The synthesis and in vitro antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitory activity of the 2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids having a substituent at C-4 position of the beta-lactam ring are described. The influence of C-4 substituents on the antibacterial activity was examined for the compounds having alpha-ureidoacetyl or alpha-oxyiminoacetyl group as acyl side chain at C-3 position. The antibacterial activity is correlated with the C-4 substituents and acyl side chain. Especially, 4(R)-methyl substituted derivatives exhibited excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and 4-dimethyl substituted derivatives exhibited strong activity against resistant Gram-negative bacteria except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 39 and 40 showed strong inhibitory activity against cephalosporinase of Enterobacter cloacae H-27.	0
Title: Isolation of methyl parathion-degrading strain M6 and cloning of the methyl parathion hydrolase gene Abstract: A degradative bacterium, M6, was isolated and presumptively identified as Plesiomonas sp. strain M6 was able to hydrolyze methyl parathion to p-nitrophenol. A novel organophosphate hydrolase gene designated mpd was selected from its genomic library prepared by shotgun cloning. The nucleotide sequence of the mpd gene was determined. The gene could be effectively expressed in Escherichia coli.	0
Title: WA8242A1, A2 and B, novel secretary phospholipase A2 inhibitors produced by Streptomyces violaceusniger. III. Structure elucidation and total synthesis of WA8242B Abstract: The structure of WA8242B, a potent novel inhibitor against phospholipase A2, was fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and chemical degradation. The success of total synthesis of WA8242B confirmed the structure and allowed the pharmacological study of WA8242B. The structures of WA8242A1 and A2 were also described.	0
Title: Transcriptomic reprogramming of genus Paracoccidioides in dimorphism and host niches Abstract: The thermodimorphic fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii are the etiologic agents of Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most important endemic systemic mycosis in Latin America. Paracoccidioides grows as saprophytic mycelia that produce infective conidia propagules, which are inhaled into the lungs where the fungus converts to the pathogenic yeast form. From the lungs, Paracoccidioides may disseminate through blood and lymphatics to several other organs and tissues. During the last decade we have witnessed the generation of a large amount of transcriptomic data regarding the events leading to the morphological transition and host niche adaptation. In this review we summarize those findings and discuss the consequence of gene expression plasticity in the persistence and survival of this pathogen. In addition, we discuss the future trends on the host-pathogen studies and how new molecular strategies, such as RNA-seq, dual RNA-seq and Chip-Seq can be powerful tools to improve our understanding on the pathobiology of this systemic mycosis in Latin America.	0
Title: The role of irradiance and C-use strategies in tropical macroalgae photosynthetic response to ocean acidification Abstract: Fleshy macroalgae may increase photosynthesis with greater CO2 availability under ocean acidification (OA) and outcompete calcifying macroalgae important for tropical reef accretion. Macroalgae use energy-dependent carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to take up HCO3-, the dominant inorganic carbon for marine photosynthesis, but carbon-use strategies may depend on the pCO2, pH and irradiance. We examined photosynthesis in eight tropical macroalgae across a range of irradiances (0-1200 μmol photon m-2 s-1), pH levels (7.5-8.5) and CO2 concentrations (3-43 μmol kg-1). Species-specific CCM strategies were assessed using inhibitors and δ13C isotope signatures. Our results indicate that the log of irradiance is a predictor of the photosynthetic response to elevated pCO2 (R2 > 0.95). All species utilized HCO3-, exhibited diverse C-use pathways and demonstrated facultative HCO3- use. All fleshy species had positive photosynthetic responses to OA, in contrast to a split amongst calcifiers. We suggest that shifts in photosynthetically-driven tropical macroalgal changes due to OA will most likely occur in moderate to high-irradiance environments when CCMs are ineffective at meeting the C-demands of photosynthesis. Further, facultative use of HCO3- allows greater access to CO2 for photosynthesis under OA conditions, particularly amongst fleshy macroalgae, which could contribute to enhance fleshy species dominance over calcifiers.	0
Title: Solanapyrone synthase, a possible Diels-Alderase and iterative type I polyketide synthase encoded in a biosynthetic gene cluster from Alternaria solani Abstract: The solanapyrone biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned from Alternaria solani. It consists of six genes-sol1-6-coding for a polyketide synthase, an O-methyltransferase, a dehydrogenase, a transcription factor, a flavin-dependent oxidase, and cytochrome P450. The prosolanapyrone synthase (PSS) encoded by sol1 was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae and its product was identified as desmethylprosolanapyrone I (8). Although PSS is closely related to the PKSs/Diels-Alderases LovB and MlcA of lovastatin and compactin biosynthesis, it did not catalyze cycloaddition. Sol5, encoding a flavin-dependent oxidase (solanapyrone synthase, SPS), was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified. The purified recombinant SPS showed activity for the formation of (-)-solanapyrone A (1) from achiral prosolanapyrone II (2), establishing that this single enzyme catalyzes both the oxidation and the subsequent cycloaddition reaction, possibly as a Diels-Alder enzyme.	1
Title: Acurin A, a novel hybrid compound, biosynthesized by individually translated PKS- and NRPS-encoding genes in Aspergillus aculeatus Abstract: This work presents the identification and proposed biosynthetic pathway for a compound of mixed polyketide-nonribosomal peptide origin that we named acurin A. The compound was isolated from an extract of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus, and its core structure resemble that of the mycotoxin fusarin C produced by several Fusarium species. Based on bioinformatics in combination with RT-qPCR experiments and gene-deletion analysis, we identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in A. aculeatus responsible for the biosynthesis of acurin A. Moreover, we were able to show that a polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzyme separately encoded by this BGC are responsible for the synthesis of the PK-NRP compound, acurin A, core structure. In comparison, the production of fusarin C is reported to be facilitated by a linked PKS-NRPS hybrid enzyme. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the PKS and NRPS in A. aculeatus resulted from a recent fission of an ancestral hybrid enzyme followed by gene duplication. In addition to the PKS- and NRPS-encoding genes of acurin A, we show that six other genes are influencing the biosynthesis including a regulatory transcription factor. Altogether, we have demonstrated the involvement of eight genes in the biosynthesis of acurin A, including an in-cluster transcription factor. This study highlights the biosynthetic capacity of A. aculeatus and serves as an example of how the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be exploited for the construction of fungal strains that can be readily engineered.	1
Title: An Ryr1I4895T mutation abolishes Ca2+ release channel function and delays development in homozygous offspring of a mutant mouse line Abstract: A heterozygous Ile4898 to Thr (I4898T) mutation in the human type 1 ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1) leads to a severe form of central core disease. We created a mouse line in which the corresponding Ryr1(I4895T) mutation was introduced by using a "knockin" protocol. The heterozygote does not exhibit an overt disease phenotype, but homozygous (IT/IT) mice are paralyzed and die perinatally, apparently because of asphyxia. Histological analysis shows that IT/IT mice have greatly reduced and amorphous skeletal muscle. Myotubes are small, nuclei remain central, myofibrils are disarranged, and no cross striation is obvious. Many areas indicate probable degeneration, with shortened myotubes containing central stacks of pyknotic nuclei. Other manifestations of a delay in completion of late stages of embryogenesis include growth retardation and marked delay in ossification, dermatogenesis, and cardiovascular development. Electron microscopy of IT/IT muscle demonstrates appropriate targeting and positioning of RyR1 at triad junctions and a normal organization of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) complexes into RyR1-associated tetrads. Functional studies carried out in cultured IT/IT myotubes show that ligand-induced and DHPR-activated RyR1 Ca(2+) release is absent, although retrograde enhancement of DHPR Ca(2+) conductance is retained. IT/IT mice, in which RyR1-mediated Ca(2+) release is abolished without altering the formation of the junctional DHPR-RyR1 macromolecular complex, provide a valuable model for elucidation of the role of RyR1-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in mammalian embryogenesis.	0
Title: Genome Characterization of Nocturne116, Novel Lactococcus lactis-Infecting Phage Isolated from Moth Abstract: While looking for novel insect-associated phages, a unique siphophage, Nocturne116, was isolated from a deceased local moth specimen along with its host, which was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as a strain of Lactococcus lactis. Next-generation sequencing and the subsequent genome annotation elaborated on herein revealed that the genome of Nocturne116 is a 25,554 bp long dsDNA molecule with 10 bp long 3' cos overhangs and a GC content of 37.99%, comprising 52 predicted open reading frames. The complete nucleotide sequence of phage Nocturne116 genome is dissimilar to any of the already sequenced phages, save for a distant link with Lactococcus phage Q54. Functions for only 15/52 of Nocturne116 gene products could be reliably predicted using contemporary comparative genomics approaches, while 22 of its gene products do not yet have any homologous entries in the public biological sequence repositories. Despite the public availability of nearly 350 elucidated Lactococcus phage complete genomes as of now, Nocturne116 firmly stands out as a sole representative of novel phage genus.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of the complete genome sequence of the plant growth-promoting bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a Gram-positive, plant-associated bacterium, which stimulates plant growth and produces secondary metabolites that suppress soil-borne plant pathogens. Its 3,918-kb genome, containing an estimated 3,693 protein-coding sequences, lacks extended phage insertions, which occur ubiquitously in the closely related Bacillus subtilis 168 genome. The B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 genome reveals an unexpected potential to produce secondary metabolites, including the polyketides bacillaene and difficidin. More than 8.5% of the genome is devoted to synthesizing antibiotics and siderophores by pathways not involving ribosomes. Besides five gene clusters, known from B. subtilis to mediate nonribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites, we identified four giant gene clusters absent in B. subtilis 168. The pks2 gene cluster encodes the components to synthesize the macrolactin core skeleton.	1
Title: Giant plasmid-encoded polyketide synthases produce the macrolide toxin of Mycobacterium ulcerans Abstract: Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), an emerging human pathogen harbored by aquatic insects, is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a devastating skin disease rife throughout Central and West Africa. Mycolactone, an unusual macrolide with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties, is responsible for the massive s.c. tissue destruction seen in Buruli ulcer. Here, we show that MU contains a 174-kb plasmid, pMUM001, bearing a cluster of genes encoding giant polyketide synthases (PKSs), and polyketide-modifying enzymes, and demonstrate that these are necessary and sufficient for mycolactone synthesis. This is a previously uncharacterized example of plasmid-mediated virulence in a Mycobacterium, and the emergence of MU as a pathogen most likely reflects the acquisition of pMUM001 by horizontal transfer. The 12-membered core of mycolactone is produced by two giant, modular PKSs, MLSA1 (1.8 MDa) and MLSA2 (0.26 MDa), whereas its side chain is synthesized by MLSB (1.2 MDa), a third modular PKS highly related to MLSA1. There is an extreme level of sequence identity within the different domains of the MLS cluster (>97% amino acid identity), so much so that the 16 ketosynthase domains seem functionally identical. This is a finding of significant consequence for our understanding of polyketide biochemistry. Such detailed knowledge of mycolactone will further the investigation of its mode of action and the development of urgently needed therapeutic strategies to combat Buruli ulcer.	1
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the beta-lactam carbapenem thienamycin in Streptomyces cattleya Abstract: beta-lactam ring formation in carbapenem and clavam biosynthesis proceeds through an alternative mechanism to the biosynthetic pathway of classic beta-lactam antibiotics. This involves the participation of a beta-lactam synthetase. Using available information from beta-lactam synthetases, we generated a probe for the isolation of the thienamycin cluster from Streptomyces cattleya. Genes homologous to carbapenem and clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes have been identified. They would participate in early steps of thienamycin biosynthesis leading to the formation of the beta-lactam ring. Other genes necessary for the biosynthesis of thienamycin have also been identified in the cluster (methyltransferases, cysteinyl transferases, oxidoreductases, hydroxylase, etc.) together with two regulatory genes, genes involved in exportation and/or resistance, and a quorum sensing system. Involvement of the cluster in thienamycin biosynthesis was demonstrated by insertional inactivation of several genes generating thienamycin nonproducing mutants.	1
Title: Barriers to genome editing with CRISPR in bacteria Abstract: Genome editing is essential for probing genotype-phenotype relationships and for enhancing chemical production and phenotypic robustness in industrial bacteria. Currently, the most popular tools for genome editing couple recombineering with DNA cleavage by the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. Although successful in some model strains, CRISPR-based genome editing has been slow to extend to the multitude of industrially relevant bacteria. In this review, we analyze existing barriers to implementing CRISPR-based editing across diverse bacterial species. We first compare the efficacy of current CRISPR-based editing strategies. Next, we discuss alternatives when the S. pyogenes Cas9 does not yield colonies. Finally, we describe different ways bacteria can evade editing and how elucidating these failure modes can improve CRISPR-based genome editing across strains. Together, this review highlights existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and offers guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in a wider range of bacterial species, including non-model strains.	0
Title: Identification and overexpression of ltnl, a novel gene which confers immunity to the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 Abstract: Production and immunity of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 is encoded by the 60-2 kb lactococcal plasmid pMRC01. A 12.6 kb region of this plasmid, containing ten genes in two divergently arranged gene clusters, has been subcloned in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and has been shown to confer both lacticin 3147 production and immunity. Further subcloning revealed that the smaller of the two clusters (ItnRIFE) confers immunity. Although the ItnF and E genes are homologous to ABC transporters which confer immunity to other lantibiotics, deletion analysis indicates that they do not play a role in the immunity exhibited by this subclone in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. Also, a deletion in ItnR (which resembles a family of transcriptional repressors) had no effect on immunity. The remaining gene, Itnl, encodes a 116 amino acid protein with a predicted membrane location which bears no homology to other bacteriocin immunity proteins. Confirmation of its role in immunity was obtained when it was observed that disruption of Itnl resulted in a complete loss of immunity. When Itnl was cloned into the expression vector pMG36e, the resulting construct conferred levels of immunity comparable to pMRC01. This confirmed that under the control of a strong promoter, the Itnl gene product alone is sufficient to confer lacticin immunity. In addition, heterologous expression of Itnl was observed in Enterococcus faecalis OG1X. On cloning Itnl behind a nisin-inducible promoter, it was observed that the level of immunity was dependent on nisin concentration. Using this construct, the authors have demonstrated a potential role for Itnl as food-grade selectable marker. Thus, Ltnl appears to represent a new class of lantibiotic immunity proteins.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of 4-methylproline in cyanobacteria: cloning of nosE and nosF genes and biochemical characterization of the encoded dehydrogenase and reductase activities Abstract: The biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid 4-methylproline in the Nostoc genus of cyanobacteria was investigated on the genetic and enzymatic level. Two genes involved in the biosynthesis were cloned and the corresponding enzymes, a zinc-dependent long-chain dehydrogenase and a Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) reductase homologue, were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. Putative substrates were synthesized to test enzyme substrate specificities, and deuterium labeling studies were carried out to reveal the stereospecificities of the enzymatic reactions with respect to the substrates as well as to the coenzymes.	1
Title: pSK41-like plasmid is necessary for Inc18-like vanA plasmid transfer from Enterococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro Abstract: Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) is thought to result from the in vivo conjugative transfer of a vanA plasmid from an Enterococcus sp. to S. aureus. We studied bacterial isolates from VRSA cases that occurred in the United States to identify microbiological factors which may contribute to this plasmid transfer. First, vancomycin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates from five VRSA cases were tested for their ability to accept foreign DNA by conjugation in mating experiments with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 containing pAM378, a pheromone-response conjugative plasmid. All of the MRSA isolates accepted the plasmid DNA with similar transfer efficiencies (∼10(-7)/donor CFU) except for one isolate, MRSA8, for which conjugation was not successful. The MRSA isolates were also tested as recipients in mating experiments between an E. faecalis isolate with an Inc18-like vanA plasmid that was isolated from a VRSA case patient. Conjugative transfer was successful for 3/5 MRSA isolates. Successful MRSA recipients carried a pSK41-like plasmid, a staphylococcal conjugative plasmid, whereas the two unsuccessful MRSA recipients did not carry pSK41. The transfer of a pSK41-like plasmid from a successful MRSA recipient to the two unsuccessful recipients resulted in conjugal transfer of the Inc18-like vanA plasmid from E. faecalis at a frequency of 10(-7)/recipient CFU. In addition, conjugal transfer could be achieved for pSK41-negative MRSA in the presence of a cell-free culture filtrate from S. aureus carrying a pSK41-like plasmid at a frequency of 10(-8)/recipient CFU. These results indicated that a pSK41-like plasmid can facilitate the transfer of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid from E. faecalis to S. aureus, possibly via an extracellular factor produced by pSK41-carrying isolates.	0
Title: The Ustilago maydis Cys2His2-type zinc finger transcription factor Mzr1 regulates fungal gene expression during the biotrophic growth stage Abstract: The smut fungus Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host plant maize to progress through sexual development. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Cys(2)His(2)-type zinc finger protein Mzr1 that functions as a transcriptional activator during host colonization. Expression of the U. maydis mig2 cluster genes is tightly linked to this phase. Upon conditional overexpression, Mzr1 confers induction of a subset of mig2 genes during vegetative growth and this requires the same promoter elements that confer inducible expression in planta. Furthermore, expression of the mig2-4 and mig2-5 genes during biotrophic growth is strongly reduced in cells deleted in mzr1. DNA-array analysis led to the identification of additional Mzr1-induced genes. Some of these genes show a mig2-like plant-specific expression pattern and Mzr1 is responsible for their high-level expression during pathogenesis. Mzr1 function requires the b-dependently regulated Cys(2)His(2)-type cell cycle regulator Biz1, indicating that two stage-specific regulators mediate gene expression during host colonization. In spite of a role as transcriptional activator during biotrophic growth, mzr1 is not essential for pathogenesis; however, conditional overexpression interfered with proliferation during vegetative growth and mating ability, caused a cell separation defect, and triggered filamentous growth. We discuss the implications of these findings.	0
Title: New insights into the mechanism of light modulated signaling by heterotrimeric G-proteins: ENVOY acts on gna1 and gna3 and adjusts cAMP levels in Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) Abstract: Sensing of environmental signals is often mediated by G-protein coupled receptors and their cognate heterotrimeric G-proteins. In Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) the signals transmitted via the G-protein alpha subunits GNA1 and GNA3 cause considerable modulation of cellulase transcript levels and the extent of this adjustment is dependent on the light status. We therefore intended to elucidate the underlying mechanism connecting light response and heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. Analysis of double mutant strains showed that constitutive activation of GNA1 or GNA3 in the absence of the PAS/LOV domain protein ENVOY (ENV1) leads to the phenotype of constitutive G-alpha activation in darkness. In light, however the deletion-phenotype of Δenv1 was observed with respect to growth, conidiation and cellulase gene transcription. Additionally deletion of env1 causes decreased intracellular cAMP accumulation, even upon constitutive activation of GNA1 or GNA3. While supplementation of cAMP caused an even more severe growth phenotype of all strains lacking env1 in light, addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor caffeine rescued the growth phenotype of these strains. ENV1 is consequently suggested to connect the light response pathway with nutrient signaling by the heterotrimeric G-protein cascade by adjusting transcript levels of gna1 and gna3 and action on cAMP levels - presumably through inhibition of a phosphodiesterase.	0
Title: Discovery of the leinamycin family of natural products by mining actinobacterial genomes Abstract: Nature's ability to generate diverse natural products from simple building blocks has inspired combinatorial biosynthesis. The knowledge-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis has allowed the production of designer analogs by rational metabolic pathway engineering. While successful, structural alterations are limited, with designer analogs often produced in compromised titers. The discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis complements the knowledge-based approach by exploring the vast combinatorial biosynthesis repertoire found in Nature. Here we showcase the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis by targeting the domain of unknown function and cysteine lyase domain (DUF-SH) didomain, specific for sulfur incorporation from the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic machinery, to discover the LNM family of natural products. By mining bacterial genomes from public databases and the actinomycetes strain collection at The Scripps Research Institute, we discovered 49 potential producers that could be grouped into 18 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis of the DUF-SH didomains. Further analysis of the representative genomes from each of the clades identified 28 lnm-type gene clusters. Structural diversities encoded by the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries were predicted based on bioinformatics and confirmed by in vitro characterization of selected adenylation proteins and isolation and structural elucidation of the guangnanmycins and weishanmycins. These findings demonstrate the power of the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity and highlight Nature's rich biosynthetic repertoire. Comparative analysis of the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries provides outstanding opportunities to dissect Nature's biosynthetic strategies and apply these findings to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity.	1
Title: Identification of a gene cluster for the synthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid in the plant pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans Abstract: Leptosphaeria maculans is an ascomycetous fungus that causes the disease blackleg on Brassica napus (canola). In spite of the importance of the disease worldwide, the mechanisms of disease development are poorly understood. Secondary metabolites, which are one of the common virulence factors of pathogenic fungi, have not been extensively explored from this fungus. An RNA-seq dataset was examined to find genes responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis by this fungus during infection. One polyketide synthase gene, pks5, was found to be upregulated during the early biotrophic stage of development. In addition to pks5, six other genes adjacent to the pks5 gene, including one encoding a Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor abscisic acid-like 7 gene (abl7), were also upregulated during that time. A striking feature of the L. maculans genome is that it contains large AT-rich regions that are gene-poor and large GC-rich regions that are gene rich. This set of seven co-regulated genes is embedded within and separated by two such AT-rich regions. Three of the genes in the cluster have similarities to those known to be involved in the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) in other fungi. When L. maculans is grown in axenic culture the genes in this cluster are not expressed and ABA is not produced. Overexpressing abl7, encoding the putative transcription factor, resulted in the transcription of the six adjacent genes in axenic culture and in the production of ABA, as detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Mutation of two genes of the cluster using CRISPR/Cas9 did not affect pathogenicity on canola cotyledons. The characterization of the ABA gene cluster has led to the discovery of the co-regulation of genes within an AT-rich region by a transcription factor, and the first report of the plant hormone abscisic acid being produced by L. maculans.	1
Title: Genome mining and biosynthesis of kitacinnamycins as a STING activator Abstract: Cinnamoyl-containing nonribosomal peptides (CCNPs) are a small group of secondary metabolites with potent biological activities produced by actinobacteria. Two remarkable features in the biosynthesis of CCNPs include the nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) for assembly of the depsipeptide backbone and the type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) for N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety construction. Here, we present a genome mining approach targeting both NRPS and type II PKS for discovery of new CCNPs, which led to the identification of 51 putative CCNP gene clusters from public bacterial genome databases. After strain prioritization, a novel class of CCNP-type glycopeptides named kitacinnamycins, one of which showing potent activation ability towards the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, was identified. Bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical analysis revealed the use of the NRPS assembly line to form the macrocyclic peptide backbone, followed by a P450 monooxygenase to generate terminal oxidized groups. A glycosyltransferase with relatively broad substrate specificity transfers sugars to the newly generated OH/COOH group. The protein crystallographic study further provided structural insights into this glycosylation. Our results not only demonstrated the feasibility of genome mining and strain prioritization for the discovery of new bioactive natural products but also disclosed the biosynthetic pathway for kitacinnamycins.	1
Title: Transcription and genetic analyses of a putative N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase in Borrelia burgdorferi Abstract: In this study, a putative N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase gene (bb0666) was identified in the genome of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. This protein shares c. 30% identity with its counterparts from other bacteria. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that bb0666 along with two other genes (bb0665 and bb0667) are cotranscribed with the motility and chemotaxis genes. This newly identified operon is termed as pami. Sequence and primer extension analyses showed that pami was regulated by a sigma(70)-like promoter, which is designated as P(ami). Transcriptional analysis using a gene encoding green fluorescence protein as a reporter demonstrated that P(ami) functions in both Escherichia coli and B. burgdorferi. Genetic studies showed that the Deltabb0666 mutant grows in long chains of unseparated cells, whose phenotype is similar to its counterparts in E. coli. Taken together, these results demonstrate that bb0666 is a homolog of MurNac-LAAs that contributes to the cell division of B. burgdorferi.	0
Title: Genetic analysis of a unique bacteriocin, Smb, produced by Streptococcus mutans GS5 Abstract: A dipeptide lantibiotic, named Smb, in Streptococcus mutans GS5 was characterized by molecular genetic approaches. The Smb biosynthesis gene locus is encoded by a 9.5-kb region of chromosomal DNA and consists of seven genes in the order smbM1, -T, -F, -M2, -G, -A, -B. This operon is not present in some other strains of S. mutans, including strain UA159. The genes encoding Smb were identified as smbA and smbB. Inactivation of smbM1, smbA, or smbB attenuated the inhibition of the growth of the indicator strain RP66, confirming an essential role for these genes in Smb expression. Mature Smb likely consists of the 30-amino-acid SmbA together with the 32-amino-acid SmbB. SmbA exhibited similarity with the mature lantibiotic lacticinA2 from Lactococcus lactis, while SmbB was similar to the mersacidin-like peptides from Bacillus halodurans and L. lactis. We also demonstrated that Smb expression is induced by the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and that a com box-like sequence is located in the smb promoter region. These results suggest that Smb belongs to the class I bacteriocin family, and its expression is dependent on CSP-induced quorum sensing.	1
Title: A novel reporter system for molecular imaging and high-throughput screening of anticancer drugs Abstract: Apoptosis is irreversible programmed cell death, characterized by a cellular cascade activation of caspase 3, which subsequently degrades proteins and other components of cells with a motif sequence. Here we report a novel reporter system to detect apoptosis, growth arrest, and cell death based on controlled and self-amplified protein degradation. The key element of the reporter system is an apoptotic sensor chimerical protein which consists of three components: procaspase 3, ubiquitin (Ub), and a strong consensus sequence of N-degron. Between each of these units is a DEVD (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) sequence, which acts as the cleavage target of caspase 3. This non-conventional signal loss approach is much more sensitive than other native methods that are based on signal gain. The superior sensitivity is demonstrated by its effective application in 386-well high-throughput screening (HTS) with low drug concentrations and a short incubation time. The HTS selection process using this reporter system is very simple and economic. The simplicity eliminates potential errors introduced by multiple steps; there is no need for any substrate. Furthermore, the cells in the assay need not be disrupted, and the morphology of the cells can provide additional information on mechanisms. After HTS, the intact cells can also be used for other analytic analysis. This system thus has a potentially important role in the discovery and development of new anticancer drugs. It also appears to be very versatile, can be used both in vitro and in vivo with different linked reporter genes, and can be used for a variety of imaging applications.	0
Title: Bioprospecting the microbiome of Red Sea Atlantis II brine pool for peptidases and biosynthetic genes with promising antibacterial activity Abstract: Background:                       The search for novel antimicrobial agents is crucial as antibiotic-resistant pathogens continue to emerge, rendering the available antibiotics no longer effective. Likewise, new anti-cancer drugs are needed to combat the emergence of multi-drug resistant tumors. Marine environments are wealthy sources for natural products. Additionally, extreme marine environments are interesting niches to search for bioactive natural compounds. In the current study, a fosmid library of metagenomic DNA isolated from Atlantis II Deep Lower Convective Layer (ATII LCL), was functionally screened for antibacterial activity as well as anticancer effects.                  Results:                       Two clones exhibited antibacterial effects against the marine Bacillus Cc6 strain, namely clones 102-5A and 88-1G and they were further tested against eleven other challenging strains, including six safe relatives of ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.), a safe relative to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and four resistant clinical isolates. Clone 88-1G resulted in clear zones of inhibition against eight bacterial strains, while clone 102-5A resulted in zones of inhibition against five bacterial strains. The whole cell lysates of clone 88-1G showed 15% inhibition of Mtb ClpP protease -Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug target-, while whole cell lysates of clone 102-5A showed 19% inhibition of Mtb ClpP protease. Whole cell lysates from the selected clones exhibited anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast cancer cells (cell viability at 50% v/v was 46.2% ± 9.9 for 88-1G clone and 38% ± 7 for 102-5A clone), U2OS osteosarcoma cells (cell viability at 50% v/v was 64.6% ± 12.3 for 88-1G clone and 28.3% ± 1.7 for 102-5A clone) and 1BR hTERT human fibroblast cells (cell viability at 50% v/v was 74.4% ± 5.6 for 88-1G clone and 57.6% ± 8.9 for 102-5A clone). Sequencing of 102-5A and 88-1G clones, and further annotation detected putative proteases and putative biosynthetic genes in clones 102-5A and 88-1G, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The ATII LCL metagenome hosts putative peptidases and biosynthetic genes that confer antibiotic and anti-cancer effects. The tested clones exhibited promising antibacterial activities against safe relative strains to ESKAPE pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, searching the microbial dark matter of extreme environments is a promising approach to identify new molecules with pharmaceutical potential use.	0
Title: First Report on Chitin in a Non-Verongiid Marine Demosponge: The Mycale euplectellioides Case Abstract: Sponges (Porifera) are recognized as aquatic multicellular organisms which developed an effective biochemical pathway over millions of years of evolution to produce both biologically active secondary metabolites and biopolymer-based skeletal structures. Among marine demosponges, only representatives of the Verongiida order are known to synthetize biologically active substances as well as skeletons made of structural polysaccharide chitin. The unique three-dimensional (3D) architecture of such chitinous skeletons opens the widow for their recent applications as adsorbents, as well as scaffolds for tissue engineering and biomimetics. This study has the ambitious goal of monitoring other orders beyond Verongiida demosponges and finding alternative sources of naturally prestructured chitinous scaffolds; especially in those demosponge species which can be cultivated at large scales using marine farming conditions. Special attention has been paid to the demosponge Mycale euplectellioides(Heteroscleromorpha: Poecilosclerida: Mycalidae) collected in the Red Sea. For the first time, we present here a detailed study of the isolation of chitin from the skeleton of this sponge, as well as its identification using diverse bioanalytical tools. Calcofluor white staining, Fourier-transform Infrared Spcetcroscopy (FTIR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence microscopy, as well as a chitinase digestion assay were applied in order to confirm with strong evidence the finding of a-chitin in the skeleton of M. euplectellioides. We suggest that the discovery of chitin within representatives of the Mycale genus is a promising step in their evaluation of these globally distributed sponges as new renewable sources for both biologically active metabolites and chitin, which are of prospective use for pharmacology and biomaterials oriented biomedicine, respectively.	0
Title: Knockout of the erythromycin biosynthetic cluster gene, eryBI, blocks isoflavone glucoside bioconversion during erythromycin fermentations in Aeromicrobium erythreum but not in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Isoflavone glucosides are valuable nutraceutical compounds and are present in commercial fermentations, such as the erythromycin fermentation, as constituents of the soy flour in the growth medium. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for recovery of the isoflavone glucosides as value-added coproducts at the end of either Saccharopolyspora erythraea or Aeromicrobium erythreum fermentation. Because the first step in isoflavone metabolism was known to be the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones by a beta-glucosidase, we chose to knock out the only beta-glucosidase gene known at the start of the study, eryBI, to see what effect this had on metabolism of isoflavone glucosides in each organism. In the unicellular erythromycin producer A. erythreum, knockout of eryBI was sufficient to block the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones. In S. erythraea, knockout of eryBI had no effect on this reaction, suggesting that other beta-glucosidases are present. Erythromycin production was not significantly affected in either strain as a result of the eryBI knockout. This study showed that isoflavone metabolism could be blocked in A. erythreum by eryBI knockout but that eryBI knockout was not sufficient to block isoflavone metabolism in S. erythraea.	1
Title: Ketoreductase Domain Dysfunction Expands Chemodiversity: Malyngamide Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium Okeania hirsuta Abstract: Dozens of type A malyngamides, principally identified by a decorated six-membered cyclohexanone headgroup and methoxylated lyngbic acid tail, have been isolated over several decades. Their environmental sources include macro- and microbiotic organisms, including sea hares, red alga, and cyanobacterial assemblages, but the true producing organism has remained enigmatic. Many type A analogues display potent bioactivity in human-health related assays, spurring an interest in this molecular class and its biosynthetic pathway. Here, we present the discovery of the type A malyngamide biosynthetic pathway in the first sequenced genome of the cyanobacterial genus Okeania. Bioinformatic analysis of two cultured Okeania genome assemblies identified 62 and 68 kb polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) pathways with unusual loading and termination genes. NMR data of malyngamide C acetate derived from 13C-substrate-fed cultures provided evidence that an intact octanoate moiety is transferred to the first KS module via a LipM homologue originally associated with lipoic acid metabolism and implicated an inactive ketoreductase (KR0) as critical for six-membered ring formation, a hallmark of the malyngamide family. Phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling of the penultimate KR0 domain inferred structural cofactor binding and active site alterations as contributory to domain dysfunction, which was confirmed by recombinant protein expression and NADPH binding assay. The carbonyl retained from this KR0 ultimately enables an intramolecular Knoevenagel condensation to form the characteristic cyclohexanone ring. Understanding this critical step allows assignment of a biosynthetic model for all type A malyngamides, whereby well-characterized tailoring modifications explain the surprising proliferation and diversity of analogues.	1
Title: Mechanistic and structural basis of stereospecific Cbeta-hydroxylation in calcium-dependent antibiotic, a daptomycin-type lipopeptide Abstract: Non-ribosomally synthesized lipopeptide antibiotics of the daptomycin type are known to contain unnatural beta-modified amino acids, which are essential for bioactivity. Here we present the biochemical and structural basis for the incorporation of 3-hydroxyasparagine at position 9 in the 11-residue acidic lipopeptide lactone calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA). Direct hydroxylation of l-asparagine by AsnO, a non-heme Fe(2+)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase encoded by the CDA biosynthesis gene cluster, was validated by Fmoc derivatization of the reaction product and LC/MS analysis. The 1.45, 1.92, and 1.66 A crystal structures of AsnO as apoprotein, Fe(2+) complex, and product complex, respectively, with (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyasparagine and succinate revealed the stereoselectivity and substrate specificity of AsnO. The comparison of native and product-complex structures of AsnO showed a lid-like region (residues F208-E223) that seals the active site upon substrate binding and shields it from sterically demanding peptide substrates. Accordingly, beta-hydroxylated asparagine is synthesized prior to its incorporation into the growing CDA peptide. The AsnO structure could serve as a template for engineering novel enzymes for the synthesis of beta-hydroxylated amino acids.	1
Title: Biphasic control logic of HAMP domain signalling in the Escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor Abstract: HAMP domains mediate input-output communication in many bacterial signalling proteins. To explore the dynamic bundle model of HAMP signalling (Zhou et al., Mol. Microbiol. 73: 801, 2009), we characterized the signal outputs of 118 HAMP missense mutants of the serine chemoreceptor, Tsr, by flagellar rotation patterns. Receptors with proline or charged amino acid replacements at critical hydrophobic packing residues in the AS1 and AS2 HAMP helices had locked kinase-off outputs, indicating that drastic destabilization of the Tsr-HAMP bundle prevents kinase activation, both in the absence and presence of the sensory adaptation enzymes, CheB and CheR. Attractant-mimic lesions that enhance the structural stability of the HAMP bundle also suppressed kinase activity, demonstrating that Tsr-HAMP has two kinase-off output states at opposite extremes of its stability range. HAMP mutants with locked-on kinase outputs appeared to have intermediate bundle stabilities, implying a biphasic relationship between HAMP stability and kinase activity. Some Tsr-HAMP mutant receptors exhibited reversed output responses to CheB and CheR action that are readily explained by a biphasic control logic. The findings of this study provide strong support for a three-state dynamic bundle model of HAMP signalling in Tsr, and possibly in other bacterial transducers as well.	0
Title: Cloning, expression, and regulation of the Pseudomonas cepacia protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes Abstract: The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) were cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment into the broad-host-range cloning vector pRO2317. The resultant clone was able to complement protocatechuate 3,4-dioxugenase mutations in P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. Expression studies showed that the genes were constitutively expressed and subject to catabolite repression in the heterologous host. Since the cloned genes exhibited normal induction patterns when present in P. cepacia DBO1, it was concluded that induction was subject to negative control. Regulatory studies with P. cepacia wild-type and mutant strains showed that protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase is induced either by protocatechuate or by beta-carboxymuconate. Further studies of P. cepacia DBO1 showed that p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2), the preceding enzyme in the pathway, is induced by p-hydroxybenzoate and that beta-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction following protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, is induced by both p-hydroxybenzoate and beta-ketoadipate.	0
Title: Analysis of the Indole Diterpene Gene Cluster for Biosynthesis of the Epoxy-Janthitrems in Epichloë Endophytes Abstract: Epoxy-janthitrems are a class of indole diterpenes with structural similarity to lolitrem B. Two taxa of asexual Epichloë endophytes have been reported to produce epoxy-janthitrems, LpTG-3 (Lolium perenne Taxonomic Group 3; e.g., NEA12) and LpTG-4 (e.g., E1). Epichloë epoxy-janthitrems are not well understood, the biosynthetic pathway and associated gene complement have not been described and while the literature suggests they are associated with superior protection against pasture insect pests and are tremorgenic in grazing mammals, these properties have not been confirmed using isolated and purified compounds. Whole genome sequence analysis was used to identify candidate genes for epoxy-janthitrem biosynthesis that are unique to epoxy-janthitrem producing strains of Epichloë. A gene, jtmD, was identified with homology to aromatic prenyl transferases involved in synthesis of indole diterpenes. The location of the epoxy-janthitrem biosynthesis gene cluster (JTM locus) was determined in the assembled nuclear genomes of NEA12 and E1. The JTM locus contains cluster 1 and cluster 2 of the lolitrem B biosynthesis gene cluster (LTM locus), as well as four genes jtmD, jtmO, jtm01, and jtm02 that are unique to Epichloë spp. that produce epoxy-janthitrems. Expression of each of the genes identified was confirmed using transcriptome analysis of perennial ryegrass-NEA12 and perennial ryegrass-E1 symbiota. Sequence analysis confirmed the genes are functionally similar to those involved in biosynthesis of related indole diterpene compounds. RNAi silencing of jtmD and in planta assessment in host-endophyte associations confirms the role of jtmD in epoxy-janthitrem production. Using LCMS/MS technologies, a biosynthetic pathway for the production of epoxy-janthitrems I-IV in Epichloë endophytes is proposed.	1
Title: Deciphering deazapurine biosynthesis: pathway for pyrrolopyrimidine nucleosides toyocamycin and sangivamycin Abstract: Pyrrolopyrimidine nucleosides analogs, collectively referred to as deazapurines, are an important class of structurally diverse compounds found in a wide variety of biological niches. In this report, a cluster of genes from Streptomyces rimosus (ATCC 14673) involved in production of the deazapurine antibiotics sangivamycin and toyocamycin was identified. The cluster includes toyocamycin nitrile hydratase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of toyocamycin to sangivamycin. In addition to this rare nitrile hydratase, the cluster encodes a GTP cyclohydrolase I, linking the biosynthesis of deazapurines to folate biosynthesis, and a set of purine salvage/biosynthesis genes, which presumably convert the guanine moiety from GTP to the adenine-like deazapurine base found in toyocamycin and sangivamycin. The gene cluster presented here could potentially serve as a model to allow identification of deazapurine biosynthetic pathways in other bacterial species.	1
Title: Cyanobacterial Dihydroxyacid Dehydratases Are a Promising Growth Inhibition Target Abstract: Microbes are essential to the global ecosystem, but undesirable microbial growth causes issues ranging from food spoilage and infectious diseases to harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The use of chemicals to control microbial growth has achieved significant success, while specific roles for a majority of essential genes in growth control remain unexplored. Here, we show the growth inhibition of cyanobacterial species by targeting an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Specifically, we report the biochemical, genetic, and structural characterization of dihydroxyacid dehydratase from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SnDHAD). Our studies suggest that SnDHAD is an oxygen-stable enzyme containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SnDHAD is selectively inhibited in vitro and in vivo by the natural product aspterric acid, which also inhibits the growth of representative bloom-forming Microcystis and Anabaena strains but has minimal effects on microbial pathogens with [4Fe-4S] containing DHADs. This study suggests DHADs as a promising target for the precise growth control of microbes and highlights the exploration of other untargeted essential genes for microbial management.	0
Title: A comparison of the clavam biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces antibioticus Tü1718 and Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: The production of clavam metabolites has been studied previously in Streptomyces clavuligerus , a species that produces clavulanic acid as well as 4 other clavam compounds, but the late steps of the pathway leading to the specific end products are unclear. The present study compared the clavam biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces antibioticus , chosen because it produces only 2 clavam metabolites and no clavulanic acid, with that of S. clavuligerus. A cosmid library of S. antibioticus genomic DNA was screened with a clavaminate synthase-specific probe based on the corresponding genes from S. clavuligerus, and 1 of the hybridizing cosmids was sequenced in full. A clavam gene cluster was identified that shows similarities to that of S. clavuligerus but also contains a number of novel genes. Knock-out mutation of the clavaminate synthase gene abolished clavam production in S. antibioticus, confirming the identity of the gene cluster. Knock-out mutation of a novel gene encoding an apparent oxidoreductase also abolished clavam production. A potential clavam biosynthetic pathway consistent with the genes in the cluster and the metabolites produced by S. antibioticus, and correspondingly different from that of S. clavuligerus, is proposed.	1
Title: Turncoat Polypeptides: We Adapt to Our Environment Abstract: A common interpretation of Anfinsen's hypothesis states that one amino acid sequence should fold into a single, native, ordered state, or a highly similar set thereof, coinciding with the global minimum in the folding-energy landscape, which, in turn, is responsible for the function of the protein. However, this classical view is challenged by many proteins and peptide sequences, which can adopt exchangeable, significantly dissimilar conformations that even fulfill different biological roles. The similarities and differences of concepts related to these proteins, mainly chameleon sequences, metamorphic proteins, and switch peptides, which are all denoted herein "turncoat" polypeptides, are reviewed. As well as adding a twist to the conventional view of protein folding, the lack of structural definition adds clear versatility to the activity of proteins and can be used as a tool for protein design and further application in biotechnology and biomedicine.	0
Title: Natural product diversity associated with the nematode symbionts Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus Abstract: Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus species dedicate a large amount of resources to the production of specialized metabolites derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or polyketide synthase (PKS). Both bacteria undergo symbiosis with nematodes, which is followed by an insect pathogenic phase. So far, the molecular basis of this tripartite relationship and the exact roles that individual metabolites and metabolic pathways play have not been well understood. To close this gap, we have significantly expanded the database for comparative genomics studies in these bacteria. Clustering the genes encoded in the individual genomes into hierarchical orthologous groups reveals a high-resolution picture of functional evolution in this clade. It identifies groups of genes-many of which are involved in secondary metabolite production-that may account for the niche specificity of these bacteria. Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus appear very similar at the DNA sequence level, which indicates their close evolutionary relationship. Yet, high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses reveal a huge chemical diversity in the two taxa. Molecular network reconstruction identified a large number of previously unidentified metabolite classes, including the xefoampeptides and tilivalline. Here, we apply genomic and metabolomic methods in a complementary manner to identify and elucidate additional classes of natural products. We also highlight the ability to rapidly and simultaneously identify potentially interesting bioactive products from NRPSs and PKSs, thereby augmenting the contribution of molecular biology techniques to the acceleration of natural product discovery.	1
Title: Sumoylation in Aspergillus nidulans: sumO inactivation, overexpression and live-cell imaging Abstract: Sumoylation, the reversible covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) peptides has emerged as an important regulator of target protein function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not in Schizosaccharyomes pombe, deletion of the gene encoding SUMO peptides is lethal. We have characterized the SUMO-encoding gene, sumO, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The sumO gene was deleted in a diploid and sumODelta haploids were recovered. The mutant was viable but exhibited impaired growth, reduced conidiation and self-sterility. Overexpression of epitope-tagged SumO peptides revealed multiple sumoylation targets in A. nidulans and SumO overexpression resulted in greatly increased levels of protein sumoylation without obvious phenotypic consequences. Using five-piece fusion PCR, we generated a gfp-sumO fusion gene expressed from the sumO promoter for live-cell imaging of GFP-SumO and GFP-SumO-conjugated proteins. Localization of GFP-SumO is dynamic, accumulating in punctate spots within the nucleus during interphase, lost at the onset of mitosis and re-accumulating during telophase.	0
Title: Functional characterization of tlmH in Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC 31158 unveiling new insight into tallysomycin biosynthesis and affording a novel bleomycin analog Abstract: Tallysomycins (TLMs) belong to the bleomycin (BLM) family of anticancer antibiotics and differ from the BLMs principally by the presence of a 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-L-talose attached to C-41 of the TLM backbone as part of a glycosylcarbinolamide. To facilitate an understanding of the differences in anticancer activities observed between TLMs and BLMs, we thought to generate des-talose TLM analogs by engineering TLM biosynthesis in Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC 31158. Here we report (i) the engineering of the DeltatlmH mutant SB8005 strain that produces the two TLM analogs, TLM H-1 and TLM H-2, (ii) production, isolation, and structural elucidation of TLM H-1 and TLM H-2 by NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses as the desired des-talose TLM analogs, and (iii) comparison of the DNA cleavage activities of TLM H-1 with selected TLMs and BLMs. These findings support the previous functional assignment of tlmH to encode an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase and unveil the TlmH-catalyzed hydroxylation at both C-41 and C-42 and the TlmK-catalyzed glycosylation of a labile carbinolamide intermediate as the final two steps for TLM biosynthesis. TlmH is apparently distinct from other enzymes known to catalyze carbinolamide formation. The availability of TLM H-1 now sets the stage to study the TlmH enzymology in vitro and to elucidate the exact contribution of the l-talose to the anticancer activities of TLMs in vivo.	1
Title: A suite of asymmetric citrate siderophores isolated from a marine Shewanella species Abstract: Woodybactins A-D are a suite of new fatty acyl siderophores produced by the luminous marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi MS32. While this bacterium has a set of genes homologous to the biosynthetic gene cluster for aerobactin, aerobactin is not produced. The arrangement of these genes within the genome differs in S. woodyi MS32 when compared to E. coli and other species producing siderophores similar to aerobactin, and one synthetase gene which would append a second acyl-hydroxylysine to the terminal carboxylate of citrate is not functional. Within the suite of woodybactins A-D, which differ by the fatty acid appendage, one contains an unusual C9 (9:0) fatty acid and one contains a unique branched C9 iso (9:0 iso) fatty acid, as well as a C8 (8:0) and C10 (10:0) fatty acid.	1
Title: Orthogonally aligned cyclic BODIPY arrays with long-lived triplet excited states as efficient heavy-atom-free photosensitizers Abstract: In photosensitizers, long triplet excited state lifetimes are key to their efficient electron transfer or energy transfer processes. Herein, we report a novel class of cyclic trimeric BODIPY arrays which were efficiently generated from easily accessible meso-mesityldipyrrinone and arylboronic acids in one pot. Arylboronic acid, for the first time, was used to provide a boron source for BODIPY derivatives. Due to the well-defined and orthogonally aligned BODIPY cores as verified by X-ray crystallography, these BODIPY arrays show strong exciton coupling effects and efficient intersystem crossings, and are novel heavy-atom-free photosensitizers with a long-lived triplet excited state (lifetime up to 257.5 μs) and good reactive oxygen species generation efficiency (up to 0.72) contributed by both 1O2 and O2 -˙ under light irradiation.	0
Title: Strain-specific proteogenomics accelerates the discovery of natural products via their biosynthetic pathways Abstract: The use of proteomics for direct detection of expressed pathways producing natural products has yielded many new compounds, even when used in a screening mode without a bacterial genome sequence available. Here we quantify the advantages of having draft DNA-sequence available for strain-specific proteomics using the latest in ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry for both proteins and the small molecules they generate. Using the draft sequence of Streptomyces lilacinus NRRL B-1968, we show a >tenfold increase in the number of peptide identifications vs. using publicly available databases. Detected in this strain were six expressed gene clusters with varying homology to those known. To date, we have identified three of these clusters as encoding for the production of griseobactin (known), rakicidin D (an orphan NRPS/PKS hybrid cluster), and a putative thr and DHB-containing siderophore produced by a new non-ribosomal peptide sythetase gene cluster. The remaining three clusters show lower homology to those known, and likely encode enzymes for production of novel compounds. Using an interpreted strain-specific DNA sequence enables deep proteomics for the detection of multiple pathways and their encoded natural products in a single cultured bacterium.	1
Title: Incorporation of P and Growth of Pseudomonad UP-2 on n-Tetracosane Abstract: Cultures of the marine pseudomonad UP-2 growing on n-tetracosane contained both free cells and cells bound to the solid hydrocarbon. After separation by filtration through a Whatman no. 1 filter, the numbers of free and bound cells were estimated from the amount of P incorporated into each fraction and the determined value of P incorporation per viable cell in the filtrate (free cells). During the early exponential growth phase, over 80% of the cells were bound to large pieces of n-tetracosane; as the culture approached the stationary phase, the number of bound cells remained constant, whereas free cells continued to accumulate. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that cells grew both on the surface of the solid and in the aqueous medium. During the growth cycle, a portion of the n-tetracosane which was initially nonfilterable was recovered in the filtrate in a form which was largely cell associated. This cell-associated n-tetracosane was preferentially utilized and could completely account for the observed growth of free cells.	0
Title: Genetic analysis of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The genes encoding the production of acidocin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus strain M46 which is active against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium sporogenes, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, but inactive against most other Lactobacillus species, were previously localized on a 4 kb XbaI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pCV461. In the present work, DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive ORFs, which potentially code for hydrophobic peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 amino acids, respectively, and a fourth ORF of opposite polarity which could potentially encode a peptide of 59 amino acids. The middle ORF (ORF-2; acdB) was identified as the gene encoding acidocin B by comparing the amino acid composition of highly purified acidocin B with the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF-2. Our results suggest that acidocin B is synthesized as a precursor which is processed at a site which conforms to the ' -3, -1' rules of von Heijne to yield active acidocin B (59 amino acids). The presence of an immunity-protein-encoding gene on the 4 kb XbaI-BamHI fragment was deduced from the capacity of a plasmid vector harbouring this fragment to confer immunity upon transformation of L. fermentum NCK127. One of the three non-assigned ORFs may encode this immunity protein.	1
Title: Geographic distance and pH drive bacterial distribution in alkaline lake sediments across Tibetan Plateau Abstract: Continent-scale biogeography has been extensively studied in soils and marine systems, but little is known about biogeographical patterns in non-marine sediments. We used barcode pyrosequencing to quantify the effects of local geochemical properties and geographic distance for bacterial community structure and membership, using sediment samples from 15 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (4-1670 km apart). Bacterial communities were surprisingly diverse, and distinct from soil communities. Four of 26 phyla detected were dominant: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, albeit 20.2% of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. As previously observed in acidic soil, pH was the dominant factor influencing alkaline sediment community structure, phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r=0.443, P=0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%). Together, our results show that pH is the best predictor of bacterial community structure in alkaline sediments, and confirm that both geographic distance and chemical factors govern bacterial biogeography in lake sediments.	0
Title: Quartromicin biosynthesis: two alternative polyketide chains produced by one polyketide synthase assembly line Abstract: The antiviral compounds quartromicins represent unique members of a family of spirotetronate natural products. In this study, a biosynthetic gene cluster of quartromicins was identified by degenerate primer PCR amplification of specific genes involved in the biosynthesis of the tetronate moiety. The biochemical results confirmed that 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate was incorporated into the tetronate ring, and the intermediates of this ring were also reconstructed in vitro. The data also suggested a module skipping strategy for the production of two alternative polyketide chains by the same polyketide synthase assembly line. These findings set the stage for further investigations of the stereodivergent intermolecular cyclization mechanism, and highlight how nature has constructed this type of C2 symmetric molecule through intermolecular dimerization.	1
Title: Discovery of the Showdomycin Gene Cluster from Streptomyces showdoensis ATCC 15227 Yields Insight into the Biosynthetic Logic of C-Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Nucleoside antibiotics are a large class of pharmaceutically relevant chemical entities, which exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. Most nucleosides belong to the canonical N-nucleoside family, where the heterocyclic unit is connected to the carbohydrate through a carbon-nitrogen bond. However, atypical C-nucleosides were isolated from Streptomyces bacteria over 50 years ago, but the molecular basis for formation of these metabolites has been unknown. Here, we have sequenced the genome of S. showdoensis ATCC 15227 and identified the gene cluster responsible for showdomycin production. Key to the detection was the presence of sdmA, encoding an enzyme of the pseudouridine monophosphate glycosidase family, which could catalyze formation of the C-glycosidic bond. Sequence analysis revealed an unusual combination of biosynthetic genes, while inactivation and subsequent complementation of sdmA confirmed the involvement of the locus in showdomycin formation. The study provides the first steps toward generation of novel C-nucleosides by pathway engineering.	1
Title: Fumagillin, a Mycotoxin of Aspergillus fumigatus: Biosynthesis, Biological Activities, Detection, and Applications Abstract: Fumagillin is a mycotoxin produced, above all, by the saprophytic filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This mold is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause invasive aspergillosis, a disease that has high mortality rates linked to it. Its ability to adapt to environmental stresses through the production of secondary metabolites, including several mycotoxins (gliotoxin, fumagillin, pseurotin A, etc.) also seem to play an important role in causing these infections. Since the discovery of the A. fumigatus fumagillin in 1949, many studies have focused on this toxin and in this review we gather all the information currently available. First of all, the structural characteristics of this mycotoxin and the different methods developed for its determination are given in detail. Then, the biosynthetic gene cluster and the metabolic pathway involved in its production and regulation are explained. The activity of fumagillin on its target, the methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP2) enzyme, and the effects of blocking this enzyme in the host are also described. Finally, the applications that this toxin and its derivatives have in different fields, such as the treatment of cancer and its microsporicidal activity in the treatment of honeybee hive infections with Nosema spp., are reviewed. Therefore, this work offers a complete review of all the information currently related to the fumagillin mycotoxin secreted by A. fumigatus, important because of its role in the fungal infection process but also because it has many other applications, notably in beekeeping, the treatment of infectious diseases, and in oncology.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the gene for the M(r) 32,000 thylakoid membrane protein from Spinacia oleracea and Nicotiana debneyi predicts a totally conserved primary translation product of M(r) 38,950 Abstract: The gene for the so-called M(r) 32,000 rapidly labeled photosystem II thylakoid membrane protein (here designated psbA) of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts is located on the chloroplast DNA in the large single-copy region immediately adjacent to one of the inverted repeat sequences. In this paper we show that the size of the mRNA for this protein is approximately 1.25 kilobases and that the direction of transcription is towards the inverted repeat unit. The nucleotide sequence of the gene and its flanking regions is presented. The only large open reading frame in the sequence codes for a protein of M(r) 38,950. The nucleotide sequence of psbA from Nicotiana debneyi also has been determined, and comparison of the sequences from the two species shows them to be highly conserved (>95% homology) throughout the entire reading frame. Conservation of the amino acid sequence is absolute, there being no changes in a total of 353 residues. This leads us to conclude that the primary translation product of psbA must be a protein of M(r) 38,950. The protein is characterized by the complete absence of lysine residues and is relatively rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which tend to be clustered. Transcription of spinach psbA starts about 86 base pairs before the first ATG codon. Immediately upstream from this point there is a sequence typical of that found in E. coli promoters. An almost identical sequence occurs in the equivalent region of N. debneyi DNA.	0
Title: Five-Membered Cyclitol Phosphate Formation by a myo-Inositol Phosphate Synthase Orthologue in the Biosynthesis of the Carbocyclic Nucleoside Antibiotic Aristeromycin Abstract: Aristeromycin is a unique carbocyclic nucleoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces citricolor. In order to elucidate its intriguing carbocyclic formation, we used a genome-mining approach to identify the responsible enzyme. In silico screening with known cyclitol synthases involved in primary metabolism, such as myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) and dehydroqunate synthase (DHQS), identified a unique MIPS orthologue (Ari2) encoded in the genome of S. citricolor. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster containing ari2 with a cosmid vector in Streptomyces albus resulted in the production of aristeromycin, thus indicating that the cloned DNA region (37.5 kb) with 33 open reading frames contains its biosynthetic gene cluster. We verified that Ari2 catalyzes the formation of a novel five-membered cyclitol phosphate from d-fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) with NAD+ as a cofactor. This provides insight into cyclitol phosphate synthase as a member of the MIPS family of enzymes. A biosynthetic pathway to aristeromycin is proposed based on bioinformatics analysis of the gene cluster.	1
Title: The sypA, sypS, and sypC synthetase genes encode twenty-two modules involved in the nonribosomal peptide synthesis of syringopeptin by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D Abstract: Syringopeptin is a necrosis-inducing phytotoxin, composed of 22 amino acids attached to a 3-hydroxy fatty acid tail. Syringopeptin, produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, functions as a virulence determinant in the plant-pathogen interaction. A 73,800-bp DNA region was sequenced, and analysis identified three large open reading frames, sypA, sypB, and sypC, that are 16.1, 16.3, and 40.6 kb in size. Sequence analysis of the putative SypA, SypB, and SypC sequences determined that they are homologous to peptide synthetases, containing five, five, and twelve amino acid activation modules, respectively. Each module exhibited characteristic domains for condensation, aminoacyl adenylation, and thiolation. Within the aminoacyl adenylation domain is a region responsible for substrate specificity. Phylogenetic analysis of the substrate-binding pockets resulted in clustering of the 22 syringopeptin modules into nine groups. This clustering reflects the substrate amino acids predicted to be recognized by each of the respective modules based on placement of the syringopeptin NRPS (nonribosomal peptide synthetase) system in the linear (type A) group. Finally, SypC contains two C-terminal thioesterase domains predicted to catalyze the release of syringopeptin from the synthetase and peptide cyclization to form the lactone ring. The syringopeptin synthetases, which carry 22 NRPS modules, represent the largest linear NRPS system described for a prokaryote.	1
Title: Synthesis of amidines using N-allyl ynamides. A palladium-catalyzed allyl transfer through an ynamido-pi-allyl complex Abstract: A de novo transformation of N-allyl-N-sulfonyl ynamides to amidines is described featuring a palladium-catalyzed N-to-C allyl transfer via ynamido-palladium-pi-allyl complexes.	0
Title: Allelic variants of the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopZ1 are differentially recognized by plant resistance systems Abstract: The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae depends on the type III secretion system and type III-secreted effectors to cause disease in plants. HopZ is a diverse family of type III effectors widely distributed in P. syringae isolates. Among the HopZ homologs, HopZ1 is ancient to P. syringae and has been shown to be under strong positive selection driven by plant resistance-imposed selective pressure. Here, we characterized the virulence and avirulence functions of the three HopZ1 alleles in soybean and Nicotiana benthamiana. In soybean, HopZ1 alleles have distinct functions: HopZ1a triggers defense response, HopZ1b promotes bacterial growth, and HopZ1c has no observable effect. In N. benthamiana, HopZ1a and HopZ1b both induce plant defense responses. However, they appear to trigger different resistance pathways, evidenced by two major differences between HopZ1a- and HopZ1b-triggered hypersensitive response (HR): i) the putative N-acylation sites had no effect on HopZ1a-triggered cell death, whereas it greatly enhanced HopZ1b-triggered cell death; and ii) the HopZ1b-triggered HR, but not the HopZ1a-triggered HR, was suppressed by another HopZ homolog, HopZ3. We previously demonstrated that HopZ1a most resembled the ancestral allelic form of HopZ1; therefore, this new evidence suggested that differentiated resistance systems have evolved in plant hosts to adapt to HopZ1 diversification in P. syringae.	0
Title: Post-polyketide synthase steps in iso-migrastatin biosynthesis, featuring tailoring enzymes with broad substrate specificity Abstract: The iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS) biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 consists of 11 genes, featuring an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK. Systematic inactivation of mgsIJK in S. platensis enabled us to (i) identify two nascent products of the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS, establishing an unprecedented novel feature for AT-less type I PKSs, and (ii) account for the formation of all known post-PKS biosynthetic intermediates generated by the three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK, which possessed significant substrate promiscuities.	1
Title: Autoproteolytic fragments are intermediates in the oligomerization/aggregation of the Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein as revealed by ion mobility mass spectrometry Abstract: Gas-phase protein separation by ion mobility: With its ability to separate the Parkinson's disease protein α-synuclein and its autoproteolytic products-despite the small concentrations of the latter-ion-mobility MS has enabled the characterization of intermediate fragments in in vitro oligomerization-aggregation. In particular, a possible key fragment, the highly aggregating C-terminal fragment, αSyn(72-140), has been revealed.	0
Title: Chemical Probes to Directly Profile Palmitoleoylation of Proteins Abstract: Palmitoleoylation is a unique fatty acylation of proteins in which a monounsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (C16:1), is covalently attached to a protein. Wnt proteins are known to be palmitoleoylated by cis-Δ9 palmitoleate at conserved serine residues. O-palmitoleoylation plays a critical role in regulating Wnt secretion, binding to the receptors, and in the dynamics of Wnt signaling. Therefore, protein palmitoleoylation is important in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Chemical probes based on saturated fatty acids, such as ω-alkynyl palmitic acid (Alk-14 or Alk-C16 ), have been used to study Wnt palmitoleoylation. However, such probes require prior conversion to the unsaturated fatty acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in cells, significantly decreasing their selectivity and efficiency for studying protein palmitoleoylation. We synthesized and characterized ω-alkynyl cis- and trans-palmitoleic acids (cis- and trans-Alk-14:1) as chemical probes to directly study protein palmitoleoylation. We found that cis-Alk-14:1 could more efficiently label Wnt proteins in cells. Interestingly, the DHHC family of palmitoyl acyltransferases can charge both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, potentially using both as acyl donors in protein palmitoylation and palmitoleoylation. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of targets labeled by these probes revealed new cis- and trans-palmitoleoylated proteins. Our studies provided new chemical tools and revealed new insights into palmitoleoylation in cell signaling.	0
Title: Collaborative Biosynthesis of a Class of Bioactive Azaphilones by Two Separate Gene Clusters Containing Four PKS/NRPSs with Transcriptional Crosstalk in Fungi Abstract: Azaphilones are a family of fungal polyketide metabolites with diverse chemical structures and biological activities with a highly oxygenated pyranoquinone bicyclic core. Here, a class of azaphilones possessing a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic ring system was identified in Aspergillus terreus, and exhibited potential anticancer activities. The gene deletions and biochemical investigations demonstrated that these azaphilones were collaboratively synthesized by two separate clusters containing four core-enzymes, two nonreducing PKSs, one highly reducing PKS, and one NRPS-like. More interestingly, we found that the biosynthesis is coordinately regulated by a crosstalk mechanism between these two gene clusters based on three transcriptional factors. This is a meaningful mechanism of fungal secondary metabolism, which allows fungi to synthesize more complex compounds and gain new physiological functions. The results provide a new insight into fungal natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Molecular dynamics of β-hairpin models of epigenetic recognition motifs Abstract: The conformations and stabilities of the β-hairpin model peptides of Waters (Riemen, A. J.; Waters, M. L. Biochemistry 2009, 48, 1525; Hughes, R. M.; Benshoff, M. L.; Waters, M. L. Chemistry 2007, 13, 5753) have been experimentally characterized as a function of lysine ε-methylation. These models were developed to explore molecular recognition of known epigenetic recognition motifs. This system offered an opportunity to computationally examine the role of cation-π interactions, desolvation of the ε-methylated ammonium groups, and aromatic/aromatic interactions on the observed differences in NMR spectra. AMOEBA, a second-generation force field (Ponder, J. W.; Wu, C.; Ren, P.; Pande, V. S.; Chodera, J. D.; Schnieders, M. J.; Haque, I.; Mobley, D. L.; Lambrecht, D. S.; DiStasio, R. A., Jr.; Head-Gordon, M.; Clark, G. N.; Johnson, M. E.; Head-Gordon, T. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 2549), was chosen as it includes both multipole electrostatics and polarizability thought to be essential to accurately characterize such interactions. Independent parametrization of ε-methylated amines was required from which aqueous solvation free energies were estimated and shown to agree with literature values. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) using the derived parameters with model peptides, such as Ac-R-W-V-W-V-N-G-Orn-K(Me)(n)-I-L-Q-NH(2), where n = 0, 1, 2, or 3, were conducted in explicit solvent. Distances between the centers of the indole rings of the two-tryptophan residues, 2 and 4, and the ε-methylated ammonium group on Lys-9 as well as the distance between the N- and C-termini were monitored to estimate the strength and orientation of the cation-π and aromatic/aromatic interactions. In agreement with the experimental data, the stability of the β-hairpin increased significantly with lysine ε-methylation. The ability of MD simulations to reproduce the observed NOEs for the four peptides was further estimated for the monopole-based force fields, AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLSAA. AMOEBA correctly predicted over 80% of the observed NOEs for all 4 peptides, while the three-monopole force fields were 40-50% predictive in only 2 cases and approximately 10% in the other 10 examples. Preliminary analysis suggests that the decreased cost of desolvation of the substituted ammonium group significantly compensated for the reduced cation-π interaction resulting from the increased separation due to steric bulk of the ε-methylated amines.	0
Title: Microbial desulfonation of substituted naphthalenesulfonic acids and benzenesulfonic acids Abstract: Sulfur-limited batch enrichment cultures containing one of nine multisubstituted naphthalenesulfonates and an inoculum from sewage yielded several taxa of bacteria which could quantitatively utilize 19 sulfonated aromatic compounds as the sole sulfur source for growth. Growth yields were about 4 kg of protein per mol of sulfur. Specific degradation rates were about 4 to 14 mu kat/kg of protein. A Pseudomonas sp., an Arthrobacter sp., and an unidentified bacterium were examined. Each desulfonated at least 16 aromatic compounds, none of which served as a carbon source. Pseudomonas sp. strain S-313 converted 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 5-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, and 3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid to 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol, 5-amino-1-naphthol, phenol, and 3-aminophenol, respectively. Experiments with 18O2 showed that the hydroxyl group was derived from molecular oxygen.	0
Title: Synthesis, characterization, and studies on DNA binding of the complex Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H(2)O) Abstract: A new metal complex, Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H2O) (where Sal is salicylaldehyde and dien is diethylenetriamine), has been synthesized and characterized. The interactions between the Fe(III) complex and calf thymus DNA has been investigated using UV and fluorescence spectra, viscosity, thermal denaturation, and molecular modeling. The cleavage reaction on plasmid DNA has been monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. The experimental results show that the mode of binding of the complex to DNA is classical intercalation and the complex can cleave pBR322 DNA.	0
Title: Regulating the Rate of Molecular Self-Assembly for Targeting Cancer Cells Abstract: Besides tight and specific ligand-receptor interactions, the rate regulation of the formation of molecular assemblies is one of fundamental features of cells. But the latter receives little exploration for developing anticancer therapeutics. Here we show that a simple molecular design of the substrates of phosphatases-tailoring the number of phosphates on peptidic substrates-is able to regulate the rate of molecular self-assembly of the enzyme reaction product. Such a rate regulation allows selective inhibition of osteosarcoma cells over hepatocytes, which promises to target cancer cells in a specific organ. Moreover, our result reveals that the direct measurement of the rate of the self-assembly in a cell-based assay provides precise assessment of the cell targeting capability of self-assembly. This work, as the first report establishing rate regulation of a multiple-step process to inhibit cells selectively, illustrates a fundamentally new approach for controlling the fate of cells.	0
Title: Formation of an Angular Aromatic Polyketide from a Linear Anthrene Precursor via Oxidative Rearrangement Abstract: Bacterial aromatic polyketides are a group of natural products synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) that show diverse structures and biological activities. They are structurally subclassified into linear, angular, and discoid aromatic polyketides, the formation of which is commonly determined by the shaping and folding of the poly-β-keto intermediates under the concerted actions of the minimal PKSs, cyclases and ketoreductases. Murayaquinone, found in several streptomycetes, possesses an unusual tricyclic angular aromatic polyketide core containing a 9,10-phenanthraquinone. In this study, genes essential for murayaquinone biosynthesis were identified, and a linear anthraoxirene intermediate was discovered. A unique biosynthetic model for the angular aromatic polyketide formation was discovered and confirmed through in vivo and in vitro studies. Three oxidoreductases, MrqO3, MrqO6, and MrqO7, were identified to catalyze the conversion of the linear aromatic polyketide intermediate into the final angularly arranged framework, which exemplifies a novel strategy for the biosynthesis of angular aromatic polyketides.	1
Title: Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid Abstract: Enzymatic beacons, or E-beacons, are 1 : 1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C-terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E-beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C-terminal protein-cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site-specifically to mono-sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E-beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx-A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence-specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E-beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl-quenched E-beacons specific for SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E-beacons (80×10-12 M) reported wild-type SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at ≥1×10-9 M by increased bioluminescence of 8-fold. E-beacon prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E-beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E-beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.	0
Title: A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster from a non-marine Brevundimonas that synthesizes hydroxylated astaxanthin Abstract: A Brevundimonas vesicularis strain DC263 isolated from surface soil was shown to produce hydroxylated astaxanthin. A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster containing ten genes was cloned from strain DC263, among which eight genes were involved in carotenoid synthesis. In addition to the crtW gene encoding the 4,4'-beta-ionone ring ketolase and the crtZ gene encoding the 3,3'-beta-ionone ring hydroxylase that were responsible for astaxanthin synthesis, the cluster also contained a novel gene crtG identified recently encoding the 2,2'-beta-ionone ring hydroxylase that further hydroxylate astaxanthin. The individual genes in the DC263 cluster showed the highest sequence similarities to the corresponding genes reported in Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212, a marine isolate that also produced hydroxylated astaxanthin. The genetic organization of the carotenoid synthesis gene clusters in the two Brevundimonas strains was identical. It is likely that the two Brevundimonas strains were evolved from the same ancestor and adapted later to growth in different environments. Expression of the crtW and crtZ from DC263 in a beta-carotene-accumulating E. coli produced astaxanthin as the predominant carotenoid. The crtG from DC263 and the crtG from another Brevundimonas aurantiaca strain were expressed in E. coli producing different carotenoid substrates. Both CrtG showed low activity on beta-carotene and high activity on zeaxanthin. The main difference was that the CrtG from B. aurantiaca worked well on canthaxanthin or astaxanthin, but the CrtG from DC263 did not work on either of the ketocarotenoids.	1
Title: Ultrahigh-throughput screening of industrial enzyme-producing strains by droplet-based microfluidic system Abstract: Droplet-based microfluidics has emerged as a powerful tool for single-cell screening with ultrahigh throughput, but its widespread application remains limited by the accessibility of a droplet microfluidic high-throughput screening (HTS) platform, especially to common laboratories having no background in microfluidics. Here, we first developed a microfluidic HTS platform based on fluorescence-activated droplet sorting technology. This platform allowed (i) encapsulation of single cells in monodisperse water-in-oil droplets; (ii) cell growth and protein production in droplets; and (iii) sorting of droplets based on their fluorescence intensities. To validate the platform, a model selection experiment of a binary mixture of Bacillus strains was performed, and a 45.6-fold enrichment was achieved at a sorting rate of 300 droplets per second. Furthermore, we used the platform for the selection of higher α-amylase-producing Bacillus licheniformis strains from a mutant library generated by atmospheric and room temperature plasma mutagenesis, and clones displaying over 50% improvement in α-amylase productivity were isolated. This droplet screening system could be applied to the engineering of other industrially valuable strains.	0
Title: Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the sisomicin biosynthetic gene cluster from Micromonospora inyoensis Abstract: Micromonospora inyoensis produces sisomicin (Sm), an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The gene cluster of sisomicin biosynthesis spanning ca. 47 kb consists of 37 ORFs encoding various proteins for sisomicin biosynthesis, regulation, resistance and transport. The comparative genetic studies on the biosynthetic genes of sisomicin and gentamicin (Gm) reveal a similar biosynthetic route and provide a framework for the future biosynthetic studies.	1
Title: Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) attack causes a dramatic shift in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in wheat Abstract: Carbon and nitrogen (C/N) metabolism and allocation within the plant have important implications for plant-parasite interactions. Many plant parasites manipulate the host by inducing C/N changes that benefit their own survival and growth. Plant resistance can prevent this parasite manipulation. We used the wheat-Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) system to analyze C/N changes in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. The Hessian fly is an insect but shares many features with plant pathogens, being sessile during feeding stages and having avirulence (Avr) genes that match plant resistance genes in gene-for-gene relationships. Many wheat genes involved in C/N metabolism were differentially regulated in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. In plants during compatible interactions, the content of free carbon-containing compounds decreased 36%, whereas the content of free nitrogen-containing compounds increased 46%. This C/N shift was likely achieved through a coordinated regulation of genes in a number of central metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino-acid synthesis. Our data on plants during compatible interactions support recent findings that Hessian fly larvae create nutritive cells at feeding (attack) sites and manipulate host plants to enhance their own survival and growth. In plants during incompatible interactions, most of the metabolic genes examined were not affected or down-regulated.	0
Title: Discovery of Ibomycin, a Complex Macrolactone that Exerts Antifungal Activity by Impeding Endocytic Trafficking and Membrane Function Abstract: Natural products are invaluable historic sources of drugs for infectious diseases; however, the discovery of novel antimicrobial chemical scaffolds has waned in recent years. Concurrently, there is a pressing need for improved therapeutics to treat fungal infections. We employed a co-culture screen to identify ibomycin, a large polyketide macrolactone that has preferential killing activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. Using chemical and genome methods, we determined the structure of ibomycin and identified the biosynthetic cluster responsible for its synthesis. Chemogenomic profiling coupled with cell biological assays link ibomycin bioactivity to membrane function. The preferential activity of ibomycin toward C. neoformans is due to the ability of the compound to selectively permeate its cell wall. These results delineate a novel antifungal agent that is produced by one of the largest documented biosynthetic clusters to date and underscore the fact that there remains significant untapped chemical diversity of natural products with application in antimicrobial research.	1
Title: A molecular platinum cluster junction: a single-molecule switch Abstract: We present a theoretical study of electron transport through single-molecule junctions incorporating a Pt(6) metal cluster bound within an organic framework. The insertion of this molecule between a pair of electrodes leads to a fully atomically engineered nanometallic device with high conductance at the Fermi level and two sequential high on/off switching states. The origin of this property can be traced back to the existence of a degenerate HOMO consisting of two asymmetric orbitals with energies close to the Fermi level of the metal leads. The degeneracy is broken when the molecule is contacted to the leads, giving rise to two resonances that become pinned to the Fermi level and display destructive interference.	0
Title: SimC7 Is a Novel NAD(P)H-Dependent Ketoreductase Essential for the Antibiotic Activity of the DNA Gyrase Inhibitor Simocyclinone Abstract: Simocyclinone D8 (SD8) is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040. The simocyclinone (sim) biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway has been proposed. The tetraene linker in SD8 was suggested to be the product of a modular type I polyketide synthase working in trans with two monofunctional enzymes. One of these monofunctional enzymes, SimC7, was proposed to supply a dehydratase activity missing from two modules of the polyketide synthase. In this study, we report the function of SimC7. We isolated the entire ~72-kb sim cluster on a single phage artificial chromosome clone and produced simocyclinone heterologously in a Streptomyces coelicolor strain engineered for improved antibiotic production. Deletion of simC7 resulted in the production of a novel simocyclinone, 7-oxo-SD8, which unexpectedly carried a normal tetraene linker but was altered in the angucyclinone moiety. We demonstrate that SimC7 is an NAD(P)H-dependent ketoreductase that catalyzes the conversion of 7-oxo-SD8 into SD8. 7-oxo-SD8 was essentially inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor, and the reduction of the keto group by SimC7 was shown to be crucial for high-affinity binding to the enzyme. Thus, SimC7 is an angucyclinone ketoreductase that is essential for the biological activity of simocyclinone.	1
Title: Activation and Characterization of Cryptic Gene Cluster: Two Series of Aromatic Polyketides Biosynthesized by Divergent Pathways Abstract: One biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) usually governs the biosynthesis of a series of compounds exhibiting either the same or similar molecular scaffolds. Reported here is a multiplex activation strategy to awaken a cryptic BGC associated with tetracycline polyketides, resulting in the discovery of compounds having different core structures. By constitutively expressing a positive regulator gene in tandem mode, a single BGC directed the biosynthesis of eight aromatic polyketides with two types of frameworks, two pentacyclic isomers and six glycosylated tetracyclines. The proposed biosynthetic pathway, based on systematic gene inactivation and identification of intermediates, employs two sets of tailoring enzymes with a branching point from the same intermediate. These findings not only provide new insights into the role of tailoring enzymes in the diversification of polyketides, but also highlight a reliable strategy for genome mining of natural products.	1
Title: Insights into the biosynthesis of 12-membered resorcylic acid lactones from heterologous production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The phytotoxic fungal polyketides lasiodiplodin and resorcylide inhibit human blood coagulation factor XIIIa, mineralocorticoid receptors, and prostaglandin biosynthesis. These secondary metabolites belong to the 12-membered resorcylic acid lactone (RAL12) subclass of the benzenediol lactone (BDL) family. Identification of genomic loci for the biosynthesis of lasiodiplodin from Lasiodiplodia theobromae and resorcylide from Acremonium zeae revealed collaborating iterative polyketide synthase (iPKS) pairs whose efficient heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided a convenient access to the RAL12 scaffolds desmethyl-lasiodiplodin and trans-resorcylide, respectively. Lasiodiplodin production was reconstituted in the heterologous host by co-expressing an O-methyltransferase also encoded in the lasiodiplodin cluster, while a glutathione-S-transferase was found not to be necessary for heterologous production. Clarification of the biogenesis of known resorcylide congeners in the heterologous host helped to disentangle the roles that biosynthetic irregularities and chemical interconversions play in generating chemical diversity. Observation of 14-membered RAL homologues during in vivo heterologous biosynthesis of RAL12 metabolites revealed "stuttering" by fungal iPKSs. The close global and domain-level sequence similarities of the orthologous BDL synthases across different structural subclasses implicate repeated horizontal gene transfers and/or cluster losses in different fungal lineages. The absence of straightforward correlations between enzyme sequences and product structural features (the size of the macrocycle, the conformation of the exocyclic methyl group, or the extent of reduction by the hrPKS) suggest that BDL structural variety is the result of a select few mutations in key active site cavity positions.	1
Title: Structure-Activity Relationships for the Marine Natural Product Sintokamides: Androgen Receptor N-Terminus Antagonists of Interest for Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Abstract: Synthetic analogues of the marine natural product sintokamides have been prepared in order to investigate the structure-activity relationships for the androgen receptor N-terminal domain (AR NTD) antagonist activity of the sintokamide scaffold. An in vitro LNCaP cell-based transcriptional activity assay with an androgen-driven luciferase (Luc) reporter was used to monitor the potency of analogues. The data have shown that the chlorine atoms on the leucine side chains are essential for potent activity. Analogues missing the nonchlorinated methyl groups of the leucine side chains (C-1 and C-17) are just as active and in some cases more active than the natural products. Analogues with the natural R configuration at C-10 and the unnatural R configuration at C-4 are most potent. Replacing the natural propionamide N-terminus cap with the more sterically hindered pivaloylamide N-terminus cap leads to enhanced potency. The tetramic acid fragment and the methyl ether on the tetramic acid fragment are essential for activity. The SAR optimized analogue 76 is more selective, easier to synthesize, more potent, and presumed to be more resistant to proteolysis than the natural sintokamides.	0
Title: Chromosomal replication origin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi functions in Escherichia coli: oriC consensus sequence Abstract: The chromosomal replication origin (oriC) of Vibrio harveyi has been isolated on a plasmid and shown to function as an origin in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the V. harveyi oriC was determined. From a comparison of this sequence with oriC sequences of five enteric bacteria, we derived a consensus sequence of bacterial origins that function in E. coli. This consensus sequence identifies 122 positions within oriC where nucleotide substitutions can occur without loss of origin function. These positions are clustered rather than scattered. Four interrelated nine-base-pair repeats and eight of the dam methylation G-A-T-C sites are conserved in the consensus sequence. Very few relative insertion-deletion changes occur, and these are localized to one region of oriC. The genes for three polypeptides linked to the V. harveyi oriC were identified by using in vitro protein synthesis directed by deletion derivative plasmid templates. One of these genes, coding for a 58,000 Mr polypeptide and located 3.0 kilobase pairs from the V. harveyi oriC region, is lethal to E. coli when many copies (approximately 40 per cell) are present (high copy lethal or HCL gene). In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that a different gene, the gid gene to the left of oriC, is highly conserved between E. coli and V. harveyi, whereas the coding region to the right of oriC is much less conserved.	0
Title: Possible involvement of ActVI-ORFA in transcriptional regulation of actVI tailoring-step genes for actinorhodin biosynthesis Abstract: The actinorhodin biosynthetic gene (act) cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor carries a functionally unknown gene, actVI-ORFA. We have characterized an ActVI-ORFA disruptant by functional complementation and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression profiles of the act genes. Introduction of the functional actVI-ORFA gene into the disruptant restored actinorhodin production to an extent similar to that seen in the wild-type cells and abolished the accumulation of actinorhodin biosynthetic intermediates and shunt products specific for actVI mutants. Thus, unique phenotypes observed in the mutant are solely dependent on the function of actVI-ORFA. The disruptant was shown to yield significantly lower levels of the transcripts for certain act genes, especially for the actVI-ORF1-VA-ORF2 transcription unit, leading to the accumulation of the intermediates and shunt products. The functional actVI-ORFA gene restored expression of actVI-ORF1, which encodes a key reductase in the actinorhodin tailoring step, in the mutant cells, indicating a possible regulatory role of ActVI-ORFA.	1
Title: Development and use of a selectable, broad-host-range reporter transposon for identifying environmentally regulated promoters in bacteria Abstract: This report describes the development and use of TnKnXSp, a selectable broad-host-range reporter transposon with a promoterless aphA gene. Insertion of TnKnXSp into the chromosome of a kanamycin-susceptible bacterium confers resistance to kanamycin only if aphA is transcribed from an active promoter adjacent to the insertion site. We designed TnKnXSp as a tool for identifying environmentally regulated promoters in bacteria and developed general methods for initial characterization of any TnKnXSp integrant. To identify putative iron-regulated promoters in Corynebacterium diphtheriae, we constructed TnKnXSp integrants and identified a subgroup that expressed kanamycin resistance under low-iron, but not high-iron, conditions. We characterized representative integrants with this phenotype, located the TnKnXSp insertion in each, and demonstrated that transcription of aphA was repressed under high-iron vs. low-iron growth conditions. We also demonstrated that TnKnXSp can be used in bacteria other than C. diphtheriae, including Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Our findings validate TnKnXSp as a useful tool for identifying environmentally regulated promoters in bacteria.	0
Title: N-Phenylacetylation and Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases with Substrate Promiscuity for Biosynthesis of Heptapeptide Variants, JBIR-78 and JBIR-95 Abstract: JBIR-78 (1) and JBIR-95 (2), both of which are heptapeptide derivatives isolated from Kibdelosporangium sp. AK-AA56, have the same amino acid sequences except for the second amino acid: phenylacetic acid (Paa)-l-Val-d-Asp (1)/d-cysteic acid (2)-l-Ala-(3S)-3-hydroxy-d-Leu-Gly-d-Ala-l-Phe. Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster including genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and in vitro assays with recombinant Orf3, an l-cysteic acid synthase homologue, suggested the single A domain in module 2 activates both l-Asp and l-cysteic acid to yield 1 and 2, respectively, although the substrate specificities of the A domains of NRPSs are usually strict. Biosynthetic mechanism of introduction of N-terminal Paa was also investigated. Recombinant Orf1 and Orf2 similar to subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzed the conversion of phenylpyruvate into phenylacetyl-CoA together with dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase whose encoding gene is located outside of the gene cluster. Moreover, we showed that phenylacetyl-CoA was directly condensed with l-Val, which was tethered to a peptidyl carrier protein, at the first condensation domain in the NRPS.	1
Title: An unusual amide synthetase (CouL) from the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A1 produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 contains two amide bonds. The biosynthetic gene cluster of coumermycin contains a putative amide synthetase gene, couL, encoding a protein of 529 amino acids. CouL was overexpressed as hexahistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, resulting in a nearly homogenous protein. CouL catalysed the formation of both amide bonds of coumermycin A1, i.e. between the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and two aminocoumarin moieties. Gel exclusion chromatography showed that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The activity was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The apparent Km values were determined as 26 micro m for the 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and 44 micro m for the aminocoumarin moiety, respectively. Several analogues of the pyrrole dicarboxylic acid were accepted as substrates. In contrast, pyridine carboxylic acids were not accepted. 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the acyl component in novobiocin biosynthesis, was well accepted, despite its structural difference from the genuine acyl substrate of CouL.	1
Title: Microtubule dynamics in mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans is very rapid, requiring less than 5 min at 37 °C in germlings (Bergen and Morris, 1983). In this time the cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) must disassemble, the mitotic spindle assemble, function and disassemble, and cytoplasmic MTs reassemble. It follows that cytoplasmic MTs must be extremely dynamic in this period and we were interested, in particular, in examining the processes of MT disassembly in prophase and reassembly in anaphase and telophase. We observed a diploid strain that expressed GFP-α-tubulin. We used a spinning disk confocal microscope that allowed rapid image capture, which proved necessary because microtubule dynamics were extremely rapid. We found, for the first time, that microtubule severing occurs in prophase in a filamentous fungus and that catastrophe rather than nucleation limits astral microtubule growth.	0
Title: Gene regulation in response to overexpression of cytochrome P450 and proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: (CYP52A4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the mRNA differential display technique, six genes were found to be up-regulated: ASN2, MDJ1, YLR194c, YNL208w, YER175, and YGL121c. Genes coding for Dur1.2p, Dal2p, and Sps19p were down-regulated. Two strongly induced genes, which were found to accommodate the peroxisome box (YLR194c) and a 10-bp consensus sequence of genes involved in lipid metabolism (YNL208w) in their promoter regions, were further analyzed with respect to the course of induction, the necessity of the P450 membrane anchor for induction, and the effects of gene disruption on P450Cm2 overexpression. We found that both genes are not essential to overproduce P450Cm2, but their induction was dependent on P450Cm2 membrane integration.	0
Title: Characterization of the colistin (polymyxin E1 and E2) biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Colistin is a mixture of polymyxin E1 and E2, bactericidal pentacationic lipopeptides used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Industrial production of colistin is obtained by a fermentation process of the natural producer Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus. NonRibosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) coding the biosynthesis of polymyxins A, B and P have been recently described, rendering thereof the improvement of their production possible. However, the colistin biosynthesis pathway was not published so far. In this study, a Paenibacillus alvei has been identified by biochemical (Api 50 CH system) and molecular (16S rDNA sequencing) methods. Its culture supernatant displayed inhibitory activity against Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp.). Two polymyxins, E1 and E2, were recovered from the supernatant and were characterized by high resolution LC-MS. A genomic library (960 clones) was constructed to identify the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of polymyxins. Selection of the clones harbouring the sequences of interest was obtained by a simple PCR-based screening. We used primers targeting NRPS sequences leading to the incorporation of amino acids present in polymyxins E. The sequences from three clones of interest were assembled on 50.4 kb. Thus, five open reading frames corresponding to a new NRPS gene cluster of 41 kb were identified. In silico, analyses revealed the presence of three NRPS implicated in the biosynthesis of polymyxins E. This work provides insightful information on colistin biosynthesis and might contribute to future drug developments in this group of antibiotics.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing and disruption of a gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis Abstract: During the purification of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus, a small protein (CLA) involved in clavulanic acid production co-purified with ACVS. A 24-mer mixed-DNA probe based on the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of CLA was used to isolate the corresponding gene (cla), located near one end of the known cluster of penicillin and cephamycin biosynthetic genes, 5.7 kb downstream from the pcbC gene which encodes isopenicillin-N synthase. The sequence of cla would encode a protein of 313 aa with a high degree of similarity to amidinohydrolase enzymes. The cla gene is located immediately upstream from the previously described clavaminate synthase 2-encoding gene (cs2), and cla homologs were only present in streptomycetes which produced clavam compounds. Replacement of cla with a disrupted copy of the gene blocked the production of clavulanic acid in starch asparagine medium (SA).	1
Title: Biosynthetic pathway for furanosteroid demethoxyviridin and identification of an unusual pregnane side-chain cleavage Abstract: Furanosteroids, represented by wortmannin, viridin, and demethoxyviridin, are a special group of fungal-derived, highly oxygenated steroids featured by an extra furan ring. They are well-known nanomolar-potency inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and widely used in biological studies. Despite their importance, the biosyntheses of these molecules are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for demethoxyviridin, consisting of 19 genes, and among them 15 biosynthetic genes, including six cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes, are deleted. As a result, 14 biosynthetic intermediates are isolated, and the biosynthetic pathway for demethoxyviridin is elucidated. Notably, the pregnane side-chain cleavage requires three enzymes: flavin-dependent Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, esterase, and dehydrogenase, in sharp contrast to the single cytochrome P450-mediated process in mammalian cells. Structure-activity analyses of these obtained biosynthetic intermediates reveal that the 3-keto group, the C1β-OH, and the aromatic ring C are important for the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.	1
Title: An iterative type I polyketide synthase PKSN catalyzes synthesis of the decaketide alternapyrone with regio-specific octa-methylation Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster containing five genes, alt1-5, was cloned from Alternaria solani, a causal fungus of early blight disease to tomato and potato. Homology searching indicated that the alt1, 2, and 3 genes code for cytochrome P450s and the alt4 gene for a FAD-dependent oxygenase/oxidase. The alt5 gene encodes a polyketide synthase (PKS), named PKSN, that was found to be an iterative type I complex reduced-type PKS with a C-methyltransferase domain. To identify the PKSN function, the alt5 gene was introduced into the fungal host Aspergillus oryzae under an alpha-amylase promoter. The transformant produced a polyketide compound, named alternapyrone, whose structure is shown to be 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-6-(1,3,5,7,11,13-hexamethyl-3,5,11-pentadecatrienyl)-pyran-2-one. Labeling experiments confirmed that alternapyrone is a decaketide with octa-methylation from methionine on every C(2) unit except the third unit.	1
Title: A Single-Chain Photoswitchable CRISPR-Cas9 Architecture for Light-Inducible Gene Editing and Transcription Abstract: Optical control of CRISPR-Cas9-derived proteins would be useful for restricting gene editing or transcriptional regulation to desired times and places. Optical control of Cas9 functions has been achieved with photouncageable unnatural amino acids or by using light-induced protein interactions to reconstitute Cas9-mediated functions from two polypeptides. However, these methods have only been applied to one Cas9 species and have not been used for optical control of different perturbations at two genes. Here, we use photodissociable dimeric fluorescent protein domains to engineer single-chain photoswitchable Cas9 (ps-Cas9) proteins in which the DNA-binding cleft is occluded at baseline and opened upon illumination. This design successfully controlled different species and functional variants of Cas9, mediated transcriptional activation more robustly than previous optogenetic methods, and enabled light-induced transcription of one gene and editing of another in the same cells. Thus, a single-chain photoswitchable architecture provides a general method to control a variety of Cas9-mediated functions.	0
Title: Synthesis of nitric oxide probes with fluorescence lifetime sensitivity Abstract: We present the rationale, synthesis and evaluation of the first activatable fluorescent probe that utilizes fluorescence lifetime change for detection of nitric oxide. The new probe DAP-LT1 features a near-infrared polymethine skeleton with a diaminobenzene functionality incorporated into the meso-position. The probe is partially quenched, and upon reaction with nitric oxide shows an increase in the fluorescence lifetime from 1.08 ns to 1.24 ns.	0
Title: Targeted gene inactivation for the elucidation of deoxysugar biosynthesis in the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The production of erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea requires the synthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose, which serve as substrates for the transfer of the two sugar residues onto the macrolactone ring. The enzymatic activities involved in this process are largely encoded within the ery gene cluster, by two sets of genes flanking the eryA locus that encodes the polyketide synthase. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three such ORFs located immediately downstream of eryA, ORFs 7, 8 and 9. Chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion either in ORF7 or in one of the previously sequenced ORFs 13 and 14 have been constructed and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for eryB mutants. Similarly, chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion in either ORF8, ORF9, or one of the previously sequenced ORFs 17 and 18 have been constructed and shown to accumulate 3-alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, as expected for eryC mutants. The ORF13 (eryBIV), ORF17 (eryCIV) and ORF7 (eryBII) mutants also synthesised small amounts of macrolide shunt metabolites, as shown by mass spectrometry. These results considerably strengthen previous tentative proposals for the pathways for the biosynthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose in Sac. erythraea and reveal that at least some of these enzymes can accommodate alternative substrates.	1
Title: De novo design of protein mimics of B-DNA Abstract: Structural mimicry of DNA is utilized in nature as a strategy to evade molecular defences mounted by host organisms. One such example is the protein Ocr - the first translation product to be expressed as the bacteriophage T7 infects E. coli. The structure of Ocr reveals an intricate and deliberate arrangement of negative charges that endows it with the ability to mimic ∼24 base pair stretches of B-DNA. This uncanny resemblance to DNA enables Ocr to compete in binding the type I restriction modification (R/M) system, and neutralizes the threat of hydrolytic cleavage of viral genomic material. Here, we report the de novo design and biophysical characterization of DNA mimicking peptides, and describe the inhibitory action of the designed helical bundles on a type I R/M enzyme, EcoR124I. This work validates the use of charge patterning as a design principle for creation of protein mimics of DNA, and serves as a starting point for development of therapeutic peptide inhibitors against human pathogens that employ molecular camouflage as part of their invasion stratagem.	0
Title: Gβγ directly modulates vesicle fusion by competing with synaptotagmin for binding to neuronal SNARE proteins embedded in membranes Abstract: Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptors can inhibit neurotransmitter release at synapses via multiple mechanisms. In addition to Gβγ-mediated modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), inhibition can also be mediated through the direct interaction of Gβγ subunits with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex of the vesicle fusion apparatus. Binding studies with soluble SNARE complexes have shown that Gβγ binds to both ternary SNARE complexes, t-SNARE heterodimers, and monomeric SNAREs, competing with synaptotagmin 1(syt1) for binding sites on t-SNARE. However, in secretory cells, Gβγ, SNAREs, and synaptotagmin interact in the lipid environment of a vesicle at the plasma membrane. To approximate this environment, we show that fluorescently labeled Gβγ interacts specifically with lipid-embedded t-SNAREs consisting of full-length syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25B at the membrane, as measured by fluorescence polarization. Fluorescently labeled syt1 undergoes competition with Gβγ for SNARE-binding sites in lipid environments. Mutant Gβγ subunits that were previously shown to be more efficacious at inhibiting Ca2+-triggered exocytotic release than wild-type Gβγ were also shown to bind SNAREs at a higher affinity than wild type in a lipid environment. These mutant Gβγ subunits were unable to inhibit VGCC currents. Specific peptides corresponding to regions on Gβ and Gγ shown to be important for the interaction disrupt the interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. In in vitro fusion assays using full-length t- and v-SNAREs embedded in liposomes, Gβγ inhibited Ca2+/synaptotagmin-dependent fusion. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of these regions for the Gβγ-SNARE interaction and show that the target of Gβγ, downstream of VGCC, is the membrane-embedded SNARE complex.	0
Title: Chemical synthesis and characterization of epicatechin glucuronides and sulfates: bioanalytical standards for epicatechin metabolite identification Abstract: The monoglucuronides and sulfates of epicatechin, 3'-O-methylepicatechin, and 4'-O-methylepicatechin, respectively, were synthesized as authentic bioanalytical standards. Reversed-phase HPLC methods capable of baseline separation of the glucuronides and sulfates have been developed. Both the epicatechin glucuronides and sulfates were stable in the solid state when stored under ambient conditions and in aqueous solution when stored refrigerated. These results should prove invaluable to the research community as analytical standards as well as in future studies of the biological and pharmacological effects of epicatechin in humans.	0
Title: Localization of the ActIII actinorhodin polyketide ketoreductase to the cell wall Abstract: Structurally diverse polyketides provide a rich reservoir of bioactive molecules. Actinorhodin, a model aromatic polyketide, is synthesized by minimal type II polyketide synthase and tailoring enzymes. The ActIII actinorhodin ketoreductase is a key tailoring enzyme in actinorhodin biosynthesis. With purified antibodies against actinorhodin polyketide synthase alpha subunit (KSalpha) and ketoreductase, we conducted systematic localization experiments of the two proteins in Streptomyces coelicolor subproteomes. The results support the membrane location of KSalpha and cell-wall location of ketoreductase. Considering previous evidence that some other tailoring enzymes of actinorhodin biosynthesis may be located outside the cytoplasm, a picture is emerging of an extensive role for extracellular biochemistry in the synthesis of type II polyketide antibiotic.	1
Title: Gold(I)-catalyzed dearomative Rautenstrauch rearrangement: enantioselective access to cyclopenta[b]indoles Abstract: A highly enantioselective dearomative Rautenstrauch rearrangement catalyzed by cationic (S)-DTBM-Segphosgold(I) is reported. This reaction provides a straightforward method to prepare enantioenriched cyclopenta[b]indoles. These studies show vast difference in enantioselectivity in the reactions of propargyl acetates and propargyl acetals in the chiral ligand-controlled Rautenstrauch reaction.	0
Title: Complete sequence of biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for producing triostin A and evaluation of quinomycin-type antibiotics from Streptomyces triostinicus Abstract: Streptomyces triostinicus produces triostin A, an antitumor antibiotic, as its major secondary metabolite. Surprisingly, this strain also produced a trace amount of echinomycin. We sequenced the entire triostin A biosynthetic gene cluster from S. triostinicus, and found that this 36 kilobase-long gene cluster contained an ORF homologous to ecm18 that encodes a thioacetal-forming enzyme responsible for the triostin A-to-echinomycin bioconversion. These findings indicate that, unlike previously thought, S. triostinicus is capable of producing not only triostin A but also echinomycin. Our observation suggests potential value in careful re-analysis for metabolites from previously characterized natural product producers with the current technologies.	1
Title: Replicon typing of plasmids carrying bla CTX-M-1 in Enterobacteriaceae of animal, environmental and human origin Abstract: Objectives:                       The aim of this work was to determine the plasmid replicon profiles of a collection of bla CTX-M-1-positive enterobacterial strains. The isolates originated from chicken in the production pyramid, healthy food-producing animals at slaughter (chicken, calves, and pigs), chicken retail meat, environmental isolates originating from water bodies, and isolates from humans. A selection of IncI and IncN plasmids were characterized by multilocus sequence typing in order to determine their epidemiological relatedness.                  Methods:                       Transconjugants of 74 bla CTX-M-1-positive isolates were analyzed by PCR-based replicon typing and by PCR-based plasmid multilocus sequence typing.                  Results:                       The incompatibility groups detected among the bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids included IncI1, IncN, IncHI1B, IncF, IncFIIS, IncFIB, and IncB/O, with plasmid lineage IncI1/ST3 predominating in isolates from chicken and from humans. Lineage IncN/ST1 was detected mainly in isolates from pigs. For the first time, bla CTX-M-1 genes encoded on IncHI1 plasmids were detected in isolates from cattle and from water bodies.                  Conclusions:                       This study identifies plasmid lineages that are contributing to the dissemination of bla CTX-M-1 genes in the food chain, the environment, and humans.	0
Title: Macrophilones from the Marine Hydroid Macrorhynchia philippina Can Inhibit ERK Cascade Signaling Abstract: Six new macrophilone-type pyrroloiminoquines were isolated and identified from an extract of the marine hydroid Macrorhynchia philippina. The proton-deficient and heteroatom-rich structures of macrophilones B-G (2-7) were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and comparison of their data with those of the previously reported metabolite macrophilone A (1). Compounds 1-7 are the first pyrroloiminoquines to be reported from a hydroid. The macrophilones were shown to inhibit the enzymatic conjugation of SUMO to peptide substrates, and macrophilones A (1) and C (3) exhibit potent and selective cytotoxic properties in the NCI-60 anticancer screen. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a close association of the cytotoxicity profiles of 1 and 3 with two known B-Raf kinase inhibitory drugs. While compounds 1 and 3 showed no kinase inhibitory activity, they resulted in a dramatic decrease in cellular protein levels of selected components of the ERK signal cascade. As such, the chemical scaffold of the macrophilones could provide small-molecule therapeutic leads that target the ERK signal transduction pathway.	0
Title: Phosphorylation as a tool to modulate aggregation propensity and to predict fibril architecture Abstract: Despite the importance of post-translational modifications in controlling the solubility and conformational properties of proteins and peptides, precisely how the aggregation propensity of different peptide sequences is modulated by chemical modification remains unclear. Here we have investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the aggregation propensity of a 13-residue synthetic peptide incorporating one or more phosphate groups at seven different sites at various pH values. Fibril formation was shown to be inhibited when a single phosphate group was introduced at all seven locations in the peptide sequence at pH 7.5, when the phosphate group is fully charged. By contrast, when the same peptides were analysed at pH 1.1, when the phosphate is fully protonated, fibrils from all seven peptide sequences form rapidly. At intermediate pH values (pH 3.6) when the phosphate group is mono-anionic, the aggregation propensity of the peptides was found to be highly dependent on the position of the phosphate group in the peptide sequence. Using this information, combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the peptide sequence, we provide evidence consistent with the peptide forming amyloid fibrils with a class 7 architecture. The results highlight the potential utility of phosphorylation as a method of reversibly controlling the aggregation kinetics of peptide sequences both during and after synthesis. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of the phosphate group to adopt different charge states as a function of pH, and combining experimental insights with atomistic information calculated from MD simulations as pH is varied, we show how the resulting information can be used to predict fibril structures consistent with both datasets, and use these to rationalise their sensitivity of fibrillation kinetics both to the location of the phosphate group and its charge state.	0
Title: Retinal artery occlusion is associated with compositional and functional shifts in the gut microbiome and altered trimethylamine-N-oxide levels Abstract: Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a sight threatening complication of cardiovascular disease and commonly occurs due to underlying atherosclerosis. As cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular has been associated with compositional alterations in the gut microbiome, we investigated this association in patients with clinically confirmed non-arteritic RAO compared to age- and sex-matched controls. On the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased in patients with RAO compared to controls, whereas the opposite applied for the phylum of Proteobacteria. Several genera and species such as Actinobacter, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides stercoris, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were relatively enriched in patients with RAO, whereas others such as Odoribacter, Parasutterella or Lachnospiraceae were significantly lower. Patient's gut microbiomes were enriched in genes of the cholesterol metabolism pathway. The gut derived, pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was significantly higher in patients with RAO compared to controls (p = 0.023) and a negative correlation between relative abundances of genera Parasutterella and Lachnospiraceae and TMAO levels and a positive correlation between relative abundance of genus Akkermansia and TMAO levels was found in study subjects. Our findings proposes that RAO is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome and with elevated TMAO levels, suggesting that RAO could be targeted by microbiome-altering interventions.	0
Title: Selective recognition of choline phosphate by tripodal hexa-urea receptors with dual binding sites: crystal and solution evidence Abstract: Two tripodal hexa-urea receptors functionalized with aromatic terminal groups are capable of binding choline phosphate (CP). Crystal structures of the host-guest complexes reveal that the zwitterion CP is efficiently encapsulated in the tripodal hosts in a dual-site binding mode. The phosphate tail of CP is coordinated by the urea groups and the quaternary ammonium head is bound in a 'composite aromatic box' through cation-π and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Such a partial aromatic binding environment for the Me3N-+ cation mimics that of most enzymes catalyzing the conversion of quaternary ammonium substrates. Moreover, NMR, ESI-MS, and fluorescence studies demonstrate the selective binding and sensing of CP over other competing species such as ADP, ATP, choline and derivatives.	0
Title: Characterization of biosynthetic gene cluster for the production of virginiamycin M, a streptogramin type A antibiotic, in Streptomyces virginiae Abstract: Virginiamycin M (VM) of Streptomyces virginiae is a hybrid polyketide-peptide antibiotic with peptide antibiotic virginiamycin S (VS) as its synergistic counterpart. VM and VS belong to the Streptogramin family, which is characterized by strong synergistic antibacterial activity, and their water-soluble derivatives are a new therapeutic option for combating vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Here, the VM biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from S. virginiae in the 62-kb region located in the vicinity of the regulatory island for virginiamycin production. Sequence analysis revealed that the region consists of 19 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and one C-terminally truncated ORF, encoding hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), typical PKS, enzymes synthesizing precursors for VM, transporters for resistance, regulatory proteins, and auxiliary enzymes. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in VM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene disruption of virA encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS megasynthetase, which resulted in complete loss of VM production without any effect on VS production. To assemble the VM core structure, VirA, VirF, VirG, and VirH consisting, as a whole, of 24 domains in 8 PKS modules and 7 domains in 2 NRPS modules were predicted to act as an acyltransferase (AT)-less hybrid PKS-NRPS, whereas VirB, VirC, VirD, and VirE are likely to be essential for the incorporation of the methyl group into the VM framework by a HMG-CoA synthase-based reaction. Among several uncommon features of gene organization in the VM gene cluster, the lack of AT domain in every PKS module and the presence of a discrete AT encoded by virI are notable. AT-overexpression by an additional copy of virI driven by ermEp() resulted in 1.5-fold increase of VM production, suggesting that the amount of VirI is partly limiting VM biosynthesis.	1
Title: Fermentation conditions and properties of a chitosanase from Acinetobacter sp. C-17 Abstract: A species of bacterium with high chitosanase activity was isolated from soil samples in Haiyan City, China, and identified as an Acinetobacter species. This strain, named Acinetobacter sp. strain C-17, produced a chitosanase that was inducible and secreted into the medium. The optimal conditions for enzyme production were cells used to inoculate a medium containing 1% chitosan (pH 7.0) followed by culture at 30 degrees C. The chitosanase activity reached 1.7 U/ml when strain C-17 was incubated in a 250-ml flask under the optimal conditions for 24 h, and reached 2.8 U/ml when cells were incubated in a 3-l fermentor. The optimal pH and temperature for hydrolysis of chitosanase were 7.0 and 36 degrees C, respectively. The chitosanase activity was stable in the pH range of 5-8 and temperature range of 30-40 degrees C. The chitosanase of the strain was extracted by zinc acetate and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The molecular mass was estimated to be 35.4 kDa by SDS-PAGE.	0
Title: Microbial acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's therapy: recent trends on extraction, detection, irradiation-assisted production improvement and nano-structured drug delivery Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significantly threatening the public health. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are compounds of great interest which can be used as effective agents for the symptomatic treatment of AD. Although plants are considered the largest source for these types of inhibitors, the microbial production of AChE inhibitors represents an efficient, easily manipulated, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and alternative approach. This review highlights the recent advances on the microbial production of AChE inhibitors and summarizes all the previously reported successful studies on isolation, screening, extraction, and detecting methodologies of AChE inhibitors from the microbial fermentation, from the earliest trials to the most promising anti-AD drug, huperzine A (HupA). In addition, improvement strategies for maximizing the industrial production of AChE inhibitors by microbes will be discussed. Finally, the promising applications of nano-material-based drug delivery systems for natural AChE inhibitor (HupA) will also be summarized. KEY POINTS: • AChE inhibitors are potential therapies for Alzheimer's disease. • Microorganisms as alternate sources for prospective production of such inhibitors. • Research advances on extraction, detection, and strategies for production improvement. • Nanotechnology-based approaches for an effective drug delivery for Alzheimer's disease.	0
Title: Competitive activity-based protein profiling identifies aza-β-lactams as a versatile chemotype for serine hydrolase inhibition Abstract: Serine hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme classes in Nature. Most serine hydrolases lack selective inhibitors, which are valuable probes for assigning functions to these enzymes. We recently discovered a set of aza-β-lactams (ABLs) that act as potent and selective inhibitors of the mammalian serine hydrolase protein-phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1). The ABLs inactivate PME-1 by covalent acylation of the enzyme's serine nucleophile, suggesting that they could offer a general scaffold for serine hydrolase inhibitor discovery. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by screening ABLs more broadly against cell and tissue proteomes by competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), leading to the discovery of lead inhibitors for several serine hydrolases, including the uncharacterized enzyme α,β-hydrolase domain-containing 10 (ABHD10). ABPP-guided medicinal chemistry yielded a compound ABL303 that potently (IC(50) ≈ 30 nM) and selectively inactivated ABHD10 in vitro and in living cells. A comparison of optimized inhibitors for PME-1 and ABHD10 indicates that modest structural changes that alter steric bulk can tailor the ABL to selectively react with distinct, distantly related serine hydrolases. Our findings, taken together, designate the ABL as a versatile reactive group for creating first-in-class serine hydrolase inhibitors.	0
Title: Variability of total and pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus densities in northern Gulf of Mexico water and oysters Abstract: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is indigenous to coastal environments and a frequent cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis in the United States, primarily due to raw-oyster consumption. Previous seasonal-cycle studies of V. parahaemolyticus have identified water temperature as the strongest environmental predictor. Salinity has also been identified, although it is evident that its effect on annual variation is not as pronounced. The effects of other environmental factors, both with respect to the seasonal cycle and intraseasonal variation, are uncertain. This study investigated intraseasonal variations of densities of total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus organisms in oysters and overlying waters during the summer of 2004 at two sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Regression analyses indicated significant associations (P < 0.001) between total V. parahaemolyticus densities and salinity, as well as turbidity in water and in oysters at the Mississippi site but not at the Alabama site. Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus organisms in Mississippi oyster and water samples were detected in 56% (9 out of 16) and 78% (43 out of 55) of samples, respectively. In contrast, 44% (7 out of 16) of oyster samples and 30% (14 out of 47) of water samples from Alabama were positive. At both sites, there was greater sample-to-sample variability in pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus densities than in total V. parahaemolyticus densities. These data suggest that, although total V. parahaemolyticus densities may be very informative, there is greater uncertainty when total V. parahaemolyticus densities are used to predict the risk of infection by pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus than previously recognized.	0
Title: A camel passes through the eye of a needle: protein unfolding activity of Clp ATPases Abstract: Clp ATPases are protein machines involved in protein degradation and disaggregation. The common structural feature of Clp ATPases is the formation of ring-shaped oligomers. Recent work has shown that the function of all Clp ATPases is based on an energy-dependent threading of substrates through the narrow pore at the centre of the ring. This review gives an outline of known mechanistic principles of threading machines that unfold protein substrates either before their degradation (ClpA, ClpX, HslU) or during their reactivation from aggregates (ClpB). The place of Clp ATPases within a broad AAA+ superfamily of ATPases associated with various cellular activities suggests that similar mechanisms can be used by other protein machines to induce conformational rearrangements in a wide variety of substrates.	0
Title: Olefin Metathesis in Confined Geometries: A Biomimetic Approach toward Selective Macrocyclization Abstract: The synthesis of macrocycles is severely impeded by concomitant oligomer formation. Here, we present a biomimetic approach that utilizes spatial confinement to increase macrocyclization selectivity in the ring-closing metathesis of various dienes at elevated substrate concentration up to 25 mM using an olefin metathesis catalyst selectively immobilized inside ordered mesoporous silicas with defined pore diameters. By this approach, the ratio between macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) product and all undesired oligomerization products (O) resulting from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization was increased from 0.55, corresponding to 35% MMC product obtained with the homogeneous catalyst, up to 1.49, corresponding to 60% MMC product. A correlation between the MMC/O ratio and the substrate-to-pore-size ratio was successfully established. Modification of the inner pore surface with dimethoxydimethylsilane allowed fine-tuning the effective pore size and reversing surface polarity, which resulted in a further increase of the MMC/O ratio up to 2.2, corresponding to >68% MMC product. Molecular-level simulations in model pore geometries help to rationalize the complex interplay between spatial confinement, specific (substrate and product) interaction with the pore surface, and diffusive transport. These effects can be synergistically adjusted for optimum selectivity by suitable surface modification.	0
Title: A transglutaminase homologue as a condensation catalyst in antibiotic assembly lines Abstract: The unrelenting emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens demands the investigation of antibiotics with new modes of action. The pseudopeptide antibiotic andrimid is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase that catalyses the first committed step in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis. Recently, the andrimid (adm) biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. This establishes a heterologous biological host in which to rapidly probe features of andrimid formation and to use biosynthetic engineering to make unnatural variants of this important and promising new class of antibiotics. Bioinformatic analysis of the adm cluster revealed a dissociated biosynthetic assembly system lacking canonical amide synthases between the first three carrier protein domains. Here we report that AdmF, a transglutaminase (TGase) homologue, catalyses the formation of the first amide bond, an N-acyl-beta-peptide link, in andrimid biosynthesis. Hence, AdmF is a newly discovered biosynthetic enzyme that acts as a stand-alone amide synthase between protein-bound, thiotemplated substrates in an antibiotic enzymatic assembly line. TGases (enzyme class (EC) 2.3.2.13) normally catalyse the cross-linking of (poly)peptides by creating isopeptidic bonds between the gamma-carboxamide group of a glutamine side chain of one protein and various amine donors, including lysine side chains. To the best of our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first report of a TGase-like enzyme recruited for the assembly of an antibiotic. Moreover, genome mining using the AdmF sequence yielded additional TGases in unassigned natural product biosynthetic pathways. With many more microbial genomes being sequenced, such a strategy could potentially unearth biosynthetic pathways producing new classes of antibiotics.	1
Title: Identification of a second tetracycline-inducible polypeptide encoded by Tn10 Abstract: Three Tn10 polypeptides were detected by analyzing the proteins synthesized in ultraviolet light-irradiated Escherichia coli cells after infection with lambda::Tn10. One of these polypeptides was the previously identified 36,000-dalton TET polypeptide. The other two had approximate sizes of 25,000 and 13,000 daltons. The syntheses of both the TET polypeptide and the 25,000-dalton polypeptide were inducible by tetracycline in lambda-immune hosts. Similarly, the synthesis of the TET polypeptide was inducible in nonimmune hosts. However, the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton polypeptide was constitutive in nonimmune hosts. An amber mutation in a gene required for tetracycline resistance on lambda::Tn10 was isolated that eliminated the synthesis of the TET polypeptide in sup+ hosts but not the synthesis of the 25,000-dalton or the 13,000-dalton polypeptides. The expression of tetracycline resistance from wild-type Tn10 was found to be anomalous in E. coli strains carrying the amber suppressors supD, supE, and supF. In general, strains containing these nonsense suppressors were less resistant to tetracycline.	0
Title: Ketosynthase III as a gateway to engineering the biosynthesis of antitumoral benastatin derivatives Abstract: Benastatins are aromatic polyketides from Streptomyces spp. that efficiently inhibit glutathione-S-transferases and induce apoptosis. Their biosynthesis involves a type II polyketide synthase, and a ketoacyl synthase (KAS) III component (BenQ) similar to FabH that is crucial for providing and selecting the rare hexanoate PKS starter unit. The function of BenQ as a KAS III was experimentally proven by point mutation of the active site cysteine. In the mutant several novel short chain fatty acid derived penta- and hexacyclic benastatin derivatives with antiprolieferative activities are formed. Strategies for engineering benastatin biosynthesis were attempted. Synthetic starter units surrogates were not incorporated by block mutants, which suggests that the primer needs to be enzyme-bound. Thus, on the basis of KAS III crystal structures the three-dimensional structure of BenQ was modeled and the predicted substrate-binding tunnel was altered by individual mutations of potential gatekeeping residues (H95A and M99A). However, no significant changes in substrate specificity were observed, indicating that there are other or additional gatekeeping amino acid residues in BenQ or secondary factors including likely protein-protein interactions between BenQ and the PKS complex, and possible conformational changes in BenQ. Finally, a benQ null mutant was complemented with butyrate starter unit biosynthesis genes from the alnumycin biosynthesis gene cluster, which resulted in a great (10x) enhancement in the production of butyrate-primed hexacyclic benastatin derivatives. The successful generation of an alnumycin-benastatin FAS-PKS hybrid pathway highlights the potential of metabolic pathways, which may lead to novel potential therapeutics and increased yields of desired natural products.	1
Title: Nanopharmacological Force Sensing to Reveal Allosteric Coupling in Transporter Binding Sites Abstract: Controversy regarding the number and function of ligand binding sites in neurotransmitter/sodium symporters arose from conflicting data in crystal structures and molecular pharmacology. Here, we have designed novel tools for atomic force microscopy that directly measure the interaction forces between the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the S- and R-enantiomers of citalopram on the single molecule level. This approach is based on force spectroscopy, which allows for the extraction of dynamic information under physiological conditions thus inaccessible via X-ray crystallography. Two distinct populations of characteristic binding strengths of citalopram to SERT were revealed in Na(+)-containing buffer. In contrast, in Li(+) -containing buffer, SERT showed only low force interactions. Conversely, the vestibular mutant SERT-G402H merely displayed the high force population. These observations provide physical evidence for the existence of two binding sites in SERT when accessed in a physiological context. Competition experiments revealed that these two sites are allosterically coupled and exert reciprocal modulation.	0
Title: Variants of the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA influence the ribosomal scanning and translation efficiency Abstract: The p53 protein is one of the major cell cycle regulators. The protein is expressed as at least twelve protein isoforms resulting from the use of alternative promoters, alternative splicing or downstream initiation codons. Importantly, there is growing evidence that translation initiation of p53 mRNA may be regulated by the structure and length of the naturally occurring variants of the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA transcripts. Here, several mRNA constructs were synthesized with variable length of the p53 5'-terminal regions and encoding luciferase reporter protein, and their translation was monitored continuously in situ in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Moreover, four additional mRNA constructs were prepared. In two constructs, the structural context of AUG1 initiation codon was altered while in the other two constructs, characteristic hairpin motifs present in the p53 5'-terminal region were changed. Translation of the last two constructs was also performed in the presence of the cap analogue to test the function of the 5'-terminal region in cap-independent translation initiation. Superposition of several structural factors connected with the length of the 5'-terminal region, stable elements of the secondary structure, structural environment of the initiation codon and IRES elements greatly influenced the ribosomal scanning and translation efficiency.	0
Title: A Desaturase-Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids Abstract: Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro- and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N-acyltransferase and a non-heme diiron desaturase-like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable-isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.	1
Title: MK800-62F1, a new inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, from Streptomyces diastatochromogenes MK800-62F1. I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation, physico-chemical properties and biological activity Abstract: A new compound, MK800-62F1, was isolated from a cultured broth of Streptomyces diastatochromogenes MK800-62F1. It inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in human small cell lung carcinoma Ms-1 cells as well as in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells. In addition, MK800-62F1 also inhibited camptothecin-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, which was mediated by intracellular H2O2 generation. MK800-62F1 did not exhibit antioxidative activity in vitro, suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis by MK800-62F1 was not due to the scavenging of H2O2, rather it was due to the modulation of the downstream event of H2O2 generation.	0
Title: Activity of Icacinol from Icacina trichantha on Seedling Growth of Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana Abstract: Broadleaf weeds are very costly for crop growers. Additional herbicidal compounds need to be obtained, especially from natural sources. Extracts of Icacina trichantha were evaluated for responses in germinating seeds and seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). An ethyl acetate fraction of I. trichantha tuber and a diterpenoid constituent, icacinol (1), were found to have impacts on germination and growth of seedlings. The seed germination inhibitory activity on rice was minimal, but significant on Arabidopsis. While rice indicated some growth delay in leaf expansion in the presence of 1, the effects appeared temporary; chlorophyll and anthocyanins were not significantly altered compared to DMSO controls. Rice seedlings attained biomass similar to DMSO controls, and rice grains per panicle were not significantly different from the DMSO controls. On the other hand, Arabidopsis exhibited damage to leaf expansion, reduced chlorophyll, and increased anthocyanins in aerial portions of the seedlings. Icacinol (1) may be a suitable chemical agent to investigate further for the treatment of eudicot weeds.	0
Title: Cupric Ions Selectively Modulate TRAAK-Phosphatidylserine Interactions Abstract: TRAAK and TREK2 are two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels and are modulated by diverse factors including temperature, membrane stretching, and lipids, such as phosphatidic acid. In addition, copper and zinc, both of which are essential for life, are known to regulate TREK2 and a number of other ion channels. However, the role of ions in the association of lipids with integral membrane proteins is poorly understood. Here, we discover cupric ions selectively modulate the binding of phosphatidylserine (PS) to TRAAK but not TREK2. Other divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) bind both channels but have no impact on binding PS and other lipids. Additionally, TRAAK binds more avidly to Cu2+ and Zn2+ than TREK2. In the presence of Cu2+, TRAAK binds similarly to PS with different acyl chains, indicating a crucial role of the serine headgroup in coordinating Cu2+. High-resolution native mass spectrometry (MS) enables the determination of equilibrium binding constants for distinct Cu2+-bound stoichiometries and uncovered the highest coupling factor corresponds to a 1:1 PS-to-Cu2+ ratio. Interestingly, the next three highest coupling factors had a ∼1.5:1 PS-to-Cu2+ ratio. Our findings bring forth the role of cupric ions as an essential cofactor in selective TRAAK-PS interactions.	0
Title: Bioinspired enantioselective synthesis of crinine-type alkaloids via iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enones Abstract: A bioinspired enantioselective synthesis of crinine-type alkaloids has been developed by iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic cycloenones. The method features a biomimetic stereodivergent resolution of the substrates bearing a remote arylated quaternary stereocenter. Using this protocol, 24 crinine-type alkaloids and 8 analogues were synthesized in a concise and rapid way with high yield and high enantioselectivity.	0
Title: Chemical Ecogenomics-Guided Discovery of Phytotoxic α-Pyrones from the Fungal Wheat Pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster that is significantly upregulated in the fungal wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum during plant infection was reconstructed heterologously in Aspergillus nidulans. This led to the discovery of five new α-pyrone polyketides, alternapyrones B-F (2-6). Compounds 5 and 6, which contain a highly substituted dihydrofuran, exhibited phytotoxicity on wheat seed germination. It is demonstrated that only three enzymes, one highly reducing polyketide synthase and two multifunctional P450 oxygenases, are needed to synthesize the structurally complex products.	1
Title: Discovery of a widely distributed toxin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Bacteriocins represent a large family of ribosomally produced peptide antibiotics. Here we describe the discovery of a widely conserved biosynthetic gene cluster for the synthesis of thiazole and oxazole heterocycles on ribosomally produced peptides. These clusters encode a toxin precursor and all necessary proteins for toxin maturation and export. Using the toxin precursor peptide and heterocycle-forming synthetase proteins from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, we demonstrate the in vitro reconstitution of streptolysin S activity. We provide evidence that the synthetase enzymes, as predicted from our bioinformatics analysis, introduce heterocycles onto precursor peptides, thereby providing molecular insight into the chemical structure of streptolysin S. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the synthetase exhibits relaxed substrate specificity and modifies toxin precursors from both related and distant species. Given our findings, it is likely that the discovery of similar peptidic toxins will rapidly expand to existing and emerging genomes.	1
Title: Saturation mutagenesis of selected residues of the α-peptide of the lantibiotic lacticin 3147 yields a derivative with enhanced antimicrobial activity Abstract: The lantibiotic lacticin 3147 consists of two ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides, Ltnα and Ltnβ, which act synergistically against a wide range of Gram-positive microorganisms. We performed saturation mutagenesis of specific residues of Ltnα to determine their functional importance. The results establish that Ltnα is more tolerant to change than previously suggested by alanine scanning mutagenesis. One substitution, LtnαH23S, was identified which improved the specific activity of lacticin 3147 against one pathogenic strain, Staphylococcus aureus NCDO1499. This represents the first occasion upon which the activity of a two peptide lantibiotic has been enhanced through bioengineering.	1
Title: Identification and isolation of the FEEBLY gene from tomato by transposon tagging Abstract: The Ac/Ds transposon system from maize was used for insertional mutagenesis in tomato. Marker genes were employed for the selection of plants carrying a total of 471 unique Ds elements. Three mutants were obtained with Ds insertions closely linked to recessive mutations: feebly (fb), yellow jim (yj) and dopey (dp). The fb seedlings produced high anthocyanin levels, developed into small fragile plants, and were insensitive to the herbicide phosphinothricin. The yj plants had yellow leaves as a result of reduced levels of chlorophyll. The dp mutants completely or partially lacked inflorescences. The fb and yj loci were genetically linked to the Ds donor site on chromosome 3. Reactivation of the Ds element in the fb mutants by crosses with an Ac-containing line resulted in restoration of the wild-type phenotypes. Plant DNA fragments flanking both sides of the Ds element in the fb mutant were isolated by the inverse polymerase chain reaction. Molecular analysis showed that phenotypic reversions of fb were correlated with excisions of Ds. DNA sequence analysis of Fb reversion alleles showed the characteristic Ds footprints. Northern and cDNA sequence analysis indicated that transcription of the FEEBLY (FB) gene was impeded by the insertion of Ds in an intron. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the FB protein with other database sequences indicated that FB is a novel gene.	0
Title: Yeast as a promising heterologous host for steroid bioproduction Abstract: With the rapid development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies, yeast has been generally considered as promising hosts for the bioproduction of secondary metabolites. Sterols are essential components of cell membrane, and are the precursors for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, signaling molecules, and defense molecules in the higher eukaryotes, which are of pharmaceutical and agricultural significance. In this mini-review, we summarize the recent engineering efforts of using yeast to synthesize various steroids, and discuss the structural diversity that the current steroid-producing yeast can achieve, the challenge and the potential of using yeast as the bioproduction platform of various steroids from higher eukaryotes.	0
Title: Effect of calcium, magnesium, and zinc on ticarcillin and tobramycin alone and in combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Correlation between in vitro and in vivo test results for synergy between carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is poor. Although the divalent cation content of culture media is known to affect aminoglycoside susceptibility testing for P. aeruginosa, this effect of divalent cations has not been examined for synergy testing of carboxypenicillin-aminoglycoside interaction against P. aeruginosa. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tobramycin and ticarcillin and the interaction of these drugs in combination were studied by a microtitration method for 36 strains of P. aeruginosa in Mueller-Hinton broth with varying supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. The supplementation of Mueller-Hinton broth to 50 or 100 mg of calcium per liter had a significant effect in increasing the tobramycin MIC (P less than 0.01), as well as decreasing the degree of synergy between ticarcillin and tobramycin (P less than 0.01). Supplementation to 20 mg of magnesium per liter, 1.0 mg of zinc per liter, or both did not significantly affect tobramycin MIC or the interaction of tobramycin and ticarcillin. Supplementation to 50 or 100 mg of calcium per liter rendered any additional effect of magnesium and zinc on aminoglycoside MIC and aminoglycoside-carboxypenicillin interaction negligible. If these results for ticarcillin and tobramycin are confirmed for other carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides, then the Mueller-Hinton broth used for P. aeruginosa aminoglycoside susceptibility and synergy testing may need to be supplemented only with calcium at a concentration of 50 mg/liter.	0
Title: Variability in nitrogen regulation of aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus strains Abstract: Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic metabolites of several Aspergillus species. The effect of nitrate on aflatoxin production and expression of the key regulatory genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis, aflR and aflJ, were compared among isolates of the S(B) and S(BG) strains of A. flavus. Aflatoxin production by two of the three strain S(B) isolates did not differ significantly between the two media tested, whereas for S(BG) A. flavus isolates, the level of aflatoxins in buffered nitrate medium was as much as 20-fold lower than in ammonium salts medium. Expression of aflR was not significantly affected by growth of cultures in nitrate medium for most of the isolates. However, on nitrate medium, expression of aflJ was 2.6-fold higher for the S(B) isolates than it was on ammonium salts medium, whereas for the S(BG) isolates aflJ expression was 2-fold lower on nitrate than on ammonium salts medium. This difference may result from the presence in the aflJ/aflR intergenic region of S(BG) isolates of fewer putative binding sites (HGATAR sites) for AreA, the positive-acting, wide domain transcription factor involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism.	1
Title: Identification and Engineering of Post-PKS Modification Bottlenecks for Ansamitocin P-3 Titer Improvement in Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. pretiosum ATCC 31280 Abstract: The type-I polyketide ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3) is a potent antitumor agent. Its production is most likely hampered by the required multiple substrate supplies and complicated post-PKS modifications in Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. pretiosum ATCC 31280. For titer improvement, gene ansa30, encoding for a glycosyltransferase competing for the N-demethyl-AP-3 (PND-3) intermediate for AP-3 biosynthesis, was initially inactivated. In the mutant NXJ-22, the AP-3 titer was increased by 66% along with an obvious accumulation of PND-3, indicating that the N-methylation is a rate-limiting step. Alternatively, when abundant upstream intermediate 19-chloroproansamitocin was fed into a PKS mutant, 3-O-acylation was further identified along with the N-methylation as the rate-limiting steps. Subsequent overexpression of N-methyltransferase gene asm10 in NXJ-22 resulted in a 93% increase of AP-3 and a corresponding 92% decrease of PND-3. Additional supplementation of L-methionine, the precursor for SAM biosynthesis, substantially decreased the accumulation of PND-3. In parallel, the 3-O-acylation bottleneck was relieved by feeding with L-valine to NXJ-22, resulting in a 126% increase of AP-3. Eventually, a combined asm10 overexpression and supplementation of L-methionine and L-valine resulted in a 5-fold increase of AP-3, from 42 ± 2 mg L-1 to 246 ± 6 mg L-1 , without any noticeable accumulation of PND-3.	1
Title: The mycosubtilin synthetase of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633: a multifunctional hybrid between a peptide synthetase, an amino transferase, and a fatty acid synthase Abstract: Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC6633 has been identified as a producer of mycosubtilin, a potent antifungal peptide antibiotic. Mycosubtilin, which belongs to the iturin family of lipopeptide antibiotics, is characterized by a beta-amino fatty acid moiety linked to the circular heptapeptide Asn-Tyr-Asn-Gln-Pro-Ser-Asn, with the second, third, and sixth position present in the D-configuration. The gene cluster from B. subtilis ATCC6633 specifying the biosynthesis of mycosubtilin was identified. The putative operon spans 38 kb and consists of four ORFs, designated fenF, mycA, mycB, and mycC, with strong homologies to the family of peptide synthetases. Biochemical characterization showed that MycB specifically adenylates tyrosine, as expected for mycosubtilin synthetase, and insertional mutagenesis of the operon resulted in a mycosubtilin-negative phenotype. The mycosubtilin synthetase reveals features unique for peptide synthetases as well as for fatty acid synthases: (i) The mycosubtilin synthase subunit A (MycA) combines functional domains derived from peptide synthetases, amino transferases, and fatty acid synthases. MycA represents the first example of a natural hybrid between these enzyme families. (ii) The organization of the synthetase subunits deviates from that commonly found in peptide synthetases. On the basis of the described characteristics of the mycosubtilin synthetase, we present a model for the biosynthesis of iturin lipopeptide antibiotics. Comparison of the sequences flanking the mycosubtilin operon of B. subtilis ATCC6633, with the complete genome sequence of B. subtilis strain 168 indicates that the fengycin and mycosubtilin lipopeptide synthetase operons are exchanged between the two B. subtilis strains.	1
Title: Characterization of Streptomyces argillaceus genes encoding a polyketide synthase involved in the biosynthesis of the antitumor mithramycin Abstract: Mithramycin (Mtm) is an aromatic polyketide which shows antibacterial and antitumor activity. From a chromosomal cosmid library of Streptomyces argillaceus, a Mtm producer, a clone (cosAR7) was isolated by homology to the actI/III region of S. coelicolor and the strDEM genes of S. griseus. From this clone, a 5.3-kb DNA region was sequenced and found to encode six open reading frames (designated as mtmQXPKST1), five of them transcribed in the same direction. The deduced products of five of these genes resembled components of type-II polyketide synthases. The mtm genes would code for an aromatase (mtmQ), a polypeptide of unknown function (mtmX), a beta-ketoacylsynthase (mtmP) and a related 'chain length factor' (mtmK), an acyl carrier protein (mtmS) and a beta-ketoreductase (mtmT1). The involvement of this gene cluster in Mtm biosynthesis was demonstrated by the Mtm non-producing phenotype of mutants generated in two independent insertional inactivation experiments.	1
Title: Improved bioconversion of 15-fluoro-6-deoxyerythronolide B to 15-fluoro-erythromycin A by overexpression of the eryK Gene in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The bioconversion of a 6-deoxyerythronolide B analogue to the corresponding erythromycin A analogue (R-EryA) by a Saccharopolyspora erythraea mutant lacking the ketosynthase in the first polyketide synthase module was significantly improved by changing fluxes at a key branch point affecting the erythromycin congener distribution. This was achieved by integrating an additional copy of the eryK gene into the chromosome under control of the eryAIp promoter. Real-time PCR analysis of RNA confirmed higher expression of eryK in the resulting strain, S. erythraea K301-105B, compared to its parent. In shake flasks, K301-105B produced less of the shunt product 15-fluoro-erythromycin B (15F-EryB), suggesting a shift in congener distribution toward the desired product, 15-fluoro-erythromycin A (15F-EryA). In bioreactor studies, K301-105B produced 1.3 g/L of 15F-EryA with 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor, compared with 0.9 g/L 15F-EryA with 50-55% molar yield on fed precursor by the parent strain. At higher precursor feed rates, K301-105B produced 3.5 g/L of 15F-EryA while maintaining 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor.	1
Title: Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Enables to Quantify the Affinity Between DNA and Proteins in Cell Lysate Abstract: The determination of the binding affinity quantifying the interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is of crucial interest in biological and chemical research. Here, we have made use of site-specific fluorine labeling of the cold shock protein from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB, enabling to directly monitor the interaction with single stranded DNA molecules in cell lysate. High-resolution 19 F NMR spectroscopy has been applied to exclusively report on resonance signals arising from the protein under study. We have found that this experimental approach advances the reliable determination of the binding affinity between single stranded DNA molecules and its target protein in this complex biological environment by intertwining analyses based on NMR chemical shifts, signal heights, line shapes and simulations. We propose that the developed experimental platform offers a potent approach for the identification of binding affinities characterizing intermolecular interactions in native surroundings covering the nano-to-micromolar range that can be even expanded to in cell applications in future studies.	0
Title: Isolation, sequencing and characterization of cluster genes involved in the biosynthesis and utilization of the siderophore of marine fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus Abstract: In fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus MVP01, the isolated 11-gene cluster consisted of two divergently transcribed, Fe(3+) and ferric uptake regulator (Fur) regulated operons, pvsABCDE and psuA-pvuABCDE, sharing high similarity with that related to siderophore biosynthesis and transportation locus in V. parahaemolyticus. Siderophore biosynthesis or utilization was blocked when pvsA and pvsD of the pvsABCDE operon or pvuA, pvuB and pvuE of the psuA-pvuABCDE operon was single-gene in-frame mutated, demonstrating their essential roles for siderophore biosynthesis or utilization in V. alginolyticus MVP01. Addition of the purified siderophore restored the cell growth in siderophore biosynthesis mutants, but not in siderophore uptake mutants.	1
Title: Oxaspirol B with p97 Inhibitory Activity and Other Oxaspirols from Lecythophora sp. FL1375 and FL1031, Endolichenic Fungi Inhabiting Parmotrema tinctorum and Cladonia evansii Abstract: A new metabolite, oxaspirol D (4), together with oxaspirols B (2) and C (3) were isolated from Lecythophora sp. FL1375, an endolichenic fungus isolated from Parmotrema tinctorum, whereas Lecythophora sp. FL1031 inhabiting the lichen Cladonia evansii afforded oxaspirols A (1), B (2), and C (3). Of these, oxaspirol B (2) showed moderate p97 ATPase inhibitory activity. A detailed characterization of all oxaspirols was undertaken because structures proposed for known oxaspirols have involved incomplete assignments of NMR spectroscopic data leading only to their planar structures. Thus, the naturally occurring isomeric mixture (2a and 2b) of oxaspirol B was separated as their diacetates (5a and 5b) and the structures and absolute configurations of 1, 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 were determined by the application of spectroscopic techniques including two-dimensional NMR and the modified Mosher's ester method. Oxaspirol B (2) and its diacetates 5a and 5b were evaluated for their ATPase inhibitory activities of p97, p97 mutants, and other ATP-utilizing enzymes, and only 2 was found to be active, indicating the requirement of some structural features in oxaspirols for their activity. Additional biochemical and cellular assays suggested that 2 was a reversible, non-ATP competitive, and specific inhibitor of p97.	0
Title: Construction of a protein-detection system using a loop peptide library with a fluorescence label Abstract: Construction of a novel protein-detection system was carried out using a designed peptide library with fluorescent labels based on loop structures. As a basic model study, detection of alpha-amylase using fluorescent-labeled peptides derived from an active loop of tendamistat was examined. The detection methods for proteins with immobilized peptides as well as peptides in solution have been successfully established. Based on these results, a loop peptide library that has various turn sequences grafted on a stable loop structure has been constructed. Various proteins with recognition patterns corresponding, for instance, to "protein fingerprints" could be detected using an immobilized peptide library. The present results suggest that the system can be applied to the development of a peptide microarray that behaves as a protein chip.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins Abstract: UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.	1
Title: Hassallidins, antifungal glycolipopeptides, are widespread among cyanobacteria and are the end-product of a nonribosomal pathway Abstract: Cyanobacteria produce a wide variety of cyclic peptides, including the widespread hepatotoxins microcystins and nodularins. Another class of peptides, cyclic glycosylated lipopeptides called hassallidins, show antifungal activity. Previously, two hassallidins (A and B) were reported from an epilithic cyanobacterium Hassallia sp. and found to be active against opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. Bioinformatic analysis of the Anabaena sp. 90 genome identified a 59-kb cryptic inactive nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster proposed to be responsible for hassallidin biosynthesis. Here we describe the hassallidin biosynthetic pathway from Anabaena sp. SYKE748A, as well as the large chemical variation and common occurrence of hassallidins in filamentous cyanobacteria. Analysis demonstrated that 20 strains of the genus Anabaena carry hassallidin synthetase genes and produce a multitude of hassallidin variants that exhibit activity against Candida albicans. The compounds discovered here were distinct from previously reported hassallidins A and B. The IC50 of hassallidin D was 0.29-1.0 µM against Candida strains. A large variation in amino acids, sugars, their degree of acetylation, and fatty acid side chain length was detected. In addition, hassallidins were detected in other cyanobacteria including Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Nostoc, and Tolypothrix. These compounds may protect some of the most important bloom-forming and globally distributed cyanobacteria against attacks by parasitic fungi.	1
Title: The paralogous pairs of genes involved in clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis are differently regulated in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Carboxyethylarginine synthase, encoded by the paralogous ceaS1 and ceaS2 genes, catalyzes the first reaction in the shared biosynthetic pathway leading to clavulanic acid and the other clavam metabolites in Streptomyces clavuligerus. The nutritional regulation of ceaS1 and ceaS2 expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR and by the use of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-encoding gene (egfp) as a reporter. ceaS1 was transcribed in complex soy medium only, whereas ceaS2 was transcribed in both soy and defined starch-asparagine (SA) media. The transcriptional start points of the two genes were also mapped to a C residue 98 bp upstream of ceaS1 and a G residue 51 bp upstream of the ceaS2 start codon by S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses. Furthermore, transcriptional mapping of the genes encoding the beta-lactam synthetase (bls1) and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (pah1) isoenzymes from the paralogue gene cluster indicated that a single polycistronic transcript of approximately 4.9 kb includes ceaS1, bls1, and pah1. The expression of ceaS1 and ceaS2 in a mutant strain defective in the regulatory protein CcaR was also examined. ceaS1 transcription was not affected in the ccaR mutant, whereas that of ceaS2 was greatly reduced compared to the wild-type strain. Overall, our results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in regulating the expression of ceaS1 and ceaS2, and presumably also of other paralogous genes that encode proteins involved in the early stages of clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of the biosynthesis gene cluster for alkyl-O-dihydrogeranyl-methoxyhydroquinones in Actinoplanes missouriensis Abstract: A polyketide biosynthesis gene cluster (agq) was found on the genome of a rare actinomycete, Actinoplanes missouriensis. Streptomyces lividans expressing agqA encoding a type III polyketide synthase produced alkylresorcinols mainly from C(16-17) fatty acids. Heterologous expression of the agq genes in S. lividans indicated the function of cognate polyketide modification enzymes; a monooxygenase AgqB hydroxylates the alkylresorcinols to yield 6-alkyl-2-hydroxyhydroquinones, a methyltransferase AgqC catalyzes O-methylation of the alkyl-hydroxyhydroquinones to yield 6-alkyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones, and a UbiA-like prenyltransferase AgqD attaches a prenyl group to the C-4 hydroxy group of the alkyl-methoxyhydroquinones to yield 6-alkyl-4-O-geranyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones and 6-alkyl-4-O-dihydrofarnesyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones derived from C(16-17) fatty acids. In contrast, A. missouriensis was found to produce 6-alkyl-4-O-dihydrogeranyl-2-methoxyhydroquinones derived from C(16-18) fatty acids by the function of the agq gene cluster. All of these prenylated phenolic lipids were novel compounds.	1
Title: Elucidation of the Tailoring Steps in Julichrome Biosynthesis by Marine Gastropod Mollusk-Associated Streptomyces sampsonii SCSIO 054 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster governing the production of antibacterial julichromes was identified from marine gastropod mollusk-associated Streptomyces sampsonii SCSIO 054. Post-PKS assembly/tailoring enzymes JuiL, JuiM, JuiI, and JuiN represent key assembly enzymes. JuiL serves as a ketoreductase. JuiM is an acetyltransferase. JuiI carries out an intriguing biaryl coupling of two julichrome Q6 units (immediate JuiL, JuiM product) to afford julichrome Q6-6. JuiN carries out tailoring steps on julichrome Q6-6, transforming Q6-6 into Q3-3.	1
Title: Comparative Profiling and Discovery of Novel Glycosylated Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids in Two Strains of the Cyanobacterium Scytonema cf. crispum Abstract: The mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are a group of small molecules with a diverse ecological distribution among microorganisms. MAAs have a range of physiological functions, including protection against UV radiation, making them important from a biotechnological perspective. In the present study, we identified a putative MAA (mys) gene cluster in two New Zealand isolates of Scytonema cf. crispum (UCFS10 and UCFS15). Homology to "Anabaena-type" mys clusters suggested that this cluster was likely to be involved in shinorine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of S cf. crispum cell extracts revealed a complex MAA profile, including shinorine, palythine-serine, and their hexose-bound variants. It was hypothesized that a short-chain dehydrogenase (UCFS15_00405) encoded by a gene adjacent to the S cf. crispum mys cluster was responsible for the conversion of shinorine to palythine-serine. Heterologous expression of MysABCE and UCFS15_00405 in Escherichia coli resulted in the exclusive production of the parent compound shinorine. Taken together, these results suggest that shinorine biosynthesis in S cf. crispum proceeds via an Anabaena-type mechanism and that the genes responsible for the production of other MAA analogues, including palythine-serine and glycosylated analogues, may be located elsewhere in the genome.                  Importance:                       Recently, New Zealand isolates of S cf. crispum were linked to the production of paralytic shellfish toxins for the first time, but no other natural products from this species have been reported. Thus, the species was screened for important natural product biosynthesis. The mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are among the strongest absorbers of UV radiation produced in nature. The identification of novel MAAs is important from a biotechnology perspective, as these molecules are able to be utilized as sunscreens. This study has identified two novel MAAs that have provided several new avenues of future research related to MAA genetics and biosynthesis. Further, we have revealed that the genetic basis of MAA biosynthesis may not be clustered on the genome. The identification of the genes responsible for MAA biosynthesis is vital for future genetic engineering.	1
Title: 'Quantized' states of the charge-density wave in microcrystals of K(0.3)MoO3 Abstract: Quantization of electrons in solids can typically be observed in microscopic samples if the mean free path of the electrons exceeds the dimensions of the sample. A special case is a quasi one-dimensional metal, in which electrons condense into a collective state. This state, a charge-density wave (CDW), is a periodic modulation of both the lattice and electron density. Here, we demonstrate that samples of K(0.3)MoO(3), a typical CDW conductor, show jumps in conduction, regular in temperature. The jumps correspond to transitions between discrete states of the CDW and reveal the quantization of the wave vector of electrons near the Fermi vector. The effect involves both quantum and classical features of the CDW: the quantum condensate demonstrates modes, resembling those of a classical wave in a resonator. The analysis of the steps allows extremely precise studies of the CDW wave-vector variations and reveals new prospects for structural studies of electronic crystals and fine effects in their electronic states and lattice motions.	0
Title: Diffusion-controlled ligand binding to spheres partially covered by receptors: an effective medium treatment Abstract: An effective medium treatment is used to extend Berg and Purcell's theory of diffusion-controlled ligand binding to a sphere partially covered by receptors. This treatment takes into account more completely the effects of interference between receptors. The results are in excellent agreement with computer simulations by Northrup.	0
Title: Dissecting fragment-based lead discovery at the von Hippel-Lindau protein:hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein-protein interface Abstract: Fragment screening is widely used to identify attractive starting points for drug design. However, its potential and limitations to assess the tractability of often challenging protein:protein interfaces have been underexplored. Here, we address this question by means of a systematic deconstruction of lead-like inhibitors of the pVHL:HIF-1α interaction into their component fragments. Using biophysical techniques commonly employed for screening, we could only detect binding of fragments that violate the Rule of Three, are more complex than those typically screened against classical druggable targets, and occupy two adjacent binding subsites at the interface rather than just one. Analyses based on ligand and group lipophilicity efficiency of anchored fragments were applied to dissect the individual subsites and probe for binding hot spots. The implications of our findings for targeting protein interfaces by fragment-based approaches are discussed.	0
Title: A facile copper(I)-catalyzed homocoupling of terminal alkynes to 1,3-diynes with diaziridinone under mild conditions Abstract: A novel and efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes with diaziridinone as an oxidant is described. Various terminal alkynes can be transformed into the corresponding 1,3-diynes in good yields. The reaction process is base-free, operationally simple, and amenable to the gram scale.	0
Title: Identification of Neuroprotective Spoxazomicin and Oxachelin Glycosides via Chemoenzymatic Glycosyl-Scanning Abstract: The assessment of glycosyl-scanning to expand the molecular and functional diversity of metabolites from the underground coal mine fire-associated Streptomyces sp. RM-14-6 is reported. Using the engineered glycosyltransferase OleD Loki and a 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen, six metabolites were identified as substrates of OleD Loki, from which 12 corresponding metabolite glycosides were produced and characterized. This study highlights the first application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen toward an unbiased set of unique microbial natural products and the first reported application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based transglycosylation reaction for the corresponding preparative synthesis of target glycosides. Bioactivity analysis (including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and EtOH damage neuroprotection assays) revealed glycosylation to attenuate the neuroprotective potency of 4, while glycosylation of the structurally related inactive spoxazomicin C (3) remarkably invoked neuroprotective activity.	0
Title: Cytochrome P450–catalyzed L-tryptophan nitration in thaxtomin phytotoxin biosynthesis Abstract: Thaxtomin phytotoxins produced by plant-pathogenic Streptomyces species contain a nitro group that is essential for phytotoxicity. The N,N'-dimethyldiketopiperazine core of thaxtomins is assembled from L-phenylalanine and L-4-nitrotryptophan by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and nitric oxide synthase-generated NO is incorporated into the nitro group, but the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid L-4-nitrotryptophan is unclear. Here we report that TxtE, a unique cytochrome P450, catalyzes L-tryptophan nitration using NO and O(2).	1
Title: In vivo biosynthesis of terpene nucleosides provides unique chemical markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Abstract: Although small molecules shed from pathogens are widely used to diagnose infection, such tests have not been widely implemented for tuberculosis. Here we show that the recently identified compound, 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), accumulates to comprise >1% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid. In vitro and in vivo, two isomers of TbAd were detected that might serve as infection markers. Using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we established the structure of the previously unknown molecule, N(6)-tuberculosinyladenosine (N(6)-TbAd). Its biosynthesis involves enzymatic production of 1-TbAd by Rv3378c followed by conversion to N(6)-TbAd via the Dimroth rearrangement. Intact biosynthetic genes are observed only within M. tuberculosis complex bacteria, and TbAd was not detected among other medically important pathogens, environmental bacteria, and vaccine strains. With no substantially similar known molecules in nature, the discovery and in vivo detection of two abundant terpene nucleosides support their development as specific diagnostic markers of tuberculosis.	0
Title: Novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity generated by targeted gene disruption Abstract: The oligosaccharide antibiotics avilamycin A and C are produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tu57. Both consist of a heptasaccharide chain, which is attached to a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety. They show excellent antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Both molecules are modified by O-methylation at different positions, which contributes to poor water solubility and difficulties in galenical drug development. In order to generate novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity and improved pharmacokinetic properties, we generated a series of mutants with one, two, or three mutated methyltransferase genes. Based on the structure of the novel avilamycin derivatives, the exact function of three methyltransferases, AviG2, AviG5, and AviG6, involved in avilamycin biosynthesis could be assigned.	1
Title: Engineering Salinispora tropica for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: The marine actinomycete genus Salinispora is a remarkably prolific source of structurally diverse and biologically active secondary metabolites. Herein, we select the model organism Salinispora tropica CNB-440 for development as a heterologous host for the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to complement well-established Streptomyces host strains. In order to create an integratable host with a clean background of secondary metabolism, we replaced three genes (salA-C) essential for salinosporamide biosynthesis with a cassette containing the Streptomyces coelicolor ΦC31 phage attachment site attB to generate the mutant S. tropica CNB-4401 via double-crossover recombination. This mutagenesis not only knocks-in the attachment site attB in the genome of S. tropica CNB-440 but also abolishes production of the salinosporamides, thereby simplifying the strain's chemical background. We validated this new heterologous host with the successful integration and expression of the thiolactomycin BGC that we recently identified in several S. pacifica strains. When compared to the extensively engineered superhost S. coelicolor M1152, the production of thiolactomycins from S. tropica CNB-4401 was approximately 3-fold higher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using a marine actinomycete as a heterologous host for natural product BGC expression. The established heterologous host may provide a useful platform to accelerate the discovery of novel natural products and engineer biosynthetic pathways.	0
Title: Antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin Abstract: Holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic lacked activity against the eukaryotic microorganisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida kefyr. Holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against Escherichia coli that was associated with rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis in whole cells. Inhibition of RNA synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting tRNA aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. However, the levels of inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed pair of E. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the relA gene. This suggests that inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Examination of the effects of holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced E. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of RNA polymerase at the level of RNA chain elongation. However, holomycin only weakly inhibited E. coli RNA polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(dA-dT) and plasmid templates. Furthermore, inhibition of RNA polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of E. coli. It is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits RNA polymerase.	1
Title: Formation and characterization of biofilms formed by salt-tolerant yeast strains in seawater-based growth medium Abstract: Yeast whole cells have been widely used in modern biotechnology as biocatalysts to generate numerous compounds of industrial, chemical, and pharmaceutical importance. Since many of the biocatalysis-utilizing manufactures have become more concerned about environmental issues, seawater is now considered a sustainable alternative to freshwater for biocatalytic processes. This approach plausibly commenced new research initiatives into exploration of salt-tolerant yeast strains. Recently, there has also been a growing interest in possible applications of microbial biofilms in the field of biocatalysis. In these complex communities, cells demonstrate higher resistance to adverse environmental conditions due to their embedment in an extracellular matrix, in which physical, chemical, and physiological gradients exist. Considering these two topics, seawater and biofilms, in this work, we characterized biofilm formation in seawater-based growth media by several salt-tolerant yeast strains with previously demonstrated biocatalytic capacities. The tested strains formed both air-liquid-like biofilms and biofilms on silicone surfaces, with Debaryomyces fabryi, Schwanniomyces etchellsii, Schwanniomyces polymorphus, and Kluyveromyces marxianus showing the highest biofilm formation. The extracted biofilm extracellular matrices mostly consisted of carbohydrates and proteins. The latter group was primarily represented by enzymes involved in metabolic processes, particularly the biosynthetic ones, and in the response to stimuli. Specific features were also found in the carbohydrate composition of the extracellular matrix, which were dependent both on the yeast isolate and the nature of formed biofilms. Overall, our findings presented herein provide a unique data resource for further development and optimization of biocatalytic processes and applications employing seawater and halotolerant yeast biofilms.Key points• Ability for biofilm formation of some yeast-halotolerant strains in seawater medium• ECM composition dependent on strain and biofilm-forming surface• Metabolic enzymes in the ECM with potential applications for biocatalysis.	0
Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the O-methyltransferase NovP from the novobiocin-biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovP (subunit MW = 29 967 Da; 262 amino acids), an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallized in space group P2, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.81, b = 46.04, c = 61.22 A, beta = 104.97 degrees. Native data to a maximum resolution of 1.4 A were collected from a single crystal at the synchrotron. NovP is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin that targets the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.	1
Title: Cinchonium Betaines as Efficient Catalysts for Asymmetric Proton Transfer Catalysis: The Development of a Practical Enantioselective Isomerization of Trifluoromethyl Imines Abstract: We have developed a new class of cinchonium betaine catalysts bearing both a base moiety and an aromatic moiety as an N-substituent of the quinuclidine motif. These cinchonium betaines were found to promote proton transfer catalysis with 1000-5000 turnovers per 24 h, thereby enabling us to realize highly efficient enantioselective isomerization of trifluoromethyl imines to provide a practical access to optically active trifluoromethylated amines.	0
Title: Chemotaxonomy of Mycotoxigenic Small-Spored Alternaria Fungi - Do Multitoxin Mixtures Act as an Indicator for Species Differentiation? Abstract: Necrotrophic as well as saprophytic small-spored Alternaria (A.) species are annually responsible for major losses of agricultural products, such as cereal crops, associated with the contamination of food and feedstuff with potential health-endangering Alternaria toxins. Knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of different species-groups to form mycotoxins is of importance for a reliable risk assessment. 93 Alternaria strains belonging to the four species groups Alternaria tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata, and A. infectoria were isolated from winter wheat kernels harvested from fields in Germany and Russia and incubated under equal conditions. Chemical analysis by means of an HPLC-MS/MS multi-Alternaria-toxin-method showed that 95% of all strains were able to form at least one of the targeted 17 non-host specific Alternaria toxins. Simultaneous production of up to 15 (modified) Alternaria toxins by members of the A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata species-groups and up to seven toxins by A. infectoria strains was demonstrated. Overall tenuazonic acid was the most extensively formed mycotoxin followed by alternariol and alternariol mono methylether, whereas altertoxin I was the most frequently detected toxin. Sulfoconjugated modifications of alternariol, alternariol mono methylether, altenuisol and altenuene were frequently determined. Unknown perylene quinone derivatives were additionally detected. Strains of the species-group A. infectoria could be segregated from strains of the other three species-groups due to significantly lower toxin levels and the specific production of infectopyrone. Apart from infectopyrone, alterperylenol was also frequently produced by 95% of the A. infectoria strains. Neither by the concentration nor by the composition of the targeted Alternaria toxins a differentiation between the species-groups A. alternata, A. tenuissima and A. arborescens was possible.	0
Title: T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through the regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity Abstract: Protein kinases are potential targets for the prevention and control of UV-induced skin cancer. T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly expressed in skin cancer cells, but its specific function is still unknown. We investigated the role of TOPK in UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins that bind with TOPK. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry were used to assess the effect of UVB on TOPK, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), and apoptosis in RPMI7951 cells. TOPK binds with Prx1 and its phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 is important for regulation of H(2)O(2)-mediated signal transduction. Analysis of the CD spectra of Prx1 and mutant Prx1 (S32A) proteins showed that the secondary structure of Prx1 was significantly altered by phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32. UVB irradiation induced phosphorylation of TOPK in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells and phosphorylated TOPK co-localized with Prx1 in the nucleus. UVB induced the peroxidase activity of Prx1 in vitro and ex vivo. Following treatment with UVB, H(2)O(2) levels and apoptosis were increased in RPMI7951 cells stably expressing TOPK siRNA or stably mutant Prx1 (S32A). Phosphorylation of Prx1 (Ser-32) by TOPK prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity and blockade of intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation.	0
Title: Retrieval of entire genes from environmental DNA by inverse PCR with pre-amplification of target genes using primers containing locked nucleic acids Abstract: We had been unsuccessful to amplify desired nucleotide sequences from various environmental DNA samples by using the inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) technique, most probably because the copy numbers of target DNA sequences had been quite low. To enrich the target DNA sequences prior to IPCR, a rolling-circle amplification was used with a site-specific primer containing locked nucleic acids (LNAs). This pre-amplified IPCR (PAI-PCR) method increased the sensitivity of PCR almost 10,000 times compared with the standard IPCR in model experiments using Escherichia coli. We then applied the PAI-PCR method to isolate glycosyl hydrolase genes from DNAs extracted from vermiform appendixes of horses and termite guts. The flanking sequences of the target genes were amplified and cloned successfully using PAI-PCR, whereas standard IPCR resulted in no amplification.	0
Title: DNA binding of the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog alters in vitro DNA flexibility Abstract: BpH1, the Bordetella pertussis H1 homolog, interacts with chromosomal DNA. With DNase I protection assays, we demonstrate in this study that BpH1 binds DNA in a nonspecific manner and that it may cover DNA fragments from end to end. Although the binding was shown to be nonspecific, preferential binding sites and sites resistant to BpH1 binding were identified within and upstream of the pertussis toxin promoter sequence. In the presence of DNA ligase, BpH1 favored the formation of multimeric DNA fragments of various sizes and prevented ring closures, suggesting a diminished flexibility of the DNA fragments and thus indicating that BpH1 acts as a macromolecular crowding agent.	0
Title: Endophytic Bacterium-Triggered Reactive Oxygen Species Directly Increase Oxygenous Sesquiterpenoid Content and Diversity in Atractylodes lancea Abstract: Oxygenous terpenoids are active components of many medicinal plants. However, current studies that have focused on enzymatic oxidation reactions cannot comprehensively clarify the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis and diversity. This study shows that an endophytic bacterium can trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that directly increase oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in Atractylodes lancea. A. lancea is a famous but endangered Chinese medicinal plant that contains abundant oxygenous sesquiterpenoids. Geo-authentic A. lancea produces a wider range and a greater abundance of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids than the cultivated herb. Our previous studies have shown the mechanisms behind endophytic promotion of the production of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbon scaffolds; however, how endophytes promote the formation of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids and their diversity is unclear. After colonization by Pseudomonas fluorescens ALEB7B, oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in A. lancea occur synchronously. Treatment with exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or singlet oxygen induces oxidative burst and promotes oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in planta. Conversely, pretreatment of plantlets with the ROS scavenger ascorbic acid significantly inhibits the oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation induced by P. fluorescens ALEB7B. Further in vitro oxidation experiments show that several oxygenous sesquiterpenoids can be obtained from direct oxidation caused by H2O2 or singlet oxygen. In summary, this study demonstrates that endophytic bacterium-triggered ROS can directly oxidize oxygen-free sesquiterpenoids and increase the oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in A. lancea, providing a novel explanation of the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis in planta and an essential complementarity to enzymatic oxidation reactions.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of amychelin, an unusual mixed-ligand siderophore from Amycolatopsis sp. AA4 Abstract: Actinobacteria generate a large number of structurally diverse small molecules with potential therapeutic value. Genomic analyses of this productive group of bacteria show that their genetic potential to manufacture small molecules exceeds their observed ability by roughly an order of magnitude, and this revelation has prompted a number of studies to identify members of the unknown majority. As a potential window into this cryptic secondary metabolome, pairwise assays for developmental interactions within a set of 20 sequenced actinomycetes were carried out. These assays revealed that Amycolatopsis sp. AA4, a so-called "rare" actinomycete, produces a novel siderophore, amychelin, which alters the developmental processes of several neighboring streptomycetes. Using this phenotype as an assay, we isolated amychelin and solved its structure by NMR and MS methods coupled with an X-ray crystallographic analysis of its Fe-complex. The iron binding affinity of amychelin was determined using EDTA competition assays, and a biosynthetic cluster was identified and annotated to provide a tentative biosynthetic scheme for amychelin.	1
Title: Predictions of linear T-cell and B-cell epitopes in proteins encoded by HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVMAC and the conservation of these sites between strains Abstract: An important consideration in the design of vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection effective against different strains is the amino acid sequence conservation of antigenic determinants. Even one amino acid change can destroy the antigenicity of a site for the antibody or T-cell receptor. The comparisons of predicted T- and B-cell epitopes between human HIV-1, HIV-2 and monkey SIVMAC AIDS viruses are presented. The three major gene products (env, gag and pol) were examined. A number of epitopes were identical between strains of HIV-1. Our analysis highlights the problem of designing an effective HIV-1 and HIV-2 vaccine and also the problem of testing human vaccines in monkey models.	0
Title: Protein kinase C catalyzes phosphorylation of guanylate cyclase in vitro Abstract: Protein kinase C catalyzes phosphorylation of purified rat brain guanylate cyclase. The phosphorylation is marked by concomitant increase in guanylate cyclase activity. TPA further enhances both phosphorylation and activity of guanylate cyclase. Data seem to provide clues to the molecular mechanism of one of the transformation-like responses mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, i.e. the elevation of cyclic GMP. It is envisaged that protein kinase C may have a central role in the understanding of molecular events triggering carcinogenesis.	0
Title: Additive effects of a two-amino-acid insertion and a single-amino-acid substitution in dihydropteroate synthase for the development of sulphonamide-resistant Neisseria meningitidis Abstract: Sulphonamide resistance in some clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis is associated with an insertion in the chromosomal folP gene leading to the addition of two amino acids, serine and glycine, in the drug target enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). Removal of the insertion resulted in a markedly higher Km for the substrate p-aminobenzoic acid and a markedly lower Km for 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-7,8-dihydropteridine pyrophosphate. In the same isolates an additional important difference, compared to wild-type enzymes, was found at amino acid position 68, which is a proline in most DHPS enzymes, but is serine in one and leucine in another clinical isolate of sulphonamide-resistant N. meningitidis. The alteration at position 68 was found to affect mainly the level of sulphonamide resistance and had only a minor effect on the Km for the substrates. Introduction of the serine-glycine dipeptide at position 194 and a proline to serine substitution at position 68 in DHPS from normal, susceptible N. meningitidis failed to produce a functional sulphonamide-resistant enzyme. The conclusion of this study is that it is not possible to change a normal chromosomally encoded DHPS of N. meningitidis to a sulphonamide-resistant one simply by an insertion of serine and glycine as seen in clinical isolates. It is likely that the resistance gene found in clinical isolates has evolved in another bacterial species where a combination of other amino acid changes may have contributed to produce a functionally resistant enzyme. This new resistance gene may have then been introduced into N. meningitidis by natural transformation.	1
Title: Anti-hepatitis B virus activity and metabolism of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-beta-L(-)-5-fluorocytidine Abstract: 2',3'-Dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-beta-L(-)-5-fluorocytidine [L(-)Fd4C] was found to be at least 10 times more potent than beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine [L(-)SddC; also called 3TC, or lamivudine]against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in culture. Its cytotoxicity against HepG2 growth in culture was also greater than that of L(-)SddC (3TC). There was no activity of this compound against mitochondrial DNA synthesis in cells at concentrations upto 10 microM. The dynamics of recovery of virus from the medium of cells pretreated with equal drug concentrations were slower with L(-)Fd4C than with L(-)SddC (3TC). L(-)Fd4C could be metabolized to mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms. The degree of L(-)Fd4C phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate metabolite was higher than the degree of L(-)SddC (3TC) phosphorylation when equal extracellular concentrations of the two drugs were used. The apparent K(m) of L(-)Fd4C phosphorylated metabolites formed intracellularly was higher than that for L(-)SddC (3TC). This may be due in part to a difference in the behavior of L(-)Fd4C and L(-)SddC (3TC) towards cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase. Furthermore, L(-)Fd4C 5'-triphosphate was retained longer within cells than L(-)SddC (3TC) 5-triphosphate. L(-)Fd4C 5'-triphosphate inhibited HBV DNA polymerase in competition with dCTP with a Ki of 0.069 +/- 0.015 microM. Given the antiviral potency and unique pharmacodynamic properties of L(-)Fd4C, this compound should be considered for development as an expanded-spectrum anti-HBV drug.	0
Title: Mapping the nucleotide binding site of uncoupling protein 1 using atomic force microscopy Abstract: A tight regulation of proton transport in the inner mitochondrial membrane is crucial for physiological processes such as ATP synthesis, heat production, or regulation of the reactive oxygen species as proposed for the uncoupling protein family members (UCP). Specific regulation of proton transport is thus becoming increasingly important in the therapy of obesity and inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and ischemic diseases. We and other research groups have shown previously that UCP1- and UCP2-mediated proton transport is inhibited by purine nucleotides. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the inhibitory effect of ATP, although structural details are still lacking. Moreover, the unresolved mystery is how UCP operates in vivo despite the permanent presence of high (millimolar) concentrations of ATP in mitochondria. Here we use the topographic and recognition (TREC) mode of an atomic force microscope to visualize UCP1 reconstituted into lipid bilayers and to analyze the ATP-protein interaction at a single molecule level. The comparison of recognition patterns obtained with anti-UCP1 antibody and ATP led to the conclusion that the ATP binding site can be accessed from both sides of the membrane. Using cantilever tips with different cross-linker lengths, we determined the location of the nucleotide binding site inside the membrane with 1 Å precision. Together with the recently published NMR structure of a UCP family member (Berardi et al. Nature, 2011, 476, 109-113), our data provide a valuable insight into the mechanism of the nucleotide binding and pave the way for new pharmacological approaches against the diseases mentioned above.	0
Title: Isolation and Biosynthetic Analysis of Haliamide, a New PKS-NRPS Hybrid Metabolite from the Marine Myxobacterium Haliangium ochraceum Abstract: Myxobacteria of marine origin are rare and hard-to-culture microorganisms, but they genetically harbor high potential to produce novel antibiotics. An extensive investigation on the secondary metabolome of the unique marine myxobacterium Haliangium ochraceum SMP-2 led to the isolation of a new polyketide-nonribosomal peptide hybrid product, haliamide (1). Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including NMR and HR-MS. Haliamide (1) showed cytotoxicity against HeLa-S3 cells with IC50 of 12 μM. Feeding experiments were performed to identify the biosynthetic building blocks of 1, revealing one benzoate, one alanine, two propionates, one acetate and one acetate-derived terminal methylene. The biosynthetic gene cluster of haliamide (hla, 21.7 kbp) was characterized through the genome mining of the producer, allowing us to establish a model for the haliamide biosynthesis. The sulfotransferase (ST)-thioesterase (TE) domains encoded in hlaB appears to be responsible for the terminal alkene formation via decarboxylation.	1
Title: Mutation of a gene encoding a putative glycoprotease leads to reduced salt tolerance, altered pigmentation, and cyanophycin accumulation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The salt-sensitive mutant 549 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was genetically and physiologically characterized. The mutated site and corresponding wild-type site were cloned and partially sequenced. The genetic analysis revealed that during the mutation about 1.8 kb was deleted from the chromosome of mutant 549. This deletion affected four open reading frames: a gcp gene homolog, the psaFJ genes, and an unknown gene. After construction of mutants with single mutations, only the gcp mutant showed a reduction in salt tolerance comparable to that of the initial mutant, indicating that the deletion of this gene was responsible for the salt sensitivity and that the other genes were of minor importance. Besides the reduced salt tolerance, a remarkable change in pigmentation was observed that became more pronounced in salt-stressed cells. The phycobilipigment content decreased, and that of carotenoids increased. Investigations of changes in the ultrastructure revealed an increase in the amount of characteristic inclusion bodies containing the high-molecular-weight nitrogen storage polymer cyanophycin (polyaspartate and arginine). The salt-induced accumulation of cyanophycin was confirmed by chemical estimations. The putative glycoprotease encoded by the gcp gene might be responsible for the degradation of cyanophycin in Synechocystis. Mutation of this gene leads to nitrogen starvation of the cells, accompanied by characteristic changes in pigmentation, ultrastructure, and salt tolerance level.	0
Title: A structural view of the inactivation of the SARS coronavirus main proteinase by benzotriazole esters Abstract: The main proteinase (M(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a principal target for the design of anticoronaviral compounds. Benzotriazole esters have been reported as potent nonpeptidic inhibitors of the enzyme, but their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro), the active-site cysteine of which has been acylated by benzotriazole esters that act as suicide inhibitors. In one of the structures, the thioester product has been hydrolyzed and benzoic acid is observed to bind to the hydrophobic S2 pocket. This structure also features the enzyme with a shortened N-terminal segment ("amputated N finger"). The results further the understanding of the important role of the N finger for catalysis as well as the design of benzotriazole inhibitors with improved specificity.	0
Title: Programmable Nanoassemblies from Non-Assembling Homopolymers Using Ad Hoc Electrostatic Interactions Abstract: Robust nanostructures were obtained from polymers that otherwise do not assemble by using a novel approach based on electrostatic self-assembly. The essence of this strategy involves the use of divalent counterions to temporarily perturb the packing features of the ionic groups in a homopolymer, which results in a vesicle-like structure that is captured in situ through a simple crosslinking reaction. The fidelity of the assembly has been tested for molecular transport across the nanomembrane, both for the molecules encapsulated in the lumen and for those trapped in the membrane itself. The membranes are addressable for robust multifunctionalization of their surfaces and for tunable transmembrane molecular transport.	0
Title: Self-malonylation is an intrinsic property of a chemically synthesized type II polyketide synthase acyl carrier protein Abstract: During polyketide biosynthesis, malonyl groups are transferred to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) component of the polyketide synthase (PKS), and it has been shown that a number of type II polyketide ACPs undergo rapid self-acylation from malonyl-CoA in the absence of a malonyl-CoA:holo-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT). More recently, however, the observation of self-malonylation has been ascribed to contamination with Escherichia coli MCAT (FabD) rather than an intrinsic property of the ACP. The wild-type apo-ACP from the actinorhodin (act) PKS of Streptomyces coelicolor (synthetic apo-ACP) has therefore been synthesized using solid-state peptide methods and refolded using the GroEL/ES chaperone system from E. coli. Correct folding of the act ACP has been confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and 1H NMR. Synthetic apo-ACP was phosphopantetheinylated to 100% by S. coelicolor holo-acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS), and the resultant holo-ACP underwent self-malonylation in the presence of malonyl-CoA. No malonylation of negative controls was observed, confirming that the use of ACPS and GroEL/ES did not introduce contamination with E. coli MCAT. This result proves unequivocally that self-malonylation is an inherent activity of this PKS ACP in vitro.	1
Title: DNA-Catalyzed Amide Hydrolysis Abstract: DNA catalysts (deoxyribozymes) for a variety of reactions have been identified by in vitro selection. However, for certain reactions this identification has not been achieved. One important example is DNA-catalyzed amide hydrolysis, for which a previous selection experiment instead led to DNA-catalyzed DNA phosphodiester hydrolysis. Subsequent efforts in which the selection strategy deliberately avoided phosphodiester hydrolysis led to DNA-catalyzed ester and aromatic amide hydrolysis, but aliphatic amide hydrolysis has been elusive. In the present study, we show that including modified nucleotides that bear protein-like functional groups (any one of primary amino, carboxyl, or primary hydroxyl) enables identification of amide-hydrolyzing deoxyribozymes. In one case, the same deoxyribozyme sequence without the modifications still retains substantial catalytic activity. Overall, these findings establish the utility of introducing protein-like functional groups into deoxyribozymes for identifying new catalytic function. The results also suggest the longer-term feasibility of deoxyribozymes as artificial proteases.	0
Title: The identification and deletion of the polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase gene responsible for the production of the phytotoxic triticone A/B in the wheat fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis Abstract: The economically important necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), causes tan spot of wheat, a disease typified by foliar necrosis and chlorosis. The culture filtrate of an Australian Ptr isolate, M4, possesses phytotoxic activity and plant bioassay guided discovery led to the purification of necrosis inducing toxins called triticone A and B. High-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis of the culture filtrate identified an additional 37 triticone-like compounds. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for triticone production (the Ttc cluster) was identified and deletion of TtcA, a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), abolished production of all triticones. The pathogenicity of mutant (ttcA) strains was not visibly affected in our assays. We hypothesize that triticones possess general antimicrobial activity important for competition in multi-microbial environments.	1
Title: Cytosolic ADP enhances the sensitivity to tolbutamide of ATP-dependent K+ channels from pancreatic B-cells Abstract: The effects of intracellular purine nucleotides on tolbutamide-induced block of ATP-dependent K+ channels from mouse pancreatic B-cells were studied using the patch-clamp technique. When applied to the inside of excised patches, tolbutamide alone blocked channel activity half-maximally at 55 microM and the concentration-response curve for the inhibition of K+ channels by tolbutamide was flat. ADP (1 mM), but not other nucleotides (AMP, GTP or GDP) increased the steepness of the concentration-response curve and decreased the half-maximally effective tolbutamide concentration to 4.2 microM. It is suggested that the ATP-dependent K+ channel or a closely related structure contains a receptor which is accessible for cytosolic ADP and controls the sensitivity to tolbutamide.	0
Title: Cholinergic plasticity of oscillating neuronal assemblies in mouse hippocampal slices Abstract: The mammalian hippocampus expresses several types of network oscillations which entrain neurons into transiently stable assemblies. These groups of co-active neurons are believed to support the formation, consolidation and recall of context-dependent memories. Formation of new assemblies occurs during theta- and gamma-oscillations under conditions of high cholinergic activity. Memory consolidation is linked to sharp wave-ripple oscillations (SPW-R) during decreased cholinergic tone. We hypothesized that increased cholinergic tone supports plastic changes of assemblies while low cholinergic tone favors their stability. Coherent spatiotemporal network patterns were measured during SPW-R activity in mouse hippocampal slices. We compared neuronal activity within the oscillating assemblies before and after a transient phase of carbachol-induced gamma oscillations. Single units maintained their coupling to SPW-R throughout the experiment and could be re-identified after the transient phase of gamma oscillations. However, the frequency of SPW-R-related unit firing was enhanced after muscarinic stimulation. At the network level, these changes resulted in altered patterns of extracellularly recorded SPW-R waveforms. In contrast, recording of ongoing SPW-R activity without intermittent cholinergic stimulation revealed remarkably stable repetitive activation of assemblies. These results show that activation of cholinergic receptors induces plasticity at the level of oscillating hippocampal assemblies, in line with the different role of gamma- and SPW-R network activity for memory formation and -consolidation, respectively.	0
Title: Chromosomal replication origin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi functions in Escherichia coli: oriC consensus sequence Abstract: The chromosomal replication origin (oriC) of Vibrio harveyi has been isolated on a plasmid and shown to function as an origin in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the V. harveyi oriC was determined. From a comparison of this sequence with oriC sequences of five enteric bacteria, we derived a consensus sequence of bacterial origins that function in E. coli. This consensus sequence identifies 122 positions within oriC where nucleotide substitutions can occur without loss of origin function. These positions are clustered rather than scattered. Four interrelated nine-base-pair repeats and eight of the dam methylation G-A-T-C sites are conserved in the consensus sequence. Very few relative insertion-deletion changes occur, and these are localized to one region of oriC. The genes for three polypeptides linked to the V. harveyi oriC were identified by using in vitro protein synthesis directed by deletion derivative plasmid templates. One of these genes, coding for a 58,000 Mr polypeptide and located 3.0 kilobase pairs from the V. harveyi oriC region, is lethal to E. coli when many copies (approximately 40 per cell) are present (high copy lethal or HCL gene). In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that a different gene, the gid gene to the left of oriC, is highly conserved between E. coli and V. harveyi, whereas the coding region to the right of oriC is much less conserved.	0
Title: Genetic variation and linkage disequilibrium in Bacillus anthracis Abstract: We performed whole-genome amplification followed by hybridization of custom-designed resequencing arrays to resequence 303 kb of genomic sequence from a worldwide panel of 39 Bacillus anthracis strains. We used an efficient algorithm contained within a custom software program, UniqueMER, to identify and mask repetitive sequences on the resequencing array to reduce false-positive identification of genetic variation, which can arise from cross-hybridization. We discovered a total of 240 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and showed that B. anthracis strains have an average of 2.25 differences per 10,000 bases in the region we resequenced. Common SNVs in this region are found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium. These patterns of variation suggest there has been little if any historical recombination among B. anthracis strains since the origin of the pathogen. This pattern of common genetic variation suggests a framework for recognizing new or genetically engineered strains.	0
Title: Engineered Streptomyces platensis strains that overproduce antibiotics platensimycin and platencin Abstract: Platensimycin, which is isolated from Streptomyces platensis MA7327, and platencin, which is isolated from S. platensis MA7339, are two recently discovered natural products that serve as important antibiotic leads. Here we report on the identification of S. platensis MA7327 as a dual producer of both platensimycin and platencin. A PCR-based approach was used to locate and clone the locus involved in platensimycin and platencin production, including ptmR1, which encodes a putative GntR-like transcriptional regulator. Deletion of this gene from the producing organism allowed us to isolate strains that overproduce platensimycin and platencin with yields of 323 +/- 29 mg/liter and 255 +/- 30 mg/liter, respectively. These results illustrate the effectiveness of genetic manipulation for the rational engineering of improvements in titers.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of a Tricyclo[6.2.2.02,7 ]dodecane System by a Berberine Bridge Enzyme-Like Aldolase Abstract: The aldol reaction is one of the most fundamental stereocontrolled carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions and is mainly catalyzed by aldolases in nature. Despite the fact that the aldol reaction has been widely proposed to be involved in fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis, a dedicated aldolase that catalyzes stereoselective aldol reactions has only rarely been reported in fungi. Herein, we activated a cryptic polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster that was upregulated in the fungal wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum during plant infection; this resulted in the production of the phytotoxic stemphyloxin II (1). Through heterologous reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathway and in vitro assay by using cell-free lysate from Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrated that a berberine bridge enzyme (BBE)-like protein SthB catalyzes an intramolecular aldol reaction to establish the bridged tricyclo[6.2.2.02,7 ]dodecane skeleton in the post-assembly tailoring step. The characterization of SthB as an aldolase enriches the catalytic toolbox of classic reactions and the functional diversities of the BBE superfamily of enzymes.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of the biosynthetic gene cluster of maduramicin and its overproduction in Actinomadura sp. J1-007 Abstract: Maduramicin is the most efficient and possesses the largest market share of all anti-coccidiosis polyether antibiotics (ionophore); however, its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) has yet to been identified, and the associated strains have not been genetically engineered. Herein, we performed whole-genome sequencing of a maduramicin-producing industrial strain of Actinomadura sp. J1-007 and identified its BGC. Additionally, we analyzed the identified BGCs in silico to predict the biosynthetic pathway of maduramicin. We then developed a conjugation method for the non-spore-forming Actinomadura sp. J1-007, consisting of a site-specific integration method for gene overexpression. The maduramicin titer increased by 30% to 7.16 g/L in shake-flask fermentation following overexpression of type II thioesterase MadTE that is the highest titer at present. Our findings provide insights into the biosynthetic mechanism of polyethers and provide a platform for the metabolic engineering of maduramicin-producing microorganisms for overproduction and development of maduramicin analogs in the future.	1
Title: OxyR is involved in coordinate regulation of expression of fimA and sod genes in Porphyromonas gingivalis Abstract: Survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the constantly changing oral environment depends on its ability to alter gene expression. We demonstrate here that P. gingivalis activates superoxide dismutase expression in response to oxidative stress and represses expression of FimA, a subunit of major fimbriae. Coordinated expression of fimA and sod is regulated by the redox-sensing transcription factor OxyR. Mutations in the oxyR gene result in a decreased expression of sod and in an elevated expression of fimA. In addition, we provide evidence that regulation of expression of fimA and sod by OxyR is mediated by direct interaction of OxyR and the promoters of these two genes. These results suggest that OxyR plays an important role in regulation of expression of virulence genes in P. gingivalis.	0
Title: FTIR analysis of GPCR activation using azido probes Abstract: We demonstrate the site-directed incorporation of an IR-active amino acid, p-azido-L-phenylalanine (azidoF, 1), into the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin using amber codon suppression technology. The antisymmetric stretch vibration of the azido group absorbs at approximately 2,100 cm(-1) in a clear spectral window and is sensitive to its electrostatic environment. We used FTIR difference spectroscopy to monitor the azido probe and show that the electrostatic environments of specific interhelical networks change during receptor activation.	0
Title: Arginyltransferase ATE1 catalyzes midchain arginylation of proteins at side chain carboxylates in vivo Abstract: Arginylation is an emerging posttranslational modification mediated by Arg-tRNA-protein-transferase (ATE1). It is believed that ATE1 links Arg solely to the N terminus of proteins, requiring prior proteolysis or action by Met-aminopeptidases to expose the arginylated site. Here, we tested the possibility of Arg linkage to midchain sites within intact protein targets and found that many proteins in vivo are modified on the side chains of Asp and Glu by unconventional chemistry that targets the carboxy rather than the amino groups at the target sites. Such arginylation appears to be functionally regulated, and it can be directly mediated by ATE1, in addition to the more conventional ATE1-mediated linkage of Arg to the N-terminal alpha amino group. This midchain arginylation implies an unconventional mechanism of ATE1 action that likely facilitates its major biological role.	0
Title: AoiQ Catalyzes Geminal Dichlorination of 1,3-Diketone Natural Products Abstract: Enzymes that can perform halogenation of aliphatic carbons are of significant interest to the synthetic and biocatalysis communities. Here we describe the characterization of AoiQ, a single-component flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes gem-dichlorination of 1,3-diketone substrates in the biosynthesis of dichlorodiaporthin. AoiQ represents the first biochemically reconstituted FDH that can halogenate an enolizable sp3-hybridized carbon atom.	1
Title: Wrapping it up in a person: Examining employment and earnings outcomes for Ph.D. recipients Abstract: In evaluating research investments, it is important to establish whether the expertise gained by researchers in conducting their projects propagates into the broader economy. For eight universities, it was possible to combine data from the UMETRICS project, which provided administrative records on graduate students supported by funded research, with data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The analysis covers 2010-2012 earnings and placement outcomes of people receiving doctorates in 2009-2011. Almost 40% of supported doctorate recipients, both federally and nonfederally funded, entered industry and, when they did, they disproportionately got jobs at large and high-wage establishments in high-tech and professional service industries. Although Ph.D. recipients spread nationally, there was also geographic clustering in employment near the universities that trained and employed the researchers. We also show large differences across fields in placement outcomes.	0
Title: Efficient synthesis of eriodictyol from L-tyrosine in Escherichia coli Abstract: The health benefits of flavonoids for humans are increasingly attracting attention. Because the extraction of high-purity flavonoids from plants presents a major obstacle, interest has emerged in biosynthesizing them using microbial hosts. Eriodictyol is a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Its efficient synthesis has been hampered by two factors: the poor expression of cytochrome P450 and the low intracellular malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) concentration in Escherichia coli. To address these issues, a truncated plant P450 flavonoid, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (tF3'H), was functionally expressed as a fusion protein with a truncated P450 reductase (tCPR) in E. coli. This allowed the engineered E. coli to produce eriodictyol from l-tyrosine by simultaneously coexpressing the fusion protein with tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI). In addition, metabolic engineering was employed to enhance the availability of malonyl-CoA so as to achieve a new metabolic balance and rebalance the relative expression of genes to enhance eriodictyol accumulation. This approach made the production of eriodictyol 203% higher than that in the control strain. By using these strategies, the production of eriodictyol from l-tyrosine reached 107 mg/liter. The present work offers an approach to the efficient synthesis of other hydroxylated flavonoids from l-tyrosine or even glucose in E. coli.	0
Title: Aza-Rubottom Oxidation: Synthetic Access to Primary α-Aminoketones Abstract: An aza analogue of the Rubottom oxidation is reported. This facile transformation takes place at ambient temperature and directly converts silyl enol ethers to the corresponding primary α-aminoketones. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent is essential for the success of this reaction. Overall this process is well-suited for the aza-functionalization and derivatization of complex organic molecules.	0
Title: Domoic acid biosynthesis in the red alga Chondria armata suggests a complex evolutionary history for toxin production Abstract: Domoic acid (DA), the causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning, is produced by select organisms within two distantly related algal clades: planktonic diatoms and red macroalgae. The biosynthetic pathway to isodomoic acid A was recently solved in the harmful algal bloom-forming diatom Pseudonitzschia multiseries, establishing the genetic basis for the global production of this potent neurotoxin. Herein, we sequenced the 507-Mb genome of Chondria armata, the red macroalgal seaweed from which DA was first isolated in the 1950s, identifying several copies of the red algal DA (rad) biosynthetic gene cluster. The rad genes are organized similarly to the diatom DA biosynthesis cluster in terms of gene synteny, including a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme critical to DA production that is notably absent in red algae that produce the simpler kainoid neurochemical, kainic acid. The biochemical characterization of the N-prenyltransferase (RadA) and kainoid synthase (RadC) enzymes support a slightly altered DA biosynthetic model in C. armata via the congener isodomoic acid B, with RadC behaving more like the homologous diatom enzyme despite higher amino acid similarity to red algal kainic acid synthesis enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis of the rad genes suggests unique origins for the red macroalgal and diatom genes in their respective hosts, with native eukaryotic CYP450 neofunctionalization combining with the horizontal gene transfer of N-prenyltransferases and kainoid synthases to establish DA production within the algal lineages.	1
Title: Prevention of peroxidative stress in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet by supplementing with a fermented bovine milk whey preparation: effect of lactic acid and beta-lactoglobulin on the antiperoxidative action Abstract: We examined the antiperoxidative properties of a fermented bovine milk whey preparation in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet and identified the active principle in the preparation. An exogenous supply of either lactic acid or an amino acid mixture simulated the unfermented whey proteins to prevent red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis and to lower liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The supply of either whey proteins or beta-lactoglobulin resulted in an increase in liver GSH and prevented iron-mediated lipoprotein peroxidation. These protein effects were reproduced in rats orally administered with either GSH or its precursor, gamma-glutamylcysteine. The amount of TBARS formed during in vitro lipoprotein peroxidation were positively correlated with liver TBARS. These results suggest that fermented milk products containing lactic acid and bovine milk whey proteins can ameliorate peroxidative stress in tissues subjected to vitamin E deficiency.	0
Title: Heterologous expression reveals the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pleuromutilin and generates bioactive semi-synthetic derivatives Abstract: The rise in antibiotic resistance is a major threat for human health. Basidiomycete fungi represent an untapped source of underexploited antimicrobials, with pleuromutilin-a diterpene produced by Clitopilus passeckerianus-being the only antibiotic from these fungi leading to commercial derivatives. Here we report genetic characterisation of the steps involved in pleuromutilin biosynthesis, through rational heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae coupled with isolation and detailed structural elucidation of the pathway intermediates by spectroscopic methods and comparison with synthetic standards. A. oryzae was further established as a platform for bio-conversion of chemically modified analogues of pleuromutilin intermediates, and was employed to generate a semi-synthetic pleuromutilin derivative with enhanced antibiotic activity. These studies pave the way for future characterisation of biosynthetic pathways of other basidiomycete natural products in ascomycete heterologous hosts, and open up new possibilities of further chemical modification for the growing class of potent pleuromutilin antibiotics.	1
Title: FILAMENT FORMATION BY ESCHERICHIA COLI AT INCREASED HYDROSTATIC PRESSURES Abstract: ZoBell, Claude E. (University of California, La Jolla), and Andre B. Cobet. Filament formation by Escherichia coli at increased hydrostatic pressures. J. Bacteriol. 87:710-719. 1964.-The reproduction as well as the growth of Escherichia coli is retarded by hydrostatic pressures ranging from 200 to 500 atm. Reproduction was indicated by an increase in the number of cells determined by plating on EMB Agar as well as by direct microscopic counts. Growth, which is not necessarily synonymous with reproduction, was indicated by increase in dry weight and protein content of the bacterial biomass. At increased pressures, cells of three different strains of E. coli tended to form long filaments. Whereas most normal cells of E. coli that developed at 1 atm were only about 2 mu long, the mean length of those that developed at 475 atm was 2.93 mu for strain R(4), 3.99 mu for strain S, and 5.82 mu for strain B cells. Nearly 90% of the bacterial biomass produced at 475 atm by strain B was found in filaments exceeding 5 mu in length; 74.7 and 16.4% of the biomass produced at 475 atm by strains S and R(4), respectively, occurred in such filaments. Strain R(4) formed fewer and shorter (5 to 35 mu) filaments than did the other two strains, whose filaments ranged in length from 5 to >100 mu. The bacterial biomass produced at all pressures had approximately the same content of protein and nucleic acids. But at increased pressures appreciably more ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proportionately less deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was found per unit of biomass. Whereas the RNA content per cell increased with cell length, the amount of DNA was nearly the same in long filaments formed at increased pressure as in cells of normal length formed at 1 atm. The inverse relationship between the concentration of DNA and cell length in all three strains of E. coli suggests that the failure of DNA to replicate at increased pressure may be responsible for a repression of cell division and consequent filament formation.	0
Title: Dynamic FtsA and FtsZ localization and outer membrane alterations during polar growth and cell division in Agrobacterium tumefaciens Abstract: Growth and cell division in rod-shaped bacteria have been primarily studied in species that grow predominantly by peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis along the length of the cell. Rhizobiales species, however, predominantly grow by PG synthesis at a single pole. Here we characterize the dynamic localization of several Agrobacterium tumefaciens components during the cell cycle. First, the lipophilic dye FM 4-64 predominantly stains the outer membranes of old poles versus growing poles. In cells about to divide, however, both poles are equally labeled with FM 4-64, but the constriction site is not. Second, the cell-division protein FtsA alternates from unipolar foci in the shortest cells to unipolar and midcell localization in cells of intermediate length, to strictly midcell localization in the longest cells undergoing septation. Third, the cell division protein FtsZ localizes in a cell-cycle pattern similar to, but more complex than, FtsA. Finally, because PG synthesis is spatially and temporally regulated during the cell cycle, we treated cells with sublethal concentrations of carbenicillin (Cb) to assess the role of penicillin-binding proteins in growth and cell division. Cb-treated cells formed midcell circumferential bulges, suggesting that interrupted PG synthesis destabilizes the septum. Midcell bulges contained bands or foci of FtsA-GFP and FtsZ-GFP and no FM 4-64 label, as in untreated cells. There were no abnormal morphologies at the growth poles in Cb-treated cells, suggesting unipolar growth uses Cb-insensitive PG synthesis enzymes.	0
Title: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Title: One-pot thioether formation from S-nitrosothiols Abstract: Protein S-nitrosation is an important post-translational modification. However, the detection of S-nitrosation is still problematic because S-nitrosation products, that is, S-nitrosothiols, are unstable species. Here a new reaction which can selectively convert unstable S-nitrosothiols to stable thioethers in one-pot under very mild conditions is reported. This reaction has the potential to be applied in the detection of protein S-nitrosation.	0
Title: Regulation of the expression level of transcription factor XylS reveals new functional insight into its induction mechanism at the Pm promoter Abstract: Background:                       XylS is the positive regulator of the inducible Pm promoter, originating from Pseudomonas putida, where the system controls a biochemical pathway involved in degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which also act as inducers. The XylS/Pm positive regulator/promoter system is used for recombinant gene expression and the output from Pm is known to be sensitive to the intracellular XylS concentration.                  Results:                       By constructing a synthetic operon consisting of xylS and luc, the gene encoding luciferase, relative XylS expression levels could be monitored indirectly at physiological concentrations. Expression of XylS from inducible promoters allowed control over a more than 800-fold range, however, the corresponding output from Pm covered only an about five-fold range. The maximum output from Pm could not be increased by introducing more copies of the promoter in the cells. Interestingly, a previously reported XylS variant (StEP-13), known to strongly stimulate expression from Pm, caused the same maximum activity from Pm as wild-type XylS at high XylS expression levels. Under uninduced conditions expression from Pm also increased as a function of XylS expression levels, and at very high concentrations the maximum activity from Pm was the same as in the presence of inducer.                  Conclusion:                       According to our proposed model, which is in agreement with current knowledge, the regulator, XylS, can exist in three states: monomers, dimers, and aggregates. Only the dimers are active and able to induce expression from Pm. Their maximum intracellular concentration and the corresponding output from Pm are limited by the concentration-dependent conversion into inactive aggregates. Maximization of the induction ratio at Pm can be obtained by expression of XylS at the level where aggregation occurs, which might be exploited for recombinant gene expression. The results described here also indicate that there might exist variants of XylS which can exist at higher active dimer concentrations and thus lead to increased expression levels from Pm.	0
Title: Farnesides A and B, sesquiterpenoid nucleoside ethers from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372 from Fiji Abstract: Farnesides A and B (1, 2), linear sesquiterpenoids connected by ether links to a ribose dihydrouracil nucleoside, were isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372, grown in saline liquid culture. The structures of the new compounds were assigned by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis primarily involving 1D and 2D NMR analysis and by comparison of spectroscopic data to the recently reported ribose nucleoside JBIR-68 (3). The farnesides are only the second example of this exceedingly rare class of microbial terpenoid nucleoside metabolites. Farneside A (1) was found to have modest antimalarial activity against the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.	0
Title: Yeast homologous recombination-based promoter engineering for the activation of silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Large-scale sequencing of prokaryotic (meta)genomic DNA suggests that most bacterial natural product gene clusters are not expressed under common laboratory culture conditions. Silent gene clusters represent a promising resource for natural product discovery and the development of a new generation of therapeutics. Unfortunately, the characterization of molecules encoded by these clusters is hampered owing to our inability to express these gene clusters in the laboratory. To address this bottleneck, we have developed a promoter-engineering platform to transcriptionally activate silent gene clusters in a model heterologous host. Our approach uses yeast homologous recombination, an auxotrophy complementation-based yeast selection system and sequence orthogonal promoter cassettes to exchange all native promoters in silent gene clusters with constitutively active promoters. As part of this platform, we constructed and validated a set of bidirectional promoter cassettes consisting of orthogonal promoter sequences, Streptomyces ribosome binding sites, and yeast selectable marker genes. Using these tools we demonstrate the ability to simultaneously insert multiple promoter cassettes into a gene cluster, thereby expediting the reengineering process. We apply this method to model active and silent gene clusters (rebeccamycin and tetarimycin) and to the silent, cryptic pseudogene-containing, environmental DNA-derived Lzr gene cluster. Complete promoter refactoring and targeted gene exchange in this "dead" cluster led to the discovery of potent indolotryptoline antiproliferative agents, lazarimides A and B. This potentially scalable and cost-effective promoter reengineering platform should streamline the discovery of natural products from silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Intramolecular Tricarbonyl-Ene Reactions and α-Hydroxy-β-Diketone Rearrangements Inspired by the Biosynthesis of Polycyclic Polyprenylated Acylphloroglucinols Abstract: Structurally unique natural products pose biosynthetic puzzles whose solution can inspire new chemical reactions. Herein, we propose a unified biosynthetic pathway towards some complex meroterpenoids-the hyperireflexolides, biyoulactones, hybeanones and hypermonones. This hypothesis led to the discovery of uncatalyzed, intramolecular carbonyl-ene reactions that are spontaneous at room temperature. We also developed an anionic cascade reaction featuring an α-hydroxy-β-diketone rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction to access four distinct natural product scaffolds from a common intermediate.	0
Title: Comparative characterization of fungal anthracenone and naphthacenedione biosynthetic pathways reveals an α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen-like cyclization catalyzed by a dimanganese thioesterase Abstract: The linear tetracyclic TAN-1612 (1) and BMS-192548 (2) were isolated from different filamentous fungal strains and have been examined as potential neuropeptide Y and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, respectively. Although the biosynthesis of fungal aromatic polyketides has attracted much interest in recent years, the biosynthetic mechanism for such naphthacenedione-containing products has not been established. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we first located the ada gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015. The connection between 1 and the ada pathway was verified through overexpression of the Zn(2)Cys(6)-type pathway-specific transcriptional regulator AdaR and subsequent gene expression analysis. The enzymes encoded in the ada gene cluster share high sequence similarities to the known apt pathway linked to the biosynthesis of anthraquinone asperthecin 3. Subsequent comparative investigation of these two highly homologous gene clusters by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a novel α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen cyclization cascade, which involves a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that hydroxylates the α-carbon of an acyl carrier protein-bound polyketide and a bifunctional metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase (MβL-TE). The bifunctional MβL-TE catalyzes the fourth ring cyclization to afford the naphthacenedione scaffold upon α-hydroxylation, whereas it performs hydrolytic release of an anthracenone product in the absence of α-hydroxylation. Through in vitro biochemical characterizations and metal analyses, we verified that the apt MβL-TE is a dimanganese enzyme and requires both Mn(2+) cations for the observed activities. The MβL-TE is the first example of a thioesterase in polyketide biosynthesis that catalyzes the Claisen-like condensation without an α/β hydrolase fold and forms no covalent bond with the substrate. These mechanistic features should be general to the biosynthesis of tetracyclic naphthacenedione compounds in fungi.	1
Title: Steroidal saponins from fresh stems of Dracaena angustifolia Abstract: Six new steroidal saponins (1-6), angudracanosides A-F, were isolated from fresh stems of Dracaena angustifolia, together with eight known compounds. The structures of compounds 1-6 were determined by detailed spectroscopic analyses and chemical methods. Antifungal testing of all compounds showed that 6 and 7 were active against Cryptococcus neoformans with IC(50)s of 9.5 and 20.0 μg/mL, respectively.	0
Title: Mining the cinnabaramide biosynthetic pathway to generate novel proteasome inhibitors Abstract: The cinnabaramides and salinosporamides are mixed PKS/NRPS natural products isolated from a terrestrial streptomycete and a marine actinomycete, respectively. They interfere with the proteasome and thus potentially inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The compounds exhibit a γ-lactam-β-lactone bicyclic ring structure attached to a cyclohexenyl unit and a PKS side chain. As a first step towards improving anticancer activity and permitting genetic approaches to novel analogues, we have cloned and characterized the cinnabaramide biosynthetic genes from Streptomyces sp. JS360. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes functionalities for the assembly of the hexyl side chain precursor. The corresponding enzymes exhibit relaxed substrate specificities towards a number of synthesized precursors, enabling production of novel chlorinated cinnabaramides. These were isolated and analyzed for activity, revealing that derivatives bearing a chlorine atom in the PKS side chain show higher inhibitory potentials towards the proteasome's proteolytic subunits (especially the trypsin and chymotrypsin units) and higher cytotoxicities towards human tumor cell lines than the parent cinnabaramide A. Although their activities towards the proteasome were weaker than that of salinosporamide A, the cinnabaramides were found to inhibit the growth of various fungi with greater potency.	1
Title: Cross-kingdom expression of synthetic genetic elements promotes discovery of metabolites in the human microbiome Abstract: Small molecules encoded by biosynthetic pathways mediate cross-species interactions and harbor untapped potential, which has provided valuable compounds for medicine and biotechnology. Since studying biosynthetic gene clusters in their native context is often difficult, alternative efforts rely on heterologous expression, which is limited by host-specific metabolic capacity and regulation. Here, we describe a computational-experimental technology to redesign genes and their regulatory regions with hybrid elements for cross-species expression in Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and eukaryotes, decoupling biosynthetic capacity from host-range constraints to activate silenced pathways. These synthetic genetic elements enabled the discovery of a class of microbiome-derived nucleotide metabolites-tyrocitabines-from Lactobacillus iners. Tyrocitabines feature a remarkable orthoester-phosphate, inhibit translational activity, and invoke unexpected biosynthetic machinery, including a class of "Amadori synthases" and "abortive" tRNA synthetases. Our approach establishes a general strategy for the redesign, expression, mobilization, and characterization of genetic elements in diverse organisms and communities.	1
Title: Loseolamycins: A Group of New Bioactive Alkylresorcinols Produced after Heterologous Expression of a Type III PKS from Micromonospora endolithica Abstract: Natural products are a valuable source of biologically active compounds with potential applications in medicine and agriculture. Unprecedented scaffold diversity of natural products and biocatalysts from their biosynthetic pathways are of fundamental importance. Heterologous expression and refactoring of natural product biosynthetic pathways are generally regarded as a promising approach to discover new secondary metabolites of microbial origin. Here, we present the identification of a new group of alkylresorcinols after transcriptional activation and heterologous expression of the type III polyketide synthase of Micromonospora endolithica. The most abundant compounds loseolamycins A1 and A2 have been purified and their structures were elucidated by NMR. Loseolamycins contain an unusual branched hydroxylated aliphatic chain which is provided by the host metabolism and is incorporated as a starter fatty acid unit. The isolated loseolamycins show activity against gram-positive bacteria and inhibit the growth of the monocot weed Agrostis stolonifera in a germination assay. The biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of loseolamycins is proposed in this paper.	1
Title: Bacteriophage T7 morphogenesis and gene 10 frameshifting in Escherichia coli showing different degrees of ribosomal fidelity Abstract: Bacteriophage T7 infection has been studied in Escherichia coli strains showing both increased and decreased ribosome fidelity and in the presence of streptomycin, which stimulates translational misreading, in an effort to determine effects on the apparent programmed translational frameshift that occurs during synthesis of the gene 10 capsid protein. Quantitation of the protein bands from SDS-PAGE failed to detect any significant effects on the amounts of the shifted 10B protein relative to the in-frame 10A protein under all fidelity conditions tested. However, any changes in fidelity conditions led to inhibition of phage morphogenesis in single-step growth experiments, which could not be accounted for by reduced amounts of phage protein synthesis, nor, at least in the case of decreased accuracy, by reduced amounts of phage DNA synthesis. Reduction in phage DNA synthesis did appear to account for a substantial proportion of the reduction in phage yield seen under conditions of increased accuracy. Similar effects of varying ribosomal fidelity on growth were also seen with phage T3, and to a lesser extent with phage T4. The absence of change in the high-frequency T7 gene 10 frameshift differs from earlier reports that ribosomal fidelity affects low-frequency frameshift errors.	0
Title: Identification of a potential general acid/base in the reversible phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by tyrosine recombinases: Flp H305 Abstract: Flp provides a unique opportunity to apply the tools of chemical biology to phosphoryl transfer reactions. Flp and other tyrosine recombinases catalyze site-specific DNA rearrangements via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. Unlike most related enzymes, Flp's nucleophilic tyrosine derives from a different protomer than the remainder of its active site. Because the tyrosine can be supplied exogenously, nonnatural synthetic analogs can be used. Here we examine the catalytic role of Flp's conserved H305. DNA cleavage was studied using a peptide containing either tyrosine (pKa congruent with 10) or 3-fluoro-tyrosine (pKa congruent with 8.4). Religation was studied using DNA substrates with 3'-phospho-cresol (pKa congruent with 10) or 3'-para-nitro-phenol (pKa congruent with 7.1). In both cases, the tyrosine analog with the lower pKa specifically restored the activity of an H305 mutant. These results provide experimental evidence that this conserved histidine functions as a general acid/base catalyst in tyrosine recombinases.	0
Title: Nebraska Red: a phosphinate-based near-infrared fluorophore scaffold for chemical biology applications Abstract: A series of novel phosphinate-based dyes displaying near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) are reported. These dyes exhibit remarkable photostability and brightness. The phosphinate functionality is leveraged as an additional reactive handle in order to tune cell permeability as well as provide a proof-of-principle for a self-reporting small molecule delivery vehicle.	0
Title: Huanglongmycin A-C, Cytotoxic Polyketides Biosynthesized by a Putative Type II Polyketide Synthase From Streptomyces sp. CB09001 Abstract: Three natural products of nonaketide biosynthetic origin, probably biosynthesized from nine molecules of malonyl-CoA, have been isolated. Herein we described the isolation and structure elucidation of huanglongmycin (HLM) A-C and identification of the putative hlm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. CB09001, isolated from a karstic cave in Xiangxi, China. Albeit previously isolated, HLM A was reported for the first time to exhibit moderate cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cell line (IC50 = 13.8 ± 1.5 μM) and weak antibacterial activity against gram-negative clinical isolates. A putative biosynthetic pathway for HLM A, featuring a nonaketide-specific type II polyketide synthase, was proposed. It would be consistent with the isolation of HLM B and C, which are two new natural products and likely shunt metabolites during HLM A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genetic architecture of wild soybean (Glycine soja) response to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) Abstract: The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is one of the most destructive pathogens of soybean plants worldwide. Host-plant resistance is an environmentally friendly method to mitigate SCN damage. To date, the resistant soybean cultivars harbor limited genetic variation, and some are losing resistance. Thus, a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of the SCN resistance, as well as developing diverse resistant soybean cultivars, is urgently needed. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 1032 wild soybean (Glycine soja) accessions with over 42,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to understand the genetic architecture of G. soja resistance to SCN race 1. Ten SNPs were significantly associated with the response to race 1. Three SNPs on chromosome 18 were localized within the previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and two of which were localized within a strong linkage disequilibrium block encompassing a nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC disease resistance gene (Glyma.18G102600). Genes encoding methyltransferases, the calcium-dependent signaling protein, the leucine-rich repeat kinase family protein, and the NB-ARC disease resistance protein, were identified as promising candidate genes. The identified SNPs and candidate genes can not only shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying SCN resistance, but also can facilitate soybean improvement employing wild genetic resources.	0
Title: The biosynthesis and catabolism of the maleic anhydride moiety of stipitatonic acid Abstract: A series of directed knockout experiments, combined with an in vitro assay of pathway components, has elucidated for the first time the chemical steps involved in the biosynthesis of the tropolone class of fungal maleic anhydrides. The pathway involves the stepwise oxidation of aldehyde and methyl carbon atoms to form a 1,2-dicarboxylate. A hydrolase-catalyzed interconversion of this and the corresponding maleic anhydride, followed by decarboxylation of the diacid leads to the pathway's final product of stipitatic acid.	1
Title: Photochemical regulation of restriction endonuclease activity Abstract: Removal by the light: The photochemical regulation of restriction endonucleases, which are important enzymes in molecular biology, has been investigated. Photolabile protecting groups have been installed on DNA substrates and have been demonstrated to inhibit restriction endonuclease activity until removed by UV light irradiation. Interestingly, these groups do not appear to dramatically affect initial binding of the enzyme to the DNA substrate, but rather prevent recognition of the specific cleavage site.	0
Title: Engineering unnatural variants of plantazolicin through codon reprogramming Abstract: Plantazolicin (PZN) is a polyheterocyclic natural product derived from a ribosomal peptide that harbors remarkable antibiotic selectivity for the causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis. To simultaneously establish the structure-activity relationship of PZN and the substrate tolerance of the biosynthetic pathway, an Escherichia coli expression strain was engineered to heterologously produce PZN analogues. Variant PZN precursor genes were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and later screened by mass spectrometry to assess post-translational modification and export by E. coli. From a screen of 72 precursor peptides, 29 PZN variants were detected. This analogue collection provided insight into the selectivity of the post-translational modifying enzymes and established the boundaries of the natural biosynthetic pathway. Unlike other studied thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins, the biosynthetic machinery appeared to be finely tuned toward the production of PZN, such that the cognate enzymes did not process even other naturally occurring sequences from similar biosynthetic clusters. The modifying enzymes were exquisitely selective, installing heterocycles only at predefined positions within the precursor peptides while leaving neighboring residues unmodified. Nearly all substitutions at positions normally harboring heterocycles prevented maturation of a PZN variant, though some exceptions were successfully produced lacking a heterocycle at the penultimate residue. No variants containing additional heterocycles were detected, although several peptide sequences yielded multiple PZN variants as a result of varying oxidation states of select residues. Eleven PZN variants were produced in sufficient quantity to facilitate purification and assessment of their antibacterial activity, providing insight into the structure-activity relationship of PZN.	1
Title: Asymmetric enzymatic glycosylation of mitoxantrone Abstract: Using a uniquely promiscuous engineered glycosyltransferase (GT) derived from the macrolide-inactivating GT OleD, a single-step asymmetric glucosylation of one 'arm' of the drug mitoxantrone was efficiently achieved in high stereo- and regiospecificity. The synthesis, structural elucidation, and anticancer activity of the corresponding mitoxantrone 4'-β-D-glucoside are described.	0
Title: Nonribosomal peptides, key biocontrol components for Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, isolated from a Greenlandic suppressive soil Abstract: Potatoes are cultivated in southwest Greenland without the use of pesticides and with limited crop rotation. Despite the fact that plant-pathogenic fungi are present, no severe-disease outbreaks have yet been observed. In this report, we document that a potato soil at Inneruulalik in southern Greenland is suppressive against Rhizoctonia solani Ag3 and uncover the suppressive antifungal mechanism of a highly potent biocontrol bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, isolated from the suppressive potato soil. A combination of molecular genetics, genomics, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) revealed an antifungal genomic island in P. fluorescens In5 encoding two nonribosomal peptides, nunamycin and nunapeptin, which are key components for the biocontrol activity by strain In5 in vitro and in soil microcosm experiments. Furthermore, complex microbial behaviors were highlighted. Whereas nunamycin was demonstrated to inhibit the mycelial growth of R. solani Ag3, but not that of Pythium aphanidermatum, nunapeptin instead inhibited P. aphanidermatum but not R. solani Ag3. Moreover, the synthesis of nunamycin by P. fluorescens In5 was inhibited in the presence of P. aphanidermatum. Further characterization of the two peptides revealed nunamycin to be a monochlorinated 9-amino-acid cyclic lipopeptide with similarity to members of the syringomycin group, whereas nunapeptin was a 22-amino-acid cyclic lipopeptide with similarity to corpeptin and syringopeptin.                  Importance:                       Crop rotation and systematic pest management are used to only a limited extent in Greenlandic potato farming. Nonetheless, although plant-pathogenic fungi are present in the soil, the farmers do not experience major plant disease outbreaks. Here, we show that a Greenlandic potato soil is suppressive against Rhizoctonia solani, and we unravel the key biocontrol components for Pseudomonas fluorescens In5, one of the potent biocontrol bacteria isolated from this Greenlandic suppressive soil. Using a combination of molecular genetics, genomics, and microbial imaging mass spectrometry, we show that two cyclic lipopeptides, nunamycin and nunapeptin, are important for the biocontrol activity of P. fluorescens In5 both in vitro and in microcosm assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthesis of nunamycin is repressed by the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum. Overall, our report provides important insight into interkingdom interference between bacteria and fungi/oomycetes.	1
Title: CloN2, a novel acyltransferase involved in the attachment of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl moiety to the deoxysugar of clorobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin contains a 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit, attached via an ester bond to the 3-OH group of the deoxysugar moiety. To investigate candidate genes responsible for the formation of this ester bond, a gene inactivation experiment was carried out in the clorobiocin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976. An in-frame deletion was created in the coding sequence of the gene cloN2. The production of secondary metabolites in the wild-type and in the cloN2 mutant was analysed. The wild-type showed clorobiocin as the main product, whereas the cloN2 mutant accumulated a new aminocoumarin derivative, novclobiocin 104, lacking the pyrrole moiety at the 3-OH of the deoxysugar. In addition, free pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid accumulated in the culture extract of the cloN2 mutant. The structures of the metabolites were confirmed by NMR and LC-MS analysis. Clorobiocin production was successfully restored in the cloN2 mutant by introducing a replicative plasmid containing the cloN2 sequence. These results prove an involvement of cloN2 in the formation of the ester bond between the pyrrole moiety and the deoxysugar in clorobiocin biosynthesis. Furthermore, they indicate that the C-methylation at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety occurs after the attachment of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid unit to the deoxysugar moiety.	1
Title: Analysis of a capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus of Bacteroides fragilis Abstract: A major clinical manifestation of infection with Bacteroides fragilis is the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses, which are induced by the capsular polysaccharides of this organism. Transposon mutagenesis was used to locate genes involved in the synthesis of capsular polysaccharides. A 24,454-bp region was sequenced and found to contain a 15,379-bp locus (designated wcf) with 16 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding products similar to those encoded by genes of other bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis loci. Four genes encode products that are similar to enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis. Seven genes encode products that are similar to sugar transferases. Two gene products are similar to O-acetyltransferases, and two products are probably involved in polysaccharide transport and polymerization. The product of one ORF, WcfH, is similar to a set of deacetylases of the NodB family. Deletion mutants demonstrated that the wcf locus is necessary for the synthesis of polysaccharide B, one of the two capsular polysaccharides of B. fragilis 9343. The virulence of the polysaccharide B-deficient mutant was comparable to that of the wild type in terms of its ability to induce abscesses in a rat model of intra-abdominal infection.	1
Title: Characterization of four beta-lactamases produced by Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus produces four types of beta-lactamase (A, B, C, and D). To investigate the effect of specific beta-lactamase type upon staphylococcal resistance, each beta-lactamase was purified to homogeneity, and the Michaelis constants (Km values) and turnover numbers (kcat values) for various penicillin and cephalosporin substrates were determined. Whereas Km values of the four beta-lactamases were comparable for penicillin G, cephalothin, and cefamandole, the type A and D enzymes exhibited greater affinity than the type B and C beta-lactamases for nitrocefin, cefazolin, and cephapirin. Conversely, the type B and C beta-lactamases exhibited greater kcat values than the type A and D enzymes against most of the cephalosporin agents, excluding nitrocefin. In contrast to earlier reports suggesting that the type B beta-lactamase is relatively inefficient in hydrolyzing penicillin G, we found only minor differences in the specific activities and kcat values of the type A, B, and C beta-lactamases. The type D beta-lactamase was distinctly less active against penicillin G, however, exhibiting only 15 to 25% of the kcat values of the other beta-lactamases. More than a 2,000-fold difference between the relative efficiencies of hydrolysis (kcat/Km) of cefazolin and cefuroxime by the type A beta-lactamase exists. This greatly exceeds the 60-fold difference in the stability of penicillin G and cefazolin with the same enzyme. Whereas the isoelectric points of the type A, B, and C beta-lactamases were similar, the value for the type D beta-lactamase was distinguishably lower (10.1 for types A, B, and C and 9.7 for type D). We conclude that marked differences in the stability of commonly used beta-lactams to hydrolysis by the staphylococcal beta-lactamases are present. This heterogeneity and the clinical implication thereof need to be considered in the antibiotic management of staphylococcal infection.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the (2S,3R)-3-methyl glutamate residue of nonribosomal lipopeptides Abstract: The calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs) and daptomycin are therapeutically relevant nonribosomal lipopeptide antibiotics that contain penultimate C-terminal 3-methyl glutamate (3-MeGlu) residues. Comparison with synthetic standards showed that (2S,3R)-configured 3-MeGlu is present in both CDA and daptomycin. Deletion of a putative methyltransferase gene glmT from the cda biosynthetic gene cluster abolished the incorporation of 3-MeGlu and resulted in the production of Glu-containing CDA exclusively. However, the 3-MeGlu chemotype could be re-established through feeding synthetic 3-methyl-2-oxoglutarate and (2S,3R)-3-MeGlu, but not (2S,3S)-3-MeGlu. This indicates that methylation occurs before peptide assembly, and that the module 10 A-domain of the CDA peptide synthetase is specific for the (2S,3R)-stereoisomer. Further mechanistic analyses suggest that GlmT catalyzes the SAM-dependent methylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to give (3R)-methyl-2-oxoglutarate, which is transaminated to (2S,3R)-3-MeGlu. These insights will facilitate future efforts to engineer lipopeptides with modified glutamate residues, which may have improved bioactivity and/or reduced toxicity.	1
Title: Artificial reconstruction of two cryptic angucycline antibiotic biosynthetic pathways Abstract: Genome-sequencing projects have revealed that Streptomyces bacteria have the genetic potential to produce considerably larger numbers of natural products than can be observed under standard laboratory conditions. Cryptic angucycline-type aromatic polyketide gene clusters are particularly abundant. Sequencing of two such clusters from Streptomyces sp. PGA64 and H021 revealed the presence of several open reading frames that could be involved in processing the basic angucyclic carbon skeleton. The pga gene cluster contains one putative FAD-dependant monooxygenase (pgaE) and a putatively bifunctional monooxygenase/short chain alcohol reductase (pgaM), whereas the cab cluster contains two similar monooxygenases (cabE and cabM) and an independent reductase (cabV). In this study we have reconstructed the biosynthetic pathways for aglycone synthesis by cloning and sequentially expressing the angucycline tailoring genes with genes required for the synthesis of the unmodified angucycline metabolite-UWM6-in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The expression studies unequivocally showed that, after the production of UWM6, the pathways proceed through the action of the similar monooxygenases PgaE and CabE, followed by reactions catalysed by PgaM and CabMV. Analysis of the metabolites produced revealed that addition of pgaE and cabE genes directs both pathways to a known shunt product, rabelomycin, whereas expression of all genes from a given pathway results in the production of the novel angucycline metabolites gaudimycin A and B. However, one of the end products is most probably further modified by endogenous S. lividans TK24 enzymes. These experiments demonstrate that genes that are either inactive or cryptic in their native host can be used as biosynthetic tools to generate new compounds.	1
Title: Titer improvement of iso-migrastatin in selected heterologous Streptomyces hosts and related analysis of mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR Abstract: iso-Migrastatin (iso-MGS) has been actively pursued recently as an outstanding candidate of antimetastasis agents. Having characterized the iso-MGS biosynthetic gene cluster from its native producer Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993, we have recently succeeded in producing iso-MGS in five selected heterologous Streptomyces hosts, albeit the low titers failed to meet expectations and cast doubt on the utility of this novel technique for large-scale production. To further explore and capitalize on the production capacity of these hosts, a thorough investigation of these five engineered strains with three fermentation media for iso-MGS production was undertaken. Streptomyces albus J1074 and Streptomyces lividans K4-114 were found to be preferred heterologous hosts, and subsequent analysis of carbon and nitrogen sources revealed that sucrose and yeast extract were ideal for iso-MGS production. After the initial optimization, the titers of iso-MGS in all five hosts were considerably improved by 3-18-fold in the optimized R2YE medium. Furthermore, the iso-MGS titer of S. albus J1074 (pBS11001) was significantly improved to 186.7 mg/L by a hybrid medium strategy. Addition of NaHCO(3) to the latter finally afforded an optimized iso-MGS titer of 213.8 mg/L, about 5-fold higher than the originally reported system. With S. albus J1074 (pBS11001) as a model host, the expression of iso-MGS gene cluster in four different media was systematically studied via the quantitative RT-PCR technology. The resultant comparison revealed the correlation of gene expression and iso-MGS production for the first time; synchronous expression of the whole gene cluster was crucial for optimal iso-MGS production. These results reveal new insights into the iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery in heterologous hosts and provide the primary data to realize large-scale production of iso-MGS for further preclinical studies.	0
Title: MS/MS networking guided analysis of molecule and gene cluster families Abstract: The ability to correlate the production of specialized metabolites to the genetic capacity of the organism that produces such molecules has become an invaluable tool in aiding the discovery of biotechnologically applicable molecules. Here, we accomplish this task by matching molecular families with gene cluster families, making these correlations to 60 microbes at one time instead of connecting one molecule to one organism at a time, such as how it is traditionally done. We can correlate these families through the use of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization MS/MS, an ambient pressure MS technique, in conjunction with MS/MS networking and peptidogenomics. We matched the molecular families of peptide natural products produced by 42 bacilli and 18 pseudomonads through the generation of amino acid sequence tags from MS/MS data of specific clusters found in the MS/MS network. These sequence tags were then linked to biosynthetic gene clusters in publicly accessible genomes, providing us with the ability to link particular molecules with the genes that produced them. As an example of its use, this approach was applied to two unsequenced Pseudoalteromonas species, leading to the discovery of the gene cluster for a molecular family, the bromoalterochromides, in the previously sequenced strain P. piscicida JCM 20779(T). The approach itself is not limited to 60 related strains, because spectral networking can be readily adopted to look at molecular family-gene cluster families of hundreds or more diverse organisms in one single MS/MS network.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing and analysis of the enterocin biosynthesis gene cluster from the marine isolate 'Streptomyces maritimus': evidence for the derailment of an aromatic polyketide synthase Abstract: Background:                       Polycyclic aromatic polyketides, such as the tetracyclines and anthracyclines, are synthesized by bacterial aromatic polyketide synthases (PKSs). Such PKSs contain a single set of iteratively used individual proteins for the construction of a highly labile poly-beta-carbonyl intermediate that is cyclized by associated enzymes to the core aromatic polyketide. A unique polyketide biosynthetic pathway recently identified in the marine strain 'Streptomyces maritimus' deviates from the normal aromatic PKS model in the generation of a diverse series of chiral, non-aromatic polyketides.                  Results:                       A 21.3 kb gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the enterocin and wailupemycin family of polyketides from 'S. maritimus' has been cloned and sequenced. The biosynthesis of these structurally diverse polyketides is encoded on a 20 open reading frames gene set containing a centrally located aromatic PKS. The architecture of this novel type II gene set differs from all other aromatic PKS clusters by the absence of cyclase and aromatase encoding genes and the presence of genes encoding the biosynthesis and attachment of the unique benzoyl-CoA starter unit. In addition to the previously reported heterologous expression of the gene set, in vitro and in vivo expression studies with the cytochrome P-450 EncR and the ketoreductase EncD, respectively, support the involvement of the cloned genes in enterocin biosynthesis.                  Conclusions:                       The enterocin biosynthesis gene cluster represents the most versatile type II PKS system investigated to date. A large series of divergent metabolites are naturally generated from the single biochemical pathway, which has several metabolic options for creating structural diversity. The absence of cyclase and aromatase gene products and the involvement of an oxygenase-catalyzed Favorskii-like rearrangement provide insight into the observed spontaneity of this pathway. This system provides the foundation for engineering hybrid expression sets in the generation of structurally novel compounds for use in drug discovery.	1
Title: Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii Abstract: New hope for old bones: The plecomacrolide bafilomycin has been explored for decades as an anti-osteoporotic. However, its structural complexity has limited the synthesis of analogues. The cloning of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from the environmental isolate Streptomyces lohii opens the door to the production of new analogues through bioengineering.	1
Title: Synthesis, characterization, and utility of thermoresponsive natural/unnatural product macroligands for affinity chromatography Abstract: [Structure: see text] The synthesis and characterization of thermoresponsive, water-soluble poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide (PNIPAM) derived macroligands displaying cyclosporin A (CsA) and dexamethasone (Dex) for use as novel affinity resins are described. Characterization of these soluble macroligands, including ligand loading and integrity, was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. One of the CsA macroligands was used in a protein affinity experiment to capture known binding proteins of CsA, the cyclophilins, from Jurkat T-cell lysates.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of fosfazinomycin is a convergent process Abstract: Fosfazinomycin A is a phosphonate natural product in which the C-terminal carboxylate of a Val-Arg dipeptide is connected to methyl 2-hydroxy-2-phosphono-acetate (Me-HPnA) via a unique hydrazide linkage. We report here that Me-HPnA is generated from phosphonoacetaldehyde (PnAA) in three biosynthetic steps through the combined action of an O-methyltransferase (FzmB) and an α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dependent non-heme iron dioxygenase (FzmG). Unexpectedly, the latter enzyme is involved in two different steps, oxidation of the PnAA to phosphonoacetic acid as well as hydroxylation of methyl 2-phosphonoacetate. The N-methyltransferase (FzmH) was able to methylate Arg-NHNH2 (3) to give Arg-NHNHMe (4), constituting the second segment of the fosfazinomycin molecule. Methylation of other putative intermediates such as desmethyl fosfazinomycin B was not observed. Collectively, our current data support a convergent biosynthetic pathway to fosfazinomycin.	1
Title: One-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems for chemoenzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates Abstract: Glycosyltransferase-catalyzed enzymatic and chemoenzymatic syntheses are powerful approaches for the production of oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoconjugates, and their derivatives. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotide donors can be combined with glycosyltransferases in one pot for efficient production of the target glycans from simple monosaccharides and acceptors. The identification of enzymes involved in the salvage pathway of sugar nucleotide generation has greatly facilitated the development of simplified and efficient one-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems for synthesizing major glycan epitopes in mammalian glycomes. The applications of OPME methods are steadily gaining popularity mainly due to the increasing availability of wild-type and engineered enzymes. Substrate promiscuity of these enzymes and their mutants allows OPME synthesis of carbohydrates with naturally occurring post-glycosylational modifications (PGMs) and their non-natural derivatives using modified monosaccharides as precursors. The OPME systems can be applied in sequence for synthesizing complex carbohydrates. The sequence of the sequential OPME processes, the glycosyltransferase used, and the substrate specificities of the glycosyltransferases define the structures of the products. The OPME and sequential OPME strategies can be extended to diverse glycans in other glycomes when suitable enzymes with substrate promiscuity become available. This Perspective summarizes the work of the authors and collaborators on the development of glycosyltransferase-based OPME systems for carbohydrate synthesis. Future directions are also discussed.	0
Title: Reconstitution of a fungal meroterpenoid biosynthesis reveals the involvement of a novel family of terpene cyclases Abstract: Meroterpenoids are hybrid natural products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that is responsible for the production of the meroterpenoid pyripyropene in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus through reconstituted biosynthesis of up to five steps in a heterologous fungal expression system. The cluster revealed a previously unknown terpene cyclase with an unusual sequence and protein primary structure. The wide occurrence of this sequence in other meroterpenoid and indole-diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of various terpenoid-bearing metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. In addition, a novel polyketide synthase that incorporated nicotinyl-CoA as the starter unit and a prenyltransferase, similar to that in ubiquinone biosynthesis, was found to be involved in the pyripyropene biosynthesis. The successful production of a pyripyropene analogue illustrates the catalytic versatility of these enzymes for the production of novel analogues with useful biological activities.	1
Title: The Discovery and Biosynthesis of Nicotinic Myxochelins from an Archangium sp. SDU34 Abstract: Myxobacteria are a prolific source of structurally diverse natural products, and one of the best-studied myxobacterial products is the siderophore myxochelin. Herein, we report two new compounds, myxochelins N (1) and O (2), that are nicotinic paralogs of myxochelin A, from the terrestrial myxobacterium Archangium sp. SDU34; 2 is functionalized with a rare 2-oxazolidinone. A precursor-feeding experiment implied that the biosynthesis of 1 or 2 was due to altered substrate specificity of the loading module of MxcE, which likely accepts nicotinic acid and benzoic acid instead of more conventional 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. We also employed a phylogenomic approach to map the evolutionary relationships of the myxochelin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all the available myxobacterial genomes, to pave the way for the future discovery of potentially hidden myxochelin derivatives. Although the biological function of 1 and 2 is unclear yet, this work underpins that even extensively studied BGCs in myxobacteria can still produce new chemistry.	1
Title: Bioactive compounds from the fern Lepisorus contortus Abstract: Phytochemical investigation of the whole plant of Lepisorus contortus (Christ) Ching led to the isolation of five new phenylethanoid glycosides (1-5), each containing a caffeoyl group, a new flavonoid glycoside (10), and 14 known compounds (6-9 and 11-15, syringic acid, vanillic acid, phloretic acid, diplopterol, and β-sitosterol). This is the first report of phenylethanoid glycosides from the family Polypodiaceae. Compounds 1-15 were evaluated for their cancer chemopreventive potential based on their ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and aromatase, quinone reductase 2 (QR-2), and COX-1/-2 activities. Quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside (15) demonstrated inhibition against QR2 with an IC(50) value of 3.84 μM, which confirmed kaempferol/quercetin glycosides as the active compounds to inhibit QR2. The compound also demonstrated NF-κB activity with an IC(50) value of 33.6 μM. In addition, compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 showed aromatase activity with IC(50) values of 30.7, 32.3, 26.8, and 35.3 μM, respectively.	0
Title: Small-molecule screening identifies the selanazal drug ebselen as a potent inhibitor of DMT1-mediated iron uptake Abstract: HEK293T cells overexpressing divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) were established to screen for small-molecule inhibitors of iron uptake. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we tested 2000 known bioactive compounds to find 3 small molecules that potently block ferrous iron uptake. One of the inhibitors, ebselen, is a seleno compound used in clinical trials as a protective agent against ischemic stroke. Ebselen inhibited Fe(II) uptake (IC(50) of approximately 0.22 microM), but did not influence Fe(III) transport or DMT1-mediated manganese uptake. An unrelated antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiobarbamate (PDTC), also inhibited DMT1 activity (IC(50) of approximately 1.54 microM). Both ebselen and PDTC increased cellular levels of reduced glutathione. These observations indicate that Fe(II) transport by DMT1 can be modulated by cellular redox status and suggest that ebselen may act therapeutically to limit iron-catalyzed damage due to transport inhibition.	0
Title: Systematic Mutational Analysis of Histidine Kinase Genes in the Nosocomial Pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Identifies BfmAK System Control of Biofilm Development Abstract: The Gram-negative bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilialives in diverse ecological niches. As a result of its formidable capabilities of forming biofilm and its resistance to multiple antibiotic agents, the bacterium is also a nosocomial pathogen of serious threat to the health of patients whose immune systems are suppressed or compromised. Besides the histidine kinase RpfC, the two-component signal transduction system (TCS), which is the canonical regulatory machinery used by most bacterial pathogens, has never been experimentally investigated inS. maltophilia Here, we annotated 62 putative histidine kinase genes in the S. maltophilia genome and successfully obtained 51 mutants by systematical insertional inactivation. Phenotypic characterization identified a series of mutants with deficiencies in bacterial growth, swimming motility, and biofilm development. A TCS, named here BfmA-BfmK (Smlt4209-Smlt4208), was genetically confirmed to regulate biofilm formation inS. maltophilia Together with interacting partner prediction and chromatin immunoprecipitation screens, six candidate promoter regions bound by BfmA in vivo were identified. We demonstrated that, among them, BfmA acts as a transcription factor that binds directly to the promoter regions of bfmA-bfmK and Smlt0800(acoT), a gene encoding an acyl coenzyme A thioesterase that is associated with biofilm development, and positively controls their transcription. Genome-scale mutational analyses of histidine kinase genes and functional dissection of BfmK-BfmA regulation in biofilm provide genetic information to support more in-depth studies on cellular signaling inS. maltophilia, in the context of developing novel approaches to fight this important bacterial pathogen.	0
Title: reGenotyper: Detecting mislabeled samples in genetic data Abstract: In high-throughput molecular profiling studies, genotype labels can be wrongly assigned at various experimental steps; the resulting mislabeled samples seriously reduce the power to detect the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. We have developed an approach to detect potential mislabeling, recover the "ideal" genotype and identify "best-matched" labels for mislabeled samples. On average, we identified 4% of samples as mislabeled in eight published datasets, highlighting the necessity of applying a "data cleaning" step before standard data analysis.	0
Title: Blue fluorescent dye-protein complexes based on fluorogenic cyanine dyes and single chain antibody fragments Abstract: Fluoromodules are complexes formed upon the noncovalent binding of a fluorogenic dye to its cognate biomolecular partner, which significantly enhances the fluorescence quantum yield of the dye. Previously, several single-chain, variable fragment (scFv) antibodies were selected from a yeast cell surface-displayed library that activated fluorescence from a family of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes covering much of the visible and near-IR spectrum. The current work expands our repertoire of genetically encodable scFv-dye pairs by selecting and characterizing a group of scFvs that activate fluorogenic violet-absorbing, blue-fluorescing cyanine dyes, based on oxazole and thiazole heterocycles. The dye binds to both yeast cell surface-displayed and soluble scFvs with low nanomolar K(d) values. These dye-protein fluoromodules exhibit high quantum yields, approaching unity for the brightest system. The promiscuity of these scFvs with other fluorogenic cyanine dyes was also examined. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that the yeast cell surface-displayed scFvs can be used for multicolor imaging. The prevalence of 405 nm lasers on confocal imaging and flow cytometry systems make these new reagents potentially valuable for cell biological studies.	0
Title: The entire nogalamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces nogalater: characterization of a 20-kb DNA region and generation of hybrid structures Abstract: Fragments spanning 20 kb of Streptomyces nogalater genomic DNA were characterized to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of the biosynthetic pathway of the anthracycline antibiotic nogalamycin. Structural analysis of the products obtained by expression of the fragments in S. galilaeus and S. peucetius mutants producing aclacinomycin and daunomycin metabolites, respectively, revealed hybrid compounds in which either the aglycone or the sugar moiety was modified. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed twenty ORFs involved in nogalamycin biosynthesis, of which eleven could be assigned to the deoxysugar pathway, four to aglycone biosynthesis, while the remaining five express products with unknown function. On the basis of sequence similarity and experimental data, the functions of the products of the newly discovered genes were determined. The results suggest that the entire biosynthetic gene cluster for nogalamycin is now known. Furthermore, the compounds obtained by heterologous expression of the genes show that it is possible to use the genes in combinatorial biosynthesis to create novel chemical structures for drug screening purposes.	1
Title: Structural and biochemical analyses of regio- and stereospecificities observed in a type II polyketide ketoreductase Abstract: Type II polyketides include antibiotics such as tetracycline and chemotherapeutics such as daunorubicin. Type II polyketides are biosynthesized by the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) that consists of 5-10 stand-alone domains. In many type II PKSs, the type II ketoreductase (KR) specifically reduces the C9-carbonyl group. How the type II KR achieves such a high regiospecificity and the nature of stereospecificity are not well understood. Sequence alignment of KRs led to a hypothesis that a well-conserved 94-XGG-96 motif may be involved in controlling the stereochemistry. The stereospecificity of single-, double-, and triple-mutant combinations of P94L, G95D, and G96D were analyzed in vitro and in vivo for the actinorhodin KR (actKR). The P94L mutation is sufficient to change the stereospecificity of actKR. Binary and ternary crystal structures of both wild-type and P94L actKR were determined. Together with assay results, docking simulations, and cocrystal structures, a model for stereochemical control is presented herein that elucidates how type II polyketides are introduced into the substrate pocket such that the C9-carbonyl can be reduced with high regio- and stereospecificities. The molecular features of actKR important for regio- and stereospecificities can potentially be applied in biosynthesizing new polyketides via protein engineering that rationally controls polyketide keto reduction.	1
Title: Exploiting the natural diversity of microviridin gene clusters for discovery of novel tricyclic depsipeptides Abstract: Microviridins are ribosomally synthesized tricyclic depsipeptides produced by different genera of cyanobacteria. The prevalence of the microviridin gene clusters and the natural diversity of microviridin precursor sequences are currently unknown. Screening of laboratory strains and field samples of the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis via PCR revealed global occurrence of the microviridin pathway and an unexpected natural variety. We could detect 15 new variants of the precursor gene mdnA encoding microviridin backbones that differ in up to 4 amino acid positions from known isoforms of the peptide. The survey not only provides insights into the versatility of the biosynthetic enzymes in a closely related group of cyanobacteria, but also facilitates the discovery and characterization of cryptic microviridin variants. This is demonstrated for microviridin L in Microcystis aeruginosa strain NIES843 and heterologously produced variants.	0
Title: Ultra-thin van der Waals crystals as semiconductor quantum wells Abstract: Control over the quantization of electrons in quantum wells is at the heart of the functioning of modern advanced electronics; high electron mobility transistors, semiconductor and Capasso terahertz lasers, and many others. However, this avenue has not been explored in the case of 2D materials. Here we apply this concept to van der Waals heterostructures using the thickness of exfoliated crystals to control the quantum well dimensions in few-layer semiconductor InSe. This approach realizes precise control over the energy of the subbands and their uniformity guarantees extremely high quality electronic transport in these systems. Using tunnelling and light emitting devices, we reveal the full subband structure by studying resonance features in the tunnelling current, photoabsorption and light emission spectra. In the future, these systems could enable development of elementary blocks for atomically thin infrared and THz light sources based on intersubband optical transitions in few-layer van der Waals materials.	0
Title: Copper(II) carboxylate promoted intramolecular diamination of terminal alkenes: improved reaction conditions and expanded substrate scope Abstract: The copper(II) carboxylate promoted diamination reaction has been improved by the use of the organic soluble copper(II) neodecanoate [Cu(ND)2]. Cu(ND)2 allowed the less-polar solvent dichloroethane (DCE) to be used, and as a consequence, decomposition of less-reactive substrates could be avoided. High diastereoselectivity was observed in the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines. Ureas, bis(anilines), and alpha-amido pyrroles derived from 2-allylaniline could also participate in the diamination reaction.	0
Title: Identification and localization of the gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of the antitumor macrolactam leinamycin in Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140 Abstract: Leinamycin (LNM), produced by Streptomyces atroolivaceus, is a thiazole-containing hybrid peptide-polyketide natural product structurally characterized with an unprecedented 1,3-dioxo-1,2-dithiolane moiety that is spiro-fused to a 18-member macrolactam ring. LNM exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antitumor activities, most significantly against tumors that are resistant to clinically important anticancer drugs, resulting from its DNA cleavage activity in the presence of a reducing agent. Using a PCR approach to clone a thiazole-forming nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) as a probe, we localized a 172-kb DNA region from S. atroolivaceus S-140 that harbors the lnm biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis of 11-kb DNA revealed three genes, lnmG, lnmH, and lnmI, and the deduced product of lnmI is characterized by domains characteristic to both NRPS and polyketide synthase (PKS). The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in LNM biosynthesis was confirmed by disrupting the lnmI gene to generate non-LNM-producing mutants and by characterizing LnmI as a hybrid NRPS-PKS megasynthetase, the NRPS module of which specifies for L-Cys and catalyzes thiazole formation. These results have now set the stage for full investigations of LNM biosynthesis and for generation of novel LNM analogs by combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis and Structural Diversification of Tylactone-Based Macrolide Antibiotics through Late-Stage Polyketide Assembly, Tailoring, and C-H Functionalization Abstract: Polyketide synthases (PKSs) represent a powerful catalytic platform capable of effecting multiple carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and oxidation state adjustments. We explored the functionality of two terminal PKS modules that produce the 16-membered tylosin macrocycle, using them as biocatalysts in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of tylactone and its subsequent elaboration to complete the first total synthesis of the juvenimicin, M-4365, and rosamicin classes of macrolide antibiotics via late-stage diversification. Synthetic chemistry was employed to generate the tylactone hexaketide chain elongation intermediate that was accepted by the juvenimicin (Juv) ketosynthase of the penultimate JuvEIV PKS module. The hexaketide is processed through two complete modules (JuvEIV and JuvEV) in vitro, which catalyze elongation and functionalization of two ketide units followed by cyclization of the resulting octaketide into tylactone. After macrolactonization, a combination of in vivo glycosylation, selective in vitro cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation, and chemical oxidation was used to complete the scalable construction of a series of macrolide natural products in as few as 15 linear steps (21 total) with an overall yield of 4.6%.	1
Title: Metabolic changes in Klebsiella oxytoca in response to low oxidoreduction potential, as revealed by comparative proteomic profiling integrated with flux balance analysis Abstract: Oxidoreduction potential (ORP) is an important physiological parameter for biochemical production in anaerobic or microaerobic processes. However, the effect of ORP on cellular physiology remains largely unknown, which hampers the design of engineering strategies targeting proteins associated with ORP response. Here we characterized the effect of altering ORP in a 1,3-propanediol producer, Klebsiella oxytoca, by comparative proteomic profiling combined with flux balance analysis. Decreasing the extracellular ORP from -150 to -240 mV retarded cell growth and enhanced 1,3-propanediol production. Comparative proteomic analysis identified 61 differentially expressed proteins, mainly involved in carbohydrate catabolism, cellular constituent biosynthesis, and reductive stress response. A hypothetical oxidoreductase (HOR) that catalyzes 1,3-propanediol production was markedly upregulated, while proteins involved in biomass precursor synthesis were downregulated. As revealed by subsequent flux balance analysis, low ORP induced a metabolic shift from glycerol oxidation to reduction and rebalancing of redox and energy metabolism. From the integrated protein expression profiles and flux distributions, we can construct a rational analytic framework that elucidates how (facultative) anaerobes respond to extracellular ORP changes.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the epothilone gene cluster Abstract: The polyketide epothilone is a potential anticancer agent that stabilizes microtubules in a similar manner to Taxol. The gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis in the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum was cloned and completely sequenced. It encodes six multifunctional proteins composed of a loading module, one nonribosomal peptide synthetase module, eight polyketide synthase modules, and a P450 epoxidase that converts desoxyepothilone into epothilone. Concomitant expression of these genes in the actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor produced epothilones A and B. Streptomyces coelicolor is more amenable to strain improvement and grows about 10-fold as rapidly as the natural producer, so this heterologous expression system portends a plentiful supply of this important agent.	1
Title: The Aspergillus nidulans enzyme TdiB catalyzes prenyltransfer to the precursor of bioactive asterriquinones Abstract: The asterriquinones represent a class of ascomycete metabolic products whose significance stems from remarkable and useful pharmacological activities, among those antiretroviral (e.g., against the HI-virus), antitumor, and antidiabetes properties. Recently, the first genetic locus for an asterriquinone, the clustered terrequinone genes tdiA-E, was identified during a genome-wide screen in Aspergillus nidulans for "orphan" natural product biosynthesis loci. Here, we describe overexpression and characterization of TdiB, which catalyzes the reverse prenylation event during terrequinone A biosynthesis, which is the transfer of dimethylallyl diphosphate to carbon atom 2' of the intermediate didemethylasterriquinone D, to yield asterriquinone C-1. TdiB does not depend on the presence of divalent metal cations for catalysis and lacks the canonical prenyl diphosphate binding motif (D/N)DXXD.	1
Title: The cereal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum produces a new class of active cytokinins during infection Abstract: The fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum causes important diseases of wheat and barley. During a survey of secondary metabolites produced by this fungus, a novel class of cytokinins, herein termed Fusarium cytokinins, was discovered. Cytokinins are known for their growth-promoting and anti-senescence activities, and the production of a cytokinin mimic by what was once considered as a necrotrophic pathogen that promotes cell death and senescence challenges the simple view that this pathogen invades its hosts by employing a barrage of lytic enzymes and toxins. Through genome mining, a gene cluster in the F. pseudograminearum genome for the production of Fusarium cytokinins was identified and the biosynthetic pathway was established using gene knockouts. The Fusarium cytokinins could activate plant cytokinin signalling, demonstrating their genuine hormone mimicry. In planta analysis of the transcriptional response to one Fusarium cytokinin suggests extensive reprogramming of the host environment by these molecules, possibly through crosstalk with defence hormone signalling pathways.	1
Title: Insights into an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthesis: identification and characterization of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides (1-3) represent a structurally unique class of antibiotics, acting as specific inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. L-49973 and the development of a genetic manipulation system for Streptomyces sp. L-49973. The biosynthetic gene cluster for the tetrapeptide antibiotic GE81112 (getA-N) was identified within a 61.7-kb region comprising 29 open reading frames (open reading frames), 14 of which were assigned to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis revealed the GE81112 cluster to consist of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding incomplete di-domain NRPS modules and a single free standing NRPS domain as well as genes encoding other biosynthetic and modifying proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in GE81112 biosynthesis was confirmed by inactivating the NRPS gene getE resulting in a GE81112 production abolished mutant. In addition, we characterized the NRPS A-domains from the pathway by expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro enzymatic assays. The previously unknown stereochemistry of most chiral centers in GE81112 was established from a combined chemical and biosynthetic approach. Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for GE81112 biosynthesis. The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising antibiotic compounds by genetic engineering.	1
Title: Assembly of membrane-bound protein complexes: detection and analysis by single molecule diffusion Abstract: Protein complexes assembled on membrane surfaces regulate a wide array of signaling pathways and cell processes. Thus, a molecular understanding of the membrane surface diffusion and regulatory events leading to the assembly of active membrane complexes is crucial to signaling biology and medicine. Here we present a novel single molecule diffusion analysis designed to detect complex formation on supported lipid bilayers. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by detection of an engineered, heterodimeric complex in which two membrane-bound pleckstrin homology (PH) domains associate stably, but reversibly, upon Ca(2+)-triggered binding of calmodulin (CaM) to a target peptide from myosin light chain kinase (MLCKp). Specifically, when a monomeric, fluorescent PH-CaM domain fusion protein diffusing on a supported bilayer binds a dark MLCKp-PH domain fusion protein, the heterodimeric complex is observed to diffuse nearly 2-fold more slowly than the monomer because both of its twin PH domains can simultaneously bind to the viscous bilayer. In a mixed population of monomers and heterodimers, the single molecule diffusion analysis resolves, identifies and quantitates the rapidly diffusing monomers and slowly diffusing heterodimers. The affinity of the CaM-MLCKp interaction is measured by titrating dark MLCKp-PH construct into the system, while monitoring the changing ratio of monomers and heterodimers, yielding a saturating binding curve. Strikingly, the apparent affinity of the CaM-MLCKp complex is ~10(2)-fold greater in the membrane system than in solution, apparently due to both faster complex association and slower complex dissociation on the membrane surface. More broadly, the present findings suggest that single molecule diffusion measurements on supported bilayers will provide an important tool for analyzing the 2D diffusion and assembly reactions governing the formation of diverse membrane-bound complexes, including key complexes from critical signaling pathways. The approach may also prove useful in pharmaceutical screening for compounds that inhibit membrane complex assembly or stability.	0
Title: Analysis of genes involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin Abstract: Lantibiotics are peptide-derived antibiotics with high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. They are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Götz, H. Zähner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). The most important lantibiotics are subtilin and the food preservative nisin, which both have a very similar structure. By using a hybridization probe specific for the structural gene of subtilin, spaS, the DNA region adjacent to spaS was isolated from Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analysis of a 4.9-kb fragment revealed several open reading frames with the same orientation as spaS. Downstream of spaS, no reading frames were present on the isolated XbaI fragment. Upstream of spaS, three reading frames, spaB, spaC, and spaT, were identified which showed strong homology to genes identified near the structural gene of the lantibiotic epidermin. The SpaT protein derived from the spaT sequence was homologous to hemolysin B of Escherichia coli, which indicated its possible function in subtilin transport. Gene deletions within spaB and spaC revealed subtilin-negative mutants, whereas spaT gene disruption mutants still produced subtilin. Remarkably, the spaT mutant colonies revealed a clumpy surface morphology on solid media. After growth on liquid media, spaT mutant cells agglutinated in the mid-logarithmic growth phase, forming longitudinal 3- to 10-fold-enlarged cells which aggregated. Aggregate formation preceded subtilin production and cells lost their viability, possibly as a result of intracellular subtilin accumulation. Our results clearly proved that reading frames spaB and spaC are essential for subtilin biosynthesis whereas spaT mutants are probably deficient in subtilin transport.	1
Title: Identification and cloning of a type III polyketide synthase required for diffusible pigment biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The soluble, diffusible red-brown pigment produced by a Saccharopolyspora erythraea "red variant" has been shown to contain glycosylated and polymerized derivatives of 2,5,7-trihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (flaviolin). Flaviolin is a spontaneous oxidation product of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN), which is biosynthesized in bacteria by a chalcone synthase-like (CS-like) type III polyketide synthase (PKS). A fragment of the gene responsible for THN biosynthesis in S. erythraea E_8-7 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers based on conserved regions of known plant CS and bacterial CS-like genes. From the isolated fragment, a suicide vector was prepared, which was subsequently used to disrupt the red-brown pigment-producing (rpp) locus in S. erythraea, generating a mutant that displayed an albino phenotype. Chromosomal DNA from the albino mutant was subsequently used in a vector-recapture protocol to isolate a plasmid that contained an insert spanning the entire rpp locus. Sequencing of the insert revealed that the disrupted open reading frame (ORF) encodes a CS-like protein displaying 69% sequence identity to the rppA gene of Streptomyces griseus. The S. griseus rppA gene encodes RppA, the first characterized bacterial CS-like protein, which is sufficient in vitro for the synthesis of THN from malonyl-CoA. The rppA disruption mutant and rppA sequence provided a means by which to address the mechanism of diffusible pigment biosynthesis, as well as to investigate any link between this and the modulation of erythromycin A titre, which has been observed for S. erythraea variants.	1
Title: Arylchlorogermanes/TBAF/"moist" toluene: a promising combination for Pd-catalyzed Germyl-Stille cross-coupling Abstract: The trichlorophenyl,- dichlorodiphenyl,- and chlorotriphenylgermanes undergo Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings with aryl bromides and iodides in the presence of TBAF in toluene with addition of the measured amount of water. One chloride ligand on the Ge center allows efficient activation by fluoride to promote transfer of one, two, or three phenyl groups from the organogermane precursors.	0
Title: The cylindrospermopsin gene cluster of Aphanizomenon sp. strain 10E6: organization and recombination Abstract: Cylindrospermopsin (CYN), a potent hepatoxin, occurs in freshwaters worldwide. Several cyanobacterial species produce the toxin, but the producing species vary between geographical regions. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a common algae species in temperate fresh and brackish waters, is one of the three well-documented CYN producers in European waters. So far, no genetic information on the CYN genes of this species has been available. Here, we describe the complete CYN gene cluster, including flanking regions from the German Aphanizomenon sp. strain 10E6 using a full genome sequencing approach by 454 pyrosequencing and bioinformatic identification of the gene cluster. In addition, we have sequenced a approximately 7 kb fragment covering the genes cyrC (partially), cyrA and cyrB (partially) of the same gene cluster in the CYN-producing Aphanizomenon sp. strains 10E9 and 22D11. Comparisons with the orthologous gene clusters of the Australian Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strains AWT205 and CS505 and the partial gene cluster of the Israeli Aphanizomenon ovalisporum strain ILC-146 revealed a high gene sequence similarity, but also extensive rearrangements of gene order. The high sequence similarity (generally higher than that of 16S rRNA gene fragments from the same strains), atypical GC-content and signs of transposase activities support the suggestion that the CYN genes have been horizontally transferred.	1
Title: Molecular and biochemical studies of chondramide formation-highly cytotoxic natural products from Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 Abstract: The jaspamide/chondramide family of depsipeptides are mixed PKS/NRPS natural products isolated from marine sponges and a terrestrial myxobacterium that potently affect the function of the actin cytoskeleton. As a first step to improve production in heterologous host cells and permit genetic approaches to novel analogs, we have cloned and characterized the chondramide biosynthetic genes from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes a rare tyrosine aminomutase for beta-tyrosine formation and a previously unknown tryptophan-2-halogenase. Conditions for gene transfer into C. crocatus Cm c5 were developed, and inactivation of several genes corroborated their proposed function and served to define the boundaries of the cluster. Biochemical characterization of the final NRPS adenylation domain confirmed the direct activation of beta-tyrosine, and fluorinated chondramides were produced through precursor-directed biosynthesis.	1
Title: Cyclic lipopeptide-producing Pseudomonas koreensis group strains dominate the cocoyam rhizosphere of a Pythium root rot suppressive soil contrasting with P. putida prominence in conducive soils Abstract: Pseudomonas isolates from tropical environments have been underexplored and may form an untapped reservoir of interesting secondary metabolites. In this study, we compared Pseudomonas and cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) diversity in the rhizosphere of a cocoyam root rot disease (CRRD) suppressive soil in Boteva, Cameroon with those from four conducive soils in Cameroon and Nigeria. Compared with other soils, Boteva andosols were characterized by high silt, organic matter, nitrogen and calcium. Besides, the cocoyam rhizosphere at Boteva was characterized by strains belonging mainly to the P. koreensis and P. putida (sub)groups, with representations in the P. fluorescens, P. chlororaphis, P. jessenii and P. asplenii (sub)groups. In contrast, P. putida isolates were prominent in conducive soils. Regarding CLP diversity, Boteva was characterized by strains producing 11 different CLP types with cocoyamide A producers, belonging to the P. koreensis group, being the most abundant. However, putisolvin III-V producers were the most dominant in the rhizosphere of conducive soils in both Cameroon and Nigeria. Furthermore, we elucidated the chemical structure of putisolvin derivatives-putisolvin III-V, and described its biosynthetic gene cluster. We show that high Pseudomonas and metabolic diversity may be driven by microbial competition, which likely contributes to soil suppressiveness to CRRD.	1
Title: Novel pyoverdine biosynthesis gene(s) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO Abstract: Conjugational mobilization of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cosmid bank (in pMMB33) into a pyoverdine-deficient (pvd) mutant harbouring a mutation in the 47 min region of the chromosome yielded one clone which restored yellow-green pigmentation and fluorescence when grown on iron-deficient medium. The relevant pMMB33-derivative cosmid, pPYP17, contained a 15.1 kb insert which was subcloned into pKT240 as a 10.8 Sacl-CIal fragment conferring the same phenotype. This derivative, pPYP180, like pPYP17, also conferred an apparent wild-type phenotype on pvd mutants previously shown to map genetically in the 23 min region of the P. aeruginosa PAO chromosomes. Physical mapping indicated that the cloned DNA fragment is located at the 66-70 min region of the PAO chromosome, demonstrating that the restored apparent wild-type phenotype observed for the transconjugants was not the result of a true gene complementation. A gene interruption was obtained by replacing a 0.6 kb BgIll-BgIll region of pPYP180 necessary for the expression of the pigmentation/fluorescence phenotype, by a Hgr interposon (omega Hg). After conjugational transfer and introduction of the mutagenized fragment into the PAO1 chromosome by gene replacement, pyoverdine-deficient mutants were recovered, indicating that the fragment indeed contained at least one gene involved in pyoverdine synthesis. The yellow-green fluorescent compound produced by such cells harbouring plasmids pPYP17 or pPYP180 differed from pyoverdine in several aspects and was consequently named pseudoverdine. Although pseudoverdine was able to complex iron, it was unable to restore growth to pvd mutants in the presence of the iron chelator ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), or to mediate iron uptake into PAO1. Pseudoverdine lacked a peptide chain but possessed spectral properties similar to pyoverdine, suggesting that it was structurally related to the chromophore of the pyoverdine molecule. The recent structural determination of pseudoverdine as a coumarin derivative confirmed this view and sheds some light on the biosynthetic pathway of the pyoverdine chromophore.	1
Title: Playing with the Molecules of Life Abstract: Our understanding of the complex molecular processes of living organisms at the molecular level is growing exponentially. This knowledge, together with a powerful arsenal of tools for manipulating the structures of macromolecules, is allowing chemists to to harness and reprogram the cellular machinery in ways previously unimaged. Here we review one example in which the genetic code itself has been expanded with new building blocks that allow us to probe and manipulate the structures and functions of proteins with unprecedented precision.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the tcmII-tcmIV region of the tetracenomycin C biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces glaucescens and evidence that the tcmN gene encodes a multifunctional cyclase-dehydratase-O-methyl transferase Abstract: Mutations in the tcmII-tcmIV region of the Streptomyces glaucescens chromosome block the C-3 and C-8 O-methylations of the polyketide antibiotic tetracenomycin C (Tcm C). The nucleotide sequence of this region reveals the presence of two genes, tcmN and tcmO, whose deduced protein products display similarity to the hydroxyindole O-methyl transferase of the bovine pineal gland, an enzyme that catalyzes a phenolic O-methylation analogous to those required for the biosynthesis of Tcm C. The deduced product of the tcmN gene also has an N-terminal domain that shows similarity to the putative ActVII and WhiE ORFVI proteins of Streptomyces coelicolor. The tcmN N-terminal domain can be separated from the remainder of the tcmN gene product, and when coupled on a plasmid with the Tcm C polyketide synthase genes (tcmKLM), this domain enables high-level production of an early, partially cyclized intermediate of Tcm C in a Tcm C- null mutant or in a heterologous host (Streptomyces lividans). By analogy to fatty acid biosynthesis, the tcmKLM polyketide synthase gene products are probably sufficient to produce the linear decaketide precursor of Tcm C; thus, the tcmN N-terminal domain is most likely responsible for one or more of the early cyclizations and, perhaps, the attendant dehydrations that lead to the partially cyclized intermediate. The tcmN gene therefore appears to encode a multifunctional cyclase-dehydratase-3-O-methyl transferase. The tcmO gene encodes the 8-O-methyl transferase.	1
Title: Effective one-pot multienzyme (OPME) synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides and other sialosides containing 4-O-acetyl sialic acid Abstract: A facile one-pot two-enzyme chemoenzymatic approach has been established for the gram (Neu4,5Ac2α3Lac, 1.33 g) and preparative scale (Neu4,5Ac2α3LNnT) synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides. Other O-acetyl-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac2)- or 4-O-acetyl-5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu4Ac5Gc) -containing α2-3-sialosides have also been synthesized in the preparative scale. Used as an effective probe, Neu4,5Ac2α3GalβpNP was found to be a suitable substrate by human influenza A viruses but not bacterial sialidases.	0
Title: Involvement of SgvP in carbon-sulfur bond formation during Griseoviridin biosynthesis Abstract: Griseoviridin (GV) is an A-type streptogramin antibiotic displaying antimicrobial activity and acting synergistically with viridogrisein (VG). Bioinformatic analyses reveal SgvP as the sole cytochrome P450 enzyme in the GV/VG gene cluster. To explore the role of SgvP in the GV/VG pathway, we inactivated the sgvP gene. The resulting ΔsgvP mutant generated two new products: GV-1 and GV-2, both lacking the CS bridge. In trans complementation of the sgvP gene into the ΔsgvP mutant strain partially restores GV production. Feeding [1-(13) C]-labeled cysteine to the wild-type strain led to enrichment of C-7 in the GV scaffold, thus verifying that the CS bond in GV is formed through direct coupling of the free SH group provided by the side chain of cysteine. The above results highlight the significance of SgvP in CS bond formation in griseoviridin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Dynamics of ligand binding from 13C NMR relaxation dispersion at natural abundance Abstract: We show that Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) 13Calpha NMR relaxation dispersion measurements are a viable means for profiling mus-ms ligand dynamics involved in receptor binding. Critically, the dispersion is at natural 13C abundance; this matches typical pharmaceutical research settings in which ligand isotope-labeling is often impractical. The dispersion reveals ligand 13Calpha nuclei that experience mus-ms modulation of their chemical shifts due to binding. 13Calpha shifts are dominated by local torsion angles , psi, chi1; hence, these experiments identify flexible torsion angles that may assist complex formation. Since the experiments detect the ligand, they are viable even in the absence of a receptor structure. The mus-ms dynamic information gained helps establish flexibility-activity relationships. We apply these experiments to study the binding of a phospho-peptide substrate ligand to the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1.	0
Title: Identification of DEBS 1, DEBS 2 and DEBS 3, the multienzyme polypeptides of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The ery A region of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea has previously been shown to contain three large open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the components of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins obtained by overexpression of 3' regions of the ORF2 and ORF3 genes. In Western blotting experiments, each antiserum reacted strongly with a different high molecular weight protein in extracts of erythromycin-producing S. erythraea cells. These putative DEBS 2 and DEBS 3 proteins were purified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The protein sequences were entirely consistent with the and DEBS 3 proteins were purified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The protein sequences were entirely consistent with the translation start sites predicted from the DNA sequences of ORFs 2 and 3. A third high molecular weight protein co-purified with DEBS 2 and DEBS 3 and had an N-terminal sequence that matched a protein sequence translated from the DNA sequence some 155 base pairs upstream from the previously proposed start codon of ORF1.	1
Title: Teichuronic acid operon of Bacillus subtilis 168 Abstract: Sequence analysis reveals that the Bacillus subtilis 168 tuaABCDEFGH operon encodes enzymes required for the polymerization of teichuronic acid as well as for the synthesis of one of its precursors, the UDP-glucuronate. Mutants deficient in any of the tua genes, grown in batch cultures under conditions of phosphate limitation, were characterized by reduced amounts of uronate in their cell walls. The teichuronic acid operon belongs to the Pho regulon, as phosphate limitation induces its transcription. Placing the tuaABCDEFGH operon under the control of the inducible Pspac promoter allowed its constitutive expression independently of the phosphate concentration in the medium; the level of uronic acid in cell walls was dependent on the concentration of the inducer. Apparently, owing to an interdependence between teichoic and teichuronic acid incorporation into the cell wall, in examined growth conditions, the balance between the two polymers is maintained in order to insure a constant level of the wall negative charge.	1
Title: Characterization of WbiQ: An α1,2-fucosyltransferase from Escherichia coli O127:K63(B8), and synthesis of H-type 3 blood group antigen Abstract: Escherichia coli O127:K63(B8) possesses high human blood group H (O) activity due to its O-antigen repeating unit structure. In this work, the wbiQ gene from E. coli O127:K63(B8) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal GST affinity tag. Using the GST-WbiQ fusion protein, the wbiQ gene was identified to encode an α1,2-fucosyltransferase using a radioactivity based assay, thin-layer chromatography assay, as well confirming product formation by using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The fused enzyme (GST-WbiQ) has an optimal pH range from 6.5 to 7.5 and does not require the presence of a divalent metal to be enzymatically active. WbiQ displays strict substrate specificity, displaying activity only towards acceptors that contain Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-α-OR linkages; indicating that both the Gal and GalNAc residues are vital for enzymatic activity. In addition, WbiQ was used to prepare the H-type 3 blood group antigen, Fuc-α1,2-Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-α-OMe, on a milligram scale.	1
Title: Defining paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli: functional characterization of two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases Abstract: Indole diterpenes are a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi. Biosynthetic schemes have been proposed for these metabolites but until recently none of the proposed steps had been validated by biochemical or genetic studies. Using Penicillium paxilli as a model experimental system to study indole diterpene biosynthesis we previously showed by deletion analysis that a cluster of seven genes is required for paxilline biosynthesis. Two of these pax genes, paxP and paxQ (encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases), are required in the later steps in this pathway. Here, we describe the function of paxP and paxQ gene products by feeding proposed paxilline intermediates to strains lacking the pax cluster but containing ectopically integrated copies of paxP or paxQ. Transformants containing paxP converted paspaline into 13-desoxypaxilline as the major product and beta-PC-M6 as the minor product. beta-PC-M6, but not alpha-PC-M6, was also a substrate for PaxP and was converted to 13-desoxypaxilline. paxQ-containing transformants converted 13-desoxypaxilline into paxilline. These results confirm that paspaline, beta-PC-M6, and 13-desoxypaxilline are paxilline intermediates and that paspaline and beta-PC-M6 are substrates for PaxP, and 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ. PaxP and PaxQ also utilized beta-paxitriol and alpha-PC-M6 as substrates converting them to paxilline and alpha-paxitriol, respectively. These findings have allowed us to delineate clearly the biosynthetic pathway for paxilline for the first time.	1
Title: Nanoscopic Characterisation of Individual Endogenous Protein Aggregates in Human Neuronal Cells Abstract: The aberrant misfolding and subsequent conversion of monomeric protein into amyloid aggregates characterises many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. These aggregates are highly heterogeneous in structure, generally of low abundance and typically smaller than the diffraction limit of light (≈250 nm). To overcome the challenges these characteristics pose to the study of endogenous aggregates formed in cells, we have developed a method to characterise them at the nanometre scale without the need for a conjugated fluorophore. Using a combination of DNA PAINT and an amyloid-specific aptamer, we demonstrate that this technique is able to detect and super-resolve a range of aggregated species, including those formed by α-synuclein and amyloid-β. Additionally, this method enables endogenous protein aggregates within cells to be characterised. We found that neuronal cells derived from patients with Parkinson's disease contain a larger number of protein aggregates than those from healthy controls.	0
Title: Constitution of the cell envelope of Haemophilus influenzae in relation to competence for genetic transformation Abstract: Cell envelopes of Haemophilus influenzae have been prepared by breakage in a French pressure cell followed by differential centrifugation. The envelope fraction may be resolved into an inner-membrane (light) and an outer-membrane (heavy) fraction on density gradients. Envelopes from competent cells possess elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide with a composition different from that of log-phase cell envelopes. Three apparently new polypeptides have been observed in envelopes from competent cells by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; additional quantitative alterations in the profiles of membrane polypeptides also company the development of the capacity to transport deoxyribonucleic acid. Most of the polypeptide changes are confined to the outer membrane; one new polypeptide is associated with the inner cytoplasmic membrane of competent cells. Protein synthesis during competence developement is rquired for the change in lipopolysaccharides and in the envelope polypeptides to occur.	0
Title: Partial DNA-guided Cas9 enables genome editing with reduced off-target activity Abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile RNA-guided genome editing tool. Here we demonstrate that partial replacement of RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides in CRISPR RNA (crRNA) enables efficient gene editing in human cells. This strategy of partial DNA replacement retains on-target activity when used with both crRNA and sgRNA, as well as with multiple guide sequences. Partial DNA replacement also works for crRNA of Cpf1, another CRISPR system. We find that partial DNA replacement in the guide sequence significantly reduces off-target genome editing through focused analysis of off-target cleavage, measurement of mismatch tolerance and genome-wide profiling of off-target sites. Using the structure of the Cas9-sgRNA complex as a guide, the majority of the 3' end of crRNA can be replaced with DNA nucleotide, and the 5 - and 3'-DNA-replaced crRNA enables efficient genome editing. Cas9 guided by a DNA-RNA chimera may provide a generalized strategy to reduce both the cost and the off-target genome editing in human cells.	0
Title: Biochemical characterization and subcellular localization of the sterol C-24(28) reductase, erg4p, from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The yeast ERG4 gene encodes sterol C-24(28) reductase which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of ergosterol. Deletion of ERG4 resulted in a complete lack of ergosterol and accumulation of the precursor ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol. An erg4 mutant strain exhibited pleiotropic defects such as hypersensitivity to divalent cations and a number of drugs such as cycloheximide, miconazole, 4-nitroquinoline, fluconazole, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Similar to erg6 mutants, erg4 mutants are sensitive to the Golgi-destabilizing drug brefeldin A. Enzyme activity measurements with isolated subcellular fractions revealed that Erg4p is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This view was confirmed in vivo by fluorescence microscopy of a strain expressing a functional fusion of Erg4p to enhanced green fluorescent protein. We conclude that ergosterol biosynthesis is completed in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the final product is supplied from there to its membranous destinations.	0
Title: Two-dimensional, conductive niobium and molybdenum metal-organic frameworks Abstract: The incorporation of second-row transition metals into metal-organic frameworks could greatly improve the performance of these materials across a wide variety of applications due to the enhanced covalency, redox activity, and spin-orbit coupling of late-row metals relative to their first-row analogues. Thus far, however, the synthesis of such materials has been limited to a small number of metals and structural motifs. Here, we report the syntheses of the two-dimensional metal-organic framework materials (H2NMe2)2Nb2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Mo2(Cl2dhbq)3 (H2Cl2dhbq = 3,6-dichloro-2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone), which feature mononuclear niobium or molybdenum metal nodes and are formed through reactions driven by metal-to-ligand electron transfer. Characterization of these materials via X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests a local trigonal prismatic coordination geometry for both niobium and molybdenum, consistent with their increased covalency relative to related first-row transition metal compounds. A combination of vibrational spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, and electronic conductivity measurements reveal that these two frameworks possess distinct electronic structures. In particular, while the niobium compound displays evidence for redox-trapping and strong magnetic interactions, the molybdenum phase is valence-delocalized with evidence of large polaron formation. Weak interlayer interactions in the neutral molybdenum phase enable solvent-assisted exfoliation to yield few-layer hexagonal nanosheets. Together, these results represent the first syntheses of metal-organic frameworks containing mononuclear niobium and molybdenum nodes, establishing a route to frameworks incorporating a more diverse range of second- and third-row transition metals with increased covalency and the potential for improved charge transport and stronger magnetic coupling.	0
Title: tRNA-Dependent Aminoacylation of an Amino Sugar Intermediate in the Biosynthesis of a Streptothricin-Related Antibiotic Abstract: The antibiotic streptothricin (ST) possesses an amino sugar bound to an l-β-lysine (β-Lys) residue via a peptide bond. The peptide bond formation has been shown to be catalyzed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) during ST biosynthesis. The focus of this study is the closely related ST analogue BD-12, which carries a glycine-derived side chain rather than a β-Lys residue. Here, in Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC13826, we describe our biosynthetic studies of BD-12, which revealed that the peptide bond between the amino sugar and the glycine residue is catalyzed by a Fem-like enzyme (Orf11) in a tRNA-dependent manner rather than by an NRPS. Although there have been several reports of peptide bond-forming tRNA-dependent enzymes, to our knowledge, Orf11 is the first enzyme that can accept an amino sugar as a substrate. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the structural diversity of the side chains of ST-type compounds in nature is generated in an unusual manner via two distinct peptide bond-forming mechanisms. Moreover, the identification and functional analysis of Orf11 resulted in not only the production of new ST-related compounds, but also the provision of new insights into the structure-activity relationship of the ST-related antibiotics.                  Importance:                       The antibiotic streptothricin (ST) possesses an amino sugar bound to an l-β-lysine (β-Lys) side chain via a peptide bond formed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). BD-12, an analogue of ST, carries a glycine-derived side chain rather than β-Lys, and here, we describe the BD-12-biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC13826, which contains the orf11 gene encoding a novel tRNA-dependent peptide bond-forming enzyme. The unique Fem-like enzyme (Orf11) accepts the amino sugar as a substrate and mediates the peptide formation between the amino sugar intermediate and glycine. Our studies demonstrate that the structural diversity of the side chains of ST-related compounds in nature is generated via two distinct peptide bond-forming mechanisms.	1
Title: Molecular basis for chloronium-mediated meroterpene cyclization: cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of the napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Structural inspection of the bacterial meroterpenoid antibiotics belonging to the napyradiomycin family of chlorinated dihydroquinones suggests that the biosynthetic cyclization of their terpenoid subunits is initiated via a chloronium ion. The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases that catalyze such reactions are distributed in fungi and marine algae and have yet to be characterized from bacteria. The cloning and sequence analysis of the 43-kb napyradiomycin biosynthetic cluster (nap) from Streptomyces aculeolatus NRRL 18422 and from the undescribed marine sediment-derived Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 revealed 33 open reading frames, three of which putatively encode vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases. Heterologous expression of the CNQ-525-based nap biosynthetic cluster in Streptomyces albus produced at least seven napyradiomycins, including the new analog 2-deschloro-2-hydroxy-A80915C. These data not only revealed the molecular basis behind the biosynthesis of these novel meroterpenoid natural products but also resulted in the first in vivo verification of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases.	1
Title: Identification of two polyketide synthase gene clusters on the linear plasmid pSLA2-L in Streptomyces rochei Abstract: The 200kb linear plasmid pSLA2-L was suggested to be involved in the production of two macrolide antibiotics, lankamycin (Lm) and lankacidin (Lc), in Streptomyces rochei 7434AN4. Hybridization experiments with the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for erythromycin and actinorhodin identified two eryAI-homologous regions and an actI-homologous region on pSLA2-L. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.6kb SacI fragment carrying one of the eryAI-homologs revealed that it codes for part of a large protein with four domains for ketoreductase, acyl carrier protein, ketosynthase, and acyltransferase. Gene disruption confirmed that the two eryAI-homologs are parts of a large type-I PKS gene cluster for Lm. A 4.8kb DNA carrying the actI-homologous region contains four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) as well as an additional ORF, i.e. ORF5, which might code for a thioesterase. Deletion of the ORF2-ORF4 region showed that it is not involved in the synthesis of Lm or Lc. Thus, it was confirmed that pSLA2-L contains two PKS gene clusters for Lm and an unknown type-II polyketide.	1
Title: Glycine-derived nitronates bifurcate to O-methylation or denitrification in bacteria Abstract: Natural products with rare functional groups are likely to be constructed by unique biosynthetic enzymes. One such rare functional group is the O-methyl nitronate, which can undergo [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with olefins in mild conditions. O-methyl nitronates are found in some natural products; however, how such O-methyl nitronates are assembled biosynthetically is unknown. Here we show that the assembly of the O-methyl nitronate in the natural product enteromycin carboxamide occurs via activation of glycine on a peptidyl carrier protein, followed by reaction with a diiron oxygenase to give a nitronate intermediate and then with a methyltransferase to give an O-methyl nitronate. Guided by the discovery of this pathway, we then identify related cryptic biosynthetic gene cassettes in other bacteria and show that these alternative gene cassettes can, instead, facilitate oxidative denitrification of glycine-derived nitronates. Altogether, our work reveals bifurcating pathways from a central glycine-derived nitronate intermediate in bacteria.	1
Title: Chiral gold nanowires with Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal structure Abstract: A Boerdijk-Coxeter-Bernal (BCB) helix is made of linearly stacked regular tetrahedra (tetrahelix). As such, it is chiral without nontrivial translational or rotational symmetries. We demonstrate here an example of the chiral BCB structure made of totally symmetrical gold atoms, created in nanowires by direct chemical synthesis. Detailed study by high-resolution electron microscopy illustrates their elegant chiral structure and the unique one-dimensional "pseudo-periodicity". The BCB-type atomic packing mode is proposed to be a result of the competition and compromise between the lattice and surface energy.	0
Title: The structure and biosynthesis of heinamides A1-A3 and B1-B5, antifungal members of the laxaphycin lipopeptide family Abstract: Laxaphycins are a family of cyclic lipopeptides with synergistic antifungal and antiproliferative activities. They are produced by multiple cyanobacterial genera and comprise two sets of structurally unrelated 11- and 12-residue macrocyclic lipopeptides. Here, we report the discovery of new antifungal laxaphycins from Nostoc sp. UHCC 0702, which we name heinamides, through antimicrobial bioactivity screening. We characterized the chemical structures of eight heinamide structural variants A1-A3 and B1-B5. These variants contain the rare non-proteinogenic amino acids 3-hydroxy-4-methylproline, 4-hydroxyproline, 3-hydroxy-d-leucine, dehydrobutyrine, 5-hydroxyl β-amino octanoic acid, and O-carbamoyl-homoserine. We obtained an 8.6-Mb complete genome sequence from Nostoc sp. UHCC 0702 and identified the 93 kb heinamide biosynthetic gene cluster. The structurally distinct heinamides A1-A3 and B1-B5 variants are synthesized using an unusual branching biosynthetic pathway. The heinamide biosynthetic pathway also encodes several enzymes that supply non-proteinogenic amino acids to the heinamide synthetase. Through heterologous expression, we showed that (2S,4R)-4-hydroxy-l-proline is supplied through the action of a novel enzyme LxaN, which hydroxylates l-proline. 11- and 12-residue heinamides have the characteristic synergistic activity of laxaphycins against Aspergillus flavus FBCC 2467. Structural and genetic information of heinamides may prove useful in future discovery of natural products and drug development.	1
Title: Unraveling the B. pseudomallei Heptokinase WcbL: From Structure to Drug Discovery Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria utilize heptoses as part of their repertoire of extracellular polysaccharide virulence determinants. Disruption of heptose biosynthesis offers an attractive target for novel antimicrobials. A critical step in the synthesis of heptoses is their 1-O phosphorylation, mediated by kinases such as HldE or WcbL. Here, we present the structure of WcbL from Burkholderia pseudomallei. We report that WcbL operates through a sequential ordered Bi-Bi mechanism, loading the heptose first and then ATP. We show that dimeric WcbL binds ATP anti-cooperatively in the absence of heptose, and cooperatively in its presence. Modeling of WcbL suggests that heptose binding causes an elegant switch in the hydrogen-bonding network, facilitating the binding of a second ATP molecule. Finally, we screened a library of drug-like fragments, identifying hits that potently inhibit WcbL. Our results provide a novel mechanism for control of substrate binding and emphasize WcbL as an attractive anti-microbial target for Gram-negative bacteria.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the halogenated mycotoxin aspirochlorine in koji mold involves a cryptic amino acid conversion Abstract: Aspirochlorine (1) is an epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxin produced from koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae), which has been used in the oriental cuisine for over two millennia. Considering its potential risk for food safety, we have elucidated the molecular basis of aspirochlorine biosynthesis. By a combination of genetic and chemical analyses we found the acl gene locus and identified the key role of AclH as a chlorinase. Stable isotope labeling, biotransformation, and mutational experiments, analysis of intermediates and an in vitro adenylation domain assay gave totally unexpected insights into the acl pathway: Instead of one Phe and one Gly, two Phe units are assembled by an iterative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS, AclP), followed by halogenation and an unprecedented Phe to Gly amino acid conversion. Biological assays showed that both amino acid transformations are required to confer cytotoxicity and antifungal activity to the mycotoxin.	1
Title: Versatile Alkylation of (Hetero)Aryl Iodides with Ketones via β-C(sp3)-H Activation Abstract: We report Pd(II)-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-H (hetero)arylation of a variety of ketones using a commercially available 2,2-dimethyl aminooxyacetic acid auxiliary. Facile installation and removal of the auxiliary as well as its superior scope for both ketones and (hetero)aryl iodides overcome the significant limitations of the previously reported β-C(sp3)-H arylation of ketones. The ready availability of ketones renders this reaction a broadly useful method for alkyl-(hetero)aryl coupling involving both primary and secondary alkyls.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of steroidal antibiotic fusidanes: functional analysis of oxidosqualene cyclase and subsequent tailoring enzymes from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Three putative oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes exist in the genome of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that produces a steroidal antibiotic, helvolic acid. One of these genes, Afu4g14770, designated AfuOSC3, is clustered with genes of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), and acyltransferases, which presumably function in triterpene tailoring steps, suggesting that this gene cluster codes for helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuOSC3 was PCR amplified from A. fumigatus IFO8866 genomic DNA and expressed in yeast. The yeast transformant accumulated protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol, an established precursor for helvolic acid. Its structural isomer, (20R)-protosta-13(17),24-dien-3beta-ol, was also isolated from the transformed yeast. To further identify the function of triterpene tailoring enzymes, four P450 genes (CYP5081A1-D1) and a SDR gene (AfuSDR1) in the cluster were each coexpressed with AfuOSC3 in yeast. As a result, coexpression of AfuSDR1 gave a 3-keto derivative of protostadienol. On the other hand, coexpression with CYP5081A1 gave protosta-17(20)Z,24-diene-3beta,29-diol and protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol-29-oic acid. These metabolites are in well accord with the oxidative modification involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuSDR1 and CYP5081A1 presumably function together to catalyze demethylation of C-29 methyl group. These results provided a firm ground for identification of the present gene cluster to be involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of coral settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole in marine bacteria by a uniquely adapted brominase-thioesterase enzyme pair Abstract: Halogenated pyrroles (halopyrroles) are common chemical moieties found in bioactive bacterial natural products. The halopyrrole moieties of mono- and dihalopyrrole-containing compounds arise from a conserved mechanism in which a proline-derived pyrrolyl group bound to a carrier protein is first halogenated and then elaborated by peptidic or polyketide extensions. This paradigm is broken during the marine pseudoalteromonad bacterial biosynthesis of the coral larval settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole (1), which arises from the substitution of the proline-derived carboxylate by a bromine atom. To understand the molecular basis for decarboxylative bromination in the biosynthesis of 1, we sequenced two Pseudoalteromonas genomes and identified a conserved four-gene locus encoding the enzymes involved in its complete biosynthesis. Through total in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of 1 using purified enzymes and biochemical interrogation of individual biochemical steps, we show that all four bromine atoms in 1 are installed by the action of a single flavin-dependent halogenase: Bmp2. Tetrabromination of the pyrrole induces a thioesterase-mediated offloading reaction from the carrier protein and activates the biosynthetic intermediate for decarboxylation. Insights into the tetrabrominating activity of Bmp2 were obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of the halogenase contrasted against structurally homologous halogenase Mpy16 that forms only a dihalogenated pyrrole in marinopyrrole biosynthesis. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the proposed substrate-binding pocket of Bmp2 led to a reduction in the degree of halogenation catalyzed. Our study provides a biogenetic basis for the biosynthesis of 1 and sets a firm foundation for querying the biosynthetic potential for the production of 1 in marine (meta)genomes.	1
Title: The Identification and Conservation of Tunicaminyluracil-Related Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Several Rathayibacter Species Collected From Australia, Africa, Eurasia, and North America Abstract: Tunicaminyluracil antibiotics are a novel class of toxigenic glycolipids that are synthesized by several soil-associated Actinomycetes. The acquisition of a tunicaminyluracil biosynthetic gene cluster (TGC) in Rathayibacter toxicus has led to the emergence of the only described, naturally occurring tunicaminyluracil-associated mammalian disease, annual ryegrass toxicity of livestock. Endemic to Australia, R. toxicus is obligately vectored by Anguinid seed gall nematodes to the developing seedheads of forage grasses, in which the bacteria synthesize tunicaminyluracils that may subsequently be consumed by livestock and result in high rates of mortality and morbidity. The potential impact of R. toxicus on U.S. agriculture has led the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to list R. toxicus as a Plant Pathogen Select Agent. R. toxicus is the only characterized phytopathogenic bacterium to produce tunicaminyluracils, but numerous R. toxicus-like livestock poisonings outside Australia suggest additional bacterial sources of tunicaminyluracils may exist. To investigate the conservation of the TGC in R. toxicus and whether the TGC is present in other Rathayibacter species, we analyzed genome sequences of members of the Rathayibacter genus. Putative TGCs were identified in genome sequences of R. toxicus, R. iranicus, R. agropyri, and an undescribed South African Rathayibacter species. In the latter three species, the putative TGCs have homologs of tunicaminyluracil-related genes essential for toxin production, but the TGCs differ in gene number and order. The TGCs appear at least partially functional because in contrast to atoxigenic species, TGC-containing Rathayibacter species were each able to tolerate exogenous applications of tunicamycin from Streptomyces chartreusis. The North American R. agropyri TGC shows extensive diversity among the sequenced isolates, with presense/absense polymorphisms in multiple genes or even the whole TGC. R. agropyri TGC structure does not appear to correlate with date or location of isolate collection. The conservation and identification of tunicaminyluracil-related gene clusters in three additional Rathayibacter species isolated from South Africa, the Middle East, and the United States, suggests a wider global distribution of potentially neurotoxigenic plant-associated bacteria. This potential for additional endemic and exotic toxigenic Rathayibacter species could have widespread and severe implications for agriculture.	1
Title: Nonprescription Antimicrobial Use in a Primary Care Population in the United States Abstract: Community antimicrobial resistance rates are high in communities with frequent use of nonprescription antibiotics. Studies addressing nonprescription antibiotic use in the United States have been restricted to Latin American immigrants. We estimated the prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use in the previous 12 months as well as intended use (intention to use antibiotics without a prescription) and storage of antibiotics and examined patient characteristics associated with nonprescription use in a random sample of adults. We selected private and public primary care clinics that serve ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients. Within the clinics, we used race/ethnicity-stratified systematic random sampling to choose a random sample of primary care patients. We used a self-administered standardized questionnaire on antibiotic use. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of nonprescription use. The response rate was 94%. Of 400 respondents, 20 (5%) reported nonprescription use of systemic antibiotics in the last 12 months, 102 (25.4%) reported intended use, and 57 (14.2%) stored antibiotics at home. These rates were similar across race/ethnicity groups. Sources of antibiotics used without prescriptions or stored for future use were stores or pharmacies in the United States, "leftover" antibiotics from previous prescriptions, antibiotics obtained abroad, or antibiotics obtained from a relative or friend. Respiratory symptoms were common reasons for the use of nonprescription antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, public clinic patients, those with less education, and younger patients were more likely to endorse intended use. The problem of nonprescription use is not confined to Latino communities. Community antimicrobial stewardship must include a focus on nonprescription antibiotics.	0
Title: Phosphatidylinositol is crucial for the mechanosensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MscL Abstract: The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) directly senses and responds to membrane tension. It serves as an "emergency release valve" upon acute decreases in the osmotic environment, thus preventing cell lysis. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to its membrane environment. The MscL protein is highly conserved, found throughout the bacterial kingdom, and has been shown to encode a functional mechanosensitive channel in all species where it has been studied. However, channels from different species have shown some functional variance; an extreme example is the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MscL, which when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli requires significantly more membrane tension for gating than the endogenous E. coli MscL. We previously speculated that the membrane environment or factors not found in E. coli promoted the proper gating of the M. tuberculosis MscL channel in its native environment. Here, by reconstituting the M. tuberculosis and E. coli MscL channels in various lipids, we demonstrate that inclusion of phosphatidylinositol, a lipid found in M. tuberculosis but not E. coli, is sufficient for gating of the M. tuberculosis MscL channel within a physiological range of membrane tension.	0
Title: Utilization of the methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus for cloning of the tautomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus Abstract: Tautomycin (TTM), a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, consists of a polyketide chain containing a spiroketal moiety and an acyl chain bearing a dialkylmaleic anhydride structure. PCR using degenerate primers was used to clone genes from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus for formation of the methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein. This locus was found to contain five genes (ttmC, ttmA, ttmD, ttmB, and ttmE), one of which was used as a probe to clone the 110-kb TTM biosynthetic gene cluster. The involvement of the ttmA gene in TTM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and mutation complementation experiments.	1
Title: A look at neural integration in the human auditory system through the stapedius muscle reflex Abstract: Ipsilateral and contralateral stapedius muscle contractions were studied as functions of the sound pressure level (SPL) and duration of 2-kHz tone bursts. The study complemented a preceding study in which temporal summation of stapedius muscle contractions produced by pairs of short tone bursts was determined and analyzed. The muscle contractions were determined indirectly by measuring changes in the acoustic impedance they produced at the tympanic membrane. The data for the stapedius muscle contraction as a function of tone-burst duration were derived from another study and analyzed in part with the help of the SPL functions obtained in the present study. According to the experimental results, the stapedius muscle contraction produced by contralateral stimulation follows a compressive power function paralleling both the cochlear output and loudness functions. The ipsilateral contraction follows an expansive power function. Mathematical analysis showed that the muscle tension due to contralateral stimulation increases with tone duration approximately according to the characteristic of a linear integrator having an exponentially decaying memory with a time constant that increases with SPL from approximately 200 to 370 msec. The simple relationship appears to be possible because of mutual cancellation of neural-processing characteristics preceding and following the temporal integration.	0
Title: Characterizing amosamine biosynthesis in amicetin reveals AmiG as a reversible retaining glycosyltransferase Abstract: The antibacterial and antiviral agent amicetin is a disaccharide nucleoside antibiotic featuring a unique α-(1→4)-glycoside bond between amosamine and amicetose, characteristic of a retaining glycosylation. In this study, two key steps for amosamine biosynthesis were investigated: the N-methyltransferase AmiH was demonstrated to be requisite for the dimethylation in amosamine, and the glycosyltransferase AmiG was shown to be necessary for amosaminylation. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of AmiG revealed for the first time the catalytic reversibility of a retaining glycosyltransferase involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. AmiG displayed substrate flexibility by utilizing five additional sugar nucleotides as surrogate donors. AmiG was also amenable to sugar and aglycon exchange reactions. This study indicates that AmiG is a potential catalyst for diversifying nucleoside antibiotics and paves the way for mechanistic studies of a natural-product retaining glycosyltransferase.	1
Title: Characterization of the epoxide hydrolase NcsF2 from the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Neocarzinostatin (1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve a vicinal diol intermediate. It is reported that NcsF2, one of two epoxide hydrolases encoded by the NCS gene cluster, catalyzes regiospecific addition of H(2)O to C-2 of both (R)- and (S)-styrene oxides to afford (R)- and (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediols, respectively, supporting its proposed role in 1 biosynthesis. (R)-1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (87% yield and 99% ee) was obtained from (+/-)-styrene oxide hydrolysis by cocatalysis using NcsF2 and SgcF, the complementary epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Rational construction of genome-reduced Burkholderiales chassis facilitates efficient heterologous production of natural products from proteobacteria Abstract: Heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) avails yield improvements and mining of natural products, but it is limited by lacking of more efficient Gram-negative chassis. The proteobacterium Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 7029 exhibits potential for heterologous BGC expression, but its cells undergo early autolysis, hindering further applications. Herein, we rationally construct DC and DT series genome-reduced S. brevitalea mutants by sequential deletions of endogenous BGCs and the nonessential genomic regions, respectively. The DC5 to DC7 mutants affect growth, while the DT series mutants show improved growth characteristics with alleviated cell autolysis. The yield improvements of six proteobacterial natural products and successful identification of chitinimides from Chitinimonas koreensis via heterologous expression in DT mutants demonstrate their superiority to wild-type DSM 7029 and two commonly used Gram-negative chassis Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Our study expands the panel of Gram-negative chassis and facilitates the discovery of natural products by heterologous expression.	1
Title: Size series of small indium arsenide-zinc selenide core-shell nanocrystals and their application to in vivo imaging Abstract: We have developed a size series of unusually small, water-soluble (InAs)ZnSe (core)shell quantum dots (QDs) that emit in the near-infrared and exhibit new behavior in vivo, including multiple sequential lymph node mapping and extravasation from the vasculature. The biological utility of these fluorescent probes resulted from our intentional choice to match the semiconductor material and water-soluble ligand with a desired final hydrodynamic diameter and emission wavelength.	0
Title: The PKS4 gene of Fusarium graminearum is essential for zearalenone production Abstract: Zearalenones are produced by several Fusarium species and can cause reproductive problems in animals. Some aurofusarin mutants of Fusarium pseudograminearum produce elevated levels of zearalenone (ZON), one of the estrogenic mycotoxins comprising the zearalenones. An analysis of transcripts from polyketide synthase genes identified in the Fusarium graminearum database was carried out for these mutants. PKS4 was the only gene with an enoyl reductase domain that had a higher level of transcription in the aurofusarin mutants than in the wild type. An Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol was used to replace the central part of the PKS4 gene with a hygB resistance gene through double homologous recombination in an F. graminearum strain producing a high level of ZON. PCR and Southern analysis of transformants were used to identify isolates with single insertional replacements of PKS4. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the PKS4 replacement mutant did not produce ZON. Thus, PKS4 encodes an enzyme required for the production of ZON in F. graminearum. Barley root infection studies revealed no alteration in the pathogenicity of the PKS4 mutant compared to the pathogenicity of the wild type. The expression of PKS13, which is located in the same cluster as PKS4, decreased dramatically in the mutant, while transcription of PKS4 was unchanged. This differential expression may indicate that ZON or its derivatives do not regulate expression of PKS4 and that the PKS4-encoded protein or its product stimulates expression of PKS13. Furthermore, both the lack of aurofusarin and ZON influenced the expression of other polyketide synthases, demonstrating that one polyketide can influence the expression of others.	1
Title: Elucidation of the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by functional analysis of gene products expressed in Escherichia coli Abstract: The most important function of carotenoid pigments, especially beta-carotene in higher plants, is to protect organisms against photooxidative damage (G. Britton, in T. W. Goodwin, ed., Plant Pigments--1988, 1988; N. I. Krinsky, in O. Isler, H. Gutmann, and U. Solms, ed., Carotenoids--1971, 1971). beta-Carotene also functions as a precursor of vitamin A in mammals (G. A. J. Pitt, in I. Osler, H. Gutmann, and U. Solms, ed., Carotenoids--1971, 1971). The enzymes and genes which mediate the biosynthesis of cyclic carotenoids such as beta-carotene are virtually unknown. We have elucidated for the first time the pathway for biosynthesis of these carotenoids at the level of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, using bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis genes. These genes were cloned from a phytopathogenic bacterium, Erwinia uredovora 20D3 (ATCC 19321), in Escherichia coli and located on a 6,918-bp fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. Six open reading frames were found and designated the crtE, crtX, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtZ genes in reference to the carotenoid biosynthesis genes of a photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter capsulatus; only crtZ had the opposite orientation from the others. The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Erwinia uredovora was clarified by analyzing carotenoids accumulated in E. coli transformants in which some of these six genes were expressed, as follows: geranylgeranyl PPiCrtB----prephytoene PPiCrtE----phytoeneCrtI---- lycopeneCrtY----beta-caroteneCrtZ----zeaxanthinCrtX--- -zeaxanthin-beta- diglucoside. The carotenoids in this pathway appear to be close to those in higher plants rather than to those in bacteria. Also significant is that only one gene product (CrtI) for the conversion of phytoene to lycopene is required, a conversion in which four sequential desaturations should occur via the intermediates phytofluene, zeta-carotene, and neurosporene.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of mycobacteria isolated from seals Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) was diagnosed in 10 seals from three species (Arctocephalus australis, Arctocephalus tropicalis and Otaria flavescens) found in South America. The mycobacteria isolated from these cases belonged to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, as determined by RFLP using an IS6110 probe, spoligotyping, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and by PCR-restriction analysis of hsp65. Polymorphisms in gyrA, katG, oxyR and pncA were investigated in some of the isolates, as well as the presence of the MPB70 antigen. The insertion sequence IS6110 was present in three to seven copies in the genome of the mycobacteria isolated from seals. Using the IS6110 probe, six patterns (designated A, B, C, D, E and F) were identified from 10 different isolates. Patterns A and B were found for the mycobacteria isolated from two and four seals, respectively, indicating an epidemiological relationship between isolates grouped according to their IS6110 RFLP. The mycobacteria isolated from seals shared the majority of their IS6110 DNA-containing restriction fragments, and nine isolates had an identical spoligotype; only one isolate showed a minor difference in its spoligotype. In addition, none of these spoligotypes were found in other M. tuberculosis complex strains. These results suggest that the isolates from seals constitute a unique group of closely related strains. The mycobacteria isolated from seals showed polymorphisms at gyrA codon 95 and katG codon 463, as do group 1 M. tuberculosis, and M. bovis. Group 1 mycobacteria are associated with cluster cases. The spoligotypes found in the mycobacteria isolated from seals lack spacers 39-43, as does M. bovis, but the MPB70 antigen, which is highly expressed in M. bovis and minimally expressed in M. tuberculosis, was not detected in these mycobacteria. The mycobacteria isolated from seals also showed oxyR and pncA polymorphisms specific to M. tuberculosis. In conclusion, the mycobacteria that cause TB in seals in the South-Western Atlantic are a related group, and based on the combination of genetic characteristics, belong to a unique genotypic group within the M. tuberculosis complex.	0
Title: Rapid evaluation of the substrate specificity of 3-nitrobenzoic acid dioxygenase MnbAB via colorimetric detection using Saltzman reagent Abstract: Nitroaromatic compounds are essential materials for chemical industry, but they are also potentially toxic environmental pollutants. Therefore, their sensitive detection and degradation are important concerns. The microbial degradation pathways of nitroaromatic compounds have been studied in detail, but their usefulness needs to be evaluated to understand their potential applications in bioremediation. Here, we developed a rapid and relatively sensitive assay system to evaluate the activities and substrate specificities of nitroaromatic dioxygenases involved in the oxidative biodegradation of nitroaromatic compounds. In this system, nitrous acid, which was released from the nitroaromatic compounds by the dioxygenases, was detected and quantified using the Saltzman reagent. Escherichia coli producing the 3-nitrobenzoic acid dioxygenase complex MnbAB from Comamonas sp. JS46 clearly showed the apparent substrate specificity of MnbAB as follows. MnbAB accepted not only 3-nitrobenzoic acid but also several other p- and m-nitrobenzoic acid derivatives as substrates, although it much preferred 3-nitrobenzoic acid to others. Furthermore, the presence of a hydroxy or an amino group at the ortho position of the nitro group decreased the activity of MnbAB. In addition, MnbAB accepted 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetic acid as a substrate, which has one additional methylene group between the aromatic ring and the carboxy group of 3-nitrobenzoic acid. This is the first report about the detailed substrate specificity of MnbAB. Our system can be used for other nitroaromatic dioxygenases and contribute to their characterization.	0
Title: Structure of ribosome-bound azole-modified peptide phazolicin rationalizes its species-specific mode of bacterial translation inhibition Abstract: Ribosome-synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent a rapidly expanding class of natural products with various biological activities. Linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs) comprise a subclass of RiPPs that display outstanding diversity of mechanisms of action while sharing common structural features. Here, we report the discovery of a new LAP biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of Rhizobium Pop5, which encodes the precursor peptide and modification machinery of phazolicin (PHZ) - an extensively modified peptide exhibiting narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity against some symbiotic bacteria of leguminous plants. The cryo-EM structure of the Escherichia coli 70S-PHZ complex reveals that the drug interacts with the 23S rRNA and uL4/uL22 proteins and obstructs ribosomal exit tunnel in a way that is distinct from other compounds. We show that the uL4 loop sequence determines the species-specificity of antibiotic action. PHZ expands the known diversity of LAPs and may be used in the future as biocontrol agent for agricultural needs.	1
Title: Role of aminoglycoside 6'-acetyltransferase in a novel multiple aminoglycoside resistance of an actinomycete strain #8: inactivation of aminoglycosides with 6'-amino group except arbekacin and neomycin Abstract: From a rare actinomycete strain #8 isolated from soil as arbekacin (ABK) resistant, we cloned a gene segment (0.9 kb) conferring multiple resistance to aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics with 6'-NH2 including semisynthetic ones except ABK and neomycin (NM). Enzymatic modification using cell free extracts from Streptomyces lividans TK21/pANT-S2 carrying the cloned gene revealed that the gene coded for an AG 6'-acetyltransferase [AAC(6')] capable of acetylating all of the tested AGs with 6'-NH2 including semisynthetic ones and astromicin. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was thus similar to that of AAC(6')-Ie of Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic assay revealed a weak but clear antibiotic activity of 6'-N-acetylABK (8% of ABK activity) in contrast with substantial inactivation by the AAC(6') of the other AGs including amikacin and isepamicin. The NM acetylation by the AAC(6') also did not result in NM inactivation. It seems thus likely that AAC(6')-dependent resistance to ABK and NM, if it emerges, will remain at low level.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the dichloroacetyl component of chloramphenicol in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230: genes required for halogenation Abstract: Five ORFs were detected in a fragment from the Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 genomic DNA library by hybridization with a PCR product amplified from primers representing a consensus of known halogenase sequences. Sequencing and functional analyses demonstrated that ORFs 11 and 12 (but not ORFs 13-15) extended the partially characterized gene cluster for chloramphenicol (Cm) biosynthesis in the chromosome. Disruption of ORF11 (cmlK) or ORF12 (cmlS) and conjugal transfer of the insertionally inactivated genes to S. venezuelae gave mutant strains VS1111 and VS1112, each producing a similar series of Cm analogues in which unhalogenated acyl groups replaced the dichloroacetyl substituent of Cm. 1H-NMR established that the principal metabolite in the disrupted strains was the alpha-N-propionyl analogue. The sequence of CmlK implicated the protein in adenylation, and involvement in halogenation was inferred from biosynthesis of analogues by the cmlK-disrupted mutant. A role in generating the dichloroacetyl substituent was supported by partial restoration of Cm biosynthesis when a cloned copy of cmlK was introduced in trans into VS1111. Complementation of the mutant also indicated that inactivation of cmlK rather than a polar effect of the disruption on cmlS expression had interfered with dichloroacetyl biosynthesis. The deduced CmlS sequence resembled sequences of FADH2-dependent halogenases. Conjugal transfer of cmlK or cmlS into S. venezuelae cml-2, a chlorination-deficient strain with a mutation mapped genetically to the Cm biosynthesis gene cluster, did not complement the cml-2 lesion, suggesting that one or more genes in addition to cmlK and cmlS is needed to assemble the dichloroacetyl substituent. Insertional inactivation of ORF13 did not affect Cm production, and the products of ORF14 and ORF15 matched Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) proteins lacking plausible functions in Cm biosynthesis. Thus cmlS appears to mark the downstream end of the gene cluster.	1
Title: Robustness analysis of culturing perturbations on Escherichia coli colony biofilm beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotic tolerance Abstract: Background:                       Biofilms are ubiquitous. For instance, the majority of medical infections are thought to involve biofilms. However even after decades of investigation, the in vivo efficacy of many antimicrobial strategies is still debated suggesting there is a need for better understanding of biofilm antimicrobial tolerances. The current study's goal is to characterize the robustness of biofilm antibiotic tolerance to medically and industrially relevant culturing perturbations. By definition, robust systems will return similar, predictable responses when perturbed while non-robust systems will return very different and potentially unpredictable responses. The predictability of an antibiotic tolerance response is essential to developing, testing, and employing antimicrobial strategies.                  Results:                       The antibiotic tolerance of Escherichia coli colony biofilms was tested against beta-lactam and aminoglycoside class antibiotics. Control scenario tolerances were compared to tolerances under culturing perturbations including 1) different nutritional environments 2) different temperatures 3) interruption of cellular quorum sensing and 4) different biofilm culture ages. Here, antibiotic tolerance was defined in terms of culturable biofilm cells recovered after a twenty four hour antibiotic treatment.Colony biofilm antibiotic tolerances were not robust to perturbations. Altering basic culturing parameters like nutritional environment or temperature resulted in very different, non-intuitive antibiotic tolerance responses. Some minor perturbations like increasing the glucose concentration from 0.1 to 1 g/L caused a ten million fold difference in culturable cells over a twenty four hour antibiotic treatment.                  Conclusions:                       The current study presents a basis for robustness analysis of biofilm antibiotic tolerance. Biofilm antibiotic tolerance can vary in unpredictable manners based on modest changes in culturing conditions. Common antimicrobial testing methods, which only consider a single culturing condition, are not desirable since slight culturing variations can lead to very different outcomes. The presented data suggest it is essential to test antimicrobial strategies over a range of culturing perturbations relevant to the targeted application. In addition, the highly dynamic antibiotic tolerance responses observed here may explain why some current antimicrobial strategies occasionally fail.	0
Title: Controlling the DNA binding specificity of bHLH proteins through intramolecular interactions Abstract: Reversible control of the conformation of proteins was employed to probe the relationship between flexibility and specificity of the basic helix-loop-helix protein MyoD. A fusion protein (apaMyoD) was designed where the basic DNA binding helix of MyoD was stablized by an amino-terminal extension with a sequence derived from the bee venom peptide apamin. The disulfide-stabilized helix from apamin served as a nucleus for a helix that extended for a further ten residues, thereby holding apaMyoD's DNA recognition helix in a predominantly alpha-helical conformation. The thermal stability of the DNA complexes of apaMyoD was increased by 13 degrees C relative to MyoD-bHLH. Measurements of the fluorescence anisotropy change on DNA binding indicated that apaMyoD bound to E-box-containing DNA sequences with enhanced affinity relative to MyoD-bHLH. Consequently, the DNA binding specificity of apaMyoD was increased 10-fold.	0
Title: The type III secretion system is involved in the invasion and intracellular survival of Escherichia coli K1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells Abstract: Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) have been documented in many Gram-negative bacteria, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. We have previously shown the existence of a putative T3SS in meningitis-causing E. coli K1 strains, referred to as E. coli type III secretion 2 (ETT2). The sequence of ETT2 in meningitis-causing E. coli K1 strain EC10 (O7:K1) revealed that ETT2 comprises the epr, epa and eiv genes, but bears mutations, deletions and insertions. We constructed the EC10 mutants deleted of ETT2 or eivA gene, and their contributions to bacterial pathogenesis were evaluated in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). The deletion mutant of ETT2 exhibited defects in invasion and intracellular survival compared with the parental E. coli K1 strain EC10. The mutant deleted of eivA within ETT2 was also significantly defective in invasion and intracellular survival in HBMECs, and the defects of the eiv mutant were restored to the levels of the parent strain EC10 by transcomplementation. These findings suggest that ETT2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of E. coli K1 infection, including meningitis.	0
Title: Genetic diversity of three lgt loci for biosynthesis of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) in Neisseria species Abstract: Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a major virulence factor of the pathogenic Neisseria. Nine lgt genes at three chromosomal loci (lgt-1, 2, 3) encoding the glycosyltransferases responsible for the biosynthesis of LOS oligosaccharide chains were examined in 26 Neisseria meningitidis, 51 Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 18 commensal Neisseria strains. DNA hybridization, PCR and nucleotide sequence data were compared to previously reported lgt genes. Analysis of the genetic organization of the lgt loci revealed that in N. meningitidis, the lgt-1 and lgt-3 loci were hypervariable genomic regions, whereas the lgt-2 locus was conserved. In N. gonorrhoeae, no variability in the composition or organization of the three lgt loci was observed. lgt genes were detected only in some commensal Neisseria species. The genetic organization of the lgt-1 locus was classified into eight types and the lgt-3 locus was classified into four types. Two types of arrangement at lgt-1 (II and IV) and one type of arrangement at lgt-3 (IV) were novel genetic organizations reported in this study. Based on the three lgt loci, 10 LOS genotypes of N. meningitidis were distinguished. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a gene cluster, lgtH, which separated from the homologous genes lgtB and lgtE. The lgtH and lgtE genes were mutually exclusive and were located at the same position in lgt-1. The data demonstrated that pathogenic and commensal Neisseria share a common lgt gene pool and horizontal gene transfer appears to contribute to the genetic diversity of the lgt loci in Neisseria.	0
Title: Synthetic biotechnology to study and engineer ribosomal bottromycin biosynthesis Abstract: Bottromycins represent a promising class of antibiotics binding to the therapeutically unexploited A-site of the bacterial ribosome. By inhibiting translation they are active against clinically important pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Structurally, bottromycins are heavily modified peptides exhibiting various unusual biosynthetic features. To set the stage for compound modification and yield optimization, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster, used synthetic biotechnology approaches to establish and improve heterologous production, and generated analogs by pathway genetic engineering. We unambiguously identified three radical SAM methyltransferase-encoding genes required for various methylations at unactivated carbons yielding tert-butyl valine, methyl-proline, and β-methyl-phenylalanine residues, plus a gene involved in aspartate methyl-ester formation. Evidence for the formation of the exo-thiazole unit and for a macrocyclodehydration mechanism leading to amidine ring formation is provided.	1
Title: The papain inhibitor (SPI) of Streptomyces mobaraensis inhibits bacterial cysteine proteases and is an antagonist of bacterial growth Abstract: A novel papain inhibitory protein (SPI) from Streptomyces mobaraensis was studied to measure its inhibitory effect on bacterial cysteine protease activity (Staphylococcus aureus SspB) and culture supernatants (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacillus anthracis). Further, growth of Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae was completely inhibited by 10 μM SPI. At this concentration of SPI, no cytotoxicity was observed. We conclude that SPI inhibits bacterial virulence factors and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic treatment against a range of unrelated pathogenic bacteria.	0
Title: Production of new anthracycline antibiotics 1-hydroxy-oxaunomycin and 6-deoxyoxaunomycin by limited biosynthetic conversion using a daunorubicin-negative mutant Abstract: A limited biosynthetic conversion of some known anthracyclinones using a specific daunorubicin-nonproducing mutant provided four new anthracycline antibiotics: 1-Hydroxy-10-methoxycarbonyl-13-deoxocarminomycin; 1-hydroxy-13-deoxocarminomycin; 1-hydroxyoxaunomycin and 6-deoxyoxaunomycin. Their isolation and purification from bioconversion broth, structural determination and antitumor activities against leukemic L1210 cells are described.	0
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. IV. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-(2-substituted-vinylthio)-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2- (carboxymethoxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(carboxymethoxyimino)ace tamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted-vinylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephen nucleus was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats in comparison with cefixime. Of these, the cephalosporins (1a and 1c) with a lower alkoxycarbonylvinylthio group (Z-form) at the C-3 position showed a potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, improved activity against Staphylococcus aureus as well as good oral absorption in rats. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: A labeling study to elucidate the biosynthesis of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one (raspberry ketone) by Nidula niveo-tomentosa Abstract: Submerged cells of the basidiomycete Nidula niveo-tomentosa, a microbial producer of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one, were supplemented with (13)C-labeled L-phenylalanines and with [1-(13)C]glucose. Labeled transformation products were detected by a novel method of analyzing stable isotope-labeled metabolites, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to an atomic emission detector, and by GC-mass spectrometry. A benzoate moiety was side chain elongated according to the poly-beta-keto scheme. The presence of an acetyl coenzyme A-carboxylase inhibitor shifted the spectrum of products to benzyl compounds. Hence, the fungal pathway differs from the one established for plant tissues.	0
Title: Somatic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumour suppressor disruption enables versatile brain tumour modelling Abstract: In vivo functional investigation of oncogenes using somatic gene transfer has been successfully exploited to validate their role in tumorigenesis. For tumour suppressor genes this has proven more challenging due to technical aspects. To provide a flexible and effective method for investigating somatic loss-of-function alterations and their influence on tumorigenesis, we have established CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic gene disruption, allowing for in vivo targeting of TSGs. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by deleting single (Ptch1) or multiple genes (Trp53, Pten, Nf1) in the mouse brain, resulting in the development of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, respectively. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) we characterized the medulloblastoma-driving Ptch1 deletions in detail and show that no off-targets were detected in these tumours. This method provides a fast and convenient system for validating the emerging wealth of novel candidate tumour suppressor genes and the generation of faithful animal models of human cancer.	0
Title: Shear-stress-mediated refolding of proteins from aggregates and inclusion bodies Abstract: Recombinant protein overexpression of large proteins in bacteria often results in insoluble and misfolded proteins directed to inclusion bodies. We report the application of shear stress in micrometer-wide, thin fluid films to refold boiled hen egg white lysozyme, recombinant hen egg white lysozyme, and recombinant caveolin-1. Furthermore, the approach allowed refolding of a much larger protein, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The reported methods require only minutes, which is more than 100 times faster than conventional overnight dialysis. This rapid refolding technique could significantly shorten times, lower costs, and reduce waste streams associated with protein expression for a wide range of industrial and research applications.	0
Title: Fabclavines: bioactive peptide-polyketide-polyamino hybrids from Xenorhabdus Abstract: The structure of the fabclavines-unique mixtures of nonribosomally derived peptide-polyketide hybrids connected to an unusual polyamino moiety-has been solved by detailed NMR and MS methods. These compounds have been identified in two different entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus strains, thereby leading also to the identification of the fabclavine biosynthesis gene cluster. Detailed analysis of these clusters and initial mutagenesis experiments allowed the prediction of a biosynthesis pathway in which the polyamino moiety is derived from an unusual type of fatty acid synthase that is normally involved in formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As fabclavines show broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and other eukaryotic cells, they might act as "protection factors" against all kinds of food competitors during the complex life cycle of Xenorhabdus, its nematode host, and their insect prey.	1
Title: Genome Sequence of Streptomyces olindensis DAUFPE 5622, Producer of the Antitumoral Anthracycline Cosmomycin D Abstract: Streptomyces olindensis DAUFPE 5622, which was isolated from a Brazilian soil sample, produces the antitumor anthracycline cosmomycin D. The genome sequence is 9.4 Mb in length, with a G+C content of 71%. Thirty-four putative secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were identified, including the cosmomycin D cluster.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of highly reducing polyketide synthase involved in betaenone biosynthesis Abstract: A unique highly reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) with a reductase domain was identified in a betaenone biosynthetic gene cluster. Successful heterologous expression and characterization of the HR-PKS and trans-acting enoyl reductase (ER) provide insights into the core structure formation with a decalin scaffold and allow reconstitution of the betaenone biosynthetic machinery.	1
Title: Characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans monodictyphenone gene cluster Abstract: Deletion of cclA, a component of the COMPASS complex of Aspergillus nidulans, results in the production of monodictyphenone and emodin derivatives. Through a set of targeted deletions in a cclA deletion strain, we have identified the genes required for monodictyphenone and emodin analog biosynthesis. Identification of an intermediate, endocrocin, from an mdpHDelta strain suggests that mdpH might encode a decarboxylase. Furthermore, by replacing the promoter of mdpA (a putative aflJ homolog) and mdpE (a putative aflR homolog) with the inducible alcA promoter, we have confirmed that MdpA functions as a coactivator. We propose a biosynthetic pathway for monodictyphenone and emodin derivatives based on bioinformatic analysis and characterization of biosynthetic intermediates.	1
Title: Target-specific identification and characterization of the putative gene cluster for brasilinolide biosynthesis revealing the mechanistic insights and combinatorial synthetic utility of 2-deoxy-l-fucose biosynthetic enzymes Abstract: Brasilinolides exhibiting potent immunosuppressive and antifungal activities with remarkably low toxicity are structurally characterized by an unusual modified 2-deoxy-l-fucose (2dF) attached to a type I polyketide (PK-I) macrolactone. From the pathogenic producer Nocardia terpenica (Nocardia brasiliensis IFM-0406), a 210 kb genomic fragment was identified by target-specific degenerate primers and subsequently sequenced, revealing a giant nbr gene cluster harboring genes (nbrCDEF) required for TDP-2dF biosynthesis and those for PK-I biosynthesis, modification and regulation. The results showed that the genetic and domain arrangements of nbr PK-I synthases agreed colinearly with the PK-I structures of brasilinolides. Subsequent heterologous expression of nbrCDEF in Escherichia coli accomplished in vitro reconstitution of TDP-2dF biosynthesis. The catalytic functions and mechanisms of NbrCDEF enzymes were further characterized by systematic mix-and-match experiments. The enzymes were revealed to display remarkable substrate and partner promiscuity, leading to the establishment of in vitro hybrid deoxysugar biosynthetic pathways throughout an in situ one-pot (iSOP) method. This study represents the first demonstration of TDP-2dF biosynthesis at the enzyme and molecular levels, and provides new hope for expanding the structural diversity of brasilinolides by combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Structure elucidation and biosynthesis of fuscachelins, peptide siderophores from the moderate thermophile Thermobifida fusca Abstract: Bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales have proven to be an important source of biologically active and often therapeutically useful natural products. The characterization of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters is an emerging and valuable approach to the discovery of novel small molecules. Analysis of the recently sequenced genome of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermobifida fusca revealed an orphan nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster coding for an unknown siderophore natural product. T. fusca is a model organism for the study of thermostable cellulases and is a major degrader of plant cell walls. Here, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of the fuscachelins, siderophore natural products produced by T. fusca. In addition, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of the termination module of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Biochemical analysis of adenylation domain specificity supports the assignment of this gene cluster as the producer of the fuscachelin siderophores. The proposed nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathway exhibits several atypical features, including a macrocyclizing thioesterase that produces a 10-membered cyclic depsipeptide and a nonlinear assembly line, resulting in the unique heterodimeric architecture of the siderophore natural product.	1
Title: Two-state models of protein folding kinetics Abstract: The folding of some proteins appears to be a two-state kinetic process. A two-state kinetic model is justified if protein molecules rapidly equilibrate between different unfolded conformations prior to complete folding. Here I show that this rapid equilibration is a natural consequence of reasonable assumptions about reaction rate constants and folding thermodynamics.	0
Title: Cell-permeant and photocleavable chemical inducer of dimerization Abstract: Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) have been developed to orchestrate protein dimerization and translocation. Here we present a novel photocleavable HaloTag- and SNAP-tag-reactive CID (MeNV-HaXS) with excellent selectivity and intracellular reactivity. Excitation at 360 nm cleaves the methyl-6-nitroveratryl core of MeNV-HaXS. MeNV-HaXS covalently links HaloTag- and SNAP-tag fusion proteins, and enables targeting of selected membranes and intracellular organelles. MeNV-HaXS-mediated translocation has been validated for plasma membrane, late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi, mitochondria, and the actin cytoskeleton. Photocleavage of MeNV-HaXS liberates target proteins and provides access to optical manipulation of protein relocation with high spatiotemporal and subcellular precision. MeNV-HaXS supports kinetic studies of protein dynamics and the manipulation of subcellular enzyme activities, which is exemplified for Golgi-targeted cargo and the assessment of nuclear import kinetics.	0
Title: Obligatory role in GTP hydrolysis for the amide carbonyl oxygen of the Mg(2+)-coordinating Thr of regulatory GTPases Abstract: When G-protein alpha subunits binds GTP and Mg(2+), they transition from their inactive to their active conformation. This transition is accompanied by completion of the coordination shell of Mg(2+) with electrons from six oxygens: two water molecules, the ss and gamma phosphoryls of GTP, a helix-alpha1 Ser, and a switch I domain (SWI) Thr, and the repositioning of SWI and SWII domains. SWII binds and regulates effector enzymes and facilitates GTP hydrolysis by repositioning the gamma-carbonyl of a Gln. Mutating the Ser generates regulatory GTPases that cannot lock Mg(2+) into its place and are locked in their inactive state with dominant negative properties. Curiously, mutating the Thr appears to reduce GTP hydrolysis. The reason for this difference is not known because it is also not known why removal of the Thr should affect the overall GTPase cycle differently than removal of the Ser. Working with recombinant Gsalpha, we report that mutating its SWI-Thr to either Ala, Glu, Gln, or Asp results not only in diminished GTPase activity but also in spontaneous activation of the SWII domain. Upon close examination of existing alpha subunit crystals, we noted the oxygen of the backbone carbonyl of SWI-Thr and of the gamma-carbonyl of SWII Gln to be roughly equidistant from the oxygen of the hydrolytic H(2)O. Our observations indicate that the Gln and Thr carbonyls play equihierarchical roles in the GTPase process and provide the mechanism that explains why mutating the Thr mimics mutating the Gln and not that of the Ser.	0
Title: Cryptosporidium parvum appears to lack a plastid genome Abstract: Surprisingly, unlike most Apicomplexa, Cryptosporidium parvum appears to lack a plastid genome. Primers based upon the highly conserved plastid small- or large-subunit rRNA (SSU/LSU rRNA) and the tufA-tRNAPhe genes of other members of the phylum Apicomplexa failed to amplify products from intracellular stages of C. parvum, whereas products were obtained from the plastid-containing apicomplexans Eimeria bovis and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as the plants Allium stellatum and Spinacia oleracea. Dot-blot hybridization of sporozoite genomic DNA (gDNA) supported these PCR results. A T. gondii plastid-specific set of probes containing SSU/LSU rRNA and tufA-tRNA(Phe) genes strongly hybridized to gDNA from a diverse group of plastid-containing organisms including three Apicomplexa, two plants, and Euglena gracilis, but not to those without this organelle including C. parvum, three kinetoplastids, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammals and the eubacterium Escherichia coli. Since the origin of the plastid in other apicomplexans is postulated to be the result of a secondary symbiogenesis of either a red or a green alga, the most parsimonious explanation for its absence in C. parvum is that it has been secondarily lost. If confirmed, this would indicate an alternative evolutionary fate for this organelle in one member of the Apicomplexa. It also suggests that unlike the situation with other diseases caused by members of the Apicomplexa, drug development against cryptosporidiosis targeting a plastid genome or metabolic pathways associated with it may not be useful.	0
Title: The genetic and molecular basis for sunscreen biosynthesis in cyanobacteria Abstract: Ultraviolet UV-A and UV-B radiation is harmful to living systems, causing damage to biological macromolecules. An important strategy for dealing with UV exposure is the biosynthesis of small-molecule sunscreens. Among such metabolites, the mycosporine and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are remarkable for their wide phylogenetic distribution and their unique chemical structures. Here, we report the identification of a MAA biosynthetic gene cluster in a cyanobacterium and the discovery of analogous pathways in other sequenced organisms. We have expressed the cluster in a heterologous bacterial host and characterized all four biosynthetic enzymes in vitro. In addition to clarifying the origin of the MAAs, these efforts have revealed two unprecedented enzymatic strategies for imine formation.	1
Title: In vivo emergence of multidrug-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa overexpressing the active efflux system MexA-MexB-OprM Abstract: During a 6-month period, 21 pairs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates susceptible (pretherapy) and resistant (posttherapy) to antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics were isolated from hospitalized patients. In vivo emergence of beta-lactam resistance was associated with the overexpression of AmpC beta-lactamase in 10 patients. In the other 11 patients, the posttherapy isolates produced only low, basal levels of beta-lactamase and had increased levels of resistance to a variety of non-beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., quinolones, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) compared with the levels of beta-lactamase production and resistance of their pretherapy counterparts. These data suggested the involvement of the MexA-MexB-OprM active efflux system in the multidrug resistance phenotype of the posttherapy strains. Immunoblotting of the outer membrane proteins of these 11 bacterial pairs with a specific polyclonal antibody raised against OprM demonstrated the overexpression of OprM in all the posttherapy isolates. To determine whether mutations in mexR, the regulator gene of the mexA-mexB-oprM efflux operon, could account for the overproduction of the efflux system, sequencing experiments were carried out with the 11 bacterial pairs. Eight posttherapy isolates were found to contain insertions or deletions that led to frameshifts in the coding sequences of mexR. Two resistant strains had point mutations in mexR that yielded single amino acid changes in the protein MexR, while another strain did not show any mutation in mexR or in the promoter region upstream of mexR. Introduction of a plasmid-encoded wild-type mexR gene into five posttherapy isolates partially restored the susceptibility of the bacteria to selected antibiotics. These results indicate that in the course of antimicrobial therapy multidrug-resistant active efflux mutants overexpressing the MexA-MexB-OprM system may emerge as a result of mutations in the mexR gene.	0
Title: Biological Properties of Low-Toxic PLGA and PLGA/PHB Fibrous Nanocomposite Scaffolds for Osseous Tissue Regeneration. Evaluation of Potential Bioactivity Abstract: Abstracts: The aim of the study was to evaluate the biocompatibility and bioactivity of two new prototype implants for bone tissue regeneration made from biodegradable fibrous materials. The first is a newly developed poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide), (PLGA), and the second is a blend of PLGA with synthetic poly([R,S]-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PLGA/PHB). The implant prototypes comprise PLGA or PLGA/PHB nonwoven fabrics with designed pore structures to create the best conditions for cell proliferation. The bioactivity of the proposed implants was enhanced by introducing a hydroxyapatite material and a biologically active agent, namely, growth factor IGF1, encapsulated in calcium alginate microspheres. To assess the biocompatibility and bioactivity, allergenic tests and an assessment of the local reaction of bone tissue after implantation were performed. Comparative studies of local tissue response after implantation into trochanters for a period of 12 months were performed on New Zealand rabbits. Based on the results of the in vivo evaluation of the allergenic effects and the local tissue reaction 12 months after implantation, it was concluded that the two implant prototypes, PLGA + IGF1 and PLGA/PHB + IGF1, were characterized by high biocompatibility with the soft and bone tissues of the tested animals.	0
Title: Chemical probes identify a role for histone deacetylase 3 in Friedreich's ataxia gene silencing Abstract: We recently identified a class of pimelic diphenylamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that show promise as therapeutics in the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and Huntington's disease. Here, we describe chemical approaches to identify the HDAC enzyme target of these inhibitors. Incubation of a trifunctional activity-based probe with a panel of class I and class II recombinant HDAC enzymes, followed by click chemistry addition of a fluorescent dye and gel electrophoresis, identifies HDAC3 as a unique high-affinity target of the probe. Photoaffinity labeling in a nuclear extract prepared from human lymphoblasts with the trifunctional probe, followed by biotin addition through click chemistry, streptavidin enrichment, and Western blotting also identifies HDAC3 as the preferred cellular target of the inhibitor. Additional inhibitors with different HDAC specificity profiles were synthesized, and results from transcription experiments in FRDA cells point to a unique role for HDAC3 in gene silencing in Friedreich's ataxia.	0
Title: Probing the compatibility of type II ketosynthase-carrier protein partners Abstract: Drug discovery often begins with the screening of large compound libraries to identify lead compounds. Recently, the enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of natural products have been investigated for their potential to generate new, diverse compound libraries. There have been several approaches toward this end, including altering the substrate specificities of the enzymes involved in natural product biosynthesis and engineering functional communication between enzymes from different biosynthetic pathways. While there exist assays to assess the substrate specificity of enzymes involved in these pathways, there is no simple method for determining whether enzymes from different synthases will function cooperatively to generate the desired product(s). Herein we report a method that provides insight into both substrate specificity and compatibility of protein-protein interactions between the acyl carrier protein (ACP) and ketosynthase (KS) domains involved in fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. Our technique uses a one-pot chemoenzymatic method to generate post-translationally modified ACPs that are capable of covalently interacting with KS domains from different biosynthetic systems. The extent of interaction between ACPs and KSs from different systems is easily detected and quantified by a gel-based method. Our results are consistent with previous studies of substrate specificity and ACP-KS binding interactions and provide new insight into unnatural substrate and protein interactions.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the lysobactin biosynthetic gene cluster reveals mechanistic insights into an unusual termination module architecture Abstract: Lysobactin (katanosin B) is a macrocyclic depsipeptide, displaying high antibacterial activity against human pathogens. In this work, we have identified and characterized the entire biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for lysobactin assembly. Sequential analysis of the Lysobacter sp. ATCC 53042 genome revealed the lysobactin gene cluster to encode two multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases. As the number of modules found within the synthetases LybA and LybB directly correlates with the primary sequence of lysobactin, a linear logic of lysobactin biosynthesis is proposed. Investigation of adenylation domain specificities in vitro confirmed the direct association between the synthetases and lysobactin biosynthesis. Furthermore, an unusual tandem thioesterase architecture of the LybB termination module was identified. Biochemical characterization of the individual thioesterases in vitro provides evidence that solely penultimate thioesterase domain mediates the cyclization and simultaneous release of lysobactin.	1
Title: Hydrogen Sulfide Donors Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) exhibits promising protective effects in many (patho)physiological processes, as evidenced by recent reports using synthetic H2 S donors in different biological models. Herein, we report the design and evaluation of compounds denoted PeroxyTCM, which are the first class of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered H2 S donors. These donors are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) upon activation, which is quickly hydrolyzed to H2 S by the ubiquitous enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The donors are stable in aqueous solution and do not release H2 S until triggered by ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), superoxide (O2- ), and peroxynitrite (ONOO- ). We demonstrate ROS-triggered H2 S donation in live cells and also demonstrate that PeroxyTCM-1 provides protection against H2 O2 -induced oxidative damage, suggesting potential future applications of PeroxyTCM and similar scaffolds in H2 S-related therapies.	0
Title: Positive reinforcement for viruses Abstract: Virus-cell membrane fusion requires a critical transition from positive to negative membrane curvature. St. Vincent et al.

Title: The codon usage of the nisZ operon in Lactococcus lactis N8 suggests a non-lactococcal origin of the conjugative nisin-sucrose transposon Abstract: An 11.6 kb area downstream from the structural gene of nisin Z in the conjugative nisin-sucrose transposon of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis N8 was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed eight open reading frames, nisZBTClPRK, followed by a putative rho-independent terminator (delta G degrees = -4.7 kcal/mol). The C-terminal hydrophilic domain of the NisK protein is homologous to the C-termini of several histidine kinases of bacterial two-component regulator systems, such as SpaK from Bacillus subtilis and KdpD and RcsC of Escherichia coli. The nisin Z biosynthetic genes were highly similar with the genes of the nisin A operons having, however, a 0-3% difference in the amino acid sequences of the individual proteins. The codon usage of eleven genes within the same conjugative transposon was calculated and found to be strikingly different from that of other lactococcal genes. This, together with the low GC-content (32%) compared to the 38% (G+C) of the lactococcal chromosome in general strongly suggests a non-lactococcal origin of this transposon.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the niddamycin polyketide synthase genes from Streptomyces caelestis Abstract: The genes encoding the polyketide synthase (PKS) portion of the niddamycin biosynthetic pathway were isolated from a library of Streptomyces caelestis NRRL-2821 chromosomal DNA. Analysis of 40 kb of DNA revealed the presence of five large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the seven modular sets of enzymatic activities required for the synthesis of a 16-membered lactone ring. The enzymatic motifs identified within each module were consistent with those predicted from the structure of niddamycin. Disruption of the second ORF of the PKS coding region eliminated niddamycin production, demonstrating that the cloned genes are involved in the biosynthesis of this compound.	1
Title: 3-substituted indazoles as configurationally locked 4EGI-1 mimetics and inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction Abstract: 4EGI-1, the prototypic inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, was identified in a high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries with the aid of a fluorescence polarization assay that measures inhibition of binding of an eIF4G-derived peptide to recombinant eIF4E. As such, the molecular probe 4EGI-1 has potential for the study of molecular mechanisms involved in human disorders characterized by loss of physiological restraints on translation initiation. A hit-to-lead optimization campaign was carried out to overcome the configurational instability in 4EGI-1, which stems from the E-to-Z isomerization of the hydrazone function. We identified compound 1 a, in which the labile hydrazone was incorporated into a rigid indazole scaffold, as a promising rigidified 4EGI-1 mimetic lead. In a structure-activity relationship study directed towards probing the structural latitude of this new chemotype as an inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and translation initiation we identified 1 d, an indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic, as a new and improved lead inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and a promising molecular probe candidate for elucidation of the role of cap-dependent translation initiation in a host of pathophysiological states.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the anti-infective marformycins featuring pre-NRPS assembly line N-formylation and O-methylation and post-assembly line C-hydroxylation chemistries Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster governing production of anti-infective marformycins was identified from deep sea-derived Streptomyces drozdowiczii SCSIO 10141. The putative mfn gene cluster (45 kb, 20 orfs) was found to encode six NRPSs and related proteins for cyclodepsipeptide core construction (mfnCDEFKL), a methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (mfnA), a SAM-dependent methyltransferase (mfnG), and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for piperazic acid moiety hydroxylation (mfnN); notably, only MfnN uses an intact cyclodepsipeptide intermediate as its substrate.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase gene, ACRTS2, is responsible for biosynthesis of host-selective ACR-toxin in the rough lemon pathotype of Alternaria alternata Abstract: The rough lemon pathotype of Alternaria alternata produces host-selective ACR-toxin and causes Alternaria leaf spot disease of rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri). The structure of ACR-toxin I (MW = 496) consists of a polyketide with an α-dihydropyrone ring in a 19-carbon polyalcohol. Genes responsible for toxin production were localized to a 1.5-Mb chromosome in the genome of the rough lemon pathotype. Sequence analysis of this chromosome revealed an 8,338-bp open reading frame, ACRTS2, that was present only in the genomes of ACR-toxin-producing isolates. ACRTS2 is predicted to encode a putative polyketide synthase of 2,513 amino acids and belongs to the fungal reducing type I polyketide synthases. Typical polyketide functional domains were identified in the predicted amino acid sequence, including β-ketoacyl synthase, acyl transferase, methyl transferase, dehydratase, β-ketoreductase, and phosphopantetheine attachment site domains. Combined use of homologous recombination-mediated gene disruption and RNA silencing allowed examination of the functional role of multiple paralogs in ACR-toxin production. ACRTS2 was found to be essential for ACR-toxin production and pathogenicity of the rough lemon pathotype of A. alternata.	1
Title: Seasonal Dynamics of Bacterial Colonization of Cotton Fiber and Effects of Moisture on Growth of Bacteria within the Cotton Boll Abstract: A highly replicated 3-year field study was conducted to determine the seasonal patterns of bacterial colonization of cotton fiber from the time of dehiscence of the bolls (the point at which the bolls just begin to open) through harvest and commercial ginning. Bacterial numbers on fiber samples from 16 plots were determined by dilution pour plating with tryptic soy agar containing cycloheximide, and numbers of gram-negative bacteria were determined by plating on tryptic soy agar containing vancomycin and cycloheximide. Populations of bacteria varied from year to year, but in all three seasons the pattern of colonization was generally a pattern consisting of a rapid increase following opening of the bolls and a more or less stable number thereafter throughout the growing season. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50% or more of the recoverable bacterial population. We hypothesized that the luxuriant bacterial flora developed as a result of the availability of sufficient free water in the bolls to allow bacterial proliferation with the carbon sources remaining after fiber maturation. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the threshold moisture level allowing growth of bacteria on fiber in the bolls. Bacterial proliferation occurred when as little as 2% moisture was added to air-dried fiber. Using simulated bolls, we demonstrated bacterial growth resulting from dew formation on fiber held in controlled-humidity chambers.	0
Title: Functionality and prevalence of trehalose-based oligosaccharides as novel compatible solutes in ascospores of Neosartorya fischeri (Aspergillus fischeri) and other fungi Abstract: Ascospores of Neosartorya, Byssochlamys and Talaromyces can be regarded as the most stress-resistant eukaryotic cells. They can survive exposure at temperatures as high as 85°C for 100 min or more. Neosartorya fischeri ascospores are more viscous and more resistant to the combined stress of heat and desiccation than the ascospores of Talaromyces macrosporus which contain predominantly trehalose. These ascospores contain trehalose-based oligosaccharides (TOS) that are novel compatible solutes, which are accumulated to high levels. These compounds are also found in other members of the genus Neosartorya and in some other genera within the order Eurotiales that also include Byssochlamys and Talaromyces. The presence of oligosaccharides was observed in species that had a relatively high growth temperature. TOS glasses have a higher glass transition temperature (Tg ) than trehalose, and they form a stable glass with crystallizing molecules, such as mannitol. Our data indicate that TOS are important for prolonged stabilization of cells against stress. The possible unique role of these solutes in protection against dry heat conditions is discussed.	0
Title: X-ray structures of the three Lactococcus lactis dihydroxyacetone kinase subunits and of a transient intersubunit complex Abstract: Bacterial dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinases do not exchange the ADP for ATP but utilize a subunit of the phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system for in situ rephosphorylation of a permanently bound ADP-cofactor. Here we report the 2.1-angstroms crystal structure of the transient complex between the phosphotransferase subunit DhaM of the phosphotransferase system and the nucleotide binding subunit DhaL of the Dha kinase of Lactococcus lactis, the 1.1-angstroms structure of the free DhaM dimer, and the 2.5-angstroms structure of the Dha-binding DhaK subunit. Conserved salt bridges and an edge-to-plane stacking contact between two tyrosines serve to orient DhaL relative to the DhaM dimer. The distance between the imidazole Nepsilon2 of the DhaM His-10 and the beta-phosphate oxygen of ADP, between which the gamma-phosphate is transferred, is 4.9 angstroms. An invariant arginine, which is essential for activity, is appropriately positioned to stabilize the gamma-phosphate in the transition state. The (betaalpha)4alpha fold of DhaM occurs a second time as a subfold in the DhaK subunit. By docking DhaL-ADP to this subfold, the nucleotide bound to DhaL and the C1-hydroxyl of Dha bound to DhaK are positioned for in-line transfer of phosphate.	0
Title: SnPKS19 Encodes the Polyketide Synthase for Alternariol Mycotoxin Biosynthesis in the Wheat Pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: Alternariol (AOH) is an important mycotoxin from the Alternaria fungi. AOH was detected for the first time in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum in a recent study. Here, we exploited reverse genetics to demonstrate that SNOG_15829 (SnPKS19), a close homolog of Penicillium aethiopicum norlichexanthone (NLX) synthase gene gsfA, is required for AOH production. We further validate that SnPKS19 is solely responsible for AOH production by heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. The expression profile of SnPKS19 based on previous P. nodorum microarray data correlated with the presence of AOH in vitro and its absence in planta. Subsequent characterization of the ΔSnPKS19 mutants showed that SnPKS19 and AOH are not involved in virulence and oxidative stress tolerance. Identification and characterization of the P. nodorum SnPKS19 cast light on a possible alternative AOH synthase gene in Alternaria alternata and allowed us to survey the distribution of AOH synthase genes in other fungal genomes. We further demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis could be used to differentiate between AOH synthases and the closely related NLX synthases. This study provides the basis for studying the genetic regulation of AOH production and for development of molecular diagnostic methods for detecting AOH-producing fungi in the future.	1
Title: Discrimination of enantiomers of amides with two stereogenic centers enabled by chiral bisthiourea derivatives using 1H NMR spectroscopy Abstract: Enantiomers of a few new amides containing two stereogenic centers have been derived from d- and l-α-amino acids as guests for chiral recognition by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A variety of chiral amides with two or more stereogenic centers often exist in the products of catalytic asymmetric synthesis, natural products or their total synthetic products, and chiral drugs. It would be a challenging and meaningful work to explore their chiral recognition. For this purpose, a class of novel chiral bisthiourea derivatives 1-9 has been synthesized from (1S,2S)-(+)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, d-α-amino acids, and isothiocyanates as chiral solvating agents (CSAs). CSAs 1-9 proved to afford better chiral discriminating results towards most amides with two stereogenic centers, which have been rarely studied as chiral substrates by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In particular, CSAs 7, 8 and 9, featuring 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene residues, exhibit outstanding chiral discriminating capabilities towards all amides, providing well-separated 1H NMR signals and sufficiently large nonequivalent chemical shifts. To test their practical application in the determination of enantiomeric excess, 1H NMR spectra of chiral amides (G16) with different optical purities were measured in the presence of CSAs 7 and 8, respectively. Their ee values (up to 90%) were accurately calculated by the integration of the NH proton of the CONHPh group of G16. To better understand the chiral discriminating behavior, Job plots of (±)-G16 with CSA 7 and (±)-G17 with CSA 8 and the association constants (Ka) of (S,R)-G16 and (R,S)-G16 with CSA 7 were evaluated, respectively. In order to further reveal any underlying intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, theoretical calculations of the enantiomers of (S,R)-G16 and (R,S)-G16 with CSA 7 were performed by means of the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) with the standard basis sets of 3-21G of the Gaussian 03 program, respectively.	0
Title: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acid D Abstract: A convergent total synthesis of the architecturally complex indole diterpenoid (-)-nodulisporic acid D has been achieved. Key synthetic transformations include vicinal difunctionalization of an advanced α,β-unsaturated aldehyde to form the E,F-trans-fused 5,6-ring system of the eastern hemisphere and a cascade cross-coupling/indolization protocol leading to the CDE multisubstituted indole core.	0
Title: Sterics and Hydrogen Bonding Control Stereochemistry and Self-Sorting in BINOL-Based Assemblies Abstract: Here we demonstrate how the hydrogen-bonding ability of a BINOL-based dialdehyde subcomponent dictated the stereochemical outcome of its subsequent self-assembly into one diastereomeric helicate form when bearing free hydroxy groups, and another in the case of its methylated congener. The presence of methyl groups also altered the self-sorting behavior when mixed with another, short linear dialdehyde subcomponent, switching the outcome of the system from narcissistic to integrative self-sorting. In all cases, the axial chirality of the BINOL building block also dictated helicate metal center handedness during stereospecific self-assembly. A new family of stereochemically pure heteroleptic helicates were thus prepared using the new knowledge gained. We also found that switching from FeII to ZnII, or the incorporation of a longer linear ligand, favored heteroleptic structure formation.	0
Title: Isolation and partial characterization of the Streptococcus mutans type AII lantibiotic mutacin K8 Abstract: Streptococcus mutans strain K8 was shown to produce a newly identified type AII lantibiotic, mutacin K8. The mutacin K8-encoding muk locus consists of 13 ORFs, three of which (mukA1, A2 and A3) have close homology to scnA, the structural gene encoding the Streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic SA-FF22, and another (mukA') resembles scnA', an ORF in the SA-FF22 locus that has no currently assigned function. Inactivation of the muk locus indicated that mutacin K8 is responsible for most of the inhibitory activity produced by strain K8 in deferred antagonism tests on Columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5 % human blood and 0.1 % CaCO(3). By contrast, on tryptic soy agar plus 2 % yeast extract and 0.5 % CaCO(3) most of the inhibitory activity of strain K8 appeared to be attributable either to mutacin IV or to some other inhibitory peptide(s) exported by the mutacin IV transporter nlmT. An inhibitory peptide purified from a derivative of strain K8 in which nlmT had been inactivated had a mass of 2734 Da and an N-terminal sequence identical to the predicted propeptide translation products of mukA1 and mukA3. The muk locus may be widely distributed in S. mutans, since 9 (35 %) of 26 strains tested contained at least part of the locus. In the genome sequence of strain UA159 the muk locus is incomplete, the sole residual components being the ORFs encoding the putative two-component regulatory system mukR (SMU.1815) and mukK (SMU.1814), followed by two transposases (SMU.1813 and SMU.1812) and then the ORFs mukF (SMU.1811), mukE (SMU.1810) and mukG (SMU.1809), thought to encode putative immunity peptides. Strains such as UA159 having incomplete loci did not produce detectable levels of mutacin K8.	1
Title: Kojic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus oryzae is regulated by a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) transcriptional activator and induced by kojic acid at the transcriptional level Abstract: A gene encoding the Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) transcriptional factor is clustered with two genes involved in biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite, kojic acid (KA), in Aspergillus oryzae. We determined that the gene was essential for KA production and the transcriptional activation of KA biosynthetic genes, which were triggered by the addition of KA.	1
Title: Deciphering the biosynthetic origin of the aglycone of the aureolic acid group of anti-tumor agents Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin, chromomycin, and olivomycin belong to the aureolic acid family of clinically important anti-tumor agents. These natural products share a common aromatic aglycone. Although isotope labeling studies have firmly established the polyketide origin of this aglycone, they do not distinguish between alternative biosynthetic models in which the aglycone is derived from one, two or three distinct polyketide moieties. We set out to determine the biosynthetic origin of this moiety using a recombinant approach in which the ketosynthase and chain-length factor proteins from the antibiotic-producer strain, which determine the chain length of a polyketide, are produced in a heterologous bacterial host.                  Results:                       The ketosynthase and chain-length factor genes from the polyketide synthase gene cluster from the mithramycin producer, Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, and the acyl carrier protein and ketoreductase genes from the actinorhodin polyketide synthase were expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999. The recombinant strain produced a 20-carbon polyketide, comprising the complete backbone of the aglycone of mithramycin.                  Conclusions:                       The aglycone moieties of mithramycin, chromomycin, and olivomycin are derived from a single polyketide backbone. The nascent polyketide backbone must undergo a series of regiospecific cyclizations to form a tetracenomycin-like tetracyclic intermediate. The final steps in the aglycone biosynthetic pathway presumably involve decarboxylation and oxidative cleavage between C-18 and C-19, followed by additional oxidation, reduction, and methylation reactions.	1
Title: Relationships of the Escherichia coli O157, O111, and O55 O-antigen gene clusters with those of Salmonella enterica and Citrobacter freundii, which express identical O antigens Abstract: Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella enterica O30, and Citrobacter freundii F90 have identical O-antigen structures, as do E. coli O55 and S. enterica O50. The O-antigen gene cluster sequences for E. coli O157 and E. coli O55 have been published, and the genes necessary for O-antigen biosynthesis have been identified, although transferase genes for glycosidic linkages are only generic and have not been allocated to specific linkages. We determined sequences for S. enterica O30 and C. freundii F90 O-antigen gene clusters and compared them to the sequence of the previously described E. coli O157 cluster. We also determined the sequence of the S. enterica O50 O-antigen gene cluster and compared it to the sequence of the previously described E. coli O55 cluster. For both the S. enterica O30-C. freundii F90-E. coli O157 group and the S. enterica O50-E. coli O55 group of O antigens, the gene clusters have identical or nearly identical organizations. The two sets of gene clusters had comparable overall levels of similarity in their genes, which were lower than the levels determined for housekeeping genes for these species, which were 55 to 65% for the genes encoding glycosyltransferases and O-antigen processing proteins and 75 to 93% for the nucleotide-sugar pathway genes. Nonetheless, the similarity of the levels of divergence in the five gene clusters required us to consider the possibility that the parent gene cluster for each structure was in the common ancestor of the species and that divergence is faster than expected for the common ancestor hypothesis. We propose that the identical O-antigen gene clusters originated from a common ancestor, and we discuss some possible explanations for the increased rate of divergence that is seen in these genes.	1
Title: Nisin- and Ripcin-Derived Hybrid Lanthipeptides Display Selective Antimicrobial Activity against Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Lanthipeptides are (methyl)lanthionine ring-containing ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Many lanthipeptides show strong antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. The group of disulfide-bond-containing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is well-known in nature and forms a rich source of templates for the production of novel peptides with corresponding (methyl)lanthionine analogues instead of disulfides. Here, we show that novel macrocyclic lanthipeptides (termed thanacin and ripcin) can be synthesized using the known antimicrobials thanatin and rip-thanatin as templates. Notably, the synthesized nisin(1-20)-ripcin hybrid lanthipeptides (ripcin B-G) showed selective antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, including an antibiotic-resistant MRSA strain. Interestingly, ripcin B-G, which are hybrid peptides of nisin(1-20) and ripcin that are each inactive against Gram-negative pathogens, showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative pathogens. Moreover, ripcin B-G was highly resistant against the nisin resistance protein (NSR; a peptidase that removes the C-terminal 6 amino acids of nisin and strongly reduces its antimicrobial activity), opposed to nisin itself. This study provides an example of converting disulfide-bond-based AMPs into (methyl)lanthionine-based macrocyclic hybrid lanthipeptides and can yield antimicrobial peptides with selective antimicrobial activity against S. aureus.	0
Title: Discovery of a new diol-containing polyketide by heterologous expression of a silent biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lavendulae FRI-5 Abstract: The genome of streptomycetes has the ability to produce many novel and potentially useful bioactive compounds, but most of which are not produced under standard laboratory cultivation conditions and are referred to as silent/cryptic secondary metabolites. Streptomyces lavendulae FRI-5 produces several types of bioactive compounds. However, this strain may also have the potential to biosynthesize more useful secondary metabolites. Here, we activated a silent biosynthetic gene cluster of an uncharacterized compound from S. lavendulae FRI-5 using heterologous expression. The engineered strain carrying the silent gene cluster produced compound 5, which was undetectable in the culture broth of S. lavendulae FRI-5. Using various spectroscopic analyses, we elucidated the chemical structure of compound 5 (named lavendiol) as a new diol-containing polyketide. The proposed assembly line of lavendiol shows a unique biosynthetic mechanism for polyketide compounds. The results of this study suggest the possibility of discovering more silent useful compounds from streptomycetes by genome mining and heterologous expression.	1
Title: Macrolactin is the polyketide biosynthesis product of the pks2 cluster of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: In the genome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, three operons pks1, pks2, and pks3 were identified which encode the biosynthesis of polyketides. pks1 and pks3 have been attributed to the production of bacillaene and difficidin/oxydifficidin, respectively, while the pks2 product remained hitherto unknown. Mass spectrometric analysis of the culture filtrates of the wild-type B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 and mutants revealed pks2-specific metabolites. By combination of the mass spectrometric and UV/vis data with a database search, these compounds were attributed to four members of the macrolactin family, macrolactin A and D as well as 7-O-malonyl- and 7-O-succinyl-macrolactin. This conclusion was verified by the isolation and structure elucidation of macrolactin A using mass spectrometric and 2D-NMR studies. Macrolactin biosynthesis was investigated using feeding experiments with (13)C-acetate. (13)C-labelled macrolactin A revealed an alternating labelling of its carbon skeleton with (13)C, indicating that acetate/malonate was used as the sole precursor. The macrolactin structure is compatible with the domain organization of the pks2-operon. Similarly to pks1 and pks3, pks2 is a modular polyketide synthase system of type I which exhibits a trans-acyltransferase architecture using a discrete acyltransferase enzyme iteratively in the assembly of macrolactin. Finally, the potential for macrolactin production on a genetic and metabolic basis was found to be widely distributed among Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains.	1
Title: Identification of a eukaryotic reductive dechlorinase and characterization of its mechanism of action on its natural substrate Abstract: Chlorinated compounds are important environmental pollutants whose biodegradation may be limited by inefficient dechlorinating enzymes. Dictyostelium amoebae produce a chlorinated alkyl phenone called DIF which induces stalk cell differentiation during their multicellular development. Here we describe the identification of DIF dechlorinase. DIF dechlorinase is active when expressed in bacteria, and activity is lost from Dictyostelium cells when its gene, drcA, is knocked out. It has a K(m) for DIF of 88 nM and K(cat) of 6.7 s(-1). DrcA is related to glutathione S-transferases, but with a key asparagine-to-cysteine substitution in the catalytic pocket. When this change is reversed, the enzyme reverts to a glutathione S-transferase, thus suggesting a catalytic mechanism. DrcA offers new possibilities for the rational design of bioremediation strategies.	0
Title: Genetic and physiological tests of three phosphate-specific transport mutants of Escherichia coli Abstract: Phosphate-specific transport system mutations phoT35, pst-2, and phoS25-(Am) were mapped between bgl and glmS, at about 83 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. All three mutations were recessive to wild-type genes on transducing bacteriophage lambda asn. The phoS25 (Am) and pst-2 mutations were also recessive to transducing phage lambda dglm; however, the phoT35 mutation was not. This suggests that phoT35 lies in a different complementation group from phoS25 (Am) or pst-2. Isogenic series of strains carrying these mutations were constructed in two genetic backgrounds, pit+ (wild type) and pit (relying entirely on the phosphate-specific transport system for phosphate uptake). The pst-2 pit double mutant was incapable of Pi utilization, but the phoT35 pit double mutant exhibited no such deficiency.	0
Title: In vitro activity of plant extracts and alkaloids against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains Abstract: The antibacterial activity of 80% ethanol extracts of 10 medicinal plants collected in Yunnan (Southwest China), was tested against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. Their MIC values ranged between 1.56-12.50 mg/mL. The most active plant extract was Chelidonium majus L. (MIC = 1.56 mg/mL). Two potent isoquinoline alkaloids, 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine and 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine, were identified as the major active principles through bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of the active ethyl acetate fraction from C. majus, with minimum MIC/MBC values of 15.63/62.50 mg/mL.	0
Title: Stable benzotriazole esters as mechanism-based inactivators of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CL protease Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of scabichelin, a novel tris-hydroxamate siderophore produced by the plant pathogen Streptomyces scabies 87.22 Abstract: Scabichelin and turgichelin, novel tris-hydroxamate siderophores, were isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus NBRC 13838/Streptomyces scabies JCM 7914 and Streptomyces turgidiscabies JCM 10429, respectively. The planar structures of scabichelin and turgichelin were elucidated by mass spectrometry, and 1- and 2-D NMR spectroscopic analyses of their gallium(III) complexes. The relative and absolute stereochemistry of the metabolites was determined by the modified Marfey's method in conjunction with computational modelling and NOESY NMR analysis of Ga-scabichelin and Ga-turgichelin. Genome sequence analysis of the plant pathogen Streptomyces scabies 87.22 identified a gene cluster containing a gene encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that was predicted to direct the production of a pentapeptide with structural similarities to scabichelin and turgichelin. Comparative LC-MS/MS analyses of iron-deficient culture supernatants from wild type S. scabies 87.22 and a mutant in which the NRPS gene had been disrupted, and scabichelin purified from S. antibioticus, showed that scabichelin is the metabolic product of the cryptic gene cluster, strongly suggesting that it functions as a siderophore.	1
Title: A two-step mechanism for the activation of actinorhodin export and resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Many microorganisms produce secondary metabolites that have antibiotic activity. To avoid self-inhibition, the producing cells often encode cognate export and/or resistance mechanisms in the biosynthetic gene clusters for these molecules. Actinorhodin is a blue-pigmented antibiotic produced by Streptomyces coelicolor. The actAB operon, carried in the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes two putative export pumps and is regulated by the transcriptional repressor protein ActR. In this work, we show that normal actinorhodin yields require actAB expression. Consistent with previous in vitro work, we show that both actinorhodin and its 3-ring biosynthetic intermediates [e.g., (S)-DNPA] can relieve repression of actAB by ActR in vivo. Importantly, an ActR mutant that interacts productively with (S)-DNPA but not with actinorhodin responds to the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway with the induction of actAB and normal yields of actinorhodin. This suggests that the intermediates are sufficient to trigger the export genes in actinorhodin-producing cells. We further show that actinorhodin-producing cells can induce actAB expression in nonproducing cells; however, in this case actinorhodin is the most important signal. Finally, while the "intermediate-only" ActR mutant permits sufficient actAB expression for normal actinorhodin yields, this expression is short-lived. Sustained culture-wide expression requires a subsequent actinorhodin-mediated signaling step, and the defect in this response causes widespread cell death. These results are consistent with a two-step model for actinorhodin export and resistance where intermediates trigger initial expression for export from producing cells and actinorhodin then triggers sustained export gene expression that confers culture-wide resistance. IMPORTANCE Understanding the links between antibiotic resistance and biosynthesis is important for our efforts to manipulate secondary metabolism. For example, many secondary metabolites are produced at low levels; our work suggests that manipulating export might be one way to enhance yields of these molecules. It also suggests that understanding resistance will be relevant to the generation of novel secondary metabolites through the creation of synthetic secondary metabolic gene clusters. Finally, these cognate resistance mechanisms are related to mechanisms that arise in pathogenic bacteria, and understanding them is relevant to our ability to control microbial infections clinically.	1
Title: Mupirocin W, a novel pseudomonic acid produced by targeted mutation of the mupirocin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Mutation of the mupW gene in the mupirocin biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas fluorescens results in efficient production of a novel pseudomonic acid metabolite, mupirocin W, which lacks the characteristic tetrahydropyran ring, and reveals the role of the mupW gene in pseudomonic acid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Self-assembling small molecules form nanofibrils that bind procaspase-3 to promote activation Abstract: Modulating enzyme function with small-molecule activators, as opposed to inhibitors, offers new opportunities for drug discovery and allosteric regulation. We previously identified a compound, called 1541, from a high-throughput screen (HTS) that stimulates activation of a proenzyme, procaspase-3, to generate mature caspase-3. Here we further investigate the mechanism of activation and report the surprising finding that 1541 self-assembles into nanofibrils exceeding 1 μm in length. These particles are an unanticipated outcome from an HTS that have properties distinct from standard globular protein aggregators. Moreover, 1541 nanofibrils function as a unique biocatalytic material that activates procaspase-3 via induced proximity. These studies demonstrate a novel approach for proenzyme activation through binding to fibrils, which may mimic how procaspases are naturally processed on protein scaffolds.	0
Title: NRPS substrate promiscuity diversifies the xenematides Abstract: Xenematide, a cyclic depsipeptide antibiotic produced by Xenorhabdus nematophila, had a candidate nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) with atypical features. Differential metabolite analysis between a mutant and wildtype validated that this stand-alone NRPS was required for xenematide production, and further analysis led to a series of new xenematide derivatives encoded by the same NRPS. Our results indicate that adenylation domain promiscuity and relaxed downstream processing in the X. nematophila NRPS provide a conduit for xenematide diversification.	1
Title: A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster from Algoriphagus sp. KK10202C with a novel fusion-type lycopene beta-cyclase gene Abstract: A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster was isolated from a marine bacterium Algoriphagus sp. strain KK10202C that synthesized flexixanthin. Seven genes were transcribed in the same direction, among which five of them were involved in carotenoid synthesis. This cluster had a unique gene organization, with an isoprenoid gene, ispH (previously named lytB), being present among the carotenoid synthesis genes. The lycopene beta-cyclase encoded by the crtY ( cd ) gene appeared to be a fusion of bacterial heterodimeric lycopene cyclase CrtY(c) and CrtY(d). This was the first time that a fusion-type of lycopene beta-cyclase was reported in eubacteria. Heterologous expression of the Algoriphagus crtY ( cd ) gene in lycopene-accumulating Escherichia coli produced bicyclic beta-carotene. A biosynthesis pathway for monocyclic flexixanthin was proposed in Algoriphagus sp. strain KK10202C, though several of the carotenoid synthesis genes not linked with the cluster have not yet been cloned.	1
Title: A complete gene cluster from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 encoding biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin Abstract: The PKS genes for biosynthesis of the polyether nanchangmycin are organized to encode two sets of proteins (six and seven ORFs, respectively), but are separated by independent ORFs that encode an epimerase, epoxidase, and epoxide hydrolase, and, notably, an independent ACP. One of the PKS modules lacks a corresponding ACP. We propose that the process of oxidative cyclization to form the polyether structure occurs when the polyketide chain is still anchored on the independent ACP before release. 4-O-methyl-L-rhodinose biosynthesis and its transglycosylation involve four putative genes, and regulation of nanchangmycin biosynthesis seems to involve activation as well as repression. In-frame deletion of a KR6 domain generated the nanchangmycin aglycone with loss of 4-O-methyl-L-rhodinose and antibacterial activity, in agreement with the assignments of the PKS domains catalyzing specific biosynthetic steps.	1
Title: Cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis involves functionalization of an unactivated carbon center Abstract: The cylindrocyclophanes are a family of natural products that share a remarkable paracyclophane carbon scaffold. Using genome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, we have discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster involved in the assembly of cylindrocyclophane F. Through a combination of in vitro enzyme characterization and feeding studies, we confirm the connection between this gene cluster and cylindrocyclophane production, elucidate the chemical events involved in initiating and terminating an unusual type I polyketide synthase assembly line, and discover that macrocycle assembly involves functionalization of an unactivated carbon center.	1
Title: A new macromolecular antitumor antibiotic, C-1027. III. Antitumor activity Abstract: C-1027, a new macromolecular antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces globisporus C-1027, showed extremely potent cytotoxicity toward cultured cancer cells. Compared in terms of IC50 values, antibiotic C-1027 showed much more potent cytotoxicity than doxorubicin, mitomycin C and neocarzinostatin. Spermatogonial assay, a prescreen for anticancer drugs, was highly sensitive for detection of C-1027. At tolerable doses, C-1027 exhibited marked inhibition on a panel of transplantable tumors in mice, which included leukemia L1210, P388, ascites hepatoma H22, sarcoma 180 and melanoma Harding-Passey.	0
Title: A gene cluster for macrolide antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae: architecture of metabolic diversity Abstract: In a survey of microbial systems capable of generating unusual metabolite structural variability, Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 is notable in its ability to produce two distinct groups of macrolide antibiotics. Methymycin and neomethymycin are derived from the 12-membered ring macrolactone 10-deoxymethynolide, whereas narbomycin and pikromycin are derived from the 14-membered ring macrolactone, narbonolide. This report describes the cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for these antibiotics. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus (pikA) that encodes a six-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins, in addition to a type II thioesterase (TEII). Immediately downstream is a set of genes for desosamine biosynthesis (des) and macrolide ring hydroxylation. The study suggests that Pik TEII plays a role in forming a metabolic branch through which polyketides of different chain length are generated, and the glycosyl transferase (encoded by desVII) has the ability to catalyze glycosylation of both the 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones. Moreover, the pikC-encoded P450 hydroxylase provides yet another layer of structural variability by introducing regiochemical diversity into the macrolide ring systems. The data support the notion that the architecture of the pik gene cluster as well as the unusual substrate specificity of particular enzymes contributes to its ability to generate four macrolide antibiotics.	1
Title: Sex-specific effect of CPB2 Ala147Thr but not Thr325Ile variants on the risk of venous thrombosis: A comprehensive meta-analysis Abstract: Background:                       Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), encoded by the Carboxypeptidase B2 gene (CPB2), is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. Experimental findings support a functional role of genetic variants in CPB2, while epidemiological studies have been unable to confirm associations with risk of venous thrombosis. Sex-specific effects could underlie the observed inconsistent associations between CPB2 genetic variants and venous thrombosis.                  Methods:                       A comprehensive literature search was conducted for associations between Ala147Thr and Thr325Ile variants with venous thrombosis. Authors were contacted to provide sex-specific genotype counts from their studies. Combined and sex-specific random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate a pooled effect estimate for primary and secondary genetic models.                  Results:                       A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. A sex-specific meta-analysis applying a dominant model supported a protective effect of Ala147Thr on venous thrombosis in females (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.68,0.97; p = 0.018), but not in males (OR = 1.06, 95%CI:0.96-1.16; p = 0.263). The Thr325Ile did not show a sex-specific effect but showed variation in allele frequencies by geographic region. A subgroup analysis of studies in European countries showed decreased risk, with a recessive model (OR = 0.83, 95%CI:0.71-0.97, p = 0.021) for venous thrombosis.                  Conclusions:                       A comprehensive literature review, including unpublished data, provided greater statistical power for the analyses and decreased the likelihood of publication bias influencing the results. Sex-specific analyses explained apparent discrepancies across genetic studies of Ala147Thr and venous thrombosis. While, careful selection of genetic models based on population genetics, evolutionary and biological knowledge can increase power by decreasing the need to adjust for testing multiple models.	0
Title: Watasemycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae: thiazoline C-methylation by a type B radical-SAM methylase homologue Abstract: 2-Hydroxyphenylthiazolines are a family of iron-chelating nonribosomal peptide natural products that function as virulence-conferring siderophores in various Gram-negative bacteria. They have also been reported as metabolites of Gram-positive Streptomyces species. Transcriptional analyses of Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 revealed that its genome contains a putative 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 showed that the mono- and dimethylated derivatives, thiazostatin and watasemycin, respectively, of the 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline enantiopyochelin are two of its metabolic products. In addition, isopyochelin, a novel isomer of pyochelin containing a C-methylated thiazolidine, was identified as a third metabolic product of the cluster. Metabolites with molecular formulae corresponding to aerugine and pulicatins A/B were also detected. The structure and stereochemistry of isopyochelin were confirmed by comparison with synthetic standards. The role of two genes in the cluster encoding homologues of PchK, which is proposed to catalyse thiazoline reduction in the biosynthesis of enantiopyochelin in Pseudomonas protegens, was investigated. One was required for the production of all the metabolic products of the cluster, whereas the other appears not to be involved in the biosynthesis of any of them. Deletion of a gene in the cluster encoding a type B radical-SAM methylase homologue abolished the production of watasemycin, but not thiazostatin or isopyochelin. Feeding of thiazostatin to the mutant lacking the functional PchK homologue resulted in complete conversion to watasemycin, demonstrating that thiazoline C-methylation by the type B radical-SAM methylase homologue is the final step in watasemycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Marinoterpins A-C: Rare Linear Merosesterterpenoids from Marine-Derived Actinomycete Bacteria of the Family Streptomycetaceae Abstract: The chemical examination of two undescribed marine actinobacteria has yielded three rare merosesterterpenoids, marinoterpins A-C (1-3, respectively). These compounds were isolated from the culture broth extracts of two marine-derived actinomycetes associated with the family Streptomycetaceae, (our strains were CNQ-253 and AJS-327). The structures of the new compounds were determined by extensive interpretation of 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and combined spectroscopic data. These compounds represent new chemical motifs, combining quinoline-N-oxides with a linear sesterterpenoid side chain. Additionally, consistent in all three metabolites is the rare occurrence of two five-ring ethers, which were derived from an apparent cyclization of methyl group carbons to adjacent hydroxy-bearing methylene groups in the sesterterpenoid side chain. Genome scanning of AJS-327 allowed for the identification of the marinoterpin (mrt) biosynthetic cluster, which consists of 16 open-reading frames that code for a sesterterpene pyrophosphate synthase, prenyltransferase, type II polyketide synthase, anthranilate:CoA-ligase, and several tailoring enzymes apparently responsible for installing the N-oxide and bis-tetrahydrofuran ring motifs.	1
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of A-500359s in Streptomyces griseus SANK60196 Abstract: A-500359s, produced by Streptomyces griseus SANK60196, are inhibitors of bacterial phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase. They are composed of three distinct moieties: a 5'-carbamoyl uridine, an unsaturated hexuronic acid and an aminocaprolactam. Two contiguous cosmids covering a 65-kb region of DNA and encoding 38 open reading frames (ORFs) putatively involved in the biosynthesis of A-500359s were identified. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed that most of the 38 ORFs are highly expressed during A-500359s production, but mutants that do not produce A-500359s did not express these same ORFs. Furthermore, orf21, encoding a putative aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces albus, yielding strains having selective resistance against A-500359B, suggesting that ORF21 phosphorylates the unsaturated hexuronic acid as a mechanism of self-resistance to A-500359s. In total, the data suggest that the cloned region is involved in the resistance, regulation and biosynthesis of A-500359s.	1
Title: Characterization of monoclonal antibodies for rapid identification of Actinomyces naeslundii in clinical samples Abstract: The purpose of this study was to generate highly specific serological reagents for the quantitative identification of Actinomyces naeslundii in clinical samples, in particular dental plaque. Balb/c mice were immunized with pasteurized human A. naeslundii strains representing different genospecies and serotypes. Ten hybrid cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies reactive with A. naeslundii were isolated and characterized. Antibody specificity was determined by indirect immunofluo-rescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using strains from 59 species and by immunofluorescence analyses of supragingival plaque from 10 gingivitis patients. Nine monoclonal antibodies reacted selectively with A. naeslundii, whereas one additionally bound to Actinomyces israelii. They recognized at least nine different epitopes with characteristic expression patterns among the test strains. Six clusters of antigenically unique or closely related strains could be distinguished. Clusters 1, 4, and 5 represented by 12, 18, and 5 strains, respectively, comprised over 80% of the A. naeslundii strains tested. All reference strains for genospecies 1 grouped with cluster 1. Strains associated with genospecies 2 fell into clusters 4 and 5. Tests with mutant strains indicated that three monoclonal antibodies recognize type 2 and one type 1 fimbriae of genospecies 2. Only four isolates grouped with clusters 2 and 3 characterized by the expression of cluster-specific antigens. Interestingly, cluster 2 and 3 bacteria were markedly more abundant in vivo than indicated by their sparse representation in our strain collection. Overall, all but one of the new monoclonal antibodies should prove of value for the serological classification and rapid quantitative determination of A. naeslundii in clinical samples.	0
Title: Cloning of the gene encoding Streptococcin A-FF22, a novel lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus pyogenes, and determination of its nucleotide sequence Abstract: Streptococcin A-FF22 (SA-FF22) is a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus pyogenes FF22. The nucleotide sequence of the SA-FF22 structural gene (scnA) was determined and shown to encode a 51-amino-acid prepeptide. The proteolytic processing site of the SA-FF22 prepeptide differs from that which characterizes other type A lantibiotics.	1
Title: Enantioselective Synthesis of the Cyclopiazonic Acid Family Using Sulfur Ylides Abstract: A convergent, nine-step (LLS), enantioselective synthesis of α-cyclopiazonic acid and related natural products is reported. The route features a) an enantioselective aziridination of an imine with a chiral sulfur ylide; b) a bioinspired (3+2)-cycloaddition of the aziridine onto an alkene; and c) installation of the acetyltetramic acid by an unprecedented tandem carbonylative lactamization/N-O cleavage of a bromoisoxazole.	0
Title: HEx: A heterologous expression platform for the discovery of fungal natural products Abstract: For decades, fungi have been a source of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved natural products such as penicillin, cyclosporine, and the statins. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing suggest that millions of fungal species exist on Earth, with each genome encoding pathways capable of generating as many as dozens of natural products. However, the majority of encoded molecules are difficult or impossible to access because the organisms are uncultivable or the genes are transcriptionally silent. To overcome this bottleneck in natural product discovery, we developed the HEx (Heterologous EXpression) synthetic biology platform for rapid, scalable expression of fungal biosynthetic genes and their encoded metabolites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied this platform to 41 fungal biosynthetic gene clusters from diverse fungal species from around the world, 22 of which produced detectable compounds. These included novel compounds with unexpected biosynthetic origins, particularly from poorly studied species. This result establishes the HEx platform for rapid discovery of natural products from any fungal species, even those that are uncultivable, and opens the door to discovery of the next generation of natural products.	1
Title: Comparison of cellular and biomass specific activities of dominant bacterioplankton groups in stratified waters of the Celtic Sea Abstract: A flow-sorting technique was developed to determine unperturbed metabolic activities of phylogenetically characterized bacterioplankton groups with incorporation rates of [(35)S]methionine tracer. According to fluorescence in situ hybridization with rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes, a clade of alpha-proteobacteria, related to Roseobacter spp., and a Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster dominated the different groups. Cytometric characterization revealed both these groups to have high DNA (HNA) content, while the alpha-proteobacteria exhibited high light scatter (hs) and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster exhibited low light scatter (ls). A third abundant group with low DNA (LNA) content contained cells from a SAR86 cluster of gamma-proteobacteria. Cellular specific activities of the HNA-hs group were 4- and 1.7-fold higher than the activities in the HNA-ls and LNA groups, respectively. However, the higher cellular protein synthesis by the HNA-hs could simply be explained by their maintenance of a larger cellular protein biomass. Similar biomass specific activities of the different groups strongly support the main assumption that underlies the determination of bacterial production: different bacteria in a complex community incorporate amino acids at a rate proportional to their protein synthesis. The fact that the highest growth-specific rates were determined for the smallest cells of the LNA group can explain the dominance of this group in nutrient-limited waters. The metabolic activities of the three groups accounted for almost the total bacterioplankton activity, indicating their key biogeochemical role in the planktonic ecosystem of the Celtic Sea.	0
Title: 6-Substituted 2-Aminopurine-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-Triphosphates that Trace Cytosine Methylation Abstract: Gene expression is extensively regulated by the occurrence and distribution of the epigenetic marker 2'-deoxy 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in genomic DNA. Because of its effects on tumorigenesis there is an important link to human health. In addition, detection of 5mC can serve as an outstanding biomarker for diagnostics as well as for disease therapy. Our previous studies have already shown that, by processing O(6) -alkylated 2'-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) analogues, DNA polymerases are able to sense the presence of a single 5mC unit in a template. Here we present the synthesis and evaluation of an extended toolbox of 6-substituted 2-aminopurine-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates modified at position 6 with various functionalities. We found that sensing of 5-methylation by this class of nucleotides is more general, not being restricted to O(6) -alkyl modification of dGTP but also applying to other functionalities.	0
Title: Hoisting-Loop in Bacterial Multidrug Exporter AcrB Is a Highly Flexible Hinge That Enables the Large Motion of the Subdomains Abstract: The overexpression of RND-type exporters is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Gram-negative pathogens. In RND transporters, such as Escherichia coli's main efflux pump AcrB, drug efflux occurs in the porter domain, while protons flow through the transmembrane domain: remote conformational coupling. At the border of a transmembrane helix (TM8) and subdomain PC2, there is a loop which makes a hoisting movement by a random-coil-to-α-helix change, and opens and closes a drug channel entrance. This loop is supposed to play a key role in the allosteric conformational coupling between the transmembrane and porter domain. Here we show the results of a series of flexibility loop-mutants of AcrB. We determined the crystal structure of a three amino acid truncated loop mutant, which is still a functional transporter, and show that the short α-helix between Cβ15 and the loop unwinds to a random coil in the access and binding monomers and in the extrusion monomer it makes a partially stretched coil-to-helix change. The loop has undergone compensatory conformational changes and still facilitates the opening and closing of the channel. In addition, more flexible mutated loops (proline mutated and significantly elongated) can still function during export. The flexibility in this region is however limited, as an even more truncated mutant (six amino acid deletion) becomes mostly inactive. We found that the hoisting-loop is a highly flexible hinge that enables the conformational energy transmission passively.	0
Title: Characterization of Mycobacterium smegmatis PolD2 and PolD1 as RNA/DNA polymerases homologous to the POL domain of bacterial DNA ligase D Abstract: Mycobacteria exploit nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) to repair DNA double-strand breaks. The core NHEJ machinery comprises the homodimeric DNA end-binding protein Ku and DNA ligase D (LigD), a modular enzyme composed of a C-terminal ATP-dependent ligase domain (LIG), a central 3'-phosphoesterase domain (PE), and an N-terminal polymerase domain (POL). LigD POL is proficient at adding templated and nontemplated deoxynucleotides and ribonucleotides to DNA ends in vitro and is the catalyst in vivo of unfaithful NHEJ events involving nontemplated single-nucleotide additions to blunt DSB ends. Here, we identify two mycobacterial proteins, PolD1 and PolD2, as stand-alone homologues of the LigD POL domain. Biochemical characterization of PolD1 and PolD2 shows that they resemble LigD POL in their monomeric quaternary structures, their ability to add templated and nontemplated nucleotides to primer-templates and blunt ends, and their preference for rNTPs versus dNTPs. Deletion of polD1, polD2, or both from a Mycobacterium smegmatis strain carrying an inactivating mutation in LigD POL failed to reveal a role for PolD1 or PolD2 in templated nucleotide additions during NHEJ of 5'-overhang DSBs or in clastogen resistance. Whereas our results document the existence and characteristics of new stand-alone members of the LigD POL family of RNA/DNA polymerases, they imply that other polymerases can perform fill-in synthesis during mycobacterial NHEJ.	0
Title: Efficient Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of N-Glycans with a β1,4-Galactosylated Bisecting GlcNAc Motif Abstract: In human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), a rare modification of biantennary complex N-glycans lead to a β1,4-galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc branch. We found that the bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary core-fucosylated N-glycan was enzymatically galactosylated under stringent reaction conditions. Further optimizations led to an efficient enzymatic approach to this particular modification for biantennary substrates. Notably, tri- and tetra-antennary complex N-glycans were not converted by bovine galactosyltransferase. An N-glycan with a galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc was linked to a lanthanide binding tag. The pseudo-contact shifts (PCS) obtained from the corresponding Dy-complex were used to calculate the conformational preferences of the rare N-glycan. Besides two extended conformations only a single folded conformation was found.	0
Title: Mutants of feline immunodeficiency virus resistant to 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine Abstract: We selected mutants of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) that are resistant to 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T). Two mutants were selected in cultured cells with a stepwise increase in d4T concentration, resulting in mutants able to replicate in 100 microM d4T. These mutants were three- to sixfold more resistant to d4T than wild-type FIV. They were also cross-resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine, and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, and they were highly resistant to phosphonoformic acid (PFA). Plaque-purified mutants were isolated from each of the mutant populations. The mutant phenotype was stable, because both of the plaque-purified mutants remained d4T resistant even after three passages in the absence of d4T. One of the plaque-purified mutants, designated D4R-3c, was further characterized. Compared with wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT), RT purified from D4R-3c was 3-fold resistant to inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of d4T, 10-fold resistant to inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of AZT, and 6-fold resistant to PFA. D4R-3c had a single point mutation in the RT-encoding region of the pol gene at position 2474, resulting in a Val to Ile mutation at codon 47 of the FIV RT. The role of this mutation in d4T resistance was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of anthraquinones by interspecies cloning of actinorhodin biosynthesis genes in streptomycetes: clarification of actinorhodin gene functions Abstract: Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31133 and ATCC 31671, producers of the anthracyclines aclacinomycin A and 2-hydroxyaklavinone, respectively, formed an anthraquinone, aloesaponarin II, when they were transformed with DNA from Streptomyces coelicolor containing four genetic loci, actI, actIII, actIV, and actVII, encoding early reactions in the actinorhodin biosynthesis pathway. Subcloning experiments indicated that a 2.8-kilobase-pair XhoI fragment containing only the actI and actVII loci was necessary for aloesaponarin II biosynthesis by S. galilaeus ATCC 31133. Aloesaponarin II was synthesized via the condensation of 8 acetyl coenzyme A equivalents, followed by a decarboxylation reaction as demonstrated by [1,2-13C2]acetate feeding experiments. S. coelicolor B22 and B159, actVI blocked mutants, also formed aloesaponarin II as an apparent shunt product. Mutants of S. coelicolor blocked in several other steps in actinorhodin biosynthesis did not synthesize aloesaponarin II or other detectable anthraquinones. When S. galilaeus ATCC 31671 was transformed with the DNA carrying the actI, actIII, and actVII loci, the recombinant strain produced both aloesaponarin II and aklavinone, suggesting that the actinorhodin biosynthesis DNA encoded a function able to deoxygenate 2-hydroxyaklavinone to aklavinone. When S. galilaeus ATCC 31671 was transformed with a plasmid carrying only the intact actIII gene (pANT45), aklavinone was formed exclusively. These experiments indicate a function for the actIII gene, which is the reduction of the keto group at C-9 from the carboxy terminus of the assembled polyketide to the corresponding secondary alcohol. In the presence of the actIII gene, anthraquinones or anthracyclines formed as a result of dehydration and aromatization lack an oxygen function on the carbon on which the keto reductase operated. When S. galilaeus ATCC 31671 was transformed with the DNA carrying the actI, actVII, and actIV loci, the recombinant strain produced two novel anthraquinones, desoxyerythrolaccin, the 3-hydroxy analog of aloesaponarin II, and 1-O-methyldesoxyerythrolaccin. The results obtained in these experiments together with earlier data suggest a pathway for the biosynthesis of actinorhodin and related compounds by S. coelicolor.	1
Title: Clickable polyglycerol hyperbranched polymers and their application to gold nanoparticles and acid-labile nanocarriers Abstract: A one-step, large-scale preparation of alkyne-containing hyper-branched polyglycerols (HPG) is reported.

Title: Chain initiation in the leinamycin-producing hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140. Discrete, monofunctional adenylation enzyme and peptidyl carrier protein that directly load D-alanine Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide natural products are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are organized into modules. For a typical NRPS initiation module, an adenylation (A) domain activates an amino acid and installs it onto a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain as a thioester; an elongation module, which has a condensation (C) domain located between every consecutive pair of A and PCP domains, catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between the upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl-S-PCP and the free amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP. D-amino acid constituents in peptide natural products usually arise from the L-enantiomers through the action of integral epimerization (E) domains of an NRPS. The biosynthetic gene cluster for leinamycin, a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide containing a D-alanine moiety, does not encode a typical NRPS initiation module with the expected A-PCP-E domains; instead, it has only an A protein (LnmQ) and a PCP (LnmP), both of which are encoded by separate genes. Here we show the results of biochemical experiments as follows: (i) we demonstrate that LnmQ directly activates D-alanine as D-alaninyl-AMP and installs it onto LnmP to generate a D-alaninyl-S-PCP intermediate; (ii) we confirm that aminoacylation of LnmP by LnmQ in trans is the result of specific communication between the separate A and PCP proteins; and (iii) we reveal that leinamycin production can be improved by supplementation of exogenous D-alanine in the fermentation broth of Streptomyces atroolivaceous S-140. These findings unveil an unprecedented NRPS initiation module structure that is characterized by a discrete D-alanine-specific A protein and a PCP.	1
Title: Directed evolution of alditol oxidase for the production of optically pure D-glycerate from glycerol in the engineered Escherichia coli Abstract: D-glycerate is an attractive chemical for a wide variety of pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biodegradable polymers, and other applications. Now several studies have been reported about the synthesis of glycerate by different biotechnological and chemical routes from glycerol or other feedstock. Here, we present the construction of an Escherichia coli engineered strain to produce optically pure D-glycerate by oxidizing glycerol with an evolved variant of alditol oxidase (AldO) from Streptomyces coelicolor. This is achieved by starting from a previously reported variant mAldO and employing three rounds of directed evolution, as well as the combination of growth-coupled high throughput selection with colorimetric screening. The variant eAldO3-24 displays a higher substrate affinity toward glycerol with 5.23-fold than the wild-type AldO, and a 1.85-fold increase of catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). Then we introduced an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 expression system in E. coli to overexpress the variant eAldO3-24, and deleted glucosylglycerate phosphorylase encoding gene ycjM to block the consumption of D-glycerate. Finally, the resulting strain TZ-170 produced 30.1 g/l D-glycerate at 70 h with a yield of 0.376 mol/mol in 5-l fed-batch fermentation.	0
Title: RNA architecture dictates the conformations of a bound peptide Abstract: Background:                       The biological function of several viral and bacteriophage proteins, and their arginine-rich subdomains, involves RNA-mediated interactions. It has been shown recently that bound peptides adopt either beta-hairpin or alpha-helical conformations in viral and phage peptide-RNA complexes. We have compared the structures of the arginine-rich peptide domain of HIV-1 Rev bound to two RNA aptamers to determine whether RNA architecture can dictate the conformations of a bound peptide.                  Results:                       The core-binding segment of the HIV-1 Rev peptide class II RNA aptamer complex spans the two-base bulge and hairpin loop of the bound RNA and the carboxy-terminal segment of the bound peptide. The bound peptide is anchored in place by backbone and sidechain intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals stacking interactions. One of the bulge bases participates in U*(A*U) base triple formation, whereas the other is looped out and flaps over the bound peptide in the complex. The seven-residue hairpin loop is closed by a sheared G*A mismatch pair with several pyrimidines looped out of the hairpin fold.                  Conclusions:                       Our structural studies establish that RNA architecture dictates whether the same HIV-1 Rev peptide folds into an extended or alpha-helical conformation on complex formation. Arginine-rich peptides can therefore adapt distinct secondary folds to complement the tertiary folds of their RNA targets. This contrasts with protein-RNA complexes in which elements of RNA secondary structure adapt to fit within the tertiary folds of their protein targets.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Machinery of Diterpene Pleuromutilin Isolated from Basidiomycete Fungi Abstract: The diterpene pleuromutilin is a ribosome-targeting antibiotic isolated from basidiomycete fungi, such as Clitopilus pseudo-pinsitus. The functional characterization of all biosynthetic enzymes involved in pleuromutilin biosynthesis is reported and a biosynthetic pathway proposed. In vitro enzymatic reactions and mutational analysis revealed that a labdane-related diterpene synthase, Ple3, catalyzed two rounds of cyclization from geranylgeranyl diphosphate to premutilin possessing a characteristic 5-6-8-tricyclic carbon skeleton. Biotransformation experiments utilizing Aspergillus oryzae transformants possessing modification enzyme genes allowed the biosynthetic pathway from premutilin to pleuromutilin to be proposed. The present study sets the stage for the enzymatic synthesis of natural products isolated from basidiomycete fungi, which are a prolific source of structurally diverse and biologically active terpenoids.	1
Title: Identification of cytochrome P450s required for fumitremorgin biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Fumitremorgin C, a diketopiperazine mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus fumigatus, is a potent and specific inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Elucidation of the fumitremorgin C biosynthetic pathway provides a strategy for new drug design. A structure-activity relationship study based on metabolites related to the ftm gene cluster revealed that the process most crucial for inhibitory activity against BCRP was cyclization to form fumitremorgin C. To determine the gene involved in the cyclization reaction, targeted gene inactivation was performed with candidate genes in the ftm cluster. Analysis of the gene disruptants allowed us to identify ftmE, one of the cytochrome P450 genes in the cluster, as the gene responsible for the key step in fumitremorgin biosynthesis. Additionally, we demonstrated that the other two cytochrome P450 genes, ftmC and ftmG, were involved in hydroxylation of the indole ring and successive hydroxylation of fumitremorgin C, respectively.	1
Title: Engineering the redox potential over a wide range within a new class of FeS proteins Abstract: MitoNEET is a newly discovered mitochondrial protein and a target of the TZD class of antidiabetes drugs. MitoNEET is homodimeric with each protomer binding a [2Fe-2S] center through a rare 3-Cys and 1-His coordination geometry. Both the fold and the coordination of the [2Fe-2S] centers suggest that it could have novel properties compared to other known [2Fe-2S] proteins. We tested the robustness of mitoNEET to mutation and the range over which the redox potential (E(M)) could be tuned. We found that the protein could tolerate an array of mutations that modified the E(M) of the [2Fe-2S] center over a range of ∼700 mV, which is the largest E(M) range engineered in an FeS protein and, importantly, spans the cellular redox range (+200 to -300 mV). These properties make mitoNEET potentially useful for both physiological studies and industrial applications as a stable, water-soluble, redox agent.	0
Title: Phosphate-controlled regulator for the biosynthesis of the dalbavancin precursor A40926 Abstract: The actinomycete Nonomuraea sp. strain ATCC 39727 produces the glycopeptide A40926, the precursor of the novel antibiotic dalbavancin. Previous studies have shown that phosphate limitation results in enhanced A40926 production. The A40926 biosynthetic gene (dbv) cluster, which consists of 37 genes, encodes two putative regulators, Dbv3 and Dbv4, as well as the response regulator (Dbv6) and the sensor-kinase (Dbv22) of a putative two-component system. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the dbv14-dbv8 and the dbv30-dbv35 operons, as well as dbv4, were negatively influenced by phosphate. Dbv4 shows a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and shares sequence similarity with StrR, the transcriptional activator of streptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus. Dbv4 was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal His(6)-tagged protein. The purified protein bound the dbv14 and dbv30 upstream regions but not the region preceding dbv4. Bbr, a Dbv4 ortholog from the gene cluster for the synthesis of the glycopeptide balhimycin, also bound to the dbv14 and dbv30 upstream regions, while Dbv4 bound appropriate regions from the balhimycin cluster. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of glycopeptide antibiotics, indicating that the phosphate-controlled regulator Dbv4 governs two key steps in A40926 biosynthesis: the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and critical tailoring reactions on the heptapeptide backbone.	1
Title: Butylphenyl-functionalized palladium nanoparticles as effective catalysts for the electrooxidation of formic acid Abstract: Monodisperse butylphenyl-functionalized palladium (Pd-BP, dia. 2.24 nm) nanoparticles were synthesized through co-reduction of butylphenyldiazonium and H(2)PdCl(4) by NaBH(4). Because of this unique surface functionalization and a high specific electrochemical surface area (122 m(2) g(-1)), the Pd-BP nanoparticles exhibited a mass activity ∼4.5 times that of commercial Pd black for HCOOH electrooxidation.	0
Title: Simultaneous Semimechanistic Population Analyses of Levofloxacin in Plasma, Lung, and Prostate To Describe the Influence of Efflux Transporters on Drug Distribution following Intravenous and Intratracheal Administration Abstract: Levofloxacin (LEV) is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone used to treat pneumonia, urinary tract infections, chronic bacterial bronchitis, and prostatitis. Efflux transporters, primarily P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are involved in LEV's tissue penetration. In the present work, LEV free lung and prostate interstitial space fluid (ISF) concentrations were evaluated by microdialysis in Wistar rats after intravenous (i.v.) and intratracheal (i.t.) administration (7 mg/kg of body weight) with and without coadministration of the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (TAR; 15 mg/kg administered i.v.). Plasma and tissue concentration/time profiles were evaluated by noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and population pharmacokinetics (popPK) analysis. The NCA showed significant differences in bioavailability (F) for the control group (0.4) and the TAR group (0.86) after i.t. administration. A four-compartment model simultaneously characterized total plasma and free lung (compartment 2) and prostate (compartment 3) ISF concentrations. Statistically significant differences in lung and prostate average ISF concentrations and levels of kidney active secretion in the TAR group from those measured for the control group (LEV alone) were observed. The estimated population means were as follows: volume of the central compartment (V1), 0.321 liters; total plasma clearance (CL), 0.220 liters/h; TAR plasma clearance (CLTAR), 0.180 liters/h. The intercompartmental distribution rate constants (K values) were as follows: K12, 8.826 h(-1); K21, 7.271 h(-1); K13, 0.047 h(-1); K31, 7.738 h(-1); K14, 0.908 h(-1); K41, 0.409 h(-1); K21 lung TAR (K21LTAR), 8.883 h(-1); K31 prostate TAR (K31PTAR), 4.377 h(-1). The presence of P-gp considerably impacted the active renal secretion of LEV but had only a minor impact on the efflux from the lung following intratracheal dosing. Our results strongly support the idea of a role of efflux transporters other than P-gp contributing to LEV's tissue penetration into the prostrate.	0
Title: The mating-type locus b of the sugarcane smut Sporisorium scitamineum is essential for mating, filamentous growth and pathogenicity Abstract: Sporisorium scitamineum is the causal agent of sugarcane smut, which is one of the most serious constraints to global sugarcane production. S. scitamineum and Ustilago maydis are two closely related smut fungi, that are predicted to harbor similar sexual mating processes/system. To elucidate the molecular basis of sexual mating in S. scitamineum, we identified and deleted the ortholog of mating-specific U. maydis locus b, in S. scitamineum. The resultant b-deletion mutant was defective in mating and pathogenicity in S. scitamineum. Furthermore, a functional b locus heterodimer could trigger filamentous growth without mating in S. scitamineum, and functionally replace the b locus in U. maydis in terms of triggering aerial filament production and forming solopathogenic strains, which do not require sexual mating prior to pathogenicity on the host plants.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of mercapturic acid derivative of the labdane-type diterpene, cyslabdan that potentiates imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: cyslabdan is generated by mycothiol-mediated xenobiotic detoxification Abstract: Genome mining of cyslabdan-producing Streptomyces cyslabdanicus K04-0144 revealed that a set of four genes, cldA, cldB, cldC, and cldD (the cld cluster), which formed a single transcriptional unit, were involved in the biosynthesis of cyslabdan that potentiates imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Experimental studies supported the heterologous expression of the cld cluster of S. cyslabdanicus K04-0144 in S. avermitilis SUKA22, and transformants carrying the cld cluster produced not only cyslabdan A (1), but also its new derivatives, 17-hydroxyl-1 (2) and 2-hydroxyl-1 (3), in the culture broth. An analysis of diterpene metabolites in the mycelia showed that a large amount of a novel intermediate had accumulated and its structure was elucidated as (7S, 8S, 12E)-8,17-epoxy-7-hydroxylabda-12,14-diene (4). The cld-like cluster (rmn cluster) was also detected in the genome of S. anulatus GM95 by searching our in-house genome databases, and the heterologous expression of the rmn cluster in S. avermitilis SUAK22 demonstrated that the rmn cluster was involved in the biosynthesis of the labdane-type bicyclic diterpene, raimonol (7). CldA/RmnA catalyzed the generation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate. CldB/RmnB converted GGPP to (+)-copalyl diphosphate, and CldD/RmnD generated labda-8(17),12(E),14-triene (5). CldC introduced two oxygen atoms at C-7 and C-8,17 to generate 4, while RmnC hydroxylated 5 at C-7 to generate 7. The heterologous expression of the cld cluster suggested that four gene products catalyzed to generate 4, but not 1. The deletion mutant of the gene encoding the mycothiol (MSH)-S-conjugate amidase (mca) of S. avermitilis SUKA22 carrying the cld cluster failed to produce 1, but accumulated 4 in the mycelia, whereas S. avermitilis SUKA22 and its mca-deletion mutant carrying the cld cluster both produced the MSH-S-conjugate of 4. The intermediate 4 was converted into the MSH-S-conjugate with MSH, which was achieved through a non-enzymatic nucleophilic reaction. The MSH-S-conjugate of 4 generated was further hydrolyzed to generate the mercapturic acid derivative, 1, by MSH-S-conjugate amidase and 1 was excreted from the mycelia.	1
Title: Insights into the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone ansamycins geldanamycin and herbimycin, obtained by gene sequencing and disruption Abstract: Geldanamycin and the closely related herbimycins A, B, and C were the first benzoquinone ansamycins to be extensively studied for their antitumor properties as small-molecule inhibitors of the Hsp90 protein chaperone complex. These compounds are produced by two different Streptomyces hygroscopicus strains and have the same modular polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived carbon skeleton but different substitution patterns at C-11, C-15, and C-17. To set the stage for structural modification by genetic engineering, we previously identified the gene cluster responsible for geldanamycin biosynthesis. We have now cloned and sequenced a 115-kb segment of the herbimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. hygroscopicus AM 3672, including the genes for the PKS and most of the post-PKS tailoring enzymes. The similarities and differences between the gene clusters and biosynthetic pathways for these closely related ansamycins are interpreted with support from the results of gene inactivation experiments. In addition, the organization and functions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) starter unit and the post-PKS modifications of progeldanamycin were assessed by inactivating the subclusters of AHBA biosynthetic genes and two oxygenase genes (gdmM and gdmL) that were proposed to be involved in formation of the geldanamycin benzoquinoid system. A resulting novel geldanamycin analog, KOS-1806, was isolated and characterized.	1
Title: Identification of the decumbenone biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium decumbens and the importance for production of calbistrin Abstract: Background:                       Filamentous fungi are important producers of secondary metabolites, low molecular weight molecules that often have bioactive properties. Calbistrin A is a secondary metabolite with an interesting structure that was recently found to have bioactivity against leukemia cells. It consists of two polyketides linked by an ester bond: a bicyclic decalin containing polyketide with structural similarities to lovastatin, and a linear 12 carbon dioic acid structure. Calbistrin A is known to be produced by several uniseriate black Aspergilli, Aspergillus versicolor-related species, and Penicillia. Penicillium decumbens produces calbistrin A and B as well as several putative intermediates of the calbistrin pathway, such as decumbenone A-B and versiol.                  Results:                       A comparative genomics study focused on the polyketide synthase (PKS) sets found in three full genome sequence calbistrin producing fungal species, P. decumbens, A. aculeatus and A. versicolor, resulted in the identification of a novel, putative 13-membered calbistrin producing gene cluster (calA to calM). Implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in P. decumbens allowed the targeted deletion of genes encoding a polyketide synthase (calA), a major facilitator pump (calB) and a binuclear zinc cluster transcription factor (calC). Detailed metabolic profiling, using UHPLC-MS, of the ∆calA (PKS) and ∆calC (TF) strains confirmed the suspected involvement in calbistrin productions as neither strains produced calbistrin nor any of the putative intermediates in the pathway. Similarly analysis of the excreted metabolites in the ∆calB (MFC-pump) strain showed that the encoded pump was required for efficient export of calbistrin A and B.                  Conclusion:                       Here we report the discovery of a gene cluster (calA-M) involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide calbistrin in P. decumbens. Targeted gene deletions proved the involvement of CalA (polyketide synthase) in the biosynthesis of calbistrin, CalB (major facilitator pump) for the export of calbistrin A and B and CalC for the transcriptional regulation of the cal-cluster. This study lays the foundation for further characterization of the calbistrin biosynthetic pathway in multiple species and the development of an efficient calbistrin producing cell factory.	1
Title: Regulation of immunity to the two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, by the transcriptional repressor LtnR Abstract: Lacticin 3147 is a membrane-active, two-component lantibiotic produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis DPC3147. In this study, the promoters of the lacticin 3147 gene cluster were mapped to the intergenic region between ltnR and ltnA1 (the genes encoding the regulatory protein LtnR and the first structural gene, LtnA1), and Northern analyses revealed that the biosynthetic and immunity genes are divergently transcribed in two operons, ltnA1A2M1TM2D and ltnRIFE respectively. Although the promoter controlling biosynthesis (Pbac) appears to be constitutive, characterization of a downstream beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) fusion beyond an intragenic stem-loop structure in ltnM1 confirmed that this putative transcriptional attenuator allows limited readthrough to the downstream biosynthetic genes, thus maintaining the correct stoichiometry between structural peptides and biosynthetic machinery. The promoter of the ltnRIFE operon (Pimm) was shown to be regulated by the transcriptional repressor LtnR. A mutant with a truncated ltnR gene exhibited a hyperimmune phenotype, whereas overexpression of ltnR resulted in cells with increased sensitivity to lacticin 3147. Gel mobility shift analysis indicated that LtnR binds to the Pimm promoter region, and fusion of this promoter to the beta-gal gene of pAK80 revealed that expression from Pimm is significantly reduced in the presence of LtnR. Thus, we have demonstrated that lacticin 3147 uses a regulatory mechanism not previously identified in lantibiotic systems.	1
Title: Tandemly duplicated acyl carrier proteins, which increase polyketide antibiotic production, can apparently function either in parallel or in series Abstract: Polyketide biosynthesis involves the addition of subunits commonly derived from malonate or methylmalonate to a starter unit such as acetate. Type I polyketide synthases are multifunctional polypeptides that contain one or more modules, each of which normally contains all the enzymatic domains for a single round of extension and modification of the polyketide backbone. Acyl carrier proteins (ACP(s)) hold the extender unit to which the starter or growing chain is added. Normally there is one ACP for each ketosynthase module. However, there are an increasing number of known examples of tandemly repeated ACP domains, whose function is as yet unknown. For the doublet and triplet ACP domains in the biosynthetic pathway for the antibiotic mupirocin from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB10586 we have inactivated ACP domains by inframe deletion and amino acid substitution of the active site serine. By deletion analysis each individual ACP from a cluster can provide a basic but reduced activity for the pathway. In the doublet cluster, substitution analysis indicates that the pathway may follow two parallel routes, one via each of the ACPs, thus increasing overall pathway flow. In the triplet cluster, substitution in ACP5 blocked the pathway. Thus ACP5 appears to be arranged "in series" to ACP6 and ACP7. Thus although both the doublet and triplet clusters increase antibiotic production, the mechanisms by which they do this appear to be different and depend specifically on the biosynthetic stage involved. The function of some ACPs may be determined by their location in the protein rather than absolute enzymic activity.	1
Title: Regulatory mutations affecting the gluconate system in Escherichia coli Abstract: A spontaneously arising regulatory mutant of the gluconate system in Escherichia coli was isolated. This mutant became constitutive, probably in one step, for gluconate high-affinity transport, gluconokinase, and gluconate-6-P dehydrase. The mutation involved (gntR18) is cotransducible with asd. Pseudorevertants, derived from a mutant (M2) that shows a long lag for growth on gluconate mineral medium, were also isolated and characterized. They give constitutive levels of gluconokinase and gluconate-6-P dehydrase but lack high-affinity transport function. Genetic experiments performed with one of these pseudorevertants (M4) indicate that it carries a secondary mutation in the gntR gene. The M4 phenotype is thus the result of the interaction of expression of a constitutive mutation (gntR4) with the mutation of strain M2 (gntM2).	0
Title: Methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide production from the terminal methiol group of methionine by anaerobic lake sediments Abstract: A significant portion of the sulfide in lake sediments may be derived from sulfur-containing amino acids. Methionine degradation in Lake Mendota (Wisconsin) sediments was studied with gas chromatographic and radiotracer techniques. Temperature optimum and inhibitor studies showed that this process was biological. Methane thiol and dimethyl sulfide were produced in sediments when 1-mumol/ml unlabeled methionine was added. When chloroform (an inhibitor of one-carbon metabolism) was added to the sediments, methane thiol, carbon disulfide, and n-propane thiol were produced, even when no methionine was added. When S-labeled methionine was added to the sediments in tracer quantities (1.75 nmol/ml), labeled hydrogen sulfide was produced, and a roughly equal amount of label was incorporated into insoluble material. Methane and carbon dioxide were produced from [methyl-C]methionine. Evidence is given favoring methane thiol as an intermediate in the formation of methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide from the terminal methiol group of methionine. Methionine may be an important source of sulfide in lake sediments.	0
Title: Phagocytosis of Escherichia coli biofilm cells with different aspect ratios: a role of substratum material stiffness Abstract: Bacterial biofilms play an important role in chronic infections due to high-level tolerance to antibiotics. Thus, it is important to eradicate bacterial cells that are attached to implanted medical devices of different materials. Phagocytosis is a key process of the innate immunity to eliminate invading pathogens. Previous research demonstrated that the efficiency of phagocytosis is affected by the aspect ratio of polymer beads. Recently, we reported that the stiffness of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) influences Escherichia coli biofilm formation and the biofilm cells on stiff (5:1) PDMS are 46.2% shorter than those on soft (40:1) PDMS. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that E. coli cells attached on stiff PDMS can be more effectively removed via phagocytosis. This hypothesis was tested in the present study using viability assays, flow cytometry, and cell tracking. The results revealed that shorter E. coli cells detached from stiff PDMS were easier to be phagocytized than the longer cells from soft PDMS surfaces. Furthermore, macrophage cells were found to be more motile on stiff PDMS surfaces and more effective at phagocytosis of E. coli cells attached on these surfaces. These results may help the design of better biomaterials to reduce fouling and associated infections.	0
Title: Five additional genes are involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: An approximately 12.5-kbp region of DNA sequence from beyond the end of the previously described clavulanic acid gene cluster was analyzed and found to encode nine possible open reading frames (ORFs). Involvement of these ORFs in clavulanic acid biosynthesis was assessed by creating mutants with defects in each of the ORFs. orf12 and orf14 had been previously reported to be involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Now five additional ORFs are shown to play a role, since their mutation results in a significant decrease or total absence of clavulanic acid production. Most of these newly described ORFs encode proteins with little similarity to others in the databases, and so their roles in clavulanic acid biosynthesis are unclear. Mutation of two of the ORFs, orf15 and orf16, results in the accumulation of a new metabolite, N-acetylglycylclavaminic acid, in place of clavulanic acid. orf18 and orf19 encode apparent penicillin binding proteins, and while mutations in these genes have minimal effects on clavulanic acid production, their normal roles as cell wall biosynthetic enzymes and as targets for beta-lactam antibiotics, together with their clustered location, suggest that they are part of the clavulanic acid gene cluster.	1
Title: Identification and heterologous expression of the kocurin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The antibiotically bioactive thiopeptide compound kocurin was identified in extracts from a newly isolated Kocuria rosea strain. The axenic strain was retrieved from a soil sample of the intertidal area at the Paracas National Park, Peru. The genetic basis of this promising natural product with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains was revealed by comparative genome analysis of this new isolate and other reported thiopeptide producer strains. The functionality of the predicted gene locus was experimentally proven by heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. Expression of the gene cluster under the control of a constitutive promoter enabled the transgenic strain to produce kocurin in selected media. The kocurin biosynthetic gene cluster comprises nine open reading frames and spans around 12 kbp of the genome.	1
Title: Total Biosynthesis of Antiangiogenic Agent (-)-Terpestacin by Artificial Reconstitution of the Biosynthetic Machinery in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: The total biosynthesis of (-)-terpestacin was achieved by heterologous expression of four biosynthetic enzyme genes ( tpcA- D) in Aspergillus oryzae. After construction of preterpestacin I by the action of bifunctional terpene synthase (TpcA), two cytochrome P450s (TpcBC) activate inert C-H bond to install three hydroxyl groups on the A-ring in stereo- and regioselective manners. Subsequently, a flavin-dependent oxidase (TpcD) catalyzes oxidation of the vicinal diol moiety to give a α-diketone, which undergoes an enolization to furnish terpestacin. The successful synthesis of structurally elaborated terpestacin showed that a reconstitution approach that harnesses several biosynthetic enzyme genes in A. oryzae could be a promising alternative to the current chemical synthesis of natural terpenoids.	1
Title: A caged, destabilized, free radical intermediate in the q-cycle Abstract: The Rieske/cytochrome b complexes, also known as cytochrome bc complexes, catalyze a unique oxidant-induced reduction reaction at their quinol oxidase (Qo ) sites, in which substrate hydroquinone reduces two distinct electron transfer chains, one through a series of high-potential electron carriers, the second through low-potential cytochrome b. This reaction is a critical step in energy storage by the Q-cycle. The semiquinone intermediate in this reaction can reduce O2 to produce deleterious superoxide. It is yet unknown how the enzyme controls this reaction, though numerous models have been proposed. In previous work, we trapped a Q-cycle semiquinone anion intermediate, termed SQo , in bacterial cytochrome bc1 by rapid freeze-quenching. In this work, we apply pulsed-EPR techniques to determine the location and properties of SQo in the mitochondrial complex. In contrast to semiquinone intermediates in other enzymes, SQo is not thermodynamically stabilized, and can even be destabilized with respect to solution. It is trapped in Qo at a site that is distinct from previously described inhibitor-binding sites, yet sufficiently close to cytochrome bL to allow rapid electron transfer. The binding site and EPR analyses show that SQo is not stabilized by hydrogen bonds to proteins. The formation of SQo involves "stripping" of both substrate -OH protons during the initial oxidation step, as well as conformational changes of the semiquinone and Qo proteins. The resulting charged radical is kinetically trapped, rather than thermodynamically stabilized (as in most enzymatic semiquinone species), conserving redox energy to drive electron transfer to cytochrome bL while minimizing certain Q-cycle bypass reactions, including oxidation of prereduced cytochrome b and reduction of O2 .	0
Title: In vitro rescue of genital strains of Chlamydia trachomatis from interferon-γ and tryptophan depletion with indole-positive, but not indole-negative Prevotella spp Abstract: Background:                       The natural course of sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis varies between individuals. In addition to parasite and host effects, the vaginal microbiota might play a key role in the outcome of C. trachomatis infections. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), known for its anti-chlamydial properties, activates the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in epithelial cells, an enzyme that catabolizes the amino acid L- tryptophan into N-formylkynurenine, depleting the host cell's pool of tryptophan. Although C. trachomatis is a tryptophan auxotroph, urogenital strains (but not ocular strains) have been shown in vitro to have the ability to produce tryptophan from indole using the tryptophan synthase (trpBA) gene. It has been suggested that indole producing bacteria from the vaginal microbiota could influence the outcome of Chlamydia infection.                  Results:                       We used two in vitro models (treatment with IFN-γ or direct limitation of tryptophan), to study the effects of direct rescue by the addition of exogenous indole, or by the addition of culture supernatant from indole-positive versus indole-negative Prevotella strains, on the growth and infectivity of C. trachomatis. We found that only supernatants from the indole-positive strains, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens, were able to rescue tryptophan-starved C. trachomatis. In addition, we analyzed vaginal secretion samples to determine physiological indole concentrations. In spite of the complexity of vaginal secretions, we demonstrated that for some vaginal specimens with higher indole levels, there was a link to higher recovery of the Chlamydia under tryptophan-starved conditions, lending preliminary support to the critical role of the IFN-γ-tryptophan-indole axis in vivo.                  Conclusions:                       Our data provide evidence for the ability of both exogenous indole as well as supernatant from indole producing bacteria such as Prevotella, to rescue genital C. trachomatis from tryptophan starvation. This adds weight to the hypothesis that the vaginal microbiota (particularly from women with lower levels of lactobacilli and higher levels of indole producing anaerobes) may be intrinsically linked to the outcome of chlamydial infections in some women.	0
Title: Species-specific secondary metabolite production in marine actinomycetes of the genus Salinispora Abstract: Here we report associations between secondary metabolite production and phylogenetically distinct but closely related marine actinomycete species belonging to the genus Salinispora. The pattern emerged in a study that included global collection sites, and it indicates that secondary metabolite production can be a species-specific, phenotypic trait associated with broadly distributed bacterial populations. Associations between actinomycete phylotype and chemotype revealed an effective, diversity-based approach to natural product discovery that contradicts the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolite production is strain specific. The structural diversity of the metabolites observed, coupled with gene probing and phylogenetic analyses, implicates lateral gene transfer as a source of the biosynthetic genes responsible for compound production. These results conform to a model of selection-driven pathway fixation occurring subsequent to gene acquisition and provide a rare example in which demonstrable physiological traits have been correlated to the fine-scale phylogenetic architecture of an environmental bacterial community.	1
Title: A tyrosine O-prenyltransferase catalyses the first pathway-specific step in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL Abstract: A putative prenyltransferase gene sirD has been identified in the gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin sirodesmin PL in Leptosphaeria maculans. The gene product was found to comprise 449 aa, with a molecular mass of 51 kDa. In this study, the coding region of sirD was amplified by PCR from cDNA, cloned into pQE70, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The overproduced protein was purified to apparent homogeneity, and characterized biochemically. The dimeric recombinant SirD was found to catalyse the O-prenylation of L-Tyr in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate; this was demonstrated unequivocally by isolation and structural elucidation of the enzymic product. Therefore, SirD catalyses the first pathway-specific step in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL. K(m) values for L-Tyr and dimethylallyl diphosphate were determined as 0.13 and 0.17 mM, respectively. Interestingly, SirD was found to share significant sequence similarity with indole prenyltransferases, which catalyse prenyl transfer reactions onto different positions of indole rings. In contrast to indole prenyltransferases, which accept indole derivatives, but not Tyr or structures derived thereof, as substrates, SirD also prenylated L-Trp, resulting in the formation of 7-dimethylallyltryptophan. A K(m) value of 0.23 mM was determined for L-Trp. Turnover numbers of 1.0 and 0.06 S(-1) were calculated for L-Tyr and L-Trp, respectively.	1
Title: A kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu species reverses streptomycin dependence of Escherichia coli strains mutated in ribosomal protein S12 Abstract: Streptomycin dependence can be caused by mutations in ribosomal protein S12. Mutations suppressing such streptomycin dependence have been found in ribosomal proteins S4 and S5, and in 16S rRNA. Here a new suppressor mutation localized in elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is described, consistent with recent models of ribosome-EF-Tu-tRNA interaction at the decoding centre. The EF-Tu mutation was obtained by genetic selection for streptomycin independence; it was identified as Ala375 --> Thr, previously described as EF-TuA(R) and known to confer a kirromycin-resistant, error-prone phenotype. Also, other streptomycin-dependent (SmD) S12 mutations could be complemented by this mutation. The streptomycin-independent (Sm1) strain grows more slowly than the wild-type (wt), suggesting that not all the defects of the S12 mutation can be complemented by EF-Tu[A375T]. Moreover, this strain is more susceptible than wt to reduction in the cellular EF-Tu concentration, and disruption of tufB led to considerable growth-rate impairment. Expression of EF-Tu from tufB, not only of wt EF-Tu and EF-Tu[A375T] but, remarkably, also of EF-Tu[G222D], known as EF-TuB0 and defective in protein synthesis, equally contributed to cell growth. In vitro analysis revealed a decreased translational activity of wt EF-Tu with SmD ribosomes as compared to EF-Tu[A375T], while EF-Tu[G222D] showed no activity at all, just as with wt ribosomes. Possible mechanisms are discussed for the improved growth rate observed in such Sm1 strains when they include wt EF-Tu or EF-Tu[G222D].	0
Title: A Potent, Selective CBX2 Chromodomain Ligand and Its Cellular Activity During Prostate Cancer Neuroendocrine Differentiation Abstract: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that facilitate both embryonic development and cancer progression. PcG proteins form Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone mark recognized by the N-terminal chromodomain (ChD) of the CBX subunit of canonical PRC1. There are five PcG CBX paralogs in humans. CBX2 in particular is upregulated in a variety of cancers, particularly in advanced prostate cancers. Using CBX2 inhibitors to understand and target CBX2 in prostate cancer is highly desirable; however, high structural similarity among the CBX ChDs has been challenging for developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here, we utilize selections of focused DNA encoded libraries (DELs) for the discovery of a selective CBX2 chromodomain probe, SW2_152F. SW2_152F binds to CBX2 ChD with a Kd of 80 nM and displays 24-1000-fold selectivity for CBX2 ChD over other CBX paralogs in vitro. SW2_152F is cell permeable, selectively inhibits CBX2 chromatin binding in cells, and blocks neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgen deprivation.	0
Title: Genes involved in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide methanolan by the obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus sp strain 12S Abstract: Methylobacillus sp. strain 12S produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS), methanolan, composed of glucose, mannose and galactose. Twenty-four ORFs flanking a Tn5 insertion site in an EPS-deficient mutant were identified, and 21 genes (epsCBAKLDEFGHIJMNOPQRSTU) were predicted to participate in methanolan synthesis on the basis of the features of the primary sequence. Gene disruption analyses revealed that epsABCEFGIJNOP and epsR are required for methanolan synthesis, whereas epsKD and epsH are not essential. EpsFG and EpsE showed homology with Wzc (chain length regulator) and Wza (export protein) of group 1 capsule-producing Escherichia coli, suggesting that methanolan was synthesized via a Wzy-like biosynthesis system. This possibility was supported by the fact that the putative hydropathy profiles of EpsH and EpsM were similar to those of Wzx and Wzy, which are also involved in the flipping of the repeating unit in the cytoplasmic membrane and the polymerization of the capsule in the Wzy-dependent system. EpsBJNOP and EpsR are probably glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the repeating unit onto the lipid carrier. In particular, EpsB appeared to catalyse the initial transfer of the glucose moiety. On the basis of their predicted location in the cells, it is proposed that EpsI and EpsL are involved in methanolan export to the cell surface. E. coli strains expressing EpsQ, EpsS and EpsT showed enhanced activities of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, respectively, revealing that they were responsible for the production of the activated compositional sugars of methanolan. EpsU contains a conserved a lytic transglycosylase motif, indicating that it could participate in the degradation of polysaccharides. EpsA and EpsK, which have conserved DNA-binding and cAMP-binding motifs, respectively, were deduced to be transcriptional regulators. In particular, EpsA seems to positively regulate the transcription of methanolan synthesis genes, since the constitutive expression of epsA in strain 12S increased the EPS production. Interestingly, EpsD showed homology with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases that catalyse the folding of proteins following translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane.	1
Title: Quantification of real-time Salmonella effector type III secretion kinetics reveals differential secretion rates for SopE2 and SptP Abstract: Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella utilize the type III secretion system to inject bacterial effector proteins into a host cell. Upon entry, these effectors bind mammalian cell proteins, hijack cellular signaling pathways, and redirect cellular function, thus enabling bacterial infection. In this study we use the FlAsH/tetracysteine labeling system to fluorescently tag specific effectors in Salmonella to observe real-time secretion of these proteins into a mammalian host cell. The tetracysteine tag is genomically incorporated, thus preserving endogenous control of bacterial effectors. We demonstrate that two effectors, SopE2 and SptP, exhibit different secretion kinetics, as well as different rates of degradation within the host cell. These proteins respectively activate and suppress GTPase Cdc42, suggesting that there is a temporal hierarchy for effector delivery and persistence within the cell that is directly related to effector function.	0
Title: A highly unusual polyketide synthase directs dawenol polyene biosynthesis in Stigmatella aurantiaca Abstract: Enormous progress in the field of polyketide biosynthesis has led to the establishment of rules for general text book biosynthetic logic and consequently to the assumption that biosynthetic genes can be easily correlated with the corresponding natural products. However, non-textbook examples of polyketide assembly continue to be discovered suggesting the gene to product and product to gene predictions need improvement, especially as they are increasingly used in the post-genomic era. Here, we analyzed the genomic blueprint of a myxobacterial multi-producer of secondary metabolites, Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, for its biosynthetic potential by genome-mining. In addition to the five polyketide synthase and/or nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of known function we identified a further 13 genomic regions exemplifying the enormous genetic potential for the production of additional chemical diversity by this strain. We show by gene inactivation and heterologous expression of the newly identified biosynthetic pathway for dawenol that the biosynthesis of this known polyene does not follow text book biosynthetic logic. Intriguingly, a genomic locus encoding an unusual polyketide synthase exhibiting similarity to gene loci involved in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and secondary lipids was identified.	1
Title: Fusaoctaxin A, an Example of a Two-Step Mechanism for Non-Ribosomal Peptide Assembly and Maturation in Fungi Abstract: Fungal non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters are spread across the chromosomes, where several modifying enzyme-encoding genes typically flank one NRPS. However, a recent study showed that the octapeptide fusaoctaxin A is tandemly synthesized by two NRPSs in Fusarium graminearum. Here, we illuminate parts of the biosynthetic route of fusaoctaxin A, which is cleaved into the tripeptide fusatrixin A and the pentapeptide fusapentaxin A during transport by a cluster-specific ABC transporter with peptidase activity. Further, we deleted the histone H3K27 methyltransferase kmt6, which induced the production of fusaoctaxin A.	1
Title: Detection and sequence of plus-strand leader RNA of sonchus yellow net virus, a plant rhabdovirus Abstract: Tobacco infected with the plant rhabdovirus sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV) contains short, 139- to 144-nucleotide (nt) transcripts complementary to the 3' terminus of the negative-strand genomic RNA. These transcripts are similar to the leader RNAs associated with several animal rhabdovirus infections in that they are encoded by the same region of the genome, but the SYNV transcripts are nearly 3 times longer than the animal rhabdovirus leader RNAs. The SYNV leader RNAs differ markedly in sequence from the leader RNAs associated with strains of vesicular stomatitis virus and rabies virus, although the first 30 nt of all three transcripts are rich in adenylate residues. The nucleotide sequence determined directly from SYNV RNA and from recombinant DNA clones derived from SYNV RNA reveals a possible initiation site for transcription of the N-protein mRNA that is located 147 nt from the 3' end of genomic RNA. The sequence (UUGU) at this site is complementary to the first 4 nt of the N-protein mRNAs of animal rhabdoviruses. In SYNV, the first AUG codon in the putative N-protein mRNA is located 57 nt downstream (at positions 203-205 in the viral genome) and is followed by an open reading frame for the remainder of the 1020 nt determined in these experiments.	0
Title: Conditionally positive effect of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator AtrA on streptomycin production by Streptomyces griseus Abstract: AtrA, a transcriptional activator for actII-ORF4, encoding the pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), has been shown to bind the region upstream from the promoter of strR, encoding the pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the streptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus [Uguru et al. (2005) Mol Microbiol 58, 131-150]. The atrA orthologue (atrA-g) in S. griseus was constitutively transcribed throughout growth from a promoter located about 250 nt upstream of the translational start codon, as determined by S1 nuclease mapping. DNase I footprinting showed that histidine-tagged AtrA-g bound an inverted repeat located upstream of strR at positions -117 to -142 relative to the transcriptional start point of strR as +1. This AtrA-g-binding site was between two AdpA-binding sites at approximately nucleotide positions -270 and -50. AdpA is a central transcriptional activator in the A-factor regulatory cascade and essential for the transcription of strR. AtrA-g and AdpA simultaneously bound the respective binding sites. In contrast to AdpA, AtrA-g was non-essential for strR transcription; an atrA-g-disrupted strain produced streptomycin on routine agar media to the same extent as the wild-type strain. However, the atrA-g-disrupted strain tended to produce a smaller amount of streptomycin than the wild-type strain under some conditions, for example, on Bennett agar containing 1 % maltose and on a minimal medium. Therefore, AtrA-g had a conditionally positive effect on streptomycin production, as a tuner, probably by enhancing the AdpA-dependent transcriptional activation of strR in a still unknown manner.	1
Title: Identification of the mokH gene encoding transcription factor for the upregulation of monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus. The monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster, mokA-mokI, has been characterized in Monascus pilosus. The mokH gene encoding Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear DNA binding protein is assumed to be an activator for monacolin K production. In this study, the mokH gene was cloned and driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter for overexpression in M. pilosus. The transformants containing an extra copy of the mokH gene were obtained and verified by PCR and Southern hybridization. The transcripts of mokH in the transformants were expressed significantly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The transformants were stably inherited through the next generation, as determined by observation of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The transformant T-mokH1 also showed a 1.7-fold higher production of monacolin K than the wild-type strain in a time course analysis. Analysis of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the monacolin K biosynthetic genes in the transformant were expressed to a greater extent than those in the wild-type strain. These results indicated that mokH upregulated the transcription of monacolin K biosynthetic genes and increased monacolin K production.	1
Title: Mechanism-based tuning of a LOV domain photoreceptor Abstract: Phototropin-like LOV domains form a cysteinyl-flavin adduct in response to blue light but show considerable variation in output signal and the lifetime of the photo-adduct signaling state. Mechanistic studies of the slow-cycling fungal LOV photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) reveal the importance of reactive cysteine conformation, flavin electronic environment and solvent accessibility for adduct scission and thermal reversion. Proton inventory, pH effects, base catalysis and structural studies implicate flavin N(5) deprotonation as rate-determining for recovery. Substitutions of active site residues Ile74, Ile85, Met135 and Met165 alter photoadduct lifetimes by over four orders of magnitude in VVD, and similar changes in other LOV proteins show analogous effects. Adduct state decay rates also correlate with changes in conformational and oligomeric properties of the protein necessary for signaling. These findings link natural sequence variation of LOV domains to function and provide a means to design broadly reactive light-sensitive probes.	0
Title: Spongiimicrobium salis gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from a marine sponge Abstract: A Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, pale-yellow pigmented, rod-shaped, chemoheterotrophic bacterium, designated A6F-11(T), was isolated from a marine sponge collected in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the novel marine strain was affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes and that it shared the highest (92.9 %) sequence similarity with Arenibacter palladensis LMG 21972(T). The strain could be differentiated phenotypically from related members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. The major fatty acids of strain A6F-11(T) were iso-C15:1 G, iso-C15:0, C16:1 ω6c and/or C16:1 ω7c and iso-C17:0 3-OH. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content was 34.7 mol%, and the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone 6 (MK-6). From the distinct phylogenetic position and combination of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, the strain is considered to represent a novel taxon in the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Spongiimicrobium salis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. salis gen. nov., sp. nov. is A6F-11(T) (= KCTC 42753(T) = NBRC 111401(T)).	0
Title: Biosynthesis of sulfated glycopeptide antibiotics by using the sulfotransferase StaL Abstract: The unique glycopeptide antibiotic A47934, produced by Streptomyces toyocaensis, possesses a nonglycosylated heptapeptide core that is sulfated on the phenolic hydroxyl of the N-terminal 4-hydroxy-L-phenylglycine residue. Genetic and biochemical experiments confirmed that StaL is a sulfotransferase capable of sulfating the predicted crosslinked heptapeptide substrate to produce A47934 both in vivo and in vitro. Incubation of purified His(6)-StaL with various substrates in vitro revealed substrate specificity and yielded two sulfo-glycopeptide antibiotics: sulfo-teicoplanin aglycone and sulfo-teicoplanin. Quantification of the antibacterial activity of desulfo-A47934, A47934, teicoplanin, and sulfo-teicoplanin demonstrated that sulfation slightly increased the minimum inhibitory concentration. This unique modification by sulfation expands glycopeptide diversity with potential application for the development of new antibiotics.	1
Title: Cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of the gene cluster required for gougerotin biosynthesis Abstract: Gougerotin, a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic, possesses antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, antimycoplasma, anthelmintic, and acaricidal activities. Here, we report the cloning of a complete gougerotin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces graminearus and heterologous production of gougerotin in Streptomyces coelicolor. Sequence analysis of a 28.7 kb DNA fragment indicated that the cluster consists of 25 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene disruption and genetic complementation experiments revealed that 15 of the 25 ORFs are required for gougerotin biosynthesis. A gougerotin biosynthetic pathway was proposed based on the analyses of bioinformatics and intermediates accumulated in selected gene inactivation mutants. These studies substantially promoted our understanding of gougerotin biosynthesis and provide "building blocks" for combinatorial biosynthesis using genes encoding different enzymes in nucleoside antibiotics.	1
Title: AvaR2, a pseudo γ-butyrolactone receptor homologue from Streptomyces avermitilis, is a pleiotropic repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth Abstract: Avermectins produced by Streptomyces avermitilis are effective anthelmintic agents. The autoregulatory signalling molecule that triggers avermectin biosynthesis is a novel butenolide-type molecule, avenolide, rather than common γ-butyrolactones (GBLs). We identified AvaR2, a pseudo GBL receptor homologue, as an important repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth. AvaR2 directly repressed transcription of aveR (the ave cluster-situated activator gene), aco (a key gene for avenolide biosynthesis), its own gene (avaR2) and two other GBL receptor homologous genes (avaR1 and avaR3) by binding to their promoter regions. The aveR promoter had the highest affinity for AvaR2. A consensus 18 bp ARE (autoregulatory element)-like sequence was found in the AvaR2-binding regions of these five target genes. Eleven novel AvaR2 targets were identified, including genes involved in primary metabolism, ribosomal protein synthesis, and stress responses. AvaR2 bound and responded to endogenous avenolide and exogenous antibiotics jadomycin B (JadB) and aminoglycosides to modulate its DNA-binding activity. Our findings help to clarify the roles of pseudo GBL receptors as pleiotropic regulators and as receptors for new type autoregulator and exogenous antibiotic signal. A pseudo GBL receptor-mediated antibiotic signalling transduction system may be a common strategy that facilitates Streptomyces interspecies communication and survival in complex environments.	0
Title: Chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycoproteins for deciphering functions Abstract: Glycoproteins are an important class of biomolecules involved in a number of biological recognition processes. However, natural and recombinant glycoproteins are usually produced as mixtures of glycoforms that differ in the structures of the pendent glycans, which are difficult to separate in pure glycoforms. As a result, synthetic homogeneous glycopeptides and glycoproteins have become indispensable probes for detailed structural and functional studies. A number of elegant chemical and biological strategies have been developed for synthetic construction of tailor-made, full-size glycoproteins to address specific biological problems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous glycoproteins. Selected examples are given to demonstrate the applications of tailor-made, glycan-defined glycoproteins for deciphering glycosylation functions.	0
Title: O-antigen polymerase adopts a distributive mechanism for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis Abstract: Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential cell envelope component for gram-negative bacteria. As the most variable region of LPS, O antigens serve as important virulence determinants for many bacteria and represent a promising carbohydrate source for glycoconjugate vaccines. In the Wzy-dependent O-antigen biosynthetic pathway, the integral membrane protein Wzy was shown to be the sole enzyme responsible for polymerization of O-repeat unit. Its catalytic mechanism, however, remains elusive. Herein, Wzy was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal His10-tag. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) revealed that the Wzy protein exists in its native confirmation as a dimer. Subsequently, we chemo-enzymatically synthesized the substrates of Wzy, the lipid-PP-linked repeat units. Together with an optimized O-antigen visualization method, we monitored the production of reaction intermediates at varying times. We present here our result as the first biochemical evidence that Wzy functions in a distributive manner.	0
Title: Production of actinorhodin-related "blue pigments" by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: The genetically well-known strain Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) produces the pH indicator (red/blue) antibiotic actinorhodin, but not all the "blue pigment" produced by this strain is actinorhodin. When the organism was subjected to various nutrient limitations (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, or trace elements), and also during growth cessation caused by a relatively low medium pH, blue pigment production was initiated but the pigment and its location varied. At pH 4.5 to 5.5, significant formation of actinorhodin occurred and was located exclusively intracellularly. At pH 6.0 to 7.5 a different blue pigment was produced intracellularly as well as extracellularly. It was purified and identified as gamma-actinorhodin (the lactone form of actinorhodin). Analysis of act mutants of S. coelicolor A3(2) confirmed that both pigments are derived from the act biosynthetic pathway. Mutants with lesions in actII-ORF2, actII-ORF3, or actVA-ORF1, previously implicated or suggested to be involved in actinorhodin export, were impaired in production of gamma-actinorhodin, suggesting that synthesis of gamma-actinorhodin from actinorhodin is coupled to its export from the cell. However, effects on the level of actinorhodin production were also found in some mutants.	1
Title: Intraspecies comparison of Streptomyces pratensis genomes reveals high levels of recombination and gene conservation between strains of disparate geographic origin Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces are widespread bacteria that contribute to the terrestrial carbon cycle and produce the majority of clinically useful antibiotics. While interspecific genomic diversity has been investigated among Streptomyces, information is lacking on intraspecific genomic diversity. Streptomyces pratensis has high rates of homologous recombination but the impact of such gene exchange on genome evolution and the evolution of natural product gene clusters remains uncharacterized.                  Results:                       We report draft genome sequences of four S. pratensis strains and compare to the complete genome of Streptomyces flavogriseus IAF-45-CD (=ATCC 33331), a strain recently reclassified to S. pratensis. Despite disparate geographic origins, the genomes are highly similar with 85.9% of genes present in the core genome and conservation of all natural product gene clusters. Natural products include a novel combination of carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor gene clusters. While high intraspecies recombination rates abolish the phylogenetic signal across the genome, intraspecies recombination is suppressed in two genomic regions. The first region is centered on an insertion/deletion polymorphism and the second on a hybrid NRPS-PKS gene. Finally, two gene families accounted for over 25% of the divergent genes in the core genome. The first includes homologs of bldB (required for spore development and antibiotic production) while the second includes homologs of an uncharacterized protein with a helix-turn-helix motif (hpb). Genes from these families co-occur with fifteen pairs spread across the genome. These genes have evidence for co-evolution of co-localized pairs, supporting previous assertions that these genes may function akin to a toxin-antitoxin system.                  Conclusions:                       S. pratensis genomes are highly similar with exceptional levels of recombination which erase phylogenetic signal among strains of the species. This species has a large core genome and variable terminal regions that are smaller than those found in interspecies comparisons. There is no geographic differentiation between these strains, but there is evidence for local linkage disequilibrium affecting two genomic regions. We have also shown further observational evidence that the DUF397-HTH (bldB and hpb) are a novel toxin-antitoxin pair.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the genes encoding nonspecific electron transport components for a cytochrome P450 system of Saccharopolyspora erythraea involved in erythromycin production Abstract: The forA gene encoding a protein that can function as a NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (For) has been cloned from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the erythromycin A (ErA) producer. In a previous study For protein, together with the FdxA ferredoxin from the same organism, was shown to be able to reconstitute the cytochrome P450 system responsible for the hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, an intermediate of ErA biosynthesis. Nucleotide sequence data suggest that the cloned forA gene codes for For, the putative pyruvate dehydrogenase component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, or its close homolog. Overexpression of forA appeared to be toxic to Escherichia coli.	1
Title: Measurement and characterization of postischemic free radical generation in the isolated perfused heart Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has been applied to measure radical generation in the postischemic heart; however, there is controversy regarding the methods used and the conclusion as to whether radicals are generated. In order to resolve this controversy, direct and spin trapping measurements of the time course and mechanisms of radical generation were performed in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. In reperfused tissue, 3 prominent radical signals are observed: A, isotropic g = 2.004 suggestive of a semiquinone; B, anisotropic g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005 suggestive of ROO.; and C, a triplet g = 2.000 and aN = 24 G suggestive of a nitrogen centered radical. B and C, however, are highly labile and disappear at temperatures probably encountered in some previous studies. In normally perfused hearts, A is observed with only small amounts of B and C. During ischemia, B and C increase reaching a maximum after 45 min while A decreases. On reflow with oxygenated perfusate all 3 signals increase. With varying duration of ischemia and reflow, peak signal intensities occurred after 15 s of reflow following 30 min of ischemia. Reperfusion with superoxide dismutase, deferoxamine, or mannitol abolished the reperfusion increase of B. Measurements performed with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrated a similar time course of radical generation with prominent DMPO-OH and DMPO-R signals peaking between 10 and 20 s of reflow. Superoxide dismutase and deferoxamine also quenched these signals. Thus, .O2- derived .OH, R., and ROO. radicals are generated in postischemic myocardium. While the experimental techniques used can result in loss of intrinsic radicals and generation of extraneous radicals, with proper care and controls valid measurements of free radicals in biological tissues can be performed.	0
Title: Efomycins K and L From a Termite-Associated Streptomyces sp. M56 and Their Putative Biosynthetic Origin Abstract: Two new elaiophylin derivatives, efomycins K (1) and L (2), and five known elaiophylin derivatives (3-7) were isolated from the termite-associated Streptomyces sp. M56. The structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR and HR-ESIMS analyses and comparative CD spectroscopy. The putative gene cluster responsible for the production of the elaiophylin and efomycin derivatives was identified based on significant homology to related clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of gene cluster domains was used to provide a biosynthetic rational for these new derivatives and to demonstrate how a single biosynthetic pathway can produce diverse structures.	1
Title: An antibody-based proximity labeling map reveals mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of antiviral immunity Abstract: The global epidemic caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the infection of over 200 million people. To extend the knowledge of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we systematically investigate the interactome of 29 viral proteins in human cells by using an antibody-based TurboID assay. In total, 1,388 high-confidence human proximal proteins with biotinylated sites are identified. Notably, we find that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the antiviral and immune responses. We validate that the membrane protein ITGB1 associates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit activation of the interferon pathway through the mitochondrial protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the methyltransferase SET domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD2). We propose 111 potential drugs for the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify three compounds that significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and humans provides a resource for elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection and developing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.	0
Title: Insights into cleavage specificity from the crystal structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C protease complexed with a peptide substrate Abstract: Picornavirus replication is critically dependent on the correct processing of a polyprotein precursor by 3C protease(s) (3C(pro)) at multiple specific sites with related but non-identical sequences. To investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity, we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non-covalent complexes of a picornavirus 3C(pro) with peptide substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro), mutated to replace the catalytic Cys by Ala and bound to a peptide (APAKQ|LLNFD) corresponding to the P5-P5' region of the VP1-2A cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein, was determined up to 2.5 A resolution. Comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in 3C(pro) on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the P4-P2' positions of the peptide. Strikingly, the deep S1' specificity pocket needed to accommodate P1'-Leu only forms when the peptide binds. Substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the P5-P4' region of synthetic substrates. The structure of the enzyme-peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular P4, P2 and P1 residue types, as well as the relative promiscuity at P3 and on the P' side of the scissile bond. Furthermore, crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified VP1-2A peptide (APAKE|LLNFD) containing a Gln-to-Glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro) to cleave sequences containing either P1-Gln or P1-Glu. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the S1' specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by Asp84 of the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity. Our results provide a new level of detail in our understanding of the structural basis of polyprotein cleavage by 3C(pro).	0
Title: FUM1--a gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis but not for maize ear rot and ear infection by Gibberella moniliformis in field tests Abstract: We have analyzed the role of fumonisins in infection of maize (Zea mays) by Gibberella moniliformis (anamorph Fusarium verticillioides) in field tests in Illinois and Iowa, United States. Fumonisin-nonproducing mutants were obtained by disrupting FUM1 (previously FUM5), the gene encoding a polyketide synthase required for fumonisin biosynthesis. Maize ear rot, ear infection, and fumonisin contamination were assessed by silk-channel injection in 1999 and 2000 and also by spray application onto maize silks, injection into maize stalks, and application with maize seeds at planting in 1999. Ear rot was evaluated by visual assessment of whole ears and by calculating percentage of symptomatic kernels by weight. Fumonisin levels in kernels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence of applied strains in kernels was determined by analysis of recovered isolates for genetic markers and fumonisin production. Two independent fumonisin-nonproducing (fum1-3 and fum1-4) mutants were similar to their respective fumonisin-producing (FUM1-1) progenitor strains in ability to cause ear rot following silk-channel injection and also were similar in ability to infect maize ears following application by all four methods tested. This evidence confirms that fumonisins are not required for G. moniliformis to cause maize ear rot and ear infection.	1
Title: A Terpene Synthase Is Involved in the Synthesis of the Volatile Organic Compound Sodorifen of Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 Abstract: Bacteria release a plethora of volatile organic compounds, including compounds with extraordinary structures. Sodorifen (IUPAC name: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethyl-3-methylenebicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene) is a recently identified and unusual volatile hydrocarbon that is emitted by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4R×13. Sodorifen comprises a bicyclic ring structure solely consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, where every carbon atom of the skeleton is substituted with either a methyl or a methylene group. This unusual feature of sodorifen made a prediction of its biosynthetic origin very difficult and so far its biosynthesis is unknown. To unravel the biosynthetic pathway we performed genome and transcriptome analyses to identify candidate genes. One knockout mutant (SOD_c20750) showed the desired negative sodorifen phenotype. Here it was shown for the first time that this gene is indispensable for the synthesis of sodorifen and strongly supports the hypothesis that sodorifen descends from the terpene metabolism. SOD_c20750 is the first bacterial terpene cyclase isolated from Serratia spp. and Enterobacteriales. Homology modeling revealed a 3D structure, which exhibits a functional role of amino acids for intermediate cation stabilization (W325) and putative proton acception (Y332). Moreover, the size and hydrophobicity of the active site strongly indicates that indeed the enzyme may catalyze the unusual compound sodorifen.	1
Title: Single-domain antibodies as promising experimental tools in imaging and isolation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus Abstract: Single-domain antibody (sdAb) or nanobody possesses specific features non-accessible for conventional antibodies that make them suitable for research and biotechnological applications. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world. To detect and isolate PEDV rapidly and accurately is important for the control and further research of the clinical PEDV strains. In this study, four sdAb fragments (sdAb-Mc19/29/30/37) targeting the membrane (M) protein of PEDV were selected from sdAb library that was constructed through M protein-immunized Camelus bactrianus. The selected sdAb-Mcs were solubly expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional characteristics analysis revealed that the recombinant sdAb-Mcs have excellent binding activity and specificity to M protein but have no neutralizing activity to PEDV. For further application, sdAb-Mc37 was conjugated with quantum dots to synthesize a nanoprobe for imaging PEDV in vero cells. The observed fluorescence in vero cells clearly reflects that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by the nanoprobe. Furthermore, the sdAb-Mc29 was conjugated with superparamagnetic nanobeads to construct immunomagnetic nanobeads (IMNBs) used to isolate PEDV. One PEDV strain was successfully isolated from clinical fecal sample, suggesting IMNBs as a novel and efficient tool suitable for PEDV isolation from clinical samples. This study provided a novel application and substantiated the suitability of sdAb as a specific binder for the isolation of viruses.	0
Title: Direct observation of an enamine intermediate in amine catalysis Abstract: An enamine intermediate is believed to be the central feature of biological catalysts, such as aldolases and small molecule amine organocatalysts. Despite decades of investigation of naturally occurring aldolase enzymes and recent studies on designed aldolase antibodies and organocatalysts, direct structural observation of an enamine intermediate has proven to be rare. Herein, we report the observation of a stable enamine intermediate in the crystal structure of an aldolase antibody 33F12 in complex with a 1,3-diketone derivative. This enamine complex structure provides strong evidence that fewer residues are essential for amine catalysis within the hydrophobic environments of this catalytic antibody than speculated for natural aldolase enzymes and should serve to guide future studies aimed at the rational design of these types of catalysts, as well as organocatalysts. Indeed, enamine catalysis in proteins might be more simplistic than previously imagined.	0
Title: Cardiac glycosides are potent inhibitors of interferon-β gene expression Abstract: Here we report that bufalin and other cardiac glycoside inhibitors of the sodium-potassium ATPase (sodium pump) potently inhibit the induction of the interferon-β (IFNβ) gene by virus, double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA. Cardiac glycosides increase the intracellular sodium concentration, which appears to inhibit the ATPase activity of the RNA sensor RIG-I, an essential and early component in the IFNβ activation pathway. This, in turn, prevents the activation of the critical transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB. Bufalin inhibition can be overcome by expressing a drug-resistant variant of the sodium pump and knocking down the pump by short hairpin RNA inhibits IFNβ expression. Thus, bufalin acts exclusively through the sodium pump. We also show that bufalin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, at least in part by interfering with the nuclear translocation of NFκB. These findings suggest that bufalin could be used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in which IFN or TNF are hyperactivated.	0
Title: Novel Type III Polyketide Synthases Biosynthesize Methylated Polyketides in Mycobacterium marinum Abstract: Mycobacterial pathogenesis is hallmarked by lipidic polyketides that decorate the cell envelope and mediate infection. However, factors mediating persistence remain largely unknown. Dynamic cell wall remodeling could facilitate the different pathogenic phases. Recent studies have implicated type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) in cell wall alterations in several bacteria. Comparative genome analysis revealed several type III pks gene clusters in mycobacteria. In this study, we report the functional characterization of two novel type III PKSs, MMAR_2470 and MMAR_2474, in Mycobacterium marinum. These type III pkss belong to a unique pks genomic cluster conserved exclusively in pathogenic mycobacteria. Cell-free reconstitution assays and high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses revealed methylated polyketide products in independent reactions of both proteins. MMAR_2474 protein exceptionally biosynthesized methylated alkyl-resorcinol and methylated acyl-phloroglucinol products from the same catalytic core. Structure-based homology modeling, product docking, and mutational studies identified residues that could facilitate the distinctive catalysis of these proteins. Functional investigations in heterologous mycobacterial strain implicated MMAR_2474 protein to be vital for mycobacterial survival in stationary biofilms. Our investigations provide new insights into type III PKSs conserved in pathogenic mycobacterial species.	1
Title: Revised Structure of Anthelvencin A and Characterization of the Anthelvencin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Anthelvencins A and B are pyrrolamide metabolites produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 14583 and 14585. Isolated in 1965, they were reported to exhibit anthelmintic and moderate antibacterial activities. In this study, we revise the structure of anthelvencin A and identify a third anthelvencin metabolite, bearing two N-methylated pyrrole groups, which we named anthelvencin C. We sequenced the genome of S. venezuelae ATCC 14583 and identified a gene cluster predicted to direct the biosynthesis of anthelvencins. Functional analysis of this gene cluster confirmed its involvement in anthelvencin biosynthesis and allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for anthelvencins. In addition to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), the assembly of anthelvencins involves an enzyme from the ATP-grasp ligase family, Ant23. We propose that Ant23 uses a PCP-loaded 4-aminopyrrole-2-carboxylate as substrate. As observed for the biosynthesis of the other pyrrolamides congocidine (produced by Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 25877) and distamycin (produced by Streptomyces netropsis DSM 40846), the NRPS assembling anthelvencins is composed of stand-alone domains only. Such NRPSs, sometimes called type II NRPSs, are less studied than the classical multimodular NRPSs. Yet, they constitute an interesting model to study protein-protein interactions in NRPSs and are good candidates for combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.	1
Title: Albusnodin: an acetylated lasso peptide from Streptomyces albus Abstract: We describe a lasso peptide, albusnodin, that is post-translationally modified with an acetyl group, the first example of a lasso peptide with this modification. Using heterologous expression, we further show that the acetyltransferase colocalized with the albusnodin gene cluster is required for the biosynthesis of this lasso peptide. This type of lasso peptide is widespread in Actinobacteria with 44 examples found in currently sequenced genomes.	1
Title: Rearranged Biosynthetic Gene Cluster and Synthesis of Hassallidin E in Planktothrix serta PCC 8927 Abstract: Cyanobacteria produce a wide range of natural products with antifungal bioactivity. The cyclic glycosylated lipopeptides of the hassallidin family have potent antifungal activity and display a great degree of chemical diversity. Here, we report the discovery of a hassallidin biosynthetic gene cluster from the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix serta PCC 8927. The hassallidin gene cluster showed heavy rearrangement and marks of genomic plasticity. Nucleotide bias, differences in GC content, and phylogenetic incongruence suggested the acquisition of the hassallidin biosynthetic gene cluster in Planktothrix serta PCC 8927 by horizontal gene transfer. Chemical analyses by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated that this strain produced hassallidin E, a new glycosylated hassallidin variant. Hassallidin E was the only structural variant produced by Planktothrix serta PCC 8927 in all tested conditions. Further evaluated on human pathogenic fungi, hassallidin E showed an antifungal bioactivity. Hassallidin production levels correlated with nitrogen availability, in the only nitrogen-fixing Planktothrix described so far. Our results provide insights into the distribution and chemical diversity of cyanobacterial antifungal compounds as well as raise questions on their ecological relevance.	1
Title: Alternating access of the putative substrate-binding chamber in the ABC transporter MsbA Abstract: MsbA is an ATP-binding cassette transporter from Escherichia coli that is involved in trafficking lipid A across the inner membrane. ATP-binding cassette transporters harness the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive the uphill translocation of substrates against their concentration gradients. A model of protein motion coupling energy input to work was inspired by crystallographic snapshots of MsbA. Central to this model is a switch in the accessibility of a transmembrane chamber, implicated in substrate binding, from an inward- to an outward-facing configuration. Here, we used spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to systematically explore rearrangements in MsbA structure during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Spin-label accessibility and local dynamics were determined in liposomes for the nucleotide-free intermediate and the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. The changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance parameters between these two intermediates fit a global pattern consistent with alternating access of the chamber. In the transition state of ATP hydrolysis, spin labels on the cytoplasmic side report increased dynamic restrictions and reduced water accessibility, while those on the extracellular side report increased water penetration. Furthermore, spin-label mobility and accessibility as well as their changes are consistent with those expected based on the crystal structures. The reversal in chamber hydration is likely to reduce the free energy of amphipathic substrate binding and promote translocation across the membrane.	0
Title: Efficient Isolation of Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids from Marine Red Algae by Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatography Abstract: Marine rhodophyta are known to synthesize specific secondary metabolites, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), to protect themselves from harmful UV-radiation. Shinorine and porphyra-334 are among the most abundant representatives of this compound class. In the present work, a novel approach for their isolation is described. As a first step, a fast centrifugal partition chromatography method, with an aqueous two-phase system comprising water, ethanol, ammonium sulfate and methanol in ascending mode, was developed to isolate the two MAAs from crude aqueous-methanolic extracts of three algal species within 90 min. The compounds could be isolated when just one of them was present in a sample or also both at the same time. By employing solid phase extraction as a second purification step, the individual MAAs were obtained in high purity and good quantity within a much shorter time frame than the established purification protocols, e.g., semi-preparative HPLC. For example, from 4 g Porphyra sp. (Nori) crude extract, 15.7 mg shinorine and 36.2 mg porphyra-334 were isolated. Both were highly pure, as confirmed by TLC, HPLC-MS and NMR analyses.	0
Title: New lessons for combinatorial biosynthesis from myxobacteria. The myxothiazol biosynthetic gene cluster of Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1 Abstract: The biosynthetic mta gene cluster responsible for myxothiazol formation from the fruiting body forming myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1 was sequenced and analyzed. Myxothiazol, an inhibitor of the electron transport via the bc(1)-complex of the respiratory chain, is biosynthesized by a unique combination of several polyketide synthases (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which are activated by the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase MtaA. Genomic replacement of a fragment of mtaB and insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene into mtaA both impaired myxothiazol synthesis. Genes mtaC and mtaD encode the enzymes for bis-thiazol(ine) formation and chain extension on one pure NRPS (MtaC) and on a unique combination of PKS and NRPS (MtaD). The genes mtaE and mtaF encode PKSs including peptide fragments with homology to methyltransferases. These methyltransferase modules are assumed to be necessary for the formation of the proposed methoxy- and beta-methoxy-acrylate intermediates of myxothiazol biosynthesis. The last gene of the cluster, mtaG, again resembles a NRPS and provides insight into the mechanism of the formation of the terminal amide of myxothiazol. The carbon backbone of an amino acid added to the myxothiazol-acid is assumed to be removed via an unprecedented module with homology to monooxygenases within MtaG.	1
Title: Prolyl hydroxylase substrate adenylosuccinate lyase is an oncogenic driver in triple negative breast cancer Abstract: Protein hydroxylation affects protein stability, activity, and interactome, therefore contributing to various diseases including cancers. However, the transiency of the hydroxylation reaction hinders the identification of hydroxylase substrates. By developing an enzyme-substrate trapping strategy coupled with TAP-TAG or orthogonal GST- purification followed by mass spectrometry, we identify adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) as an EglN2 hydroxylase substrate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ADSL expression is higher in TNBC than other breast cancer subtypes or normal breast tissues. ADSL knockout impairs TNBC cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. An integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis reveals that ADSL activates the oncogenic cMYC pathway by regulating cMYC protein level via a mechanism requiring ADSL proline 24 hydroxylation. Hydroxylation-proficient ADSL, by affecting adenosine levels, represses the expression of the long non-coding RNA MIR22HG, thus upregulating cMYC protein level. Our findings highlight the role of ADSL hydroxylation in controlling cMYC and TNBC tumorigenesis.	0
Title: When it is hard to get to with genetics--planar cell polarity under a chemical scalpel Abstract: Planar cell polarity (PCP) has been under genetic dissection for decades. More and more fundamental developmental processes have been found relying on PCP signaling. However, mechanisms of how PCP signaling generates asymmetry is still unknown. A recent paper in Chemistry & Biology (Sundberg et al., 2011) represents the efforts to decipher the intracellular code of polarity signaling.	0
Title: CodY orchestrates the expression of virulence determinants in emetic Bacillus cereus by impacting key regulatory circuits Abstract: Bacillus cereus causes gastrointestinal diseases and local and systemic infections elicited by the depsipeptide cereulide, enterotoxins, phospholipases, cytolysins and proteases. The PlcR-PapR quorum sensing system activates the expression of several virulence factors, whereas the Spo0A-AbrB regulatory circuit partially controls the plasmid-borne cereulide synthetase (ces) operon. Here, we show that CodY, a nutrient-responsive regulator of Gram-positive bacteria, has a profound effect on both regulatory systems, which have been assumed to operate independently of each other. Deletion of codY resulted in downregulation of virulence genes belonging to the PlcR regulon and a concomitant upregulation of the ces genes. CodY was found to be a repressor of the ces operon, but did not interact with the promoter regions of PlcR-dependent virulence genes in vitro, suggesting an indirect regulation of the latter. Furthermore, CodY binds to the promoter of the immune inhibitor metalloprotease InhA1, demonstrating that CodY directly links B. cereus metabolism to virulence. In vivo studies using a Galleria mellonella infection model, showed that the codY mutant was substantially attenuated, highlighting the importance of CodY as a key regulator of pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate that CodY profoundly modulates the virulence of B. cereus, possibly controlling the development of pathogenic traits in suitable host environments.	1
Title: Capturing linear intermediates and C-terminal variants during maturation of the thiopeptide GE2270 Abstract: Thiopeptides are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptides with potent activity against Gram-positives. However, only GE2270 has yielded semisynthetic derivatives under clinical investigations. The pbt gene cluster from the GE2270 producer Planobispora rosea was successfully expressed in the genetically tractable Nonomuraea ATCC39727. Gene deletions established that PbtO, PbtM1, PbtM2, PbtM3, and PbtM4 are involved in regiospecific hydroxylation and methylations of GE2270, leading to the generation of various derivatives with altered decorations. Further deletions established that PbtH and PbtG1 are involved in C-terminal amide and oxazoline formation, respectively. Surprisingly, preventing either step resulted in the accumulation of linear precursors in which the pyridine-generated macrocycle failed to form, and only one of the pyridine-forming serine residues had been dehydrated. Often, these linear precursors present a shortened C terminus but retain the full set of methylation and hydroxylation decorations.	1
Title: Discovery of cryptic polyketide metabolites from dermatophytes using heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Dermatophytes belonging to the Trichophyton and Arthroderma genera cause skin infections in humans and animals. From genome sequencing data, we mined a conserved gene cluster among dermatophytes that are homologous to one that produces an immunosuppressive polyketide in Aspergillus fumigatus. Using a recombination-based cloning strategy in yeast, we constructed fungal heterologous expression vectors that encode the cryptic clusters. When integrated into the model Aspergillus nidulans host, a structurally related compound neosartoricin B was formed, suggesting a possible role of this compound in the pathogenesis of these strains.	1
Title: Phenylnannolones A-C: biosynthesis of new secondary metabolites from the myxobacterium Nannocystis exedens Abstract: Myxobacteria are gliding bacteria that belong to the delta-Proteobacteria and are known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. Among myxobacteria, Nannocystis spp. are most closely related to marine myxobacteria and their secondary metabolism has hardly been investigated. Phenylnannolones A (1), B (2) and C (3) were obtained from a culture of Nannocystis exedens that was isolated from the intertidal region of Crete. Compound 1 had inhibitory activity toward the ABCB1 gene product P-glycoprotein and reversed daunorubicin resistance in cultured cancer cells. Phenylnannolone A has an unusual structural architecture; it is composed of an ethyl-substituted polyene chain linked to a pyrone moiety on one side and to a phenyl ring on the other. The investigation of the biosynthesis with labelled precursors revealed acetate, butyrate and phenylalanine as building blocks for 1. The labelling pattern suggested novel biochemical reactions for the biosynthesis of the starter unit.	1
Title: A possible contribution of mRNA secondary structure to translation initiation efficiency in Lactococcus lactis Abstract: Gene expression signals derived from Lactococcus lactis were linked to lacZ-fused genes with different 5'-nucleotide sequences. Computer predictions of mRNA secondary structure were combined with lacZ expression studies to direct base-substitutions that could possibly influence gene expression. Mutations were made such that the DNA sequence upstream of the ATG start codon was not changed. Moreover, care was taken that the substitutions, which were all within the first six codons, neither affected the amino acid sequence of the gene product nor introduced codons rarely used in L. lactis. The results suggest that mRNA secondary structure contributes to the efficiency of translation initiation in L. lactis.	0
Title: Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) associated with duckweed (lemnaceae) mats Abstract: Duckweed (Lemnaceae) mats in Texas and Florida were investigated, using the acetylene reduction assay, to determine whether nitrogen fixation occurred in these floating aquatic macrophyte communities. N(2)-fixing microorganisms were enumerated by plating or most-probable-number techniques, using appropriate N-free media. Results of the investigations indicated that substantial N(2)-fixation (C(2)H(2)) was associated with duckweed mats in Texas and Florida. Acetylene reduction values ranged from 1 to 18 mumol of C(2)H(4) g (dry weight) day for samples incubated aerobically in light. Dark N(2) fixation was always two- to fivefold lower. 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (7 to 10 muM) reduced acetylene reduction to levels intermediate between light and dark incubation. Acetylene reduction was generally greatest for samples incubated anaerobically in the light. It was estimated that 15 to 20% of the N requirement of the duckweed could be supplied through biological nitrogen fixation. N(2)-fixing heterotrophic bacteria (10 cells g [wet weight] and cyanobacteria (10 propagules g [wet weight] were associated with the duckweed mats. Azotobacter sp. was not detected in these investigations. One diazotrophic isolate was classified as Klebsiella.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Fungal Organophosphonate Fosfonochlorin Involves an Iron(II) and 2-(Oxo)glutarate Dependent Oxacyclase Abstract: The fungal metabolite Fosfonochlorin features a chloroacetyl moiety that is unusual within known phosphonate natural product biochemistry. Putative biosynthetic genes encoding Fosfonochlorin in Fusarium and Talaromyces spp. were investigated through reactions of encoded enzymes with synthetic substrates and isotope labelling studies. We show that the early biosynthetic steps for Fosfonochlorin involve the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to form 2-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid, followed by oxidative intramolecular cyclization of the resulting alcohol to form (S)-epoxyethylphosphonic acid. The latter reaction is catalyzed by FfnD, a rare example of a non-heme iron/2-(oxo)glutarate dependent oxacyclase. In contrast, FfnD behaves as a more typical oxygenase with ethylphosphonic acid, producing (S)-1-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid. FfnD thus represents a new example of a ferryl generating enzyme that can suppress the typical oxygen rebound reaction that follows abstraction of a substrate hydrogen by a ferryl oxygen, thereby directing the substrate radical towards a fate other than hydroxylation.	1
Title: The determinants of activity and specificity in actinorhodin type II polyketide ketoreductase Abstract: In the actinorhodin type II polyketide synthase, the first polyketide modification is a regiospecific C9-carbonyl reduction, catalyzed by the ketoreductase (actKR). Our previous studies identified the actKR 94-PGG-96 motif as a determinant of stereospecificity. The molecular basis for reduction regiospecificity is, however, not well understood. In this study, we examined the activities of 20 actKR mutants through a combination of kinetic studies, PKS reconstitution, and structural analyses. Residues have been identified that are necessary for substrate interaction, and these observations have suggested a structural model for this reaction. Polyketides dock at the KR surface and are steered into the enzyme pocket where C7-C12 cyclization is mediated by the KR before C9-ketoreduction can occur. These molecular features can potentially serve as engineering targets for the biosynthesis of novel, reduced polyketides.	1
Title: The gene cluster for chloramphenicol biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 includes novel shikimate pathway homologues and a monomodular non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene Abstract: Regions of the Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 chromosome flanking pabAB, an amino-deoxychorismate synthase gene needed for chloramphenicol (Cm) production, were examined for involvement in biosynthesis of the antibiotic. Three of four ORFs in the sequence downstream of pabAB resembled genes involved in the shikimate pathway. BLASTX searches of GenBank showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of ORF3 and ORF4 were similar to proteins encoded by monofunctional genes for chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydrogenase, respectively, while the sequence of the ORF5 product resembled deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, the enzyme that initiates the shikimate pathway. A relationship to Cm biosynthesis was indicated by sequence similarities between the ORF6 product and membrane proteins associated with Cm export. BLASTX searches of GenBank for matches with the translated sequence of ORF1 in chromosomal DNA immediately upstream of pabAB did not detect products relevant to Cm biosynthesis. However, the presence of Cm biosynthesis genes in a 7.5 kb segment of the chromosome beyond ORF1 was inferred when conjugal transfer of the DNA into a blocked S. venezuelae mutant restored Cm production. Deletions in the 7.5 kb segment of the wild-type chromosome eliminated Cm production, confirming the presence of Cm biosynthesis genes in this region. Sequencing and analysis located five ORFs, one of which (ORF8) was deduced from BLAST searches of GenBank, and from characteristic motifs detected in alignments of its deduced amino acid sequence, to be a monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase. GenBank searches did not identify ORF7, but matched the translated sequences of ORFs 9, 10 and 11 with short-chain ketoreductases, the ATP-binding cassettes of ABC transporters, and coenzyme A ligases, respectively. As has been shown for ORF2, disrupting ORF3, ORF7, ORF8 or ORF9 blocked Cm production.	1
Title: An antibiotic factory caught in action Abstract: The synthesis of aromatic polyketides, such as actinorhodin, tetracycline and doxorubicin, begins with the formation of a polyketide chain. In type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), chains are polymerized by the heterodimeric ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF). Here we present the 2.0-A structure of the actinorhodin KS-CLF, which shows polyketides being elongated inside an amphipathic tunnel approximately 17 A in length at the heterodimer interface. The structure resolves many of the questions about the roles of KS and CLF. Although CLF regulates chain length, it does not have an active site; KS must catalyze both chain initiation and elongation. We provide evidence that the first cyclization of the polyketide occurs within the KS-CLF tunnel. The mechanistic details of this central PKS polymerase could guide biosynthetic chemists in designing new pharmaceuticals and polymers.	1
Title: A novel multidomain polyketide synthase is essential for zeamine production and the virulence of Dickeya zeae Abstract: Dickeya zeae is the causal agent of the rice foot rot disease, but its mechanism of infection remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel gene designated as zmsA. The gene encodes a large protein of 2,346 amino acids in length, which consists of multidomains arranged in the order of N-terminus, β-ketoacyl synthase, acyl transferase, acyl carrier protein, β-ketoacyl reductase, dehydratase. This multidomain structure and sequence alignment analysis suggest that ZmsA is a member of the polyketide synthase family. Mutation of zmsA abolished antimicrobial activity and attenuated the virulence of D. zeae. To determine the relationship between antimicrobial activity and virulence, active compounds were purified from D. zeae EC1 and were structurally characterized. This led to identification of two polyamino compounds, i.e., zeamine and zeamine II, that were phytotoxins and potent antibiotics. These results have established the essential role of ZmsA in zeamine biosynthesis and presented a new insight on the molecular mechanisms of D. zeae pathogenicity.	0
Title: Influence of nitrogen sources on the tolerance of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus to heat stress and oxidative stress Abstract: It has been found that 32 genes related to nitrogen source metabolism in Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus are downregulated under both heat stress and oxidative stress. In this study, the influence of different nitrogen sources within the growth medium on the tolerance of L. rhamnosus to heat stress and oxidative stress was investigated. Tryptone-free MRS was found to enhance the tolerance of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 to heat stress and oxidative stress during the whole growth period, and this result was universal for all L. rhamnosus species analyzed. The strongest strengthening effect occurred when the OD600 value reached 2.0, at which the survival rates under heat stress and oxidative stress increased 130-fold and 40-fold, respectively. After supplementing phenylalanine, isoleucine, glutamate, valine, histidine, or tryptophan into the tryptone-free MRS, the tolerance of L. rhamnosus to heat stress and oxidative stress exhibited a sharp drop. The spray drying survival rate of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 cultured in the tryptone-free MRS rose to 75% (from 30%), and the spray dried powder also performed better in the experimentally simulated gastrointestinal digestion. These results showed that decreasing the intake of amino acids is an important mechanism for L. rhamnosus to tolerate heat stress and oxidative stress. When L. rhamnosus is cultured for spray drying, the concentration of the nitrogen source's components should be an important consideration.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the echinocandin B biosynthetic gene cluster from Emericella rugulosa NRRL 11440 Abstract: Echinocandins are a family of fungal lipidated cyclic hexapeptide natural products. Due to their effectiveness as antifungal agents, three semisynthetic derivatives have been developed and approved for treatment of human invasive candidiasis. All six of the amino acid residues are hydroxylated, including 4R,5R-dihydroxy-L-ornithine, 4R-hydroxyl-L-proline, 3S,4S-dihydroxy-L-homotyrosine, and 3S-hydroxyl-4S-methyl-L-proline. We report here the biosynthetic gene cluster of echinocandin B 1 from Emericella rugulosa NRRL 11440 containing genes encoding for a six-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase EcdA, an acyl-AMP ligase EcdI, and oxygenases EcdG, EcdH, and EcdK. We showed EcdI activates linoleate as linoleyl-AMP and installs it on the first thiolation domain of EcdA. We have also established through ATP-PP(i) exchange assay that EcdA loads L-ornithine in the first module. A separate hty gene cluster encodes four enzymes for de novo generation of L-homotyrosine from acetyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate is found from the sequenced genome. Deletions in the ecdA, and htyA genes validate their essential roles in echinocandin B production. Five predicted iron-centered oxygenase genes, ecdG, ecdH, ecdK, htyE, and htyF, in the two separate ecd and hty clusters are likely to be the tailoring oxygenases for maturation of the nascent NRPS lipohexapeptidolactam product.	1
Title: Characterization of the saframycin A gene cluster from Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 11002 revealing a nonribosomal peptide synthetase system for assembling the unusual tetrapeptidyl skeleton in an iterative manner Abstract: Saframycin A (SFM-A), produced by Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 11002, belongs to the tetrahydroisoquinoline family of antibiotics, and its core is structurally similar to the core of ecteinascidin 743, which is a highly potent antitumor drug isolated from a marine tunicate. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster for SFM-A was cloned and localized to a 62-kb contiguous DNA region. Sequence analysis revealed 30 genes that constitute the SFM-A gene cluster, encoding an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system and tailoring enzymes and regulatory and resistance proteins. The results of substrate prediction and in vitro characterization of the adenylation specificities of this NRPS system support the hypothesis that the last module acts in an iterative manner to form a tetrapeptidyl intermediate and that the colinearity rule does not apply. Although this mechanism is different from those proposed for the SFM-A analogs SFM-Mx1 and safracin B (SAC-B), based on the high similarity of these systems, it is likely they share a common mechanism of biosynthesis as we describe here. Construction of the biosynthetic pathway of SFM-Y3, an aminated SFM-A, was achieved in the SAC-B producer (Pseudomonas fluorescens). These findings not only shed new insight on tetrahydroisoquinoline biosynthesis but also demonstrate the feasibility of engineering microorganisms to generate structurally more complex and biologically more active analogs by combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: The neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces carzinostaticus ATCC 15944 involving two iterative type I polyketide synthases Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin (NCS) was localized to 130 kb continuous DNA from Streptomyces carzinostaticus ATCC15944 and confirmed by gene inactivation. DNA sequence analysis of 92 kb of the cloned region revealed 68 open reading frames (ORFs), 47 of which were determined to constitute the NCS cluster. Sequence analysis of the genes within the NCS cluster suggested dNDP-D-mannose as a precursor for the deoxy aminosugar, revealed two distinct type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), and supported a convergent model for NCS chromophore biosynthesis from the deoxy aminosugar, naphthoic acid, and enediyne core building blocks. These findings shed light into deoxysugar biosynthesis, further support the iterative type I PKS paradigm for enediyne core biosynthesis, and unveil a mechanism for microbial polycyclic aromatic polyketide biosynthesis by an iterative type I PKS.	1

Title: Genome Mining of Alkaloidal Terpenoids from a Hybrid Terpene and Nonribosomal Peptide Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Biosynthetic pathways containing multiple core enzymes have potential to produce structurally complex natural products. Here we mined a fungal gene cluster that contains two predicted terpene cyclases (TCs) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). We showed the flv pathway produces flavunoidine 1, an alkaloidal terpenoid. The core of 1 is a tetracyclic, cage-like, and oxygenated sesquiterpene that is connected to dimethylcadaverine via a C-N bond and is acylated with 5,5-dimethyl-l-pipecolate. The roles of all flv enzymes are established on the basis of metabolite analysis from heterologous expression.	1
Title: Genome sequences of four divergent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients with sepsis or osteomyelitis Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections worldwide, with recent prevalence and higher frequency in wounded military personnel. Four A. baumannii strains from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) isolated between 2008 and 2009 were sequenced, representing diverse, multidrug-resistant isolates from osteomyelitis or septic patients.	0
Title: Selvamicin, an atypical antifungal polyene from two alternative genomic contexts Abstract: The bacteria harbored by fungus-growing ants produce a variety of small molecules that help maintain a complex multilateral symbiosis. In a survey of antifungal compounds from these bacteria, we discovered selvamicin, an unusual antifungal polyene macrolide, in bacterial isolates from two neighboring ant nests. Selvamicin resembles the clinically important antifungals nystatin A1 and amphotericin B, but it has several distinctive structural features: a noncationic 6-deoxymannose sugar at the canonical glycosylation site and a second sugar, an unusual 4-O-methyldigitoxose, at the opposite end of selvamicin's shortened polyene macrolide. It also lacks some of the pharmacokinetic liabilities of the clinical agents and appears to have a different target. Whole genome sequencing revealed the putative type I polyketide gene cluster responsible for selvamicin's biosynthesis including a subcluster of genes consistent with selvamicin's 4-O-methyldigitoxose sugar. Although the selvamicin biosynthetic cluster is virtually identical in both bacterial producers, in one it is on the chromosome, in the other it is on a plasmid. These alternative genomic contexts illustrate the biosynthetic gene cluster mobility that underlies the diversity and distribution of chemical defenses by the specialized bacteria in this multilateral symbiosis.	1
Title: Bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid suppresses IFN-β production by inhibiting RIG-I-like receptors pathway in host cells Abstract: The present study aimed to explore if bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid (BCoV N) impacts IFN-β production in the host cells and to reveal further molecular mechanism of BCoV pathogenesis. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were transiently transfected with pMyc-BCoV-N recombinant plasmids, then infected with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Expression levels of beta interferon (IFN-β) mRNA were detected using RT-qPCR. The results showed that BCoV N gene was 1347 bp that was consistent with the expected size. pMyc-BCoV-N recombinant protein was 1347 bp which was successfully transcribed and overexpressed in HEK 293 T cells. BCoV-N recombinant protein inhibited dose-dependently VSV-induced IFN-β production (p < 0.01). MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3 could promote transcription levels of IFN-β mRNA. But, BCoV-N protein demoted IFN-β transcription levels induced by MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3. Furthermore, expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3 mRNAs were reduced in RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. In conclusion, BCoV-N reduced IFN-β levels in RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway in HEK 293 T cells which were induced by MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3(5D). BCoV-N protein inhibited IFN-β production and activation of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) signal pathway. Our findings demonstrated BCoV N protein is an IFN-β antagonist through inhibition of MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3(5D) in RLRs pathway, also revealed a new mechanism of BCoV N protein to evade host innate immune response by inhibiting type I IFN production, which is beneficial to developing novel prevention strategy for BCoV disease in the animals and humans.	0
Title: New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved processive exoribonucleolysis mechanism of the RNase J family Abstract: RNase J, a prokaryotic 5'-3' exo/endoribonuclease, contributes to mRNA decay, rRNA maturation and post-transcriptional regulation. Yet the processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism remains obscure. Here, we solved the first RNA-free and RNA-bound structures of an archaeal RNase J, and through intensive biochemical studies provided detailed mechanistic insights into the catalysis and processivity. Distinct dimerization/tetramerization patterns were observed for archaeal and bacterial RNase Js, and unique archaeal Loops I and II were found involved in RNA interaction. A hydrogen-bond-network was identified for the first time that assists catalysis by facilitating efficient proton transfer in the catalytic center. A conserved 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket that coordinates the RNA 5'-end ensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within the catalytic track; the 5'-capping residue Leu37 of the sandwich pocket coupled with the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket are dedicated to translocating and controlling the RNA orientation for each exoribonucleolytic cycle. The processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism was verified as conserved in bacterial RNase J and also exposes striking parallels with the non-homologous eukaryotic 5'-3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1. The findings in this work shed light on not only the molecular mechanism of the RNase J family, but also the evolutionary convergence of divergent exoribonucleases.	0
Title: Inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in blood samples stored as high-salt lysates Abstract: Blood samples to be tested for the presence of parasite DNA by using specific DNA probes are routinely stored in our laboratory as high-salt lysates (HSL). To safeguard against the risk of accidental infection with etiological agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) while manipulating large numbers of blood samples in preparation for DNA probing, we determined the residual infectivity of HIV-1 after exposure to HSL components. Both high-titer virus stocks or provirus-carrying cells, suspended either in tissue culture medium or freshly drawn blood, were completely inactivated upon contact with the HSL components. This was verified by the absence of any detectable HIV-1-specific antigen in the supernatants of long-term cultures and the absence of virus-specific DNA fragments after amplification by polymerase chain reaction with DNA from such cultures as target DNA. These results support the conclusion that the virus is in fact completely inactivated by contact with the HSL components, rendering blood specimens stored as HSL noninfectious in regard to HIV-1.	0
Title: Identification of ε-Poly-L-lysine as an Antimicrobial Product from an Epichloë Endophyte and Isolation of Fungal ε-PL Synthetase Gene Abstract: The endophytic fungus Epichloë festucae is known to produce bioactive metabolites, which consequently protect the host plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. We previously found that the overexpression of vibA (a gene for transcription factor) in E. festucae strain E437 resulted in the secretion of an unknown fungicide. In the present study, the active substance was purified and chemically identified as ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PL), which consisted of 28-34 lysine units. The productivity was 3.7-fold compared with that of the wild type strain E437. The isolated ε-PL showed inhibitory activity against the spore germination of the plant pathogens Drechslera erythrospila, Botrytis cinerea, and Phytophthora infestans at 1-10 μg/mL. We also isolated the fungal gene "epls" encoding ε-PL synthetase Epls. Overexpression of epls in the wild type strain E437 resulted in the enhanced production of ε-PL by 6.7-fold. Interestingly, overexpression of epls in the different strain E. festucae Fl1 resulted in the production of shorter ε-PL with 8-20 lysine, which exhibited a comparable antifungal activity to the longer one. The results demonstrate the first example of ε-PL synthetase gene from the eukaryotic genomes and suggest the potential of enhanced expression of vibA or/and epls genes in the Epichloë endophyte for constructing pest-tolerant plants.	1

Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII -mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.	0
Title: Pentaketide Ansamycin Microansamycins A-I from Micromonospora sp. Reveal Diverse Post-PKS Modifications Abstract: Overexpression of the pathway-specific positive regulator gene mas13 activated the cryptic gene cluster mas, resulting in the isolation of nine novel pentaketide ansamycins, namely, microansamycins A-I (1-9). These results not only revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster of pentaketide ansamycins for the first time but also presented an unprecedented scenario of diverse post-PKS modifications in ansamycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genetic characterization of the chlorothricin gene cluster as a model for spirotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for chlorothricin (CHL) was localized to a 122 kb contiguous DNA from Streptomyces antibioticus DSM 40725, and its involvement in CHL biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced 111.989 kb DNA region revealed 42 open reading frames, 35 of which were defined to constitute the CHL gene cluster. An assembly model for CHL biosynthesis from D-olivose, 2-methoxy-5-chloro-6-methylsalicyclic acid, and chlorothricolide building blocks was proposed. This work represents cloning of a gene cluster for spirotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis and sets the stage to investigate the unusual macrolide biosynthesis including tandem Diels-Alder cyclizations, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, and incorporation of an enoylpyruvate unit.	1
Title: Regulation of the expression of gas vesicle genes in Haloferax mediterranei: interaction of the two regulatory proteins GvpD and GvpE Abstract: The gas vesicle formation in Haloferax mediterranei occurs in the stationary growth phase and involves the 14 genes mc-gvpACNO and mc-gvpDEFGHIJKLM. The appearance of the two regulatory proteins GvpD and GvpE, and also of GvpF, was investigated during the growth of H. mediterranei. GvpD was only found during the stationary growth phase, GvpE was present from the late exponential to stationary growth phase, and GvpF was present only during the exponential growth, although the three genes were co-transcribed. The impact of GvpD and GvpE on the activity of the promoter of the mc-gvpACNO gene cluster encoding the gas vesicle structural proteins was analysed in H. volcanii transformants containing the mc-gvpA gene or a fusion of the mcA promoter with the bgaH reading frame encoding a halobacterial beta-galactosidase as reporter. The experiments proved that GvpE is a transcriptional activator, whereas GvpD is involved in the repression. Protein-protein affinity chromatography was used to search for putative binding partners of GvpD and GvpE. Both proteins were synthesized in Escherichia coli as his-tagged proteins, isolated under denaturing conditions and refolded by dialysis against buffers containing decreasing urea and increasing KCl concentrations up to 2.5 M. The Ni-NTA matrix tagged with GvpD-his or GvpE-his was incubated with soluble proteins of gas vesicle producing H. mediterranei cells. A 21 kDa protein was purified using the matrix tagged with GvpD-his which proved to be GvpE by Western analysis. Vice versa, GvpD was purified using the GvpE-his-Ni-NTA matrix. These results strongly suggested that GvpD and GvpE were able to interact and might constitute a regulatory system.	0
Title: Deletion of the C26 Methyl Substituent from the Bryostatin Analogue Merle 23 Has Negligible Impact on Its Biological Profile and Potency Abstract: Important strides are being made in understanding the effects of structural features of bryostatin 1, a candidate therapeutic agent for cancer and dementia, in conferring its potency toward protein kinase C and the unique spectrum of biological responses that it induces. A critical pharmacophoric element in bryostatin 1 is the secondary hydroxy group at the C26 position, with a corresponding primary hydroxy group playing an analogous role in binding of phorbol esters to protein kinase C. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a bryostatin homologue in which the C26 hydroxy group is primary, as it is in the phorbol esters, and show that its biological activity is almost indistinguishable from that of the corresponding compound with a secondary hydroxy group.	0
Title: Regio- and stereoselective intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling in Streptomyces Abstract: Intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling is the main process in nature for the formation of atroposelective biaryl compounds. Although well defined in plants and fungi, this type of dimerization reaction in bacteria is poorly understood. Therefore, the biosynthesis of julichromes, spectomycins, and setomimycin was investigated. The monomeric subunits of these biarylic pre-anthraquinones are derived from a common polyketidic precursor, yet the coupling reaction proceeds in a regioselective manner, with the position of attachment of the two subunits depending on the specific streptomycete strain. By using genome analysis and deletion experiments, the biosynthetic gene clusters were identified. Furthermore, it was established that cytochrome P450 enzymes are fundamentally involved during dimerization of the polyketide monomers.	1
Title: Accurate prediction of the Aspergillus nidulans terrequinone gene cluster boundaries using the transcriptional regulator LaeA Abstract: LaeA is a regulatory protein of the genus Aspergillus which controls global expression of secondary metabolism gene clusters. During a previous genome-wide transcriptional profiling screen, numerous novel gene clusters were found to be regulated by LaeA including a cluster required for the production of the antitumor agent terrequinone A. Beginnings and ends of secondary metabolite gene clusters are difficult to predict by gene sequence alone, but sharp demarcation of transcriptional control by LaeA suggested this protein might present a tool to identify cluster ends. To address this possibility in a first test case, we created null mutants of three genes, one regulated and two not regulated by LaeA, lying at the first, sixth and seventh position of a contiguous seven gene region where the third gene in this continuum was already shown to be required for terrequinone A production. Only the gene regulated by LaeA, tdiE, sixth in the series, was required for terrequinone A. In this pilot experiment, these findings experimentally validate LaeA-based predictions of the terrequinone biosynthetic locus boundaries. Further, this study identifies TdiE as a protein of unknown yet essential function for terrequinone A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type II Polyketide Synthases Abstract: Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large-scale analysis of type II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type II polyketide synthase-derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.	1
Title: Assembling the glycopeptide antibiotic scaffold: The biosynthesis of A47934 from Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL15009 Abstract: The glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin are vital components of modern anti-infective chemotherapy exhibiting outstanding activity against Gram-positive pathogens including members of the genera Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus. These antibiotics also provide fascinating examples of the chemical and associated biosynthetic complexity exploitable in the synthesis of natural products by actinomycetes group of bacteria. We report the sequencing and annotation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide antibiotic from Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL15009, the first complete sequence for a teicoplanin class glycopeptide. The cluster includes 34 ORFs encompassing 68 kb and includes all of the genes predicted to be required to synthesize and regulate its biosynthesis. The gene cluster also contains ORFs encoding enzymes responsible for glycopeptide resistance. This role was confirmed by insertional inactivation of the d-Ala-d-lactate ligase, vanAst, which resulted in the predicted -sensitive phenotype and impaired antibiotic biosynthesis. These results provide increased understanding of the biosynthesis of these complex natural products.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Enterotoxic Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Natural Product Tilivalline Abstract: The nonribosomal enterotoxin tilivalline was the first naturally occurring pyrrolobenzodiazepine to be linked to disease in the human intestine. Since the producing organism Klebsiella oxytoca is part of the intestinal microbiota and the pyrrolobenzodiazepine causes the pathogenesis of colitis it is important to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of tilivalline activity. Here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and show that this nonribosomal peptide assembly pathway initially generates tilimycin, a simple pyrrolobenzodiazepine with cytotoxic properties. Tilivalline results from the non-enzymatic spontaneous reaction of tilimycin with biogenetically generated indole. Through a chemical total synthesis of tilimycin we could corroborate the predictions made about the biosynthesis. Production of two cytotoxic pyrrolobenzodiazepines with distinct functionalities by human gut resident Klebsiella oxytoca has important implications for intestinal disease.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of the epoxidase catalyzing the formation of fosfomycin from Pseudomonas syringae Abstract: The final step in the biosynthesis of fosfomycin in Streptomyces wedmorensis is catalyzed by ( S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid (HPP) epoxidase ( Sw-HppE). A homologous enzyme from Pseudomonas syringae whose encoding gene ( orf3) shares a relatively low degree of sequence homology with the corresponding Sw-HppE gene has recently been isolated. This purified P. syringae protein was determined to catalyze the epoxidation of ( S)-HPP to fosfomycin and the oxidation of ( R)-HPP to 2-oxopropylphosphonic acid under the same conditions as Sw-HppE. Therefore, this protein is indeed a true HPP epoxidase and is termed Ps-HppE. Like Sw-HppE, Ps-HppE was determined to be post-translationally modified by the hydroxylation of a putative active site tyrosine (Tyr95). Analysis of the Fe(II) center by EPR spectroscopy using NO as a spin probe and molecular oxygen surrogate reveals that Ps-HppE's metal center is similar, but not identical, to that of Sw-HppE. The identity of the rate-determining step for the ( S)-HPP and ( R)-HPP reactions was determined by measuring primary deuterium kinetic effects, and the outcome of these results was correlated with density functional theory calculations. Interestingly, the reaction using the nonphysiological substrate ( R)-HPP was 1.9 times faster than that with ( S)-HPP for both Ps-HppE and Sw-HppE. This is likely due to the difference in bond dissociation energy of the abstracted hydrogen atom for each respective reaction. Thus, despite the low level of amino acid sequence identity, Ps-HppE is a close mimic of Sw-HppE, representing a second example of a non-heme iron-dependent enzyme capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol to form a new C-O bond.	1
Title: Fused dithienogermolodithiophene low band gap polymers for high-performance organic solar cells without processing additives Abstract: We report the synthesis of a novel ladder-type fused ring donor, dithienogermolodithiophene, in which two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units are held coplanar by a bridging dialkyl germanium. Polymerization of this extended monomer with N-octylthienopyrrolodione by Stille polycondensation afforded a polymer, pDTTG-TPD, with an optical band gap of 1.75 eV combined with a high ionization potential. Bulk heterojunction solar cells based upon pDTTG-TPD:PC(71)BM blends afforded efficiencies up to 7.2% without the need for thermal annealing or processing additives.	0
Title: Adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid dynamics underlie mammary gland remodeling after lactation Abstract: Adipocytes undergo pronounced changes in size and behavior to support diverse tissue functions, but the mechanisms that control these changes are not well understood. Mammary gland-associated white adipose tissue (mgWAT) regresses in support of milk fat production during lactation and expands during the subsequent involution of milk-producing epithelial cells, providing one of the most marked physiological examples of adipose growth. We examined cellular mechanisms and functional implications of adipocyte and lipid dynamics in the mouse mammary gland (MG). Using in vivo analysis of adipocyte precursors and genetic tracing of mature adipocytes, we find mature adipocyte hypertrophy to be a primary mechanism of mgWAT expansion during involution. Lipid tracking and lipidomics demonstrate that adipocytes fill with epithelial-derived milk lipid. Furthermore, ablation of mgWAT during involution reveals an essential role for adipocytes in milk trafficking from, and proper restructuring of, the mammary epithelium. This work advances our understanding of MG remodeling and tissue-specific roles for adipocytes.	0
Title: The IPEA dilemma in CASPT2 Abstract: Multi-configurational second order perturbation theory (CASPT2) has become a very popular method for describing excited-state properties since its development in 1990. To account for systematic errors found in the calculation of dissociation energies, an empirical correction applied to the zeroth-order Hamiltonian, called the IPEA shift, was introduced in 2004. The errors were attributed to an unbalanced description of open-shell versus closed-shell electronic states and is believed to also lead to an underestimation of excitation energies. Here we show that the use of the IPEA shift is not justified and the IPEA should not be used to calculate excited states, at least for organic chromophores. This conclusion is the result of three extensive analyses. Firstly, we survey the literature for excitation energies of organic molecules that have been calculated with the unmodified CASPT2 method. We find that the excitation energies of 356 reference values are negligibly underestimated by 0.02 eV. This value is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected error based on the calculation of dissociation energies. Secondly, we perform benchmark full configuration interaction calculations on 137 states of 13 di- and triatomic molecules and compare the results with CASPT2. Also in this case, the excited states are underestimated by only 0.05 eV. Finally, we perform CASPT2 calculations with different IPEA shift values on 309 excited states of 28 organic small and medium-sized organic chromophores. We demonstrate that the size of the IPEA correction scales with the amount of dynamical correlation energy (and thus with the size of the system), and gets immoderate already for the molecules considered here, leading to an overestimation of the excitation energies. It is also found that the IPEA correction strongly depends on the size of the basis set. The dependency on both the size of the system and of the basis set, contradicts the idea of a universal IPEA shift which is able to compensate for systematic CASPT2 errors in the calculation of excited states.	0
Title: Alternative folding to a monomer or homopolymer is a common feature of the type 1 pilus subunit FimA from enteroinvasive bacteria Abstract: Adhesive type 1 pili from enteroinvasive, Gram-negative bacteria mediate attachment to host cells. Up to 3000 copies of the main pilus subunit, FimA, assemble into the filamentous, helical quaternary structure of the pilus rod via a mechanism termed donor-strand complementation, in which the N-terminal extension of each subunit, the donor strand, is inserted into the incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold of the preceding FimA subunit. For FimA from Escherichia coli, it has been previously shown that the protein can also adopt a monomeric, self-complemented conformation in which the donor strand is inserted intramolecularly in the opposite orientation relative to that observed for FimA polymers. Notably, soluble FimA monomers can act as apoptosis inhibitors in epithelial cells after uptake of type 1-piliated pathogens. Here, we show that the FimA orthologues from Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica can all fold to form self-complemented monomers. We solved X-ray structures of all three FimA monomers at 0.89-1.69 Å resolutions, revealing identical, intramolecular donor-strand complementation mechanisms. Our results also showed that the pseudo-palindromic sequences of the donor strands in all FimA proteins permit their alternative folding possibilities. All FimA monomers proved to be 50-60 kJ/mol less stable against unfolding than their pilus rod-like counterparts (which exhibited very high energy barriers of unfolding and refolding). We conclude that the ability of FimA to adopt an alternative, monomeric state with anti-apoptotic activity is a general feature of FimA proteins of type 1-piliated bacteria.	0
Title: Reassessment of the toxin profile of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 and function of putative sulfotransferases in synthesis of sulfated and sulfonated PSP toxins Abstract: The toxigenic freshwater cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 has been used as a model to study and elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydropurine neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). There are nevertheless several inconsistencies and contradictions in the toxin profile of this strain as published by different research groups, and claimed to include carbamoyl (STX, NEO, GTX2/3), decarbamoyl (dcSTX), and N-sulfocarbamoyl (C1/2, B1) derivatives. Our analysis of the complete genome of another PSP toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Raphidiopsis brookii D9, which is closely related to C. raciborskii T3, resolved many issues regarding the correlation between biosynthetic pathways, corresponding genes and the T3 toxin profile. The putative sxt gene cluster in R. brookii D9 has a high synteny with the T3 sxt cluster, with 100% nucleotide identity among the shared genes. We also compared the PSP toxin profile of the strains by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In contrast to published reports, our reassessment of the PSP toxin profile of T3 confirmed production of only STX, NEO and dcNEO. We gained significant insights via correlation between specific sxt genes and their role in PSP toxin synthesis in both D9 and T3 strains. In particular, analysis of sulfotransferase functions for SxtN (N-sulfotransferase) and SxtSUL (O-sulfotransferase) enzymes allowed us to propose an extension of the PSP toxin biosynthetic pathway from STX to the production of the derivatives GTX2/3, C1/2 and B1. This is a significantly revised view of the genetic mechanisms underlying synthesis of sulfated and sulfonated STX analogues in toxigenic cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Target-selective phototherapy using a ligand-based photosensitizer for type 2 cannabinoid receptor Abstract: Phototherapy is a powerful, noninvasive approach for cancer treatment, with several agents currently in clinical use. Despite the progress and promise, most current phototherapy agents have serious side effects as they can lead to damage to healthy tissue, even when the photosensitizers are fused to targeting molecules due to nonspecific light activation of the unbound photosensitizer. To overcome these limitations, we developed a phototherapy agent that combines a functional ligand and a near infrared phthalocyanine dye. Our target is type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R), considered an attractive therapeutic target for phototherapy given it is overexpressed by many types of cancers that are located at a surface or can be reached by an endoscope. We show that our CB2R-targeted phototherapy agent, IR700DX-mbc94, is specific for CB2R and effective only when bound to the target receptor. Overall, this opens up the opportunity for development of an alternative treatment option for CB2R-positive cancers.	0
Title: Macrolide resistance in microorganisms at antimicrobial-free Swine farms Abstract: To investigate the relationship between agricultural antimicrobial use and resistance, a variety of methods for quantification of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance were applied to organic swine farm manure samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to indirectly quantify the specific rRNA methylation resulting in MLS(B) resistance. Using this method, an unexpectedly high prevalence of ribosomal methylation and, hence, predicted MLS(B) resistance was observed in manure samples from two swine finisher farms that reported no antimicrobial use (37.6% +/- 6.3% and 40.5% +/- 5.4%, respectively). A culture-based method targeting relatively abundant clostridia showed a lower but still unexpectedly high prevalence of resistance at both farms (27.7% +/- 11.3% and 11.7% +/- 8.6%, respectively), while the prevalence of resistance in cultured fecal streptococci was low at both farms (4.0%). These differences in the prevalence of resistance across microorganisms suggest the need for caution when extrapolating from data obtained with indicator organisms. A third antimicrobial-free swine farm, a breeder-to-finisher operation, had low levels of MLS(B) resistance in manure samples with all methods used (<9%). Tetracycline antimicrobials were detected in manure samples from one of the finisher farms and may provide a partial explanation for the high level of MLS(B) resistance. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for a more fundamental understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial use and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.	0
Title: Structural and functional characterization of gene clusters directing nonribosomal synthesis of bioactive cyclic lipopeptides in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain FZB42 Abstract: The environmental strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 promotes plant growth and suppresses plant pathogenic organisms present in the rhizosphere. We sampled sequenced the genome of FZB42 and identified 2,947 genes with >50% identity on the amino acid level to the corresponding genes of Bacillus subtilis 168. Six large gene clusters encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) occupied 7.5% of the whole genome. Two of the PKS and one of the NRPS encoding gene clusters were unique insertions in the FZB42 genome and are not present in B. subtilis 168. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis revealed expression of the antibiotic lipopeptide products surfactin, fengycin, and bacillomycin D. The fengycin (fen) and the surfactin (srf) operons were organized and located as in B. subtilis 168. A large 37.2-kb antibiotic DNA island containing the bmy gene cluster was attributed to the biosynthesis of bacillomycin D. The bmy island was found inserted close to the fen operon. The responsibility of the bmy, fen, and srf gene clusters for the production of the corresponding secondary metabolites was demonstrated by cassette mutagenesis, which led to the loss of the ability to produce these peptides. Although these single mutants still largely retained their ability to control fungal spread, a double mutant lacking both bacillomycin D and fengycin was heavily impaired in its ability to inhibit growth of phytopathogenic fungi, suggesting that both lipopeptides act in a synergistic manner.	1
Title: Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076 harbours the largest actinomycete chromosome to date and the kistamicin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) have served as potent clinical drugs and as an inspiration to chemists in various disciplines. Among known GPAs, complestatin, chloropeptin, and kistamicin are unique in that they contain an unusual indole-phenol crosslink. The mechanism of formation of this linkage is unknown, and to date, the biosynthetic gene cluster of only one GPA with an indole-phenol crosslink, that of complestatin, has been identified. Here, we report the genome sequence of the kistamicin producer Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076. We find that this strain harbours the largest actinobacterial chromosome to date, consisting of a single linear chromosome of ∼13.1 Mbp. AntiSMASH analysis shows that ∼32 biosynthetic gene clusters and ∼10% of the genome are devoted to production of secondary metabolites, which include 1,6-dihydroxyphenazine and nomuricin, a new anthraquinone-type pentacyclic compound that we report herein. The kistamicin gene cluster (kis) was identified bioinformatically. A unique feature of kis is that it contains two cytochrome P450 enzymes, which likely catalyze three crosslinking reactions. These findings set the stage for examining the biosynthesis of kistamicin and its unusual indole-phenol crosslink in the future.	1
Title: Enhanced C30 carotenoid production in Bacillus subtilis by systematic overexpression of MEP pathway genes Abstract: Creating novel biosynthetic pathways and modulating the synthesis of important compounds are one of the hallmarks of synthetic biology. Understanding the key parameters controlling the flux of chemicals throughout a metabolic pathway is one of the challenges ahead. Isoprenoids are the most functionally and structurally diverse group of natural products from which numerous medicines and relevant fine chemicals are derived. The well-characterized and broadly used production organism Bacillus subtilis forms an ideal background for creating and studying novel synthetic routes. In comparison to other bacteria, B. subtilis emits the volatile compound isoprene, the smallest representative of isoprenoids, in high concentrations and thus represents an interesting starting point for an isoprenoid cell factory. In this study, the effect of systematic overexpression of the genes involved in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway on isoprenoid production in B. subtilis was investigated. B. subtilis strains harboring a plasmid containing C30 carotenoid synthetic genes, crtM and crtN, were combined with pHCMC04G plasmids carrying various synthetic operons of the MEP pathway genes. The levels of produced carotenoids, diaponeurosporene and diapolycopene, were used as indication of the role of the various enzymes on the flux of the MEP pathway. It was shown that the production of carotenoids can be increased significantly by overexpressing the MEP pathway enzymes. More broadly, the strains developed in this study can be used as a starting point for various isoprenoid cell factories.	0
Title: Regulation of c-myc and c-fos mRNA levels by polyomavirus: distinct roles for the capsid protein VP1 and the viral early proteins Abstract: The levels of c-myc, c-fos, and JE mRNAs accumulate in a biphasic pattern following infection of quiescent BALB/c 3T3 mouse cells with polyomavirus. Maximal levels of c-myc and c-fos mRNAs were seen within 1 hr and were nearly undetectable at 6 hr after infection. At 12 hr after infection mRNA levels were again maximal and remained elevated thereafter. Empty virions (capsids) and recombinant VP1 protein, purified from Escherichia coli, induced the early but not the late phase of mRNA accumulation. Virions, capsids, and recombinant VP1 protein stimulated [3H]thymidine nuclear labeling and c-myc mRNA accumulation in a dose-responsive manner paralleling their affinity for the cell receptor for polyoma. The second phase of mRNA accumulation is regulated by the viral early gene products, as shown by polyomavirus early gene mutants and by a transfected cell line (336a) expressing middle tumor antigen upon glucocorticoid addition. These results suggest that polyomavirus interacts with the cell membrane at the onset of infection to increase the levels of mRNA for cellular genes associated with cell competence for DNA replication, and subsequently these levels are maintained by the action of the early viral proteins.	0
Title: Correction to: Bioprospection of actinobacteria derived from freshwater sediments for their potential to produce antimicrobial compounds Abstract: Upon publication of this article [1], it was brought to our attention that Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are incorrectly presented in the original version of the article. The figures were inadvertently swapped in the original submission and published. Figure 3 should be treated as Fig. 5; Fig. 4 should be 3 and Fig. 5 should be Fig. 4.	0
Title: An Unconventional Mechanistic Insight into SCF3 Formation from Difluorocarbene: Preparation of 18 F-Labeled α-SCF3 Carbonyl Compounds Abstract: Trifluoromethylthiolation by sulfuration of difluorocarbene with elemental sulfur is described for the first time, which overrides long-standing trifluoromethyl anion-based theory. Mechanistic elucidation reveals an unprecedented chemical process for the formation of thiocarbonyl fluoride and also enables transition-metal-mediated trifluoromethylthiolation and [18 F]trifluoromethylthiolation of α-bromo carbonyl compounds with broad substrate scope and compatibility.	0
Title: A Highly Conserved Basidiomycete Peptide Synthetase Produces a Trimeric Hydroxamate Siderophore Abstract: The model white-rot basidiomycete, Ceriporiopsis (Gelatoporia) subvermispora B, encodes putative natural product biosynthesis genes. Among them is the gene for the seven-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase CsNPS2. It is a member of the as-yet-uncharacterized fungal type VI siderophore synthetase family, which is highly conserved and widely distributed among the basidiomycetes. These enzymes include only one adenylation (A) domain, i.e., one complete peptide synthetase module, and two thiolation/condensation (T-C) didomain partial modules which together constitute an AT1C1T2C2T3C3 domain setup. The full-length CsNPS2 enzyme (274.5 kDa) was heterologously produced as a polyhistidine fusion in Aspergillus niger as a soluble and active protein. N 5-acetyl-N 5-hydroxy-l-ornithine (l-AHO) and N 5-cis-anhydromevalonyl-N 5 -hydroxy-l-ornithine (l-AMHO) were accepted as the substrates, based on results of an in vitro substrate-dependent [32P]ATP-pyrophosphate radioisotope exchange assay. Full-length holo-CsNPS2 catalyzed amide bond formation between three l-AHO molecules to release the linear l-AHO trimer, called basidioferrin, as the product in vitro, which was verified by liquid chromatography-high-resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that type VI family siderophore synthetases are widespread in mushrooms and evolved in a common ancestor of basidiomycetes.IMPORTANCE The basidiomycete nonribosomal peptide synthetase CsNPS2 represents a member of a widely distributed but previously uninvestigated class (type VI) of fungal siderophore synthetases. Genes orthologous to CsNPS2 are highly conserved across various phylogenetic clades of the basidiomycetes. Hence, our work serves as a broadly applicable model for siderophore biosynthesis and iron metabolism in higher fungi. Also, our results on the amino acid substrate preference of CsNPS2 support a further understanding of the substrate selectivity of fungal adenylation domains. Methodologically, this report highlights the Aspergillus niger/SM-Xpress-based system as a suitable platform to heterologously express multimodular basidiomycete biosynthesis enzymes in the >250-kDa range in soluble and active form.	1
Title: Covalent inhibitors of human monoacylglycerol lipase: ligand-assisted characterization of the catalytic site by mass spectrometry and mutational analysis Abstract: The active site of recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged human monoacylglycerol lipase (hMGL) is characterized by mass spectrometry using the inhibitors 5-((biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2H-tetrazole-2-carboxamide (AM6701), and N-arachidonylmaleimide (NAM) as probes. Carbamylation of Ser(129) by AM6701 in the putative hMGL catalytic triad demonstrates this residue's essential role in catalysis. Partial NAM alkylation of hMGL cysteine residues 215 and/or 249 was sufficient to achieve approximately 80% enzyme inhibition. Although Cys(215) and/or Cys(249) mutations to alanine(s) did not affect hMGL hydrolytic activity as compared with nonmutated hMGL, the C215A displayed heightened NAM sensitivity, whereas the C249A evidenced reduced NAM sensitivity. These data conclusively demonstrate a sulfhydryl-based mechanism for NAM inhibition of hMGL in which Cys(249) is of paramount importance. Identification of amino acids critical to the catalytic activity and pharmacological modulation of hMGL informs the design of selective MGL inhibitors as potential drugs.	0
Title: Biosynthetic Study on Antihypercholesterolemic Agent Phomoidride: General Biogenesis of Fungal Dimeric Anhydrides Abstract: To elucidate the general biosynthetic pathway of fungal dimeric anhydrides, a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the antihy-percholesterolemic agent phomoidride was identified by heterologous expression of candidate genes encoding the highly reducing polyketide synthase, alkylcitrate synthase (ACS), and alkylcitrate dehydratase (ACDH). An in vitro analysis of ACS and ACDH revealed that they give rise to anhydride monomers. Based on the established monomer biosynthesis, we propose a general biogenesis of dimeric anhydrides involving a single donor unit and four acceptor units.	1
Title: An efficient approach for cloning the dNDP-glucose synthase gene from actinomycetes and its application in Streptomyces spectabilis, a spectinomycin producer Abstract: Specifically designed PCR primers were applied to amplify a segment of dTDP-glucose synthase gene from six actinomycete strains. About 300-bp or 580-bp DNA fragments were obtained from all the organisms tested. By DNA sequence analysis, seven amplified fragments showed high homology with dTDP-glucose synthase genes that participate in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites or in deoxy-sugar moieties in lipopolysaccharides. In addition, we have cloned a 45-kb region of DNA from Streptomyces spectabilis ATCC27741, a spectinomycin producer which contained the dTDP-glucose synthase and dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase genes named spcD and spcE, respectively. The spcE gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the activity was assayed in cell extracts. The enzyme showed substrate specificity only to dTDP-glucose.	1
Title: Oxidase domains in epothilone and bleomycin biosynthesis: thiazoline to thiazole oxidation during chain elongation Abstract: The natural products epothilone and bleomycin are assembled by hybrid polyketide/nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Of note in these assembly lines is the conversion of internal cysteine residues into thiazolines and their subsequent oxidation to heteroaromatic thiazole rings. We have excised the EpoB oxidase domain, EpoB-Ox, proposed to be responsible for thiazoline to thiazole oxidation in epothilone biosynthesis, and expressed it in soluble form in Escherichia coli. The purified domain is an FMN-containing flavoprotein that demonstrates thiazoline to thiazole oxidase activity when incubated with thioester substrate mimics. Kinetic parameters were determined for both thiazoline and oxazoline substrates, with k(cat) values ranging between 48.8 and 0.55 min(-1). While the physiological electron acceptor is not yet known, molecular oxygen is needed in these in vitro assays to mediate reoxidation of reduced FMN. Additionally, the oxidase domain-containing BlmIII from the bleomycin assembly line was heterologously expressed and purified. BlmIII is also an FMN-containing protein with activity similar to EpoB-Ox. This work marks the first direct characterization of nonribosomal peptide synthetase oxidase domain activity and will lead to further exploration of these flavoproteins.	1
Title: Molecular Basis for the Biosynthesis of an Unusual Chain-Fused Polyketide, Gregatin A Abstract: Gregatin A (1) is a fungal polyketide featuring an alkylated furanone core, but the biosynthetic mechanism to furnish the intriguing molecular skeleton has yet to be elucidated. Herein, we have identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of gregatin A (1) in Penicillium sp. sh18 and investigated the mechanism that produces the intriguing structure of 1 by in vivo and in vitro reconstitution of its biosynthesis. Our study established the biosynthetic route leading to 1 and illuminated that 1 is generated by the fusion of two different polyketide chains, which are, amazingly, synthesized by a single polyketide synthase GrgA with the aid of a trans-acting enoylreductase GrgB. Chain fusion, as well as chain hydrolysis, is catalyzed by an α/β hydrolase, GrgF, hybridizing the C11 and C4 carbon chains by Claisen condensation. Finally, structural analysis and mutational experiments using GrgF provided insight into how the enzyme facilitates the unusual chain-fusing reaction. In unraveling a new biosynthetic strategy involving a bifunctional PKS and a polyketide fusing enzyme, our study expands our knowledge concerning fungal polyketide biosynthesis.	1
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the beta-lactam antibiotic tabtoxin in Pseudomonas syringae Abstract: DNA sequence analysis revealed that the biosynthetic genes of the unusual beta-lactam antibiotic tabtoxin reside at the att site adjacent to the lysC tRNA gene in Pseudomonas syringae BR2. ORFs encoded within the region included ones with similarity to beta-lactam synthase and clavaminic acid synthase, as well as amino acid synthesis enzymes. Novel ORFs were present in a portion of the biosynthetic region associated with a toxin hypersensitivity phenotype. Tabtoxin resistance was associated with a fragment containing a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter gene.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of fluopsin C, a copper-containing antibiotic from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Metal-binding natural products contribute to metal acquisition and bacterial virulence, but their roles in metal stress response are underexplored. We show that a five-enzyme pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes a small-molecule copper complex, fluopsin C, in response to elevated copper concentrations. Fluopsin C is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that contains a copper ion chelated by two minimal thiohydroxamates. Biosynthesis of the thiohydroxamate begins with cysteine and requires two lyases, two iron-dependent enzymes, and a methyltransferase. The iron-dependent enzymes remove the carboxyl group and the α carbon from cysteine through decarboxylation, N-hydroxylation, and methylene excision. Conservation of the pathway in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria suggests a common role for fluopsin C in the copper stress response, which involves fusing copper into an antibiotic against other microbes.	1
Title: Antifungal and Cytotoxic β-Resorcylic Acid Lactones from a Paecilomyces Species Abstract: Eight new β-resorcylic acid lactones (RALs), including the hypothemycin-type compounds paecilomycins N-P (1-3) and the radicicol-type metabolites dechloropochonin I (4), monocillins VI (5) and VII (6), 4'-hydroxymonocillin IV (7), and 4'-methoxymonocillin IV (8), along with nine known RALs (9-17), were isolated from the cultures of Paecilomyces sp. SC0924. Compounds 1 and 2 feature a novel 6/11/5 ring system, and 3 is the first 5'-keto RAL. The structures of 1-8 were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and theoretical calculations of ECD spectra. Compounds 3, 5, and 6 exhibit cytotoxicity against MCF-7, A549, and HeLa cells, and compounds 5 and 7 display antifungal activity against Peronophythora litchii.	0
Title: Cloning, purification and characterization of a functional anthracycline glycosyltransferase Abstract: We have cloned the gene that encodes a novel glucosyl transferase (AraGT) involved in rhamnosylation of the polyketide antibiotic Aranciamycin in Streptomyces echinatus. AraGT comprises two domains characteristic of bacterial glycosyltranferases. AraGT was synthesized in E. coli as a decahistidinyl-tagged polypeptide. Purified AraGT is dimeric, displays a T(mapp) of 30 degrees C and can glycosylate the aglycone of an Aranciamycin derivative as shown by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The availability of functional AraGT will allow the generation Aranciamycin-based combinatorial libraries.	1
Title: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing and heterologous expression of the medermycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. AM-7161: towards comparative analysis of the benzoisochromanequinone gene clusters Abstract: Medermycin is a Streptomyces aromatic C-glycoside antibiotic classified in the benzoisochromanequinones (BIQs), which presents several interesting biosynthetic problems concerning polyketide synthase (PKS), post-PKS tailoring and deoxysugar pathways. The biosynthetic gene cluster for medermycin (the med cluster) was cloned from Streptomyces sp. AM-7161. Completeness of the clone was proved by the heterologous expression of a cosmid carrying the entire med cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor CH999 to produce medermycin. The DNA sequence of the cosmid (36 202 bp) revealed 34 complete ORFs, with an incomplete ORF at either end. Functional assignment of the deduced products was made for PKS and biosynthetically related enzymes, tailoring steps including strereochemical control, oxidation, angolosamine pathway, C-glycosylation, and regulation. The med cluster was estimated to be about 30 kb long, covering 29 ORFs. An unusual characteristic of the cluster is the disconnected organization of the minimal PKS genes: med-ORF23 encoding the acyl carrier protein is 20 kb apart from med-ORF1 and med-ORF2 for the two ketosynthase components. Secondly, the six genes (med-ORF14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 20) for the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar, angolosamine, are all contiguous. Finally, the finding of a glycosyltransferase gene, med-ORF8, suggests a possible involvement of conventional C-glycosylation in medermycin biosynthesis. Comparison among the three complete BIQ gene clusters - med and those for actinorhodin (act) and granaticin (gra) - revealed some common genes whose deduced functions are unavailable from database searches (the 'unknowns'). An example is med-ORF5, a homologue of actVI-ORF3 and gra-ORF18, which was highlighted by a recent proteomic analysis of S. coelicolor A3(2).	1
Title: Molecular Basis for Spirocycle Formation in the Paraherquamide Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: The paraherquamides are potent anthelmintic natural products with complex heptacyclic scaffolds. One key feature of these molecules is the spiro-oxindole moiety that lends a strained three-dimensional architecture to these structures. The flavin monooxygenase PhqK was found to catalyze spirocycle formation through two parallel pathways in the biosynthesis of paraherquamides A and G. Two new paraherquamides (K and L) were isolated from a ΔphqK strain of Penicillium simplicissimum, and subsequent enzymatic reactions with these compounds generated two additional metabolites, paraherquamides M and N. Crystal structures of PhqK in complex with various substrates provided a foundation for mechanistic analyses and computational studies. While it is evident that PhqK can react with various substrates, reaction kinetics and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the dioxepin-containing paraherquamide L is the favored substrate. Through this effort, we have elucidated a key step in the biosynthesis of the paraherquamides and provided a rationale for the selective spirocyclization of these powerful anthelmintic agents.	1
Title: Molecular genetic characterization of the thermostable L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200 and biochemical characterization of the enzyme Abstract: The structural gene ldhL for a thermostable L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase was cloned from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200. The nucleotide sequence of the ldhL gene was determined and shown to have the capacity to encode a protein of 311 amino acids (33.5 kDa). By 5'-RACE analysis, the ldhL transcription start point was confirmed to be derived from the -10 region closest to the initiation codon. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by nickel-affinity chromatography. It was shown to be allosteric in the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme were 5.8 and 60 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic in the pyruvate reduction and 7.0 and 70 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic in the lactate oxidation reaction, respectively. The kinetic parameters K(m,app) and k(cat,app) for pyruvate were 0.18 mM and 520 U/mg, respectively, and in the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a 1.2-fold increase in K(m,app) and a 16-fold decrease in k(cat,app) were determined. The K(m,app) and k(cat,app) values for lactate were 60 mM and 0.58 U/mg, respectively, and they were not affected by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme was greatly inhibited by Zn2+, Ag(+), Cu2+, Fe3+, and Pb(3+). The extreme thermostability of the enzyme was reflected in its unaltered activity over 5 h at 70 degrees C.	0
Title: Selective phosphorylation modulates the PIP2 sensitivity of the CaM-SK channel complex Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the activities of many membrane proteins, including ion channels, through direct interactions. However, the affinity of PIP2 is so high for some channel proteins that its physiological role as a modulator has been questioned. Here we show that PIP2 is a key cofactor for activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SKs) by Ca(2+)-bound calmodulin (CaM). Removal of the endogenous PIP2 inhibits SKs. The PIP2-binding site resides at the interface of CaM and the SK C terminus. We further demonstrate that the affinity of PIP2 for its target proteins can be regulated by cellular signaling. Phosphorylation of CaM T79, located adjacent to the PIP2-binding site, by casein kinase 2 reduces the affinity of PIP2 for the CaM-SK channel complex by altering the dynamic interactions among amino acid residues surrounding the PIP2-binding site. This effect of CaM phosphorylation promotes greater channel inhibition by G protein-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2.	0
Title: Co-occurrence of enzyme domains guides the discovery of an oxazolone synthetase Abstract: Multidomain enzymes orchestrate two or more catalytic activities to carry out metabolic transformations with increased control and speed. Here, we report the design and development of a genome-mining approach for targeted discovery of biochemical transformations through the analysis of co-occurring enzyme domains (CO-ED) in a single protein. CO-ED was designed to identify unannotated multifunctional enzymes for functional characterization and discovery based on the premise that linked enzyme domains have evolved to function collaboratively. Guided by CO-ED, we targeted an unannotated predicted ThiF-nitroreductase di-domain enzyme found in more than 50 proteobacteria. Through heterologous expression and biochemical reconstitution, we discovered a series of natural products containing the rare oxazolone heterocycle and characterized their biosynthesis. Notably, we identified the di-domain enzyme as an oxazolone synthetase, validating CO-ED-guided genome mining as a methodology with potential broad utility for both the discovery of unusual enzymatic transformations and the functional annotation of multidomain enzymes.	1
Title: Genetic and biosynthetic studies of the fungal prenylated xanthone shamixanthone and related metabolites in Aspergillus spp. revisited Abstract: Biosynthetic genes for the prenylated xanthone shamixanthone have been identified in the Aspergillus nidulans genome; based on assignment of putative functions from sequence analyses and selected gene deletions, a pathway was proposed leading from the anthraquinone emodin via the benzophenone carboxylic acid monodictyphenone and the xanthone emericellin to shamixanthone. Several aspects of this proposed pathway are inconsistent with previously identified biosynthetic intermediates: the anthraquinone chrysophanol and the benzophenone aldehyde derivatives arugosins F and A/B, isotopic labelling studies and chemical precedents. A new pathway is presented that provides a full rationale for the results of the gene deletion studies and reconciles them with previous biosynthetic results, and is in accord with established chemical and biosynthetic mechanisms. The importance of interpreting genetic information in terms of established biosynthetic events is discussed.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of genes from the kinamycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces murayamaensis Abstract: The genes for most of the biosynthesis of the kinamycin antibiotics have been cloned and heterologously expressed. Genomic DNA of Streptomyces murayamaensis was partially digested with MboI and a library of approximately 40 kb fragments in E. coli XL1-BlueMR was prepared using the cosmid vector pOJ446. Hybridization with the actI probe from the actinorhodin polyketide synthase genes identified two clusters of polyketide genes. After transferal of these clusters to S. lividans ZX7, expression of one cluster was established by HPLC with photodiode array detection. Peaks were identified from the kin cluster for dehydrorabelomycin, kinobscurinone, and stealthin C, which are known intermediates in kinamycin biosynthesis. Two shunt metabolites, kinafluorenone and seongomycin were also identified. The structure of the latter was determined from a quantity obtained from large-scale fermentation of one of the clones.	1
Title: Nitric oxide as a source for bacterial triazole biosynthesis Abstract: The heterocycle 1,2,3-triazole is among the most versatile chemical scaffolds and has been widely used in diverse fields. However, how nature creates this nitrogen-rich ring system remains unknown. Here, we report the biosynthetic route to the triazole-bearing antimetabolite 8-azaguanine. We reveal that its triazole moiety can be assembled through an enzymatic and non-enzymatic cascade, in which nitric oxide is used as a building block. These results expand our knowledge of the physiological role of nitric oxide synthase in building natural products with a nitrogen-nitrogen bond, and should also inspire the development of synthetic biology approaches for triazole production.	1
Title: Taburnaemines A-I, Cytotoxic Vobasinyl-Iboga-Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Tabernaemontana corymbosa Abstract: Nineteen vobasinyl-ibogan-type bisindole alkaloids, including nine new compounds, taburnaemines A-I (1-9), were isolated from the twigs and leaves of Tabernaemontana corymbosa. The structures and absolute configurations of the new alkaloids were determined by a combination of MS, NMR, and ECD analyses. Alkaloids 1-5 contain a rare 1,3-oxazinane moiety in the vobasinyl unit, while 6 has an uncommon 1,3-oxazolidine moiety in the iboga unit. The absolute configurations of alkaloid 1 and the known alkaloid tabernaecorymbosine A (10) were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All of the bisindole alkaloids, except 2 and 16'-decarbomethoxytabernaecorymbosine A (14), showed antiproliferative activity (IC50 2.6-9.8 μM) against several human cancer cell lines, including A-549, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, KB, and P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant KB cells. The preliminary structure-activity relationship correlations are also discussed.	0
Title: The partitioned Rhizobium etli genome: genetic and metabolic redundancy in seven interacting replicons Abstract: We report the complete 6,530,228-bp genome sequence of the symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacterium Rhizobium etli. Six large plasmids comprise one-third of the total genome size. The chromosome encodes most functions necessary for cell growth, whereas few essential genes or complete metabolic pathways are located in plasmids. Chromosomal synteny is disrupted by genes related to insertion sequences, phages, plasmids, and cell-surface components. Plasmids do not show synteny, and their orthologs are mostly shared by accessory replicons of species with multipartite genomes. Some nodulation genes are predicted to be functionally related with chromosomal loci encoding for the external envelope of the bacterium. Several pieces of evidence suggest an exogenous origin for the symbiotic plasmid (p42d) and p42a. Additional putative horizontal gene transfer events might have contributed to expand the adaptive repertoire of R. etli, because they include genes involved in small molecule metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation. Twenty-three putative sigma factors, numerous isozymes, and paralogous families attest to the metabolic redundancy and the genomic plasticity necessary to sustain the lifestyle of R. etli in symbiosis and in the soil.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of a gene cluster for synthesis of the polyketide antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol from Pseudomonas fluorescens Q2-87 Abstract: The polyketide metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) is produced by many strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. with biocontrol activity against soilborne fungal plant pathogens. Genes required for 2,4-DAPG synthesis by P. fluorescens Q2-87 are encoded by a 6.5-kb fragment of genomic DNA that can transfer production of 2,4-DAPG to 2,4-DAPG-nonproducing recipient Pseudomonas strains. In this study the nucleotide sequence was determined for the 6.5-kb fragment and flanking regions of genomic DNA from strain Q2-87. Six open reading frames were identified, four of which (phlACBD) comprise an operon that includes a set of three genes (phlACB) conserved between eubacteria and archaebacteria and a gene (phlD) encoding a polyketide synthase with homology to chalcone and stilbene synthases from plants. The biosynthetic operon is flanked on either side by phlE and phlF, which code respectively for putative efflux and regulatory (repressor) proteins. Expression in Escherichia coli of phlA, phlC, phlB, and phlD, individually or in combination, identified a novel polyketide biosynthetic pathway in which PhlD is responsible for the production of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG). PhlA, PhlC, and PhlB are necessary to convert MAPG to 2,4-DAPG, and they also may function in the synthesis of MAPG.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Heptacyclic Duclauxins Requires Extensive Redox Modifications of the Phenalenone Aromatic Polyketide Abstract: Duclauxins are dimeric and heptacyclic fungal polyketides with notable bioactivities. We characterized the cascade of redox transformations in the biosynthetic pathway of duclauxin from Talaromyces stipitatus. The redox reaction sequence is initiated by a cupin family dioxygenase DuxM that performs an oxidative cleavage of the peri-fused tricyclic phenalenone and affords a transient hemiketal-oxaphenalenone intermediate. Additional redox enzymes then morph the oxaphenoalenone into either an anhydride or a dihydrocoumarin-containing monomeric building block that is found in dimeric duxlauxins. Oxidative coupling between the monomers to form the initial C-C bond was shown to be catalyzed by a P450 monooxygenase, although the enzyme responsible for the second C-C bond formation was not found in the pathway. Collectively, the number and variety of redox enzymes used in the duclauxin pathway showcase Nature's strategy to generate structural complexity during natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification and analysis of the core biosynthetic machinery of tubulysin, a potent cytotoxin with potential anticancer activity Abstract: Myxobacteria are well known for their biosynthetic potential, especially for the production of cytotoxic compounds with potential anticancer activities. The tubulysins are currently in preclinical development. They are produced in very low quantities, and genetic manipulation of producing strains has never been accomplished. We report the development of a mariner-based transposon mutagenesis system for Angiococcus disciformis An d48. Extracts from a library of 1200 mutants were analyzed for the presence of tubulysin by a microscopic cell nucleus fragmentation bioassay. The transposition sites of four tubulysin-negative mutants were identified by vector recovery, which led to the identification and the sequencing of the corresponding core biosynthetic gene locus. Sequence analysis of more than 80,000 bp reveals an unusual multimodular hybrid polyketide synthase/peptide synthetase assembly line with a variety of unprecedented features.	1
Title: Modular and Single-Cell Sensors of Bacterial Ser/Thr Kinase Activity Abstract: At the single-cell level, protein kinase activity is typically inferred from downstream transcriptional reporters. However, promoters are often coregulated by several pathways, making the activity of a specific kinase difficult to deconvolve. Here, we present modular, direct, and specific sensors of bacterial kinase activity, including FRET-based sensors, as well as a synthetic transcription factor based on the lactose repressor (LacI) that has been engineered to respond to phosphorylation. We demonstrate the utility of these sensors in measuring the activity of PrkC, a conserved bacterial Ser/Thr kinase, in different growth conditions from single cells to colonies. We also show that PrkC activity increases in response to a cell-wall active antibiotic that blocks the late steps in peptidoglycan synthesis (cefotaxime), but not the early steps (fosfomycin). These sensors have a modular design that should generalize to other bacterial signaling systems in the future.	0
Title: Highly effective, regiospecific reduction of chalcone by cyanobacteria leads to the formation of dihydrochalcone: two steps towards natural sweetness Abstract: Background:                       Chalcones are the biogenetic precursors of all known flavonoids, which play an essential role in various metabolic processes in photosynthesizing organisms. The use of whole cyanobacteria cells in a two-step, light-catalysed regioselective bio-reduction of chalcone, leading to the formation of the corresponding dihydrochalcone, is reported. The prokaryotic microalgae cyanobacteria are known to produce phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, as natural components of cells. It seems logical that organisms producing such compounds possess a suitable "enzymatic apparatus" to carry out their biotransformation. Therefore, determination of the ability of whole cells of selected cyanobacteria to carry out biocatalytic transformations of chalcone, the biogenetic precursor of all known flavonoids, was the aim of our study.                  Results:                       Chalcone was found to be converted to dihydrochalcone by all examined cyanobacterial strains; however, the effectiveness of this process depends on the strain with biotransformation yields ranging from 3% to >99%. The most effective biocatalysts are Anabaena laxa, Aphanizomenon klebahnii, Nodularia moravica, Synechocystis aquatilis (>99% yield) and Merismopedia glauca (92% yield). The strains Anabaena sp. and Chroococcus minutus transformed chalcone in more than one way, forming a few products; however, dihydrochalcone was the dominant product. The course of biotransformation shed light on the pathway of chalcone conversion, indicating that the process proceeds through the intermediate cis-chalcone. The scaled-up process, conducted on a preparative scale and by using a mini-pilot photobioreactor, fully confirmed the high effectiveness of this bioconversion. Moreover, in the case of the mini-pilot photobioreactor batch cultures, the optimization of culturing conditions allowed the shortening of the process conducted by A. klebahnii by 50% (from 8 to 4 days), maintaining its >99% yield.                  Conclusions:                       This is the first report related to the use of whole cells of halophilic and freshwater cyanobacteria strains in a two-step, light-catalysed regioselective bio-reduction of chalcone, leading to the formation of the corresponding dihydrochalcone. The total bioconversion of chalcone in analytical, preparative, and mini-pilot scales of this process creates the possibility of its use in the food industry for the production of natural sweeteners.	0
Title: Discovery of Influenza Polymerase PA-PB1 Interaction Inhibitors Using an In Vitro Split-Luciferase Complementation-Based Assay Abstract: The limited therapeutic options and increasing drug-resistance call for next-generation influenza antivirals. Due to the essential function in viral replication and high sequence conservation among influenza viruses, influenza polymerase PA-PB1 protein-protein interaction becomes an attractive drug target. Here, we developed an in vitro split luciferase complementation-based assay to speed up screening of PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors. By screening 10,000 compounds, we identified two PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors, R160792 and R151785, with potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of influenza A and B viruses, including amantadine-, oseltamivir-, or dual resistant strains. Further mechanistic study reveals that R151785 inhibits PA nuclear localization, reduces the levels of viral RNAs and proteins, and inhibits viral replication at the intermediate stage, all of which are in line with its antiviral mechanism of action. Overall, we developed a robust high throughput-screening assay for screening broad-spectrum influenza antivirals targeting PA-PB1 interaction and identified R151785 as a promising antiviral drug candidate.	0
Title: A unique amino transfer mechanism for constructing the β-amino fatty acid starter unit in the biosynthesis of the macrolactam antibiotic cremimycin Abstract: Cremimycin is a 19-membered macrolactam glycoside antibiotic based on three distinctive substructures: 1) a β-amino fatty acid starter moiety, 2) a bicyclic macrolactam ring, and 3) a cymarose unit. To elucidate the biosynthetic machineries responsible for these three structures, the cremimycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The cmi gene cluster consists of 33 open reading frames encoding eight polyketide synthases, six deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, and a characteristic group of five β-amino-acid-transfer enzymes. Involvement of the gene cluster in cremimycin production was confirmed by a gene knockout experiment. Further, a feeding experiment demonstrated that 3-aminononanoate is a direct precursor of cremimycin. Two characteristic enzymes of the cremimycin-type biosynthesis were functionally characterized in vitro. The results showed that a putative thioesterase homologue, CmiS1, catalyzes the Michael addition of glycine to the β-position of a non-2-enoic acid thioester, followed by hydrolysis of the thioester to give N-carboxymethyl-3-aminononanoate. Subsequently, the resultant amino acid was oxidized by a putative FAD-dependent glycine oxidase homologue, CmiS2, to produce 3-aminononanoate and glyoxylate. This represents a unique amino transfer mechanism for β-amino acid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Emission of cyanobacterial volatile organic compounds and their roles in blooms Abstract: Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes and one of dominant species in eutrophicated waters, which easily burst blooms in summer with high irradiance and temperature conditions. In response to high irradiance, high temperature, and nutrient conditions, cyanobacteria release abundant of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by up-regulating related gene expression and oxidatively degrading β-carotene. These VOCs not only increase offensive odor in waters, but also transfer allelopathic signals to algae and aquatic plants, resulting in cyanobacteria dominating eutrophicated waters. Among these VOCs, β-cyclocitral, α-ionone, β-ionone, limonene, longifolene, and eucalyptol have been identified as the main allelopathic agents, which even directly kill algae by inducing programmed cell death (PCD). The VOCs released from cyanobacteria, especially the ruptured cells, exhibit repelling effects on the herbivores, which is beneficial to survival of the population. Cyanobacterial VOCs might transfer aggregating information among homogeneous species, so the acceptors initiate aggregation to resist the coming stresses. It can be speculated that the adverse conditions can promote VOC emission from cyanobacteria, which play important roles in cyanobacteria dominating eutrophicated waters and even bursting blooms.	0
Title: The Swinholide Biosynthesis Gene Cluster from a Terrestrial Cyanobacterium, Nostoc sp. Strain UHCC 0450 Abstract: Swinholides are 42-carbon ring polyketides with a 2-fold axis of symmetry. They are potent cytotoxins that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. Swinholides were discovered from the marine sponge Theonella sp. and were long suspected to be produced by symbiotic bacteria. Misakinolide, a structural variant of swinholide, was recently demonstrated to be the product of a symbiotic heterotrophic proteobacterium. Here, we report the production of swinholide A by an axenic strain of the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain UHCC 0450. We located the 85-kb trans-AT polyketide synthase (PKS) swinholide biosynthesis gene cluster from a draft genome of Nostoc sp. UHCC 0450. The swinholide and misakinolide biosynthesis gene clusters share an almost identical order of catalytic domains, with 85% nucleotide sequence identity, and they group together in phylogenetic analysis. Our results resolve speculation around the true producer of swinholides and demonstrate that bacteria belonging to two distantly related phyla both produce structural variants of the same natural product. In addition, we described a biosynthesis cluster from Anabaena sp. strain UHCC 0451 for the synthesis of the cytotoxic and antifungal scytophycin. All of these biosynthesis gene clusters were closely related to each other and created a group of cytotoxic macrolide compounds produced by trans-AT PKSs of cyanobacteria and proteobacteria.IMPORTANCE Many of the drugs in use today originate from natural products. New candidate compounds for drug development are needed due to increased drug resistance. An increased knowledge of the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds can be used to aid chemical synthesis to produce novel drugs. Here, we show that a terrestrial axenic culture of Nostoc cyanobacterium produces swinholides, which have been previously found only from marine sponge or samples related to them. Swinholides are polyketides with a 2-fold axis of symmetry, and they are potent cytotoxins that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. We describe the biosynthesis gene clusters of swinholide from Nostoc cyanobacteria, as well as the related cytotoxic and antifungal scytophycin from Anabaena cyanobacteria, and we study the evolution of their trans-AT polyketide synthases. Interestingly, swinholide is closely related to misakinolide produced by a symbiotic heterotrophic proteobacterium, demonstrating that bacteria belonging to two distantly related phyla and different habitats can produce similar natural products.	1
Title: Direct synthesis of β-N-glycosides by the reductive glycosylation of azides with protected and native carbohydrate donors Abstract: A simple and straightforward method for the stereocontrolled synthesis of β-linked N-glycosides uses alkyl and aryl azides as the nitrogen source. The N-glycosides are formed in high yields and with high β selectivities (typically >70% yield, >15:1 β:α selectivity). This approach is also amenable to the synthesis of N-glycosylated amino acids and peptides (see example, Fmoc=9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl).	0
Title: Cross-talk between a regulatory small RNA, cyclic-di-GMP signalling and flagellar regulator FlhDC for virulence and bacterial behaviours Abstract: Dickeya dadantii is a globally dispersed phytopathogen which causes diseases on a wide range of host plants. This pathogen utilizes the type III secretion system (T3SS) to suppress host defense responses, and secretes pectate lyase (Pel) to degrade the plant cell wall. Although the regulatory small RNA (sRNA) RsmB, cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and flagellar regulator have been reported to affect the regulation of these two virulence factors or multiple cell behaviours such as motility and biofilm formation, the linkage between these regulatory components that coordinate the cell behaviours remain unclear. Here, we revealed a sophisticated regulatory network that connects the sRNA, c-di-GMP signalling and flagellar master regulator FlhDC. We propose multi-tiered regulatory mechanisms that link the FlhDC to the T3SS through three distinct pathways including the FlhDC-FliA-YcgR3937 pathway; the FlhDC-EcpC-RpoN-HrpL pathway; and the FlhDC-rsmB-RsmA-HrpL pathway. Among these, EcpC is the most dominant factor for FlhDC to positively regulate T3SS expression.	0
Title: Four gene products are required for the fungal synthesis of the indole-diterpene, paspaline Abstract: Paspaline belongs to a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of indole-diterpenes synthesized by filamentous fungi. However, the identity of the gene products required for the biosynthesis of paspaline, a key intermediate for the synthesis of paxilline and other indole-diterpenes, is not known. Transfer of constructs containing different pax gene combinations into a paxilline negative deletion derivative of Penicillium paxilli demonstrated that just four proteins, PaxG, a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, PaxM, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, PaxB, a putative membrane protein, and PaxC, a prenyl transferase, are required for the biosynthesis of paspaline.	1
Title: Type III secretion system 1 genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus are positively regulated by ExsA and negatively regulated by ExsD Abstract: Vibrio parahaemolyticus harbours two distinct type III secretion systems (T3SS1 and T3SS2). A subset of 10 T3SS1 genes are transcribed when V. parahaemolyticus is grown in tissue culture medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)], while transcription of these genes (except exsD) is minimal upon growth in Luria-Bertani-Salt (LB-S). Transcription of T3SS1 genes and cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells was prevented by deletion of exsA while complementation with exsA restored these traits. Overexpression of ExsA in the wild-type strain, NY-4, activated the transcription of T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in LB-S. Thus, ExsA is necessary and sufficient to induce the transcription of T3SS1 genes. Deletion of the exsD permitted the transcription of T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in the LB-S medium and complementation with the wild-type exsD gene-blocked transcription of T3SS1 genes. Overexpression of ExsD in NY-4 prevented the transcription of T3SS1 gene when bacteria were grown in DMEM. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that purified ExsA protein binds a novel motif in the upstream region of vp1668 and vp1687, indicating that ExsA interacts directly with the promoter sequences of T3SS1 genes. ExsA positively regulates the expression and secretion of Vp1656 while ExsD negatively regulates the expression and secretion of Vp1656.	0
Title: Metabolome profiling reveals metabolic cooperation between Bacillus megaterium and Ketogulonicigenium vulgare during induced swarm motility Abstract: The metabolic cooperation in the ecosystem of Bacillus megaterium and Ketogulonicigenium vulgare was investigated by cultivating them spatially on a soft agar plate. We found that B. megaterium swarmed in a direction along the trace of K. vulgare on the agar plate. Metabolomics based on gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) was employed to analyze the interaction mechanism between the two microorganisms. We found that the microorganisms interact by exchanging a number of metabolites. Both intracellular metabolism and cell-cell communication via metabolic cooperation were essential in determining the population dynamics of the ecosystem. The contents of amino acids and other nutritional compounds in K. vulgare were rather low in comparison to those in B. megaterium, but the levels of these compounds in the medium surrounding K. vulgare were fairly high, even higher than in fresh medium. Erythrose, erythritol, guanine, and inositol accumulated around B. megaterium were consumed by K. vulgare upon its migration. The oxidization products of K. vulgare, including 2-keto-gulonic acids (2KGA), were sharply increased. Upon coculturing of B. megaterium and K. vulgare, 2,6-dipicolinic acid (the biomarker of sporulation of B. megaterium), was remarkably increased compared with those in the monocultures. Therefore, the interactions between B. megaterium and K. vulgare were a synergistic combination of mutualism and antagonism. This paper is the first to systematically identify a symbiotic interaction mechanism via metabolites in the ecosystem established by two isolated colonies of B. megaterium and K. vulgare.	0
Title: Total Synthesis of Scytonemide A Employing Weinreb AM Solid-Phase Resin Abstract: The human 20S proteasome inhibitor scytonemide A (1), a macrocyclic imine originally isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema hofmanni, was synthesized via a biomimetic solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach employing the Weinreb AM resin. Utilizing this approach, cyclization of the protected heptapeptide via formation of the imine bond occurred spontaneously upon cleavage from the resin in the presence of a reducing agent and subsequent aqueous workup. The final deprotection step necessary to produce the natural product was accomplished under slightly basic conditions, facilitating cleavage of the silyl ether group while leaving the macrocycle intact. Purification of the synthetic scytonemide A was accomplished via normal-phase flash column chromatography, potentially facilitating larger scale preparation of the compound necessary for future mechanistic and SAR studies. The structure of the target compound was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, which also shed light on differences in the spectroscopic data obtained for the synthetic and natural scytonemide A samples for some of the amide and alcohol signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.	0
Title: Geographical Distribution of Methanogenic Archaea in Nine Representative Paddy Soils in China Abstract: Paddy field methanogenic archaea are responsible for methane (CH4) production and contribute significantly to climate change. The information regarding the spatial variations in the abundance, the diversity and the composition of such ecologically important microbes, however, is quite limited at large scale. In this investigation, we studied the abundance, alpha diversity and geographical distribution of methanogenic archaeal communities in nine representative paddy sites, along a large latitudinal gradient in China, using pyrosequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. It is found that all paddy soils harbor constant methanogenic archaeal constituents, which is dominated by family Methanocellaceae (37.3%), Methanobacteriaceae (22.1%), Methanosaetaceae (17.2%), and Methanosarcinaceae (9.8%). Methanogenic archaeal abundance is primarily influenced by soil C (R = 0.612, P = 0.001) and N (R = 0.673, P = 0.001) contents, as well as alpha diversity by soil pH (PD: R = -0.552, P = 0.006; Chao1: R = -0.615, P = 0.002). Further exploration revealed that both spatial distance (R = 0.3469, P = 0.001, partial mental test) and soil chemical variables mainly about soil C and N (R = 0.2847, P = 0.001) are the two major factors affecting methanogenic archaeal community composition distribution in paddy soils. This finding will allow us to develop a better picture of the biogeographic ranges of these ecologically important microbes and get deeper insights into their ecology.	0
Title: The str gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 5'-hydroxystreptomycin in Streptomyces glaucescens GLA.0 (ETH 22794): new operons and evidence for pathway-specific regulation by StrR Abstract: Two divergently oriented operons, strXU and strVW, located within the gene cluster for 5'-hydroxystreptomycin (5'-OH-Sm) biosynthesis in Streptomyces glaucescens strain GAL.0 (ETH 22794), were analysed by DNA sequencing and transcription/regulation studies. Three genes, strU and strVW, are conserved in a similar arrangement but in a different location within the str/sts gene cluster of the Sm-producing strain S. griseus N2-3-11. The four putative products resemble NDP-4-ketohexose 3,5-epimerases (StrX, M(r) 20.2 kDa), NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases (StrU, 45.6 kDa), and ABC-transporters (StrV, 61.8 kDa; StrW, 63.4 kDa). These genes are apparently involved in the biosynthesis of 5'-OH-Sm because the promoters of both operons are activated in trans by the activator StrR of S. griseus N2-3-11, when cloned in S. lividans 66 TK23. A sequence motif resembling the consensus sequence GTTCGActG(N)11CagTcGAAc for binding of StrR was identified within the intergenic region of strX and strV. Specific binding of StrR to this site was demonstrated by gel retardation assays using purified His*Tag-StrR.	1
Title: Antimicrobial metabolites from the Paracel Islands sponge Agelas mauritiana Abstract: Four new alkaloids, (-)-8'-oxo-agelasine D (2), ageloxime B (3), (+)-2-oxo-agelasidine C (4), and 4-bromo-N-(butoxymethyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide (5), and the known compound (-)-ageloxime D (1) were isolated from the marine sponge Agelas mauritiana. Their chemical structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 3 both showed antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani in vitro. Compound 3 also exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureusin vitro.	0
Title: Discovery and characterization of a group of fungal polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferases Abstract: The prenyltransferase (PTase) gene vrtC was proposed to be involved in viridicatumtoxin (1) biosynthesis in Penicillium aethiopicum. Targeted gene deletion and reconstitution of recombinant VrtC activity in vitro established that VrtC is a geranyl transferase that catalyzes a regiospecific Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the naphthacenedione carboxamide intermediate 2 at carbon 6 with geranyl diphosphate. VrtC can function in the absence of divalent ions and can utilize similar naphthacenedione substrates, such as the acetyl-primed TAN-1612 (4). Genome mining using the VrtC protein sequence leads to the identification of a homologous group of PTase genes in the genomes of human and animal-associated fungi. Three enzymes encoded by this new subgroup of PTase genes from Neosartorya fischeri, Microsporum canis, and Trichophyton tonsurans were shown to be able to catalyze transfer of dimethylallyl to several tetracyclic naphthacenedione substrates in vitro. In total, seven C(5)- or C(10)-prenylated naphthacenedione compounds were generated. The regioselectivity of these new polycyclic PTases (pcPTases) was confirmed by characterization of product 9 obtained from biotransformation of 4 in Escherichia coli expressing the N. fischeri pcPTase gene. The discovery of this new subgroup of PTases extends our enzymatic tools for modifying polycyclic compounds and enables genome mining of new prenylated polyketides.	1
Title: Evaluation of Virulence Factors In vitro, Resistance to Osmotic Stress and Antifungal Susceptibility of Candida tropicalis Isolated from the Coastal Environment of Northeast Brazil Abstract: Several studies have been developed regarding human health risks associated with the recreational use of beaches contaminated with domestic sewage. These wastes contain various micro-organisms, including Candida tropicalis. In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize C. tropicalis isolates from the sandy beach of Ponta Negra, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, regarding the expression of in vitro virulence factors, adaptation to osmotic stress and susceptibility to antifungal drugs. We analyzed 62 environmental isolates and observed a great variation among them for the various virulence factors evaluated. In general, environmental isolates were more adherent to human buccal epithelial cells (HBEC) than C. tropicalis ATCC13803 reference strain, and they also showed increased biofilm production. Most of the isolates presented wrinkled phenotypes on Spider medium (34 isolates, 54.8%). The majority of the isolates also showed higher proteinase production than control strains, but low phospholipase activity. In addition, 35 isolates (56.4%) had high hemolytic activity (hemolysis index > 0.55). With regard to C. tropicalis resistance to osmotic stress, 85.4% of the isolates were able to grow in a liquid medium containing 15% sodium chloride. The strains were highly resistant to the azoles tested (fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole). Fifteen strains were resistant to the three azoles tested (24.2%). Some strains were also resistant to amphotericin B (14 isolates; 22.6%), while all of them were susceptible for the echinocandins tested, except for a single strain of intermediate susceptibility to micafungin. Our results demonstrate that C. tropicalis isolated from the sand can fully express virulence attributes and showed a high persistence capacity on the coastal environment; in addition of showing high minimal inhibitory concentrations to several antifungal drugs used in current clinical practice, demonstrating that environmental isolates may have pathogenic potential.	0
Title: Multiple entry pathways within the efflux transporter AcrB contribute to multidrug recognition Abstract: AcrB is the major multidrug exporter in Escherichia coli. Although several substrate-entrances have been identified, the specificity of these various transport paths remains unclear. Here we present evidence for a substrate channel (channel 3) from the central cavity of the AcrB trimer, which is connected directly to the deep pocket without first passing the switch-loop and the proximal pocket . Planar aromatic cations, such as ethidium, prefer channel 3 to channels 1 and 2. The efflux through channel 3 increases by targeted mutations and is not in competition with the export of drugs such as minocycline and erythromycin through channels 1 and 2. A switch-loop mutant, in which the pathway from the proximal to the deep pocket is hindered, can export only channel 3-utilizing drugs. The usage of multiple entrances thus contributes to the recognition and transport of a wide range of drugs with different physicochemical properties.	0
Title: A hybrid non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase containing fatty-acyl ligase (FAAL) synthesizes the β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides puwainaphycins in the Cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum alatosporum Abstract: A putative operon encoding the biosynthetic pathway for the cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides puwainphycins was identified in Cylindrospermum alatosporum. Bioinformatics analysis enabled sequential prediction of puwainaphycin biosynthesis; this process is initiated by the activation of a fatty acid residue via fatty acyl-AMP ligase and continued by a multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase. High-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements proved the production of puwainaphycin F/G congeners differing in FA chain length formed by either 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl dodecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahdoa) or 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl tetradecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahtea). Because only one puwainaphycin operon was recovered in the genome, we suggest that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase and one of the amino acid adenylation domains (Asn/Gln) show extended substrate specificity. Our results provide the first insight into the biosynthesis of frequently occurring β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides in cyanobacteria, which may facilitate analytical assessment and development of monitoring tools for cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and structures of cyclomarins and cyclomarazines, prenylated cyclic peptides of marine actinobacterial origin Abstract: Two new diketopiperazine dipeptides, cyclomarazines A and B, were isolated and characterized along with the new cyclic heptapeptide cyclomarin D from the marine bacterium Salinispora arenicola CNS-205. These structurally related cyclic peptides each contain modified amino acid residues, including derivatives of N-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-tryptophan and delta-hydroxyleucine, which are common in the di- and heptapeptide series. Stable isotope incorporation studies in Streptomyces sp. CNB-982, which was first reported to produce the cyclomarin anti-inflammatory agents, illuminated the biosynthetic building blocks associated with the major metabolite cyclomarin A, signifying that this marine microbial peptide is nonribosomally derived largely from nonproteinogenic amino acid residues. DNA sequence analysis of the 5.8 Mb S. arenicola circular genome and PCR-targeted gene inactivation experiments identified the 47 kb cyclomarin/cyclomarazine biosynthetic gene cluster (cym) harboring 23 open reading frames. The cym locus is dominated by the 23 358 bp cymA, which encodes a 7-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) responsible for assembly of the full-length cyclomarin heptapeptides as well as the truncated cyclomarazine dipeptides. The unprecedented biosynthetic feature of the megasynthetase CymA to synthesize differently sized peptides in vivo may be triggered by the level of beta oxidation of the priming tryptophan residue, which is oxidized in the cyclomarin series and unoxidized in the cyclomarazines. Biosynthesis of the N-(1,1-dimethyl-2,3-epoxypropyl)-beta-hydroxytryptophan residue of cyclomarin A was further illuminated through gene inactivation experiments, which suggest that the tryptophan residue is reverse prenylated by CymD prior to release of the cyclic peptide from the CymA megasynthetase, whereas the cytochrome P450 CymV installs the epoxide group on the isoprene of cyclomarin C post-NRPS assembly. Last, the novel amino acid residue 2-amino-3,5-dimethylhex-4-enoic acid in the cyclomarin series was shown by bioinformatics and stable isotope experiments to derive from a new pathway involving condensation of isobutyraldehyde and pyruvate followed by S-adenosylmethionine methylation. Assembly of this unsaturated, branched amino acid is unexpectedly related to the degradation of the environmental pollutant 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid.	1
Title: Expression, purification, and characterization of AknX anthrone oxygenase, which is involved in aklavinone biosynthesis in Streptomyces galilaeus Abstract: In streptomycete anthracycline biosynthetic gene clusters, small open reading frames are located just upstream of minimal polyketide synthase genes. aknX is such a gene found in the aklavinone-aclacinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces galilaeus. In order to identify its function, the aknX gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The cell extract prepared from E. coli cells overexpressing AknX protein exhibited anthrone oxygenase activity, which converted emodinanthrone to anthraquinone emodin. This indicates that AknX and related gene products such as DnrG and SnoaB are involved in the formation of aklanonic acid from its anthrone precursor, as suggested by their homology with TcmH and ActVA6. The AknX protein fused with a His(6) tag was efficiently purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity and anion-exchange column chromatography. The native molecular mass of AknX was estimated to be 42 kDa by gel filtration. Thus, native AknX is considered to have a homotrimeric subunit structure. AknX, like TcmH and ActVA6, possesses no apparent prosthetic group for oxygen activation. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify the key amino acid residue(s) involved in the oxygenation reaction. Of seven AknX mutants expressed, the W67F mutant showed significantly reduced oxygenase activity, suggesting the important role of the W67 residue in the AknX reaction. A possible mechanism for the reaction via peroxy anion intermediate is proposed.	1
Title: Identification and engineering of the cytochalasin gene cluster from Aspergillus clavatus NRRL 1 Abstract: Cytochalasins are a group of fungal secondary metabolites with diverse structures and bioactivities, including cytochalasin E produced by Aspergillus clavatus, which is a potent anti-angiogenic agent. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the cytochalasin gene cluster from A. clavatus NRRL 1. As a producer of cytochalasin E and K, the genome of A. clavatus was analyzed and the ∼30 kb ccs gene cluster was identified based on the presence of a polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetases (PKS-NRPS) and a putative Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO). Deletion of the central PKS-NRPS gene, ccsA, abolished the production of cytochalasin E and K, confirming the association between the natural products and the gene cluster. Based on bioinformatic analysis, a putative biosynthetic pathway is proposed. Furthermore, overexpression of the pathway specific regulator ccsR elevated the titer of cytochalasin E from 25mg/L to 175 mg/L. Our results not only shed light on the biosynthesis of cytochalasins, but also provided genetic tools for increasing and engineering the production.	1
Title: Direct and simultaneous observation of ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium Abstract: Understanding excited carrier dynamics in semiconductors is crucial for the development of photovoltaics and efficient photonic devices. However, overlapping spectral features in optical pump-probe spectroscopy often render assignments of separate electron and hole carrier dynamics ambiguous. Here, ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium nanocrystalline thin films are directly and simultaneously observed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet at the germanium M4,5 edge. We decompose the spectra into contributions of electronic state blocking and photo-induced band shifts at a carrier density of 8 × 1020 cm-3. Separate electron and hole relaxation times are observed as a function of hot carrier energies. A first-order electron and hole decay of ∼1 ps suggests a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination mechanism. The simultaneous observation of electrons and holes with extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy paves the way for investigating few- to sub-femtosecond dynamics of both holes and electrons in complex semiconductor materials and across junctions.	0
Title: Identification of a novel two-peptide lantibiotic, haloduracin, produced by the alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans C-125 Abstract: Complete genome sequencing of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans C-125 revealed the presence of several genes homologous to those involved in the production of lantibiotic peptides. Additional bioinformatic analysis identified a total of eleven genes, spanning a 15 kbp region, potentially involved in the production, modification, immunity and transport of a two-peptide lantibiotic. Having established that strain C-125 exhibited antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, it was demonstrated through peptide purification, MS and site-directed mutagenesis that this activity was indeed attributable to the production of a lantibiotic encoded by these genes. This antimicrobial has been designated haloduracin and represents the first occasion wherein production of two-peptide lantibiotic has been associated with a Bacillus sp. It is also the first example of a lantibiotic of any kind to be produced by an alkaliphilic species.	1
Title: Analysis of the carbapenem gene cluster of Erwinia carotovora: definition of the antibiotic biosynthetic genes and evidence for a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism Abstract: Members of two genera of Gram-negative bacteria, Serratia and Erwinia, produce a beta-lactam antibiotic, 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid. We have reported previously the cloning and sequencing of the genes responsible for production of this carbapenem in Erwinia carotovora. These genes are organized as an operon, carA--H, and are controlled by a LuxR-type transcriptional activator, encoded by the linked carR gene. We report in this paper the genetic dissection of this putative operon to determine the function of each of the genes. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the products of the first five genes of the operon are involved in the synthesis of the carbapenem molecule. Three of these, carABC, are absolutely required. In addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel carbapenem resistance mechanism, encoded by the CarF and carG genes. Both products of these overlapping and potentially translationally coupled genes have functional, N-terminal signal peptides. Removal of these genes from the Erwinia chromosome results in a carbapenem-sensitive phenotype. We assume that these novel beta-lactam resistance genes have evolved in concert with the biosynthetic genes to ensure 'self-resistance' in the Erwinia carbapenem producer.	1
Title: Hunting the eagle killer: A cyanobacterial neurotoxin causes vacuolar myelinopathy Abstract: Vacuolar myelinopathy is a fatal neurological disease that was initially discovered during a mysterious mass mortality of bald eagles in Arkansas in the United States. The cause of this wildlife disease has eluded scientists for decades while its occurrence has continued to spread throughout freshwater reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacuolar myelinopathy is induced by consumption of the epiphytic cyanobacterial species Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on aquatic vegetation, primarily the invasive Hydrilla verticillata Here, we describe the identification, biosynthetic gene cluster, and biological activity of aetokthonotoxin, a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid that is produced by the cyanobacterium A. hydrillicola We identify this cyanobacterial neurotoxin as the causal agent of vacuolar myelinopathy and discuss environmental factors-especially bromide availability-that promote toxin production.	1
Title: The response regulator PhoP negatively regulates Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis biofilms Abstract: A few Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains form biofilms on the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but numerous others do not. We show that a widely used Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, YPIII, is biofilm positive because of a mutation in phoP, which encodes the response regulator of a two-component system. For two wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis that do not make biofilms on C. elegans, deletion of phoP was sufficient to produce robust biofilms. In Yersinia pestis, a phoP mutant made more extensive biofilms in vitro than did the wild type. Expression of HmsT, a diguanylate cyclase that positively regulates biofilms, is diminished in Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with functional PhoP.	0
Title: ABC transporters and azole susceptibility in laboratory strains of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola Abstract: Laboratory strains of Mycosphaerella graminicola with decreased susceptibilities to the azole antifungal agent cyproconazole showed a multidrug resistance phenotype by exhibiting cross-resistance to an unrelated chemical, cycloheximide or rhodamine 6G, or both. Decreased azole susceptibility was found to be associated with either decreased or increased levels of accumulation of cyproconazole. No specific relationship could be observed between azole susceptibility and the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes MgAtr1 to MgAtr5 and the sterol P450 14alpha-demethylase gene, CYP51. ABC transporter MgAtr1 was identified as a determinant in azole susceptibility since heterologous expression of the protein reduced the azole susceptibility of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and disruption of MgAtr1 in one specific M. graminicola laboratory strain with constitutive MgAtr1 overexpression restored the level of susceptibility to cyproconazole to wild-type levels. However, the level of accumulation in the mutant with an MgAtr1 disruption did not revert to the wild-type level. We propose that variations in azole susceptibility in laboratory strains of M. graminicola are mediated by multiple mechanisms.	0
Title: Ni- and Pd-catalyzed synthesis of substituted and functionalized allylic boronates Abstract: Two highly efficient and convenient methods for the synthesis of functionalized and substituted allylic boronates are described. In one procedure, readily available allylic acetates are converted to allylic boronates catalyzed by Ni/PCy(3) or Ni/PPh(3) complexes with high levels of stereoselectivity and in good yields. Alternatively, the borylation can be accomplished with commercially available Pd catalysts [e.g., Pd(2)(dba)(3), PdCl(2), Pd/C], starting with easily accessed allylic halides.	0
Title: Fluorinated N,N-dialkylaminostilbenes repress colon cancer by targeting methionine S-adenosyltransferase 2A Abstract: Methionine S-adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) is the catalytic subunit for synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal methyl donor in many biological processes. MAT2A is up-regulated in many cancers, including liver cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) and is a potentially important drug target. We developed a family of fluorinated N,N-dialkylaminostilbene agents, called FIDAS agents, that inhibit the proliferation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Using a biotinylated FIDAS analogue, we identified the catalytic subunit of MAT2A as the direct and exclusive binding target of these FIDAS agents. MAT2B, an associated regulatory subunit of MAT2A, binds indirectly to FIDAS agents through its association with MAT2A. FIDAS agents inhibited MAT2A activity in SAM synthesis, and depletion of MAT2A by shRNAs inhibited CRC cell growth. A novel FIDAS agent delivered orally repressed CRC xenografts in athymic nude mice. These findings suggest that FIDAS analogues targeting MAT2A represent a family of novel and potentially useful agents for cancer treatment.	0
Title: pTOYAMAcos, pTYM18, and pTYM19, actinomycete-Escherichia coli integrating vectors for heterologous gene expression Abstract: A novel shuttle integration cosmid vector (pTOYAMAcos), based on pKU402, and shuttle integration vectors (pTYM18 and pTYM19) were constructed for the cloning of actinomycete DNA and its heterologous expression. These vectors contain oriT of an IncP transmissible plasmid in order to transfer genes by conjugation from Escherichia coli to actinomycetes, and they also contain int derived from actinophage phiC31 in order to integrate site-specifically into the chromosomal DNA. pTOYAMAcos contains the lambdacos site to promote packaging of vectors containing 35 to approximately 45-kb DNA fragments into lambda particles. pTYM18 and pTYM19 contain kanamaycin and thiostrepton resistance genes, respectively, and have multiple cloning sites including EcoRI and HindIII sites, which are available for blue/white screening in E. coli. To demonstrate the utility of these vectors, we expressed the entire gene cluster for rebeccamycin biosynthesis from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes using pTOYAMAcos and detected rebeccamycin production in transformed S. lividans. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of pTYM 19 in a gene-disruption complementation test. L. aerocolonigenes deltarebC strain, which is defective in rebeccamycin production because of a rebC deletion, was restored to rebeccamycin production by complemention by rebC cloned in pTYM 19.	1
Title: Target-based screen against a periplasmic serine protease that regulates intrabacterial pH homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) maintains its intrabacterial pH (pHIB) near neutrality in the acidic environment of phagosomes within activated macrophages. A previously reported genetic screen revealed that Mtb loses this ability when the mycobacterial acid resistance protease (marP) gene is disrupted. In the present study, a high throughput screen (HTS) of compounds against the protease domain of MarP identified benzoxazinones as inhibitors of MarP. A potent benzoxazinone, BO43 (6-chloro-2-(2'-methylphenyl)-4H-1,3-benzoxazin-4-one), acylated MarP and lowered Mtb's pHIB and survival during incubation at pH 4.5. BO43 had similar effects on MarP-deficient Mtb, suggesting the existence of additional target(s). Reaction of an alkynyl-benzoxazinone, BO43T, with Mycobacterium bovis variant bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) followed by click chemistry with azido-biotin identified both the MarP homologue and the high temperature requirement A1 (HtrA1) homologue, an essential protein. Thus, the chemical probe identified through a target-based screen not only reacted with its intended target in the intact cells but also implicated an additional enzyme that had eluded a genetic screen biased against essential genes.	0
Title: Lipid and fatty acid composition of diatoms revisited: rapid wound-activated change of food quality parameters influences herbivorous copepod reproductive success Abstract: Lipid and fatty acid composition are considered to be key parameters that determine the nutritive quality of phytoplankton diets for zooplanktonic herbivores. The fitness, reproduction and physiology of the grazers are influenced by these factors. The trophic transfer of lipids and fatty acids from algal cells has been typically studied by using simple extraction and quantification approaches, which, as we argue here, do not reflect the actual situation in the plankton. We show that cell disruption, as it occurs during a predator's grazing on diatoms can drastically change the lipid and fatty acid content of the food. In some algae, a rapid depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is observed within the first minutes after cell disruption. This fatty acid depletion is directly linked to the production of PUFA-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUA); these are molecules that are thought to be involved in the chemical defence of the algae. PUA-releasing diatoms are even capable of transforming lipids from other sources if these are available in the vicinity of the wounded cells. Fluorescent staining reveals that the enzymes involved in lipid transformation are active in the foregut of copepods, and therefore link the depletion processes directly to food uptake. Incubation experiments with the calanoid copepod Temora longicornis showed that PUFA depletion in PUA-producing diatoms is correlated to reduced hatching success, and can be compensated for by externally added single fatty acids.	0
Title: Mimicking the oxygen minimum zones: stimulating interaction of aerobic archaeal and anaerobic bacterial ammonia oxidizers in a laboratory-scale model system Abstract: In marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) rather than marine ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) may provide nitrite to anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria. Here we demonstrate the cooperation between marine anammox bacteria and nitrifiers in a laboratory-scale model system under oxygen limitation. A bioreactor containing 'Candidatus Scalindua profunda' marine anammox bacteria was supplemented with AOA (Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1) cells and limited amounts of oxygen. In this way a stable mixed culture of AOA, and anammox bacteria was established within 200 days while also a substantial amount of endogenous AOB were enriched. 'Ca. Scalindua profunda' and putative AOB and AOA morphologies were visualized by transmission electron microscopy and a C18 anammox [3]-ladderane fatty acid was highly abundant in the oxygen-limited culture. The rapid oxygen consumption by AOA and AOB ensured that anammox activity was not affected. High expression of AOA, AOB and anammox genes encoding for ammonium transport proteins was observed, likely caused by the increased competition for ammonium. The competition between AOA and AOB was found to be strongly related to the residual ammonium concentration based on amoA gene copy numbers. The abundance of archaeal amoA copy numbers increased markedly when the ammonium concentration was below 30 μM finally resulting in almost equal abundance of AOA and AOB amoA copy numbers. Massive parallel sequencing of mRNA and activity analyses further corroborated equal abundance of AOA and AOB. PTIO addition, inhibiting AOA activity, was employed to determine the relative contribution of AOB versus AOA to ammonium oxidation. The present study provides the first direct evidence for cooperation of archaeal ammonia oxidation with anammox bacteria by provision of nitrite and consumption of oxygen.	0
Title: Identification and partial characterization of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene responsible for cereulide production in emetic Bacillus cereus Abstract: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Due to its chemical structure, (D-O-Leu-D-Ala-L-O-Val-L-Val)(3), cereulide might be synthesized nonribosomally. Therefore, degenerate PCR primers targeted to conserved sequence motifs of known nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes were used to amplify gene fragments from a cereulide-producing B. cereus strain. Sequence analysis of one of the amplicons revealed a DNA fragment whose putative gene product showed significant homology to valine activation NRPS modules. The sequences of the flanking regions of this DNA fragment revealed a complete module that is predicted to activate valine, as well as a putative carboxyl-terminal thioesterase domain of the NRPS gene. Disruption of the peptide synthetase gene by insertion of a kanamycin cassette through homologous recombination produced cereulide-deficient mutants. The valine-activating module was highly conserved when sequences from nine emetic B. cereus strains isolated from diverse geographical locations were compared. Primers were designed based on the NRPS sequence, and the resulting PCR assay, targeting the ces gene, was tested by using a panel of 143 B. cereus group strains and 40 strains of other bacterial species showing PCR bands specific for only the cereulide-producing B. cereus strains.	1
Title: Purification and biochemical characterization of mutacin I from the group I strain of Streptococcus mutans, CH43, and genetic analysis of mutacin I biosynthesis genes Abstract: Previously, we reported isolation and characterization of mutacin III and genetic analysis of mutacin III biosynthesis genes from the group III strain of Streptococcus mutans, UA787 (F. Qi, P. Chen, and P. W. Caufield, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:3880-3887, 1999). During the same process of isolating the mutacin III structural gene, we also cloned the structural gene for mutacin I. In this report, we present purification and biochemical characterization of mutacin I from the group I strain CH43 and compare mutacin I and mutacin III biosynthesis genes. The mutacin I biosynthesis gene locus consists of 14 genes in the order mutR, -A, -A', -B, -C, -D, -P, -T, -F, -E, -G, orfX, orfY, orfZ. mutA is the structural gene for mutacin I, while mutA' is not required for mutacin I activity. DNA and protein sequence analysis revealed that mutacins I and III are homologous to each other, possibly arising from a common ancestor. The mature mutacin I is 24 amino acids in size and has a molecular mass of 2, 364 Da. Ethanethiol modification and peptide sequencing of mutacin I revealed that it contains six dehydrated serines, four of which are probably involved with thioether bridge formation. Comparison of the primary sequence of mutacin I with that of mutacin III and epidermin suggests that mutacin I likely has the same bridging pattern as epidermin.	1
Title: The application of virus-like particles as vaccines and biological vehicles Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be spontaneously self-assembled by viral structural proteins under appropriate conditions in vitro while excluding the genetic material and potential replication probability. In addition, VLPs possess several features including can be rapidly produced in large quantities through existing expression systems, highly resembling native viruses in terms of conformation and appearance, and displaying repeated cluster of epitopes. Their capsids can be modified via genetic insertion or chemical conjugation which facilitating the multivalent display of a homologous or heterogeneous epitope antigen. Therefore, VLPs are considered as a safe and effective candidate of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. VLPs, with a diameter of approximately 20 to 150 nm, also have the characteristics of nanometer materials, such as large surface area, surface-accessible amino acids with reactive moieties (e.g., lysine and glutamic acid residues), inerratic spatial structure, and good biocompatibility. Therefore, assembled VLPs have great potential as a delivery system for specifically carrying a variety of materials. This review summarized recent researches on VLP development as vaccines and biological vehicles, which demonstrated the advantages and potential of VLPs in disease control and prevention and diagnosis. Then, the prospect of VLP biology application in the future is discussed as well.	0
Title: Pseudilins: halogenated, allosteric inhibitors of the non-mevalonate pathway enzyme IspD Abstract: The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been identified as attractive targets with novel modes of action for the development of herbicides for crop protection and agents against infectious diseases. This pathway is present in many pathogenic organisms and plants, but absent in mammals. By using high-throughput screening, we identified highly halogenated marine natural products, the pseudilins, to be inhibitors of the third enzyme, IspD, in the pathway. Their activity against the IspD enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Plasmodium vivax was determined in photometric and NMR-based assays. Cocrystal structures revealed that pseudilins bind to an allosteric pocket by using both divalent metal ion coordination and halogen bonding. The allosteric mode of action for preventing cosubstrate (CTP) binding at the active site was elucidated. Pseudilins show herbicidal activity in plant assays and antiplasmodial activity in cell-based assays.	1
Title: Synthesis and antibacterial activity of doxycycline neoglycosides Abstract: A set of 37 doxycycline neoglycosides were prepared, mediated via a C-9 alkoxyamino-glycyl-based spacer reminiscent of that of tigecycline. Subsequent in vitro antibacterial assays against representative drug-resistant Gram negative and Gram positive strains revealed a sugar-dependent activity profile and one doxycycline neoglycoside, the 2'-amino-α-D-glucoside conjugate, to rival that of the parent pharmacophore. In contrast, the representative tetracycline-susceptible strain E. coli 25922 was found to be relatively responsive to a range of doxycycline neoglycosides. This study also extends the use of aminosugars in the context of neoglycosylation via a simple two-step strategy anticipated to be broadly applicable for neoglycorandomization.	0
Title: A 12.7 kb fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is not present in Mycobacterium bovis Abstract: Southern blotting, sequence analysis and PCR experiments showed that Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG lack a 12.7 kb fragment present in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This region is 337 bp downstream of the RD2 region, which was previously described as being absent from some M. bovis BCG strains. The 12.7 kb fragment should be useful as a target for a PCR test to differentiate M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. An analysis of the 12.7 kb region suggests that it represents a deletion in M. bovis rather than an insertion in M. tuberculosis. The deletion removes most of the mce-3 operon, one of four highly related operons which may be involved in cell entry, and therefore it may contribute to differences in virulence or host range in the two species.	0
Title: Synthesis of nitriles via palladium-catalyzed water shuffling from amides to acetonitrile Abstract: Palladium-catalyzed synthesis of nitriles from amides has been described. Two similar, but complementary reaction conditions have been identified to convert various amides including α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated amides, cinnamides, aromatic amides and alkyl amides to the corresponding nitriles in good to excellent yield.	0
Title: Immune response characterization of mice immunized with Lactobacillus plantarum expressing spike antigen of transmissible gastroenteritis virus Abstract: The highly infectious porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which belongs to the coronaviruses (CoVs), causes diarrhea and high mortality rates in piglets, resulting in severe economic losses in the pork industry worldwide. In this study, we used Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) to anchor the expression of TGEV antigen (S) to dendritic cells (DCs) via dendritic cell-targeting peptides (DCpep). The results show that S antigen could be detected on the surface of L. plantarum by different detection methods. Furthermore, flow cytometry and ELISA techniques were used to measure the cellular, mucosal, and humoral immune responses of the different orally gavaged mouse groups. The obtained results demonstrated the significant effect of the constructed L. plantarum expressing S-DCpep fusion proteins in inducing high expression levels of B7 molecules on DCs, as well as high levels of IgG, secretory IgA, and IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines compared with the other groups. Accordingly, surface expression of DC-targeted antigens successfully induced cellular, mucosal, and humoral immunity in mice and could be used as a vaccine.	0
Title: Isolation and sequence analysis of polyketide synthase genes from the daunomycin-producing Streptomyces sp. strain C5 Abstract: A contiguous region of about 30 kbp of DNA putatively encoding reactions in daunomycin biosynthesis was isolated from Streptomyces sp. strain C5 DNA. The DNA sequence of an 8.1-kbp EcoRI fragment, which hybridized with actI polyketide synthase (PKS) and actIII polyketide reductase (PKR) gene probes, was determined, revealing seven complete open reading frames (ORFs), two in one cluster and five in a divergently transcribed cluster. The former two genes are likely to encode PKR and a bifunctional cyclase/dehydrase. The five latter genes encode: (i) a homolog of TcmH, an oxygenase of the tetracenomycin biosynthesis pathway; (ii) a PKS Orf1 homolog; (iii) a PKS Orf2 homolog (chain length factor); (iv) a product having moderate sequence identity with Escherichia coli beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase III but lacking the conserved active site; and (v) a protein highly similar to several acyltransferases. The DNA within the 8.1-kbp EcoRI fragment restored daunomycin production to two dauA non-daunomycin-producing mutants of Streptomyces sp. strain C5 and restored wild-type antibiotic production to Streptomyces coelicolor B40 (act VII; nonfunctional cyclase/dehydrase), and to S. coelicolor B41 (actIII) and Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31671, strains defective in PKR activity.	1
Title: Thermotoga neapolitana bglB gene, upstream of lamA, encodes a highly thermostable beta-glucosidase that is a laminaribiase Abstract: The gene for thermostable 1,3-beta-glucosidase BglB was cloned from the chromosome of Thermotoga neapolitana and its primary sequence was determined. The purified recombinant beta-glucosidase B had a monomer molecular mass of 81 kDa in accordance with the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of clone pTT51. It was a member of glycosylhydrolase family 3 and belonged to enzyme class EC 3.2.1.21. beta-Glucosidase B had a specific activity of 255 U mg-1 on 4-nitrophenyl(PNP)-beta-glucoside at the optima of pH (5.5) and temperature (90 degrees C), and K(m) values of 0.1, 10 and 50 mM for PNP-beta-glucoside, laminaribiose and cellobiose, respectively. The gene bglB was located immediately upstream of the laminarinase gene lamA. Both genes were transcribed from the same DNA strand and were not separated by a palindromic transcription terminator. The two purified enzymes 1,3-beta-glucosidase BglB (laminaribiase) and 1,3-beta-glucanase LamA (laminarinase) were together capable of completely degrading laminarin to glucose.	0
Title: The novel gluconeogenesis inhibitors FR225659 and FR225656 from Helicomyces sp. No. 19353. III. Structure determination Abstract: During the course of screening for novel gluconeogenesis inhibitors, FR225659 and its related compounds were isolated from a fermentation broth of Helicomyces sp. No. 19353. Spectroscopic analysis concluded that FR225659 is an N-acyl tripeptide consisting of a novel acyl, a 3-chloro-4-hydroxyarginine, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylproline and a dehydrovaline. Degradation study allowed assignment of the absolute configuration of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylproline to be (2S,3R). FR225656 was shown to possess a dehydroisoleucine instead of the dehydrovaline of FR225659.	0
Title: Mosaic structure of p1658/97, a 125-kilobase plasmid harboring an active amplicon with the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene blaSHV-5 Abstract: Escherichia coli isolates recovered from patients during a clonal outbreak in a Warsaw, Poland, hospital in 1997 produced different levels of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) of the SHV type. The beta-lactamase hyperproduction correlated with the multiplication of ESBL gene copies within a plasmid. Here, we present the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid p1658/97 carried by the isolates recovered during the outbreak. The plasmid is 125,491 bp and shows a mosaic structure in which all modules constituting the plasmid core are homologous to those found in plasmids F and R100 and are separated by segments of homology to other known regions (plasmid R64, Providencia rettgeri genomic island R391, Vibrio cholerae STX transposon, Klebsiella pneumoniae or E. coli chromosomes). Plasmid p1658/97 bears two replication systems, IncFII and IncFIB; we demonstrated that both are active in E. coli. The presence of an active partition system (sopABC locus) and two postsegregational killing systems (pemIK and hok/sok) indicates that the plasmid should be stably maintained in E. coli populations. The conjugative transfer is ensured by the operons of the tra and trb genes. We also demonstrate that the plasmidic segment undergoing amplification contains the blaSHV-5 gene and is homologous to a 7.9-kb fragment of the K. pneumoniae chromosome. The amplicon displays the structure of a composite transposon of type I.	0
Title: A branched biosynthetic pathway is involved in production of roquefortine and related compounds in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Profiling and structural elucidation of secondary metabolites produced by the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum and derived deletion strains were used to identify the various metabolites and enzymatic steps belonging to the roquefortine/meleagrin pathway. Major abundant metabolites of this pathway were identified as histidyltryptophanyldiketopiperazine (HTD), dehydrohistidyltryptophanyldi-ketopiperazine (DHTD), roquefortine D, roquefortine C, glandicoline A, glandicoline B and meleagrin. Specific genes could be assigned to each enzymatic reaction step. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase RoqA accepts L-histidine and L-tryptophan as substrates leading to the production of the diketopiperazine HTD. DHTD, previously suggested to be a degradation product of roquefortine C, was found to be derived from HTD involving the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase RoqR. The dimethylallyltryptophan synthetase RoqD prenylates both HTD and DHTD yielding directly the products roquefortine D and roquefortine C without the synthesis of a previously suggested intermediate and the involvement of RoqM. This leads to a branch in the otherwise linear pathway. Roquefortine C is subsequently converted into glandicoline B with glandicoline A as intermediates, involving two monooxygenases (RoqM and RoqO) which were mixed up in an earlier attempt to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway. Eventually, meleagrin is produced from glandicoline B involving a methyltransferase (RoqN). It is concluded that roquefortine C and meleagrin are derived from a branched biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Zwittermicin A resistance gene from Bacillus cereus Abstract: Zwittermicin A is a novel aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus that is active against diverse bacteria and lower eukaryotes (L.A. Silo-Suh, B.J. Lethbridge, S.J. Raffel, H. He, J. Clardy, and J. Handelsman, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2023-2030, 1994). To identify a determinant for resistance to zwittermicin A, we constructed a genomic library from B. cereus UW85, which produces zwittermicin A, and screened transformants of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, which is sensitive to zwittermicin A, for resistance to zwittermicin A. Subcloning and mutagenesis defined a genetic locus, designated zmaR, on a 1.2-kb fragment of DNA that conferred zwittermicin A resistance on E. coli. A DNA fragment containing zmaR hybridized to a corresponding fragment of genomic DNA from B. cereus UW85. Corresponding fragments were not detected in mutants of B. cereus UW85 that were sensitive to zwittermicin A, and the plasmids carrying zmaR restored resistance to the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants, indicating that zmaR was deleted in the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants and that zmaR is functional in B. cereus. Sequencing of the 1.2-kb fragment of DNA defined an open reading frame, designated ZmaR. Neither the nucleotide sequence nor the predicted protein sequence had significant similarity to sequences in existing databases. Cell extracts from an E. coli strain carrying zmaR contained a 43.5-kDa protein whose molecular mass and N-terminal sequence matched those of the protein predicted by the zmaR sequence. The results demonstrate that we have isolated a gene, zmaR, that encodes a zwIttermicin A resistance determinant that is functional in both B. cereus and E. coli.	1
Title: Multi-energy metabolic mechanisms of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum in low oxygen environments Abstract: The fungus Fusarium oxysporum produces energy under hypoxic and anoxic conditions by denitrification (nitrate respiration) and ammonia fermentation respectively. Here we found that glucose repressed both of these metabolisms, whereas it supported another anoxic metabolism, hetero-lactic acid fermentation. Ammonia fermentation occurred only after the glucose present in the medium was metabolized to ethanol via alcohol fermentation. During this transition, clear diauxic growth was observed. Glucose regulated the activity of the enzymes involved in ammonia fermentation, hetero-lactic acid fermentation, and denitrification. Highest cell growth was supported by hetero-lactic acid fermentation, followed by denitrification and ammonia fermentation. These results indicate that the energy metabolisms of F. oxysporum are dependent not only on environmental O(2) tension but also on the carbon source, and that ammonia fermentation is an adaptative mechanism acting physiologically as a secondary fermentative mechanism replacing the primary hetero-lactic acid fermentation.	0
Title: Specific plate assay for bacterial heparinase Abstract: A procedure was developed for detecting heparinase activity on heparin agar plates. The method is based on the differential precipitation of heparin and heparinase-generated heparin fragments by protamine sulfate. Heparinase activity is detected by the presence of clear zones against a white background. This method can be used to screen for the expression of recombinant heparinase and to identify Flavobacterium heparinum mutants expressing heparinase constitutively.	0
Title: Overexpressing transcriptional regulator in Aspergillus oryzae activates a silent biosynthetic pathway to produce a novel polyketide Abstract: Fungal genomes carry many gene clusters seemingly capable of natural product biosynthesis, yet most clusters remain silent. This places a major constraint on the conventional approach of cloning these genes in more amenable heterologous host for the natural product biosynthesis. One way to overcome this difficulty is to activate the silent gene clusters within the context of the target fungus. Here, we successfully activated a silent polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae by overexpressing a transcriptional regulator found within the cluster from a plasmid. This strategy allowed us to isolate a new polyketide product and to efficiently decipher its biosynthetic pathway. Through this exercise, we also discovered unexpected activities of the biosynthetic enzymes found in the cluster. These results indicate that our approach would be valuable for isolating novel natural products and engineering analogues of comparable, if not more potent, bioactivity.	1
Title: Elucidating the biosynthetic pathway for the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide collismycin A: mechanism for formation of the 2,2'-bipyridyl ring Abstract: The gene cluster for the bipyridyl compound collismycin was characterized from Streptomyces sp. CS40. Sequence analysis of a 46.7 kb DNA region revealed 27 open reading frames, 23 of which are involved in collismycin biosynthesis. Eight insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to prove its involvement in collismycin biosynthesis, define the boundaries of the cluster, functionally characterize some genes, and isolate two biosynthetic intermediates. A model for collismycin biosynthesis--which includes the conversion of lysine into picolinic acid, participation of a polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase system, and some further modifications--is proposed. The biosynthetic pathway would include an unusual NRPS-mediated incorporation of a cysteine residue, possibly through a Michael addition and followed by the extension of the peptide chain by leucine incorporation and later removal by amidohydrolase.	1
Title: A type II polyketide synthase is responsible for anthraquinone biosynthesis in Photorhabdus luminescens Abstract: Type II polyketide synthases are involved in the biosynthesis of numerous clinically relevant secondary metabolites with potent antibiotic or anticancer activity. Until recently the only known producers of type II PKSs were members of the Gram-positive actimomycetes, well-known producers of secondary metabolites in general. Here we present the second example of a type II PKS from Gram-negative bacteria. We have identified the biosynthesis gene cluster responsible for the production of anthraquinones (AQs) from the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. This is the first example of AQ production in Gram-negative bacteria, and their heptaketide origin was confirmed by feeding experiments. Deletion of a cyclase/aromatase involved in AQ biosynthesis resulted in accumulation of mutactin and dehydromutactin, which have been described as shunt products of typical octaketide compounds from streptomycetes, and a pathway for AQ formation from octaketide intermediates is discussed.	1
Title: Initial characterization of novobiocic acid noviosyl transferase activity of NovM in biosynthesis of the antibiotic novobiocin Abstract: The aminocoumarin class of antibiotics, exemplified by novobiocin, is composed of tripartite l-noviosylaminocoumarin prenylbenzoate natural products. The decorated noviosyl sugar component interacts with the target bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. We have subcloned the putative 40 kDa l-noviosyl transferase from Streptomyces spheroides into Escherichia coli, expressed it in soluble form, and purified it to homogeneity as a C-terminal His(8) fusion protein. The aglycone novobiocic acid, obtained from selective degradation of novobiocin, and TDP-l-noviose, obtained by an 11-step chemical synthesis from l-rhamnose, were shown to be robust substrates for NovM to produce the desmethyldescarbamoyl novobiocin intermediate with a k(cat) of >300 min(-1). NovM displays activity with variant coumarin aglycones, suggesting it may be a promiscuous catalyst for noviosylation of a range of planar scaffolds. Conversely, NovM shows no activity with and is inhibited by TDP-l-rhamnose (K(i) = 83.5 +/- 5.5 microM), the sugar donor that most closely structurally resembles the natural substrate TDP-l-noviose. The NovM reaction products generated during the course of this work will serve as substrates for subsequent analysis of the NovP and NovN tailoring enzymes that impart the noviose decorations required for DNA gyrase binding and antibiotic activity.	1
Title: Extracellular redox modulation by regulatory T cells Abstract: We demonstrate that the mechanism of redox remodeling during mouse T-cell activation involves secretion of glutathione by dendritic cells and its subsequent cleavage to cysteine. Extracellular cysteine accumulation results in a lower redox potential, which is conducive to proliferation, and changes the net redox status of exofacial protein domains. Regulatory T cells inhibit this redox metabolite signaling pathway, which represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for immunosuppression of effector T cells.	0
Title: Functions of the siderophore esterases IroD and IroE in iron-salmochelin utilization Abstract: The siderophore salmochelin is produced under iron-poor conditions by Salmonella and many uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains. The production of salmochelin, a C-glucosylated enterobactin, is dependent on the synthesis of enterobactin and the iroBCDEN gene cluster. An E. coli IroD protein with an N-terminal His-tag cleaved cyclic salmochelin S4 to the linear trimer salmochelin S2, the dimer salmochelin S1, and the monomers dihydroxybenzoylserine and C-glucosylated dihydroxybenzoylserine (salmochelin SX, pacifarinic acid). The periplasmic IroE protein was purified as a MalE-IroE fusion protein. This enzyme degraded salmochelin S4 and ferric-salmochelin S4 to salmochelin S2 and ferric-salmochelin S2, respectively. In E. coli, uptake of ferric-salmochelin S4 was dependent on the cleavage by IroE, and independent of the FepBDGC ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. IroC, which has similarities to ABC-multidrug-resistance proteins, was necessary for the uptake of salmochelin S2 from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. IroE did not function as a classical binding protein since salmochelin S2 was taken up in the absence of a functional IroE protein. IroC mediated the uptake of iron via enterobactin in a fepB mutant. IroE was also necessary in this case for the uptake of ferric-enterobactin, which indicated that only the linear degradation products of enterobactin were taken up via IroC. PfeE, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa IroE homologue, was cloned, and its enzymic activity was shown to be very similar to that of IroE. It is suggested that homologues in other bacteria are also periplasmic IroE-type esterases of siderophores.	0
Title: The antibiotic CJ-15,801 is an antimetabolite that hijacks and then inhibits CoA biosynthesis Abstract: The natural product CJ-15,801 is an inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus, but not other bacteria. Its close structural resemblance to pantothenic acid, the vitamin precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), and its Michael acceptor moiety suggest that it irreversibly inhibits an enzyme involved in CoA biosynthesis or utilization. However, its mode of action and the basis for its specificity have not been elucidated to date. We demonstrate that CJ-15,801 is transformed by the uniquely selective S. aureus pantothenate kinase, the first CoA biosynthetic enzyme, into a substrate for the next enzyme, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, which is inhibited through formation of a tight-binding structural mimic of its native reaction intermediate. These findings reveal CJ-15,801 as a vitamin biosynthetic pathway antimetabolite with a mechanism similar to that of the sulfonamide antibiotics and highlight CoA biosynthesis as a viable antimicrobial drug target.	0
Title: Isofuranonaphthoquinone produced by an Actinoplanes isolate Abstract: A new isofuranonaphthoquinone, 7,8-dihydroxy-1-methylnaphtho[2,3-c]furan-4,9-dione, was isolated from cultures of an Actinoplanes isolate obtained using an in situ diffusion technology that facilitates the isolation of soil microorganisms. This compound was demonstrated to have the ability to complex Fe(III). The structure was determined on the basis of spectroscopic data.	0
Title: Polyhydroxyalkanoates in Gram-positive bacteria: insights from the genera Bacillus and Streptomyces Abstract: Gram-positive bacteria, notably Bacillus and Streptomyces, have been used extensively in industry. However, these microorganisms have not yet been exploited for the production of the biodegradable polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Although PHAs have many potential applications, the cost of production means that medical applications are currently the main area of use. Gram-negative bacteria, currently the only commercial source of PHAs, have lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which co-purify with the PHAs and cause immunogenic reactions. On the other hand, Gram- positive bacteria lack LPS, a positive feature which justifies intensive investigation into their production of PHAs. This review summarizes currently available knowledge on PHA production by Gram- positive bacteria especially Bacillus and Streptomyces. We hope that this will form the basis of further research into developing either or both as a source of PHAs for medical applications.	1
Title: Glycogenomics as a mass spectrometry-guided genome-mining method for microbial glycosylated molecules Abstract: Glycosyl groups are an essential mediator of molecular interactions in cells and on cellular surfaces. There are very few methods that directly relate sugar-containing molecules to their biosynthetic machineries. Here, we introduce glycogenomics as an experiment-guided genome-mining approach for fast characterization of glycosylated natural products (GNPs) and their biosynthetic pathways from genome-sequenced microbes by targeting glycosyl groups in microbial metabolomes. Microbial GNPs consist of aglycone and glycosyl structure groups in which the sugar unit(s) are often critical for the GNP's bioactivity, e.g., by promoting binding to a target biomolecule. GNPs are a structurally diverse class of molecules with important pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Herein, O- and N-glycosyl groups are characterized in their sugar monomers by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and matched to corresponding glycosylation genes in secondary metabolic pathways by a MS-glycogenetic code. The associated aglycone biosynthetic genes of the GNP genotype then classify the natural product to further guide structure elucidation. We highlight the glycogenomic strategy by the characterization of several bioactive glycosylated molecules and their gene clusters, including the anticancer agent cinerubin B from Streptomyces sp. SPB74 and an antibiotic, arenimycin B, from Salinispora arenicola CNB-527.	1
Title: Structural basis for specific, high-affinity tetracycline binding by an in vitro evolved aptamer and artificial riboswitch Abstract: The tetracycline aptamer is an in vitro selected RNA that binds to the antibiotic with the highest known affinity of an artificial RNA for a small molecule (Kd approximately 0.8 nM). It is one of few aptamers known to be capable of modulating gene expression in vivo. The 2.2 A resolution cocrystal structure of the aptamer reveals a pseudoknot-like fold formed by tertiary interactions between an 11 nucleotide loop and the minor groove of an irregular helix. Tetracycline binds within this interface as a magnesium ion chelate. The structure, together with previous biochemical and biophysical data, indicates that the aptamer undergoes localized folding concomitant with tetracycline binding. The three-helix junction, h-shaped architecture of this artificial RNA is more complex than those of most aptamers and is reminiscent of the structures of some natural riboswitches.	0
Title: Stable tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions Abstract: Three-component coupling reactions between trialkylphosphines, methyl propiolates, and aldehydes produced 1:1:1 dipolar adducts in moderate-to-excellent yields. The product phosphonium enolate zwitterions were isolated as crystalline solids. X-ray crystallographic analyses of these single crystals established unequivocally the dipolar structures of these tetravalent phosphonium enolate zwitterions. Because phosphonium enolates are the first key intermediates in the nucleophilic phosphine-mediated catalysis of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, this study provides crucial insight into the mechanisms of Morita–Baylis–Hillman-type reactions.	0
Title: Characterization of the xiamenmycin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces xiamenensis 318 Abstract: Xiamenmycin (1) is a prenylated benzopyran derivative with anti-fibrotic activity. To investigate the genetic basis of xiamenmycin biosynthesis, we performed genome mining in the xiamenmycin-producing Streptomyces xiamenensis wild-type strain 318 to identify a candidate gene cluster. The complete gene cluster, consisting of five genes, was confirmed by a series of gene inactivations and heterologous expression. Based on bioinformatics analyses of each gene and feeding experiments, we found that the structure of an intermediate xiamenmycin B (3) accumulated in a ximA inactivation mutant, allowing us to propose a biosynthetic pathway. All five of the genes in the pathway were genetically and biochemically characterized. XimA was biochemically characterized as an ATP-dependent amide synthetase, catalyzing an amide bond formation in the presence of ATP as the final step in Xiamenmycin biosynthesis. The Km value of XimA was determined to be 474.38 µM for the substrate xiamenmycin B. These studies provide opportunities to use genetic and chemo-enzymatic methods to create new benzopyran derivatives as potential therapeutic agents.	1
Title: [3H]diborane reduction of vitamin K-dependent calcium-binding proteins. Identification of a unique amino acid Abstract: gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid has recently been identified as a component of the vitamin K-dependent region of bovine prothrombin (Nelsestuen, G. L., Zytkovicz, T. H., and Howard J. B. (1974) J. Biol Chem. 249, 6347-6350). The presence of this amino acid has been substantiated here by the reduction of vitamin K-dependent proteins with [3H]-DIBORANE. The reduction product of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, 5,5'-[3H]dihydroxyleucine, was shown to be present in hydrolysates of reduced rat prothrombin, bovine prothrombin, and bovine factor X. The results are consistent with a minimum of 10 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the nonthrombin-generating region of bovine prothrombin but no such residues in the thrombin precursor portion of prothrombin. It is concluded that amino acid analyses of [3H]diborane-reduced proteins provides a sensitive, qualitative method for the identification of proteins which contain gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and are vitamin K-dependent.	0
Title: Effects of cardiotrophin on adipocytes Abstract: Cardiotrophin (CT-1) is a naturally occurring protein member of the interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine family and signals through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) heterodimer. The formation of gp130/LIFR complex triggers the auto/trans-phosphorylation of associated Janus kinases, leading to the activation of Janus kinase/STAT and MAPK (ERK1 and -2) signaling pathways. Since adipocytes express both gp130 and LIFR proteins and are responsive to other IL-6 family cytokines, we examined the effects of CT-1 on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our studies have shown that CT-1 administration results in a dose- and time-dependent activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, -3, -5A, and -5B as well as ERK1 and -2. We also confirmed the ability of CT-1 to induce signaling in fat cells in vivo. Our studies revealed that neither CT-1 nor ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment affected adipocyte differentiation. However, acute CT-1 treatment caused an increase in SOCS-3 mRNA in adipocytes and a transient decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA that was regulated by the binding of STAT1 to the PPARgamma2 promoter. The effects of CT-1 on SOCS-3 and PPARgamma mRNA were independent of MAPK activation. Chronic administration of CT-1 to 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a decrease of both fatty acid synthase and insulin receptor substrate-1 protein expression yet did not effect the expression of a variety of other adipocyte proteins. Moreover, chronic CT-1 treatment resulted in the development of insulin resistance as judged by a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In summary, CT-1 is a potent regulator of signaling in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo, and our current efforts are focused on determining the role of this cardioprotective cytokine on adipocyte physiology.	0
Title: Enhanced extracellular α-amylase production in Brevibacillus choshinensis by optimizing extracellular degradation and folding environment Abstract: A strategy for optimizing the extracellular degradation and folding environment of Brevibacillus choshinensis has been used to enhance the extracellular production of recombinant α-amylase. First, a gene (bcp) encoding an extracellular protease and another encoding an extracellular chaperone (prsC) were identified in the genome of B. choshinensis HPD31-SP3. Then, the effect of extracellular protein degradation on recombinant α-amylase production was investigated by establishing a CRISPR/Cas9n system to knock out bcp. The effect of extracellular folding capacity was investigated separately by coexpressing extracellular chaperones genes from different sources (prsA, prsC, prsL, prsQ) in B. choshinensis. The final recombinant strain (BCPPSQ), which coexpressed prsQ in a genetic background lacking bcp, produced an extracellular α-amylase activity of 6940.9 U/ml during shake-flask cultivation. This was 2.1-fold greater than that of the original strain BCWPS (3367.9 U/ml). Cultivation of BCPPSQ in a 3-l fermenter produced an extracellular α-amylase activity of 17925.6 U/ml at 72 h, which was 7.6-fold greater than that of BCWPS (2358.1 U/ml). This strategy demonstrates its great potential in enhancing extracellular α-amylase production in B. choshinensis. What's more, this study provides a strategic reference for improving the extracellular production of other recombinant proteins in B. choshinensis.	0
Title: Chemical synthesis and immunological properties of oligosaccharides derived from the vegetative cell wall of Bacillus anthracis Abstract: Bacillus anthracis vaccine candidate: Sera of rabbits exposed to live and irradiated-killed spores of B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 or immunized with B. anthracis polysaccharide conjugated to KLH elicited antibodies that recognize isolated polysaccharide and two synthetic trisaccharides providing a proof-of-concept step in the development of vegetative and spore-specific reagents for detection and targeting of non-protein structures of B. anthracis.	0
Title: Characterization of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Enterocin F4-9, a Glycosylated Bacteriocin Abstract: Enterocin F4-9 belongs to the glycocin family having post-translational modifications by two molecules of N-acetylglucosamine β-O-linked to Ser37 and Thr46. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of enterocin F4-9 was cloned and expressed in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. Production of glycocin by the JH2-2 expression strain was confirmed by expression of the five genes. The molecular weight was greater than glycocin secreted by the wild strain, E. faecalis F4-9, because eight amino acids from the N-terminal leader sequence remained attached. This N-terminal extension was eliminated after treatment with the culture supernatant of strain F4-9, implying an extracellular protease from E. faecalis F4-9 cleaves the N-terminal sequence. Thus, leader sequences cleavage requires two steps: the first via the EnfT protease domain and the second via extracellular proteases. Interestingly, the long peptide, with N-terminal extension, demonstrated advanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, enfC was responsible for glycosylation, a necessary step prior to secretion and cleavage of the leader peptide. In addition, enfI was found to grant self-immunity to producer cells against enterocin F4-9. This report demonstrates specifications of the minimal gene set responsible for production of enterocin F4-9, as well as a new biosynthetic mechanism of glycocins.	1
Title: A comparative analysis of the sugar phosphate cyclase superfamily involved in primary and secondary metabolism Abstract: Sugar phosphate cyclases (SPCs) catalyze the cyclization of sugar phosphates to produce a variety of cyclitol intermediates that serve as the building blocks of many primary metabolites, for example, aromatic amino acids, and clinically relevant secondary metabolites, for example, aminocyclitol/aminoglycoside and ansamycin antibiotics. Feeding experiments with isotopically labeled cyclitols revealed that cetoniacytone A, a unique C(7)N-aminocyclitol antibiotic isolated from an insect endophytic Actinomyces sp., is derived from 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, a product of SPC. By using heterologous probes from the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase class of SPCs, an SPC homologue gene, cetA, was isolated from the cetoniacytone producer. cetA is closely related to BE-orf9 found in the BE-40644 biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinoplanes sp. strain A40644. Recombinant expression of cetA and BE-orf9 and biochemical characterization of the gene products confirmed their function as 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthases. Further phylogenetic analysis of SPC sequences revealed a new clade of SPCs that might regulate the biosynthesis of a novel set of secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Effect of ammonium as nitrogen source on production of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase by Cephalosporium acremonium C-10 Abstract: Cephalosporin production by Cephalosporium acremonium strain C-10 was suppressed when the organic nitrogen source (1.2% L-asparagine) was replaced by 1.2% (NH4)2SO4. A higher level of (NH4)2SO4 (3.5%) led to even greater suppression. Ammonium repression was exerted on formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) synthetase, together with that of expandase; a lesser effect by ammonium was observed on cyclase production. Inhibition of ACV synthetase activity byammonium was also observed (ca. 50% inhibition at 250 mM NH4+).	0
Title: Expression of nisin genes in cheese--a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction approach Abstract: The role of bacteriocins in different environments has not been thoroughly explained, mainly because of the difficulties related to the detection of their production. Nisin, an antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactococcus lactis has a long history of safe use in food products and has been studied from many aspects of genetics, biosynthesis, immunity, regulation, and mode of action. Still, some aspects concerning the dynamics of nisin gene expression remain unknown, especially in complex media like cheese. The main objective of the present study was to quantify in a cheese-like medium the expression of nisin genes in L. lactis M78, a well-characterized nisin A producer isolated from raw milk. The expression of all 11 genes involved in nisin biosynthesis was evaluated during cheese production by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cheeses using a direct extraction method without prior separation of microbial cells. The M78 strain grew well in experimental cheeses, producing detectable amounts of nisin after 4 h of fermentation. The presence of nisin as an activator modified both the expression of nisin genes and the accumulation of active nisin. Four groups could be distinguished based on gene expression as a function of time: nisA, nisFEG, nisRK and nisBTCIP. Based on nisin-producing strain growth, nisin activity, function of nisin genes, and their location, correlations were established that contribute to the explanation of regulation of nisin biosynthesis and immunity. This study is the first in which the evolution of bacteriocin gene transcripts has been quantified rigorously in a cheese-like medium.	1
Title: Strain Prioritization and Genome Mining for Enediyne Natural Products Abstract: The enediyne family of natural products has had a profound impact on modern chemistry, biology, and medicine, and yet only 11 enediynes have been structurally characterized to date. Here we report a genome survey of 3,400 actinomycetes, identifying 81 strains that harbor genes encoding the enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes that could be grouped into 28 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Genome sequencing of 31 representative strains confirmed that each clade harbors a distinct enediyne biosynthetic gene cluster. A genome neighborhood network allows prediction of new structural features and biosynthetic insights that could be exploited for enediyne discovery. We confirmed one clade as new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, and discovered a new family of enediyne natural products, the tiancimycins (TNMs), that exhibit potent cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection.                  Importance:                       Recent advances in microbial genomics clearly revealed that the biosynthetic potential of soil actinomycetes to produce enediynes is underappreciated. A great challenge is to develop innovative methods to discover new enediynes and produce them in sufficient quantities for chemical, biological, and clinical investigations. This work demonstrated the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection. The new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, will impact the practical supply of this important drug lead. The TNMs, with their extremely potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cells and their rapid and complete cancer cell killing characteristics, in comparison with the payloads used in FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are poised to be exploited as payload candidates for the next generation of anticancer ADCs. Follow-up studies on the other identified hits promise the discovery of new enediynes, radically expanding the chemical space for the enediyne family.	1
Title: Versatile Applications of Cyanobacteria in Biotechnology Abstract: Cyanobacteria are blue-green Gram-negative and photosynthetic bacteria which are seen as one of the most morphologically numerous groups of prokaryotes. Because of their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen and carbon dioxide to organic materials, they are known to play important roles in the universal nutrient cycle. Cyanobacteria has emerged as one of the promising resources to combat the issues of global warming, disease outbreaks, nutrition insecurity, energy crises as well as persistent daily human population increases. Cyanobacteria possess significant levels of macro and micronutrient substances which facilitate the versatile popularity to be utilized as human food and protein supplements in many countries such as Asia. Cyanobacteria has been employed as a complementary dietary constituent of feed for poultry and as vitamin and protein supplement in aquatic lives. They are effectively used to deal with numerous tasks in various fields of biotechnology, such as agricultural (including aquaculture), industrial (food and dairy products), environmental (pollution control), biofuel (bioenergy) and pharmaceutical biotechnology (such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, anticoagulant and antitumor); recently, the growing interest of applying them as biocatalysts has been observed as well. Cyanobacteria are known to generate a numerous variety of bioactive compounds. However, the versatile potential applications of cyanobacteria in biotechnology could be their significant growth rate and survival in severe environmental conditions due to their distinct and unique metabolic pathways as well as active defensive mechanisms. In this review, we elaborated on the versatile cyanobacteria applications in different areas of biotechnology. We also emphasized the factors that could impede the implementation to cyanobacteria applications in biotechnology and the execution of strategies to enhance their effective applications.	0
Title: Structure and mechanism of ORF36, an amino sugar oxidizing enzyme in everninomicin biosynthesis Abstract: Everninomicin is a highly modified octasaccharide that belongs to the orthosomycin family of antibiotics and possesses potent Gram-positive antibiotic activity, including broad-spectrum efficacy against multidrug resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Among its distinctive structural features is a nitro sugar, l-evernitrose, analogues of which decorate a variety of natural products. Recently, we identified a nitrososynthase enzyme encoded by orf36 from Micromonospora carbonacea var. africana that mediates the flavin-dependent double oxidation of synthetically generated thymidine diphosphate (TDP)-l-epi-vancosamine to the corresponding nitroso sugar. Herein, we utilize a five-enzyme in vitro pathway both to verify that ORF36 catalyzes oxidation of biogenic TDP-l-epi-vancosamine and to determine whether ORF36 exhibits catalytic competence for any of its biosynthetic progenitors, which are candidate substrates for nitrososynthases in vivo. Progenitors solely undergo single-oxidation reactions and terminate in the hydroxylamine oxidation state. Performing the in vitro reactions in the presence of (18)O(2) establishes that molecular oxygen, rather than oxygen from water, is incorporated into ORF36-generated intermediates and products and identifies an off-pathway product that correlates with the oxidation product of a progenitor substrate. The 3.15 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of ORF36 reveals a tetrameric enzyme that shares a fold with acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and class D flavin-containing monooxygenases, including the nitrososynthase KijD3. However, ORF36 and KijD3 have unusually open active sites in comparison to these related enzymes. Taken together, these studies map substrate determinants and allow the proposal of a minimal monooxygenase mechanism for amino sugar oxidation by ORF36.	1
Title: Molecular basis for barbed end uncapping by CARMIL homology domain 3 of mouse CARMIL-1 Abstract: Capping protein (CP) is a ubiquitously expressed, 62-kDa heterodimer that binds the barbed end of the actin filament with approximately 0.1 nm affinity to prevent further monomer addition. CARMIL is a multidomain protein, present from protozoa to mammals, that binds CP and is important for normal actin dynamics in vivo. The CARMIL CP binding site resides in its CAH3 domain (CARMIL homology domain 3) located at or near the protein's C terminus. CAH3 binds CP with approximately 1 nm affinity, resulting in a complex with weak capping activity (30-200 nm). Solution assays and single-molecule imaging show that CAH3 binds CP already present on the barbed end, causing a 300-fold increase in the dissociation rate of CP from the end (i.e. uncapping). Here we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to define the molecular interaction between the minimal CAH3 domain (CAH3a/b) of mouse CARMIL-1 and CP. Specifically, we show that the highly basic CAH3a subdomain is required for the high affinity interaction of CAH3 with a complementary "acidic groove" on CP opposite its actin-binding surface. This CAH3a-CP interaction orients the CAH3b subdomain, which we show is also required for potent anti-CP activity, directly adjacent to the basic patch of CP, shown previously to be required for CP association to and high affinity interaction with the barbed end. The importance of specific residue interactions between CP and CAH3a/b was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of both proteins. Together, these results offer a mechanistic explanation for the barbed end uncapping activity of CARMIL, and they identify the basic patch on CP as a crucial regulatory site.	0
Title: Effect of alkaline growth pH on the expression of cell envelope proteins in Fusobacterium nucleatum Abstract: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic organism that plays a central role in the development of periodontal diseases. The progression of periodontitis is associated with a rise in pH of the gingival sulcus which promotes the growth and expression of virulence factors by periodontopathic bacteria. We have previously reported that the expression of specific cytoplasmic proteins is altered by a shift in growth pH. In the present study we have compared cell envelope protein expression of F. nucleatum during chemostat growth at pH 7.2 and 7.8. From a total of 176 proteins resolved from the cell envelope, 15 were found to have altered expression in response to an increase in growth pH and were identified by MS. Upregulated proteins included an outer membrane porin which has been identified as playing a role in virulence, a periplasmic chaperone which assists in the folding of outer membrane proteins, and a transporter thought to be involved with iron uptake. Proteins downregulated at pH 7.8 were consistent with our previous findings that the bacterium reduces its catabolism of energy-yielding substrates in favour of energy-storage pathways. Among the downregulated proteins, two transporters which are involved in the uptake of C4 dicarboxylates and phosphate were identified. A putative protease and an enzyme associated with the metabolism of glutamate were also identified. A high proportion of the cell envelope proteins suggested by these data to play a role in the organism's response to alkaline growth pH may have arisen by lateral gene transfer. This would support the hypothesis that genes that provide an ability to adapt to the changing conditions of the oral environment may be readily shared between oral bacteria.	0
Title: Intracellular light-activation of riboswitch activity Abstract: By combining a riboswitch with a cell-permeable photocaged small-molecule ligand, an optochemical gene control element was constructed that enabled spatial and temporal control of gene expression in bacterial cells. The simplicity of this strategy, coupled with the ability to create synthetic riboswitches with tailored ligand specificities and output in a variety of microorganisms, plants, and fungi might afford a general strategy to photocontrol gene expression in vivo. The ability to activate riboswitches by using light enables the interrogation and manipulation of a wide range of biological processes with high precision, and will have broad utility in the regulation of artificial genetic circuits.	0
Title: A new family of ATP-dependent oligomerization-macrocyclization biocatalysts Abstract: Oligomerization and macrocyclization reactions are key steps in the biosynthesis of many bioactive natural products. Important macrocycles include the antibiotic daptomycin (1; ref. 1), the immunosuppressant FK-506 (2; ref. 2), the anthelmintic avermectin B1a (3; ref. 3) and the insecticide spinosyn A (4; ref. 4); important oligomeric macrocycles include the siderophores enterobactin (5; ref. 5) and desferrioxamine E (6; ref. 6). Biosynthetic oligomerization and macrocyclization reactions typically involve covalently tethered intermediates and are catalyzed by thioesterase domains of polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase multienzymes. Here we report that the purified recombinant desferrioxamine siderophore synthetase DesD from Streptomyces coelicolor M145 catalyzes ATP-dependent trimerization-macrocyclization of a chemically synthesized 10-aminocarboxylic acid substrate via noncovalently bound intermediates. DesD is dissimilar to other known synthetase families but is similar to other enzymes known or proposed to be required for the biosynthesis of omega-aminocarboxylic acid-derived cyclodimeric siderophores. This suggests that DesD is the first biochemically characterized member of a new family of oligomerizing and macrocyclizing synthetases.	1
Title: Structural characterization of the highly cyclized lantibiotic paenicidin A via a partial desulfurization/reduction strategy Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that are increasingly of interest for food preservation and possible therapeutic uses. These peptides are extensively post-translationally modified, and are characterized by lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether cross-links. Paenibacillus polymyxa NRRL B-30509 was found to produce polymyxins and tridecaptins, in addition to a novel lantibiotic termed paenicidin A. A bacteriocin termed SRCAM 602 previously reported to be produced by this organism and claimed to be responsible for inhibition of Campylobacter jejuni could not be detected either directly or by genomic analysis. The connectivities of the thioether cross-links of paenicidin A were solved using a novel partial desulfurization/reduction strategy in combination with tandem mass spectrometry. This approach overcame the limitations of NMR-based structural characterization that proved mostly unsuccessful for this peptide. Paenicidin A is a highly cyclized lantibiotic, containing six lanthionine and methyllanthionine rings, three of which are interlocking.	1
Title: Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in vitro Applications Abstract: Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over-reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post-translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110-fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30 mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2 h of reaction.	0
Title: Pantoea Bacteriophage vB_PagS_AAS23: A Singleton of the Genus Sauletekiovirus Abstract: A cold-adapted siphovirus, vB_PagS_AAS23 (AAS23) was isolated in Lithuania using the Pantoea agglomerans strain AUR for the phage propagation. The double-stranded DNA genome of AAS23 (51,170 bp) contains 92 probable protein encoding genes, and no genes for tRNA. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that 25 of all AAS23 open reading frames (ORFs) code for unique proteins that have no reliable identity to database entries. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, AAS23 has no close relationship to other viruses publicly available to date and represents a single species of the genus Sauletekiovirus within the family Drexlerviridae. The phage is able to form plaques in bacterial lawns even at 4 °C and demonstrates a depolymerase activity. Thus, the data presented in this study not only provides the information on Pantoea-infecting bacteriophages, but also offers novel insights into the diversity of cold-adapted viruses and their potential to be used as biocontrol agents.	0
Title: Synchronous Chemoradiation Nanovesicles by X-Ray Triggered Cascade of Drug Release Abstract: The approach of concurrent-to-synchronous chemoradiation has now been advanced by well-designed nanovesicles that permit X-ray irradiation-triggered instant drug release. The nanovesicles consist of Au nanoparticles tethered with irradiation labile linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAHP) molecules and oxidation-responsive poly(propylene sulfide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PPS-PEG) polymers, where DOX were loaded in the inner core of the vesicles (Au-LAHP-vDOX). Upon irradiation, the in situ formation of hydroxyl radicals from LAHP molecules triggers the internal oxidation of PPS from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic, leading to degradation of the vesicles and burst release of cargo drugs. In this manner, synchronous chemoradiation showed impressive anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in a subcutaneous mouse tumor model by one-dose injection and one-time irradiation.	0
Title: Transition State Structure of RNA Depurination by Saporin L3 Abstract: Saporin L3 from the leaves of the common soapwort is a catalyst for hydrolytic depurination of adenine from RNA. Saporin L3 is a type 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) composed only of a catalytic domain. Other RIPs have been used in immunotoxin cancer therapy, but off-target effects have limited their development. In the current study, we use transition state theory to understand the chemical mechanism and transition state structure of saporin L3. In favorable cases, transition state structures guide the design of transition state analogues as inhibitors. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were determined for an A14C mutant of saporin L3. To permit KIE measurements, small stem-loop RNAs that contain an AGGG tetraloop structure were enzymatically synthesized with the single adenylate bearing specific isotopic substitutions. KIEs were measured and corrected for forward commitment to obtain intrinsic values. A model of the transition state structure for depurination of stem-loop RNA (5'-GGGAGGGCCC-3') by saporin L3 was determined by matching KIE values predicted via quantum chemical calculations to a family of intrinsic KIEs. This model indicates saporin L3 displays a late transition state with the N-ribosidic bond to the adenine nearly cleaved, and the attacking water nucleophile weakly bonded to the ribosyl anomeric carbon. The transition state retains partial ribocation character, a feature common to most N-ribosyl transferases. However, the transition state geometry for saporin L3 is distinct from ricin A-chain, the only other RIP whose transition state is known.	0
Title: Chemical genetics of acetyl-CoA carboxylases Abstract: Chemical genetic studies on acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCs), rate-limiting enzymes in long chain fatty acid biosynthesis, have greatly advanced the understanding of their biochemistry and molecular biology and promoted the use of ACCs as targets for herbicides in agriculture and for development of drugs for diabetes, obesity and cancers. In mammals, ACCs have both biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT) activity, catalyzing carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Several classes of small chemicals modulate ACC activity, including cellular metabolites, natural compounds, and chemically synthesized products. This article reviews chemical genetic studies of ACCs and the use of ACCs for targeted therapy of cancers.	0
Title: Identification of the specific sequence recognized by Penicillium citrinum MlcR, a GAL4-type transcriptional activator of ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic genes Abstract: MlcR is a pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in Penicillium citrinum. The MlcR-binding sequences were identified by an in vitro gel-shift assay and an in vivo reporter assay for the region between mlcA and mlcC as a model. The gel-shift assay showed that recombinant MlcR bound to the DNA sequence 5'-ACGGCGTTATTCGG-3' and most of the bases in this motif were required for the interaction between MlcR and DNA. In the reporter assay using beta-glucuronidase (GUS), substitution of the bases in this binding sequence resulted in the drastic reduction of GUS activities. These data clearly indicate that this MlcR-binding sequence is essential for the transcriptional activation of mlcA and mlcC in P. citrinum. Similar motifs were found in other loci of the ML-236B biosynthetic gene cluster and the consensus-binding motif for MlcR was predicted to be a direct repeat, 5'-WCGG-N(6)-TCGG-3'.	1
Title: Enzymatic processing of fumiquinazoline F: a tandem oxidative-acylation strategy for the generation of multicyclic scaffolds in fungal indole alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 is a known producer of quinazoline natural products, including the antitumor fumiquinazolines, of which the simplest member is fumiquinazoline F (FQF) with a 6-6-6 tricyclic core derived from anthranilic acid, tryptophan, and alanine. FQF is the proposed biological precursor to fumiquinazoline A (FQA) in which the pendant indole side chain has been modified via oxidative coupling of an additional molecule of alanine, yielding a fused 6-5-5 imidazoindolone. We recently identified fungal anthranilate-activating nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains through bioinformatics approaches. One domain previously identified is part of the trimodular NRPS Af12080, which we predict is responsible for FQF formation. We now show that two adjacent A. fumigatus ORFs, a monomodular NRPS Af12050 and a flavoprotein Af12060, are necessary and sufficient to convert FQF to FQA. Af12060 oxidizes the 2',3'-double bond of the indole side chain of FQF, and the three-domain NRPS Af12050 activates l-Ala as the adenylate, installs it as the pantetheinyl thioester on its carrier protein domain, and acylates the oxidized indole for subsequent intramolecular cyclization to create the 6-5-5 imidazolindolone of FQA. This work provides experimental validation of the fumiquinazoline biosynthetic cluster of A. fumigatus Af293 and describes an oxidative annulation biosynthetic strategy likely shared among several classes of polycyclic fungal alkaloids.	1
Title: A Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA binding protein regulates the sirodesmin PL biosynthetic gene cluster in Leptosphaeria maculans Abstract: A gene, sirZ, encoding a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA binding protein is present in a cluster of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin, sirodesmin PL in the ascomycete plant pathogen, Leptosphaeria maculans. RNA-mediated silencing of sirZ gives rise to transformants that produce only residual amounts of sirodesmin PL and display a decrease in the transcription of several sirodesmin PL biosynthetic genes. This indicates that SirZ is a major regulator of this gene cluster. Proteins similar to SirZ are encoded in the gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus (gliZ) and in an ETP-like cluster in Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum (PlgliZ). Despite its high level of sequence similarity to gliZ, PlgliZ is unable to complement the gliotoxin-deficiency of a mutant of gliZ in A. fumigatus. Putative binding sites for these regulatory proteins in the promoters of genes in these clusters were predicted using bioinformatic analysis. These sites are similar to those commonly bound by other proteins with Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA binding domains.	1
Title: Intriguing properties of the angucycline antibiotic auricin and complex regulation of its biosynthesis Abstract: Streptomyces bacteria are major producers of bioactive natural products, including many antibiotics. We identified a gene cluster, aur1, in a large linear plasmid of Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239. The cluster is responsible for the production of a new angucycline polyketide antibiotic auricin. Several tailoring biosynthetic genes were scatted in rather distant aur1 flanking regions. Auricin was produced in a very narrow growth phase interval of several hours after entry into stationary phase, after which it was degraded to non-active metabolites because of its instability at the high pH values reached after the production stage. Strict transcriptional regulation of the auricin biosynthetic gene cluster has been demonstrated, including feed-forward and feedback control by auricin intermediates via several of the huge number of regulatory genes present in the aur1 cluster. The complex mechanism may ensure strict confinement of auricin production to a specific growth stage.	1
Title: Aromatic prenylation in phenazine biosynthesis: dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase from Streptomyces anulatus Abstract: The bacterium Streptomyces anulatus 9663, isolated from the intestine of different arthropods, produces prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. From this organism, we have identified the prenyltransferase gene ppzP. ppzP resides in a gene cluster containing orthologs of all genes known to be involved in phenazine 1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas strains as well as genes for the six enzymes required to generate dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway. This is the first complete gene cluster of a phenazine natural compound from streptomycetes. Heterologous expression of this cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the formation of prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. After inactivation of ppzP, only nonprenylated phenazine 1-carboxylic acid was formed. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of PpzP resulted in a 37-kDa soluble protein, which was identified as a 5,10-dihydrophenazine 1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase, forming a C-C bond between C-1 of the isoprenoid substrate and C-9 of the aromatic substrate. In contrast to many other prenyltransferases, the reaction of PpzP is independent of the presence of magnesium or other divalent cations. The K(m) value for dimethylallyl diphosphate was determined as 116 microm. For dihydro-PCA, half-maximal velocity was observed at 35 microm. K(cat) was calculated as 0.435 s(-1). PpzP shows obvious sequence similarity to a recently discovered family of prenyltransferases with aromatic substrates, the ABBA prenyltransferases. The present finding extends the substrate range of this family, previously limited to phenolic compounds, to include also phenazine derivatives.	1
Title: Acyclic CB[n]-type molecular containers: effect of solubilizing group on their function as solubilizing excipients Abstract: We report the synthesis and X-ray crystal structures of three acyclic CB[n]-type molecular containers (2a, 2h, 2f) that differ in the charge on their solubilizing groups (SO3(−), OH, NH3(+)). The X-ray crystal structures of compounds 2h and 2f reveal a self-folding of the ArOCH2CH2X wall into the cavity driven by π–π interactions, H-bonds and ion–dipole interactions. The need to reverse this self-folding phenomenon upon guest binding decreases the affinity of 2h and 2f toward cationic guests in water relative to 2a as revealed by direct (1)H NMR and UV/Vis titrations as well as UV/Vis competition experiments. We determined the pKa of 6-aminocoumarin 7 (pKa = 3.6) on its own and in the presence anionic, neutral, and cationic hosts (2a: pKa = 4.9; 2h: pKa = 4.1; 2f, pKa = 3.4) which reflect in part the relevance of direct ion–ion interactions between the arms of the host and the guest toward the recognition properties of acyclic CB[n]-type containers. Finally, we showed that the weaker binding affinities measured for neutral and positively charged hosts 2h and 2f compared to anionic 2a results in a decreased ability to act as solubilizing agents for either cationic (tamoxifen), neutral (17α-ethynylestradiol), or anionic (indomethacin) drugs in water. The results establish that acyclic CB[n] compounds that bear anionic solubilizing groups are most suitable for development as general purpose solubilizing excipients for insoluble pharmaceutical agents.	0
Title: Mutasynthesis of fluorinated pactamycin analogues and their antimalarial activity Abstract: A mutasynthetic strategy has been used to generate fluorinated TM-025 and TM-026, two biosynthetically engineered pactamycin analogues produced by Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456. The fluorinated compounds maintain excellent activity and selectivity toward chloroquine-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of malarial parasites as the parent compounds. The results also provide insights into the biosynthesis of 3-aminobenzoic acid in S. pactum.	1
Title: Overproduction of lactimidomycin by cross-overexpression of genes encoding Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins Abstract: The glutarimide-containing polyketides represent a fascinating class of natural products that exhibit a multitude of biological activities. We have recently cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic gene clusters for three members of the glutarimide-containing polyketides-iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS) from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993, lactimidomycin (LTM) from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, and cycloheximide (CHX) from Streptomyces sp. YIM56141. Comparative analysis of the three clusters identified mgsA and chxA, from the mgs and chx gene clusters, respectively, that were predicted to encode the PimR-like Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs) but failed to reveal any regulatory gene from the ltm gene cluster. Overexpression of mgsA or chxA in S. platensis NRRL 18993, Streptomyces sp. YIM56141 or SB11024, and a recombinant strain of Streptomyces coelicolor M145 carrying the intact mgs gene cluster has no significant effect on iso-MGS or CHX production, suggesting that MgsA or ChxA regulation may not be rate-limiting for iso-MGS and CHX production in these producers. In contrast, overexpression of mgsA or chxA in S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 resulted in a significant increase in LTM production, with LTM titer reaching 106 mg/L, which is five-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. These results support MgsA and ChxA as members of the SARP family of positive regulators for the iso-MGS and CHX biosynthetic machinery and demonstrate the feasibility to improve glutarimide-containing polyketide production in Streptomyces strains by exploiting common regulators.	0
Title: Molecular and genetic characterization of a novel nisin variant produced by Streptococcus uberis Abstract: Streptococcus uberis is one of the principal causative agents of bovine mastitis. In this study, we report that S. uberis strain 42 produces a lantibiotic, nisin U, which is 78% identical (82% similar) to nisin A from Lactococcus lactis. The 15.6-kb nisin U locus comprises 11 open reading frames, similar in putative functionality but differing in arrangement from that of the nisin A biosynthetic cluster. The nisin U producer strain exhibits specific resistance (immunity) to nisin U and cross-resistance to nisin A, a finding consistent with the 55% sequence similarity of their respective immunity peptides. Homologues of the nisin U structural gene were identified in several additional S. uberis strains, and in each case cross-protective immunity was expressed to nisin A and to the other producers of nisin U and its variants. To our knowledge, this is the first report both of characterization of a bacteriocin by S. uberis, as well as of a member of the nisin family of peptides in a species other than L. lactis.	1
Title: A simple method for the electrophilic cyanation of secondary amines Abstract: Bleach oxidizes trimethylsilyl cyanide to generate an electrophilic cyanating reagent that readily reacts with an amine nucleophile. This oxidative N-cyanation reaction allows for the preparation of disubstituted cyanamides from amines without using highly toxic cyanogen halides.	0
Title: New Aspercryptins, Lipopeptide Natural Products, Revealed by HDAC Inhibition in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Unlocking the biochemical stores of fungi is key for developing future pharmaceuticals. Through reduced expression of a critical histone deacetylase in Aspergillus nidulans, increases of up to 100-fold were observed in the levels of 15 new aspercryptins, recently described lipopeptides with two noncanonical amino acids derived from octanoic and dodecanoic acids. In addition to two NMR-verified structures, MS/MS networking helped uncover an additional 13 aspercryptins. The aspercryptins break the conventional structural orientation of lipopeptides and appear "backward" when compared to known compounds of this class. We have also confirmed the 14-gene aspercryptin biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes two fatty acid synthases and several enzymes to convert saturated octanoic and dodecanoic acid to α-amino acids.	1
Title: Alamethicin suppresses methanogenesis and promotes acetogenesis in bioelectrochemical systems Abstract: Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) systems with mixed cultures often generate a variety of gaseous and soluble chemicals. Methane is the primary end product in mixed-culture MES because it is the thermodynamically most favorable reduction product of CO2. Here, we show that the peptaibol alamethicin selectively suppressed the growth of methanogens in mixed-culture MES systems, resulting in a shift of the solution and cathode communities to an acetate-producing system dominated by Sporomusa, a known acetogenic genus in MES systems. Archaea in the methane-producing control were dominated by Methanobrevibacter species, but no Archaea were detected in the alamethicin-treated reactors. No methane was detected in the mixed-culture reactors treated with alamethicin over 10 cycles (∼ 3 days each). Instead, acetate was produced at an average rate of 115 nmol ml(-1) day(-1), similar to the rate reported previously for pure cultures of Sporomusa ovata on biocathodes. Mixed-culture control reactors without alamethicin generated methane at nearly 100% coulombic recovery, and no acetate was detected. These results show that alamethicin is effective for the suppression of methanogen growth in MES systems and that its use enables the production of industrially relevant organic compounds by the inhibition of methanogenesis.	0
Title: A new genomic tool, ultra-frequently cleaving TaqII/sinefungin endonuclease with a combined 2.9-bp recognition site, applied to the construction of horse DNA libraries Abstract: Background:                       Genomics and metagenomics are currently leading research areas, with DNA sequences accumulating at an exponential rate. Although enormous advances in DNA sequencing technologies are taking place, progress is frequently limited by factors such as genomic contig assembly and generation of representative libraries. A number of DNA fragmentation methods, such as hydrodynamic sharing, sonication or DNase I fragmentation, have various drawbacks, including DNA damage, poor fragmentation control, irreproducibility and non-overlapping DNA segment representation. Improvements in these limited DNA scission methods are consequently needed. An alternative method for obtaining higher quality DNA fragments involves partial digestion with restriction endonucleases (REases).                  Results:                       We constructed a horse genomic library and a deletion derivative library of the butyrylcholinesterase cDNA coding region using a novel method, based on TaqII, Thermus sp. family bifunctional enzyme exhibiting cofactor analogue specificity relaxation. We used sinefungin (SIN) - an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue with reversed charge pattern, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), to convert the 6-bp recognition site TaqII (5'-GACCGA-3' [11/9]) into a theoretical 2.9-bp REase, with 70 shortened variants of the canonical recognition sequence detected. Because partial DNA cleavage is an inherent feature of the Thermus sp. enzyme family, this modified TaqII is uniquely suited to quasi-random library generation.                  Conclusions:                       In the presence of SIN/DMSO, TaqII REase is transformed from cleaving every 4096 bp on average to cleaving every 58 bp. TaqII SIN/DMSO thus extends the palette of available REase prototype specificities. This phenomenon, employed under partial digestion conditions, was applied to quasi-random DNA fragmentation. Further applications include high sensitivity probe generation and metagenomic DNA amplification.	0
Title: Robust circadian clocks from coupled protein-modification and transcription-translation cycles Abstract: The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus uses both a protein phosphorylation cycle and a transcription-translation cycle to generate circadian rhythms that are highly robust against biochemical noise. We use stochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable rhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation cycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or dilution rates (and compensating synthesis rates), however, the phosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus cannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate, and consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a purely posttranslational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling time drops below the 24-h clock period. At higher growth rates, a transcription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust circadian rhythms. Interestingly, although a transcription-translation cycle is necessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a phosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a transcription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. In fact, the full oscillator built from these two tightly intertwined cycles far outperforms not just each of its two components individually, but also a hypothetical system in which the two parts are coupled as in textbook models of coupled phase oscillators. Our analysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust circadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.	0
Title: Whole-cell display of Pyrococcus horikoshii glutamate decarboxylase in Escherichia coli for high-titer extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid production Abstract: We investigated the effect of cell-surface display of glutamate decarboxylase (GadB) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in recombinant Escherichia coli. We integrated GadB from the hyperthermophilic, anaerobic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii to the C-terminus of the E. coli outer membrane protein C (OmpC). After 12 hr of culturing GadB-displaying cells, the GABA concentration in the extracellular medium increased to 3.2 g/l, which is eight times that obtained with cells expressing GadB in the cytosol. To further enhance GABA production, we increased the temperatures of the culture. At 60°C, the obtained GABA concentration was 4.62 g/l after 12 hr of culture, and 5.35 g/l after 24 hr, which corresponds to a yield of 87.7%.	0
Title: Effects of plasmid propagation of a sporulation promoter on promoter utilization and sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Transcription of the sporulation gene spoVG of Bacillus subtilis is induced at the onset of spore formation and depends on the products of the regulatory genes spoOA, spoOB, and spoOH. We describe two effects of propagating the promoter region of spoVG on a multicopy plasmid replicon in B. subtilis cells. One effect is that transcription from the plasmid-borne spoVG promoter is altered with respect to the time of its induction and the dependence on spoO gene products. An example of this effect is that plasmid propagation was observed to relieve substantially the inhibitory effect of a mutation in spoOH, the spoO gene upon which spoVG promoter activity is most strongly dependent. We present results which suggest that propagation on a plasmid replicon causes an alteration in the conformation of spoVG promoter DNA which somehow compensates for the defective spoOH gene product. Plasmid propagation did not, however, entirely eliminate the requirement for the spoOH gene product; little or no spoVG-directed RNA synthesis was observed in cells bearing a putative spoOH deletion mutation, a finding which indicates that SpoOH protein plays an indispensable role in spoVG promoter utilization. Another effect of propagating the promoter region of spoVG on a multicopy plasmid is to inhibit sporulation. S1 nuclease mapping experiments suggest that amplification of spoVG on a multicopy plasmid causes the titration of a transcription factor or minor form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme required for utilization of one of the two overlapping promoters which comprise the spoVG transcription initiation region.	0
Title: Sustainable source of omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid from metabolically engineered Yarrowia lipolytica: from fundamental research to commercial production Abstract: The omega-3 fatty acids, cis-5, 8, 11, 14, and 17-eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5; EPA) and cis-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19-docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6; DHA), have wide-ranging benefits in improving heart health, immune function, mental health, and infant cognitive development. Currently, the major source for EPA and DHA is from fish oil, and a minor source of DHA is from microalgae. With the increased demand for EPA and DHA, DuPont has developed a clean and sustainable source of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA through fermentation using metabolically engineered strains of Yarrowia lipolytica. In this mini-review, we will focus on DuPont's technology for EPA production. Specifically, EPA biosynthetic and supporting pathways have been introduced into the oleaginous yeast to synthesize and accumulate EPA under fermentation conditions. This Yarrowia platform can also produce tailored omega-3 (EPA, DHA) and/or omega-6 (ARA, GLA) fatty acid mixtures in the cellular lipid profiles. Fundamental research such as metabolic engineering for strain construction, high-throughput screening for strain selection, fermentation process development, and process scale-up were all needed to achieve the high levels of EPA titer, rate, and yield required for commercial application. Here, we summarize how we have combined the fundamental bioscience and the industrial engineering skills to achieve large-scale production of Yarrowia biomass containing high amounts of EPA, which led to two commercial products, New Harvest™ EPA oil and Verlasso® salmon.	0
Title: The putative permease PhlE of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113 has a role in 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol resistance and in general stress tolerance Abstract: 2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol (PHL) is the primary determinant of the biological control activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113. The operon phlACBD encodes enzymes responsible for PHL biosynthesis from intermediate metabolites. The phlE gene, which is located downstream of the phlACBD operon, encodes a putative permease suggested to be a member of the major facilitator superfamily with 12 transmembrane segments. PhlE has been suggested to function in PHL export. Here the sequencing of the phlE gene from P. fluorescens F113 and the construction of a phlE null mutant, F113-D3, is reported. It is shown that F113-D3 produced less PHL than F113. The ratio of cell-associated to free PHL was not significantly different between the strains, suggesting the existence of alternative transporters for PHL. The phlE mutant was, however, significantly more sensitive to high concentrations of added PHL, implicating PhlE in PHL resistance. Furthermore, the phlE mutant was more susceptible to osmotic, oxidative and heat-shock stresses. Osmotic stress induced rapid degradation of free PHL by the bacteria. Based on these results, we propose that the role of phlE in general stress tolerance is to export toxic intermediates of PHL degradation from the cells.	1
Title: Reconstitution and Substrate Specificity of the Radical S-Adenosyl-methionine Thiazole C-Methyltransferase in Thiomuracin Biosynthesis Abstract: Thiomuracin is a thiopeptide antibiotic with potent activity toward Gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria. Thiomuracin is biosynthesized from a precursor peptide, TbtA, by a complex array of posttranslational modifications. One of several intriguing transformations is the C-methylation of thiazole, occurring at an unactivated sp2 carbon. Herein, we report the in vitro reconstitution of TbtI, the responsible radical S-adenosyl-methionine (rSAM) C-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the formation of 5-methylthiazole at a single site. Our studies demonstrate that a linear hexazole-bearing intermediate of TbtA is a substrate for TbtI whereas macrocyclized thiomuracin GZ is not. In determining the minimal substrate for TbtI, we found that the enzyme is functional when most of the leader peptide has been removed. The in vitro reconstitution of TbtI, a class C rSAM methyltransferase, further adds to the chemical versatility of rSAM enzymes, and informs on the complexity of thiomuracin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Effect of isotopically sensitive branching on product distribution for pentalenene synthase: support for a mechanism predicted by quantum chemistry Abstract: Mechanistic proposals for the carbocation cascade reaction leading to the tricyclic sesquiterpene pentalenene are assessed in light of the results of isotopically sensitive branching experiments with the H309A mutant of pentalenene synthase. These experimental results support a mechanism for pentalenene formation involving a 7-protoilludyl cation whose intermediacy was first predicted using quantum-chemical calculations.	0
Title: The cell end marker Tea4 regulates morphogenesis and pathogenicity in the basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis Abstract: Positional cues localized to distinct cell domains are critical for the generation of cell polarity and cell morphogenesis. These cues lead to assembly of protein complexes that organize the cytoskeleton resulting in delivery of vesicles to sites of polarized growth. Tea4, an SH3 domain protein, was first identified in fission yeast, and is a critical determinant of the axis of polarized growth, a role conserved among ascomycete fungi. Ustilago maydis is a badiomycete fungus that exhibits a yeast-like form that is nonpathogenic and a filamentous form that is pathogenic on maize and teozintle. We are interested in understanding how positional cues contribute to generation and maintenance of these two forms, and their role in pathogenicity. We identified a homologue of fission yeast tea4 in a genetic screen for mutants with altered colony and cell morphology and present here analysis of Tea4 for the first time in a basidiomycete fungus. We demonstrate that Tea4 is an important positional marker for polarized growth and septum location in both forms. We uncover roles for Tea4 in maintenance of cell and neck width, cell separation, and cell wall deposition in the yeast-like form, and in growth rate, formation of retraction septa, growth reversal, and inhibition of budding in the filamentous form. We show that Tea4::GFP localizes to sites of polarized or potential polarized growth in both forms, as observed in ascomycete fungi. We demonstrate an essential role of Tea4 in pathogencity in the absence of cell fusion. Basidiomycete and ascomycete Tea4 homologues share SH3 and Glc7 domains. Tea4 in basidiomycetes has additional domains, which has led us to hypothesize that Tea4 has novel functions in this group of fungi.	0
Title: An oxidation domain in the BlmIII non-ribosomal peptide synthetase probably catalyzing thiazole formation in the biosynthesis of the anti-tumor drug bleomycin in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 Abstract: We have previously proposed that the BlmIV and BlmIII non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are involved in the formation of the bithiazole moiety of the anti-tumor drug bleomycin in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003. We report here the identification and characterization of an oxidation domain in BlmIII. The oxidation domain shows local homology to a family of oxidoreductases and is present in all thiazole-forming non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules known to date. Both the blmIII-Ox domain and blmIII gene were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting BlmIII-Ox and BlmIII proteins were purified to homogeneity. The oxidation domain contains one molar equivalent of non-covalently bound FMN as a prosthetic group. These results provide experimental evidence for an oxidation domain within non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, suggesting that BlmIII-Ox probably catalyzes the thiazoline to thiazole oxidation in bleomycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Molecular Cloning and Functional Analysis of Gene Clusters for the Biosynthesis of Indole-Diterpenes in Penicillium crustosum and P. janthinellum Abstract: The penitremane and janthitremane families of indole-diterpenes are abundant natural products synthesized by Penicillium crustosum and P. janthinellum. Using a combination of PCR, cosmid library screening, and Illumina sequencing we have identified gene clusters encoding enzymes for the synthesis of these compounds. Targeted deletion of penP in P. crustosum abolished the synthesis of penitrems A, B, D, E, and F, and led to accumulation of paspaline, a key intermediate for paxilline biosynthesis in P. paxilli. Similarly, deletion of janP and janD in P. janthinellum abolished the synthesis of prenyl-elaborated indole-diterpenes, and led to accumulation in the latter of 13-desoxypaxilline, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the structurally related aflatremanes synthesized by Aspergillus flavus. This study helps resolve the genetic basis for the complexity of indole-diterpene natural products found within the Penicillium and Aspergillus species. All indole-diterpene gene clusters identified to date have a core set of genes for the synthesis of paspaline and a suite of genes encoding multi-functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, FAD dependent monooxygenases, and prenyl transferases that catalyse various regio- and stereo- specific oxidations that give rise to the diversity of indole-diterpene products synthesized by this group of fungi.	1
Title: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Biological Activity of the Cyclic Lipopeptide Anikasin Abstract: The class of cyclic lipopeptide natural products consists of compounds with a diverse range of bioactivities. In this study, we elucidated the structure of the cyclic lipopeptide anikasin using X-ray crystallography, analyzed its biosynthetic gene cluster, and investigated its natural role in the interaction between the producer strain Pseudomonas fluorescens HKI0770 and protozoal predators. These results led to the conclusion that anikasin has dual functionality enabling swarming motility and acting as a niche amoebicide, which effectively inhibits the social amoeba Polysphondylium violaceum and protects the producer strain from protozoal grazing.	1
Title: Analysis of the gene cluster involved in production and immunity of the peptide antibiotic AS-48 in Enterococcus faecalis Abstract: A region of 7.8 kb of the plasmid pMB2 from Enterococcus faecalis S-48 carrying the information necessary for production and immunity of the peptide antibiotic AS-48 has been cloned and sequenced. It contains the as-48A structural gene plus five open reading frames (as-48B, as-48C, as-48C1, as-48D and as-48D1). Besides As-48D, all the predicted gene products are basic hydrophobic proteins with potential membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). None of them shows any homology with protein sequences stored in databanks, except for As-48D, which shows similarity to the C-terminal domain of ABC transporters and contains a highly conserved ATP-binding site. The gene products of as-48B, as-48C, as-48C1 and as-48D are thought to be involved in AS-48 production and secretion. The only gene able to provide resistance to AS-48 by itself is as-48D1. Immunity also seems to be enhanced at least by the products of as-48B, as-48C1 and as-48D genes. Transcription analysis using probes derived from the different ORFs revealed two large (3.5 and 2.7kb) mRNAs, suggesting that the different genes are organized in two constitutive operons.	1
Title: Accurate prediction of secondary metabolite gene clusters in filamentous fungi Abstract: Biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites from fungi are currently subject to an intense effort to elucidate the genetic basis for these compounds due to their large potential within pharmaceutics and synthetic biochemistry. The preferred method is methodical gene deletions to identify supporting enzymes for key synthases one cluster at a time. In this study, we design and apply a DNA expression array for Aspergillus nidulans in combination with legacy data to form a comprehensive gene expression compendium. We apply a guilt-by-association-based analysis to predict the extent of the biosynthetic clusters for the 58 synthases active in our set of experimental conditions. A comparison with legacy data shows the method to be accurate in 13 of 16 known clusters and nearly accurate for the remaining 3 clusters. Furthermore, we apply a data clustering approach, which identifies cross-chemistry between physically separate gene clusters (superclusters), and validate this both with legacy data and experimentally by prediction and verification of a supercluster consisting of the synthase AN1242 and the prenyltransferase AN11080, as well as identification of the product compound nidulanin A. We have used A. nidulans for our method development and validation due to the wealth of available biochemical data, but the method can be applied to any fungus with a sequenced and assembled genome, thus supporting further secondary metabolite pathway elucidation in the fungal kingdom.	1
Title: 17-Norpimaranes and (9βH)-17-Norpimaranes from the Tuber of Icacina trichantha Abstract: Seven new 17-norpimarane and (9βH)-17-norpimarane diterpenoids, icacinlactones A-G (1-7), were isolated from the tuber of Icacina trichantha. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic and HRMS techniques, and the absolute configuration of 2 was determined by means of X-ray crystallographic analysis. Compounds 1-7, as well as four known related structures, were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma cancer), MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer), and OVCAR3 (human ovarian cancer) cell lines. Several of these natural products displayed significant cytotoxic activity, with humirianthenolide C being the most active.	0
Title: Heterologous Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acid F Abstract: Nodulisporic acids comprise a group of valuable indole diterpenes that exhibit potent insecticidal activities. We report the identification of a gene cluster in the genome of the filamentous fungus Hypoxylon pulicicidum (Nodulisporium sp.) that contains genes responsible for the biosynthesis of nodulisporic acids. Using Penicillium paxilli as a heterologous host, and through pathway reconstitution experiments, we identified the function of four genes involved in the biosynthesis of the nodulisporic acid core compound, nodulisporic acid F (NAF). Two of these genes (nodM and nodW) are especially significant as they encode enzymes with previously unreported functionality: nodM encodes a 3-geranylgeranylindole epoxidase capable of catalyzing only a single epoxidation step to prime formation of the distinctive ring structure of nodulisporic acids, and nodW encodes the first reported gene product capable of introducing a carboxylic acid moiety to an indole diterpene core structure that acts as a reactive handle for further modification. Here, we present the enzymatic basis for the biosynthetic branch point that gives rise to nodulisporic acids.	1
Title: Protective effects of immunoactive peptide, FK565 against systemic and local infections with herpes simplex virus and murine cytomegalovirus and respiratory tract infection with influenza virus in mice Abstract: The protective effects of FK565 against systemic infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), respiratory tract infection with influenza virus and zosteriform rash with HSV investigated in mice. FK565 showed excellent protective activities against systemic infections with both acyclovir (ACV)-sensitive and -resistant HSV at intravenous and subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg and oral dose of 1 mg/kg. FK565 showed superior protective activities at subcutaneous doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg compared to ACV at subcutaneous dose of 15 mg/kg against MCMV infection. In respiratory tract infection with influenza virus, FK565 showed potent protective effects at intravenous, subcutaneous and oral doses of 0.001 to 1 mg/kg. FK565 markedly inhibited zosteriform spread of HSV on the flank skin at an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg and the mice given FK565 survived longer than the control mice. The peritoneal exudate cells from FK565-treated mice suppressed the growth of HSV in mouse embryo fibroblast more strongly than those from the control mice, although FK565 had no direct antiviral activity against HSV. These findings suggest that FK565 enhanced the host defense ability against viral infections by nonspecific activation of macrophages.	0
Title: Resistance Gene-Guided Genome Mining: Serial Promoter Exchanges in Aspergillus nidulans Reveal the Biosynthetic Pathway for Fellutamide B, a Proteasome Inhibitor Abstract: Fungal genome projects are revealing thousands of cryptic secondary metabolism (SM) biosynthetic gene clusters that encode pathways that potentially produce valuable compounds. Heterologous expression systems should allow these clusters to be expressed and their products obtained, but approaches are needed to identify the most valuable target clusters. The inp cluster of Aspergillus nidulans contains a gene, inpE, that encodes a proteasome subunit, leading us to hypothesize that the inp cluster produces a proteasome inhibitor and inpE confers resistance to this compound. Previous efforts to express this cluster have failed, but by sequentially replacing the promoters of the genes of the cluster with a regulatable promotor, we have expressed them successfully. Expression reveals that the product of the inp cluster is the proteasome inhibitor fellutamide B, and our data allow us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the compound. By deleting inpE and activating expression of the inp cluster, we demonstrate that inpE is required for resistance to internally produced fellutamide B. These data provide experimental validation for the hypothesis that some fungal SM clusters contain genes that encode resistant forms of the enzymes targeted by the compound produced by the cluster.	1
Title: Properties and gene structure of a bifunctional cellulolytic enzyme (CelA) from the extreme thermophile 'Anaerocellum thermophilum' with separate glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and 48 catalytic domains Abstract: A large cellulolytic enzyme (CelA) with the ability to hydrolyse microcrystalline cellulose was isolated from the extremely thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium 'Anaerocellum thermophilum'. Full-length CelA and a truncated enzyme species designated CelA' were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants. CelA has an apparent molecular mass of 230 kDa. The enzyme exhibited significant activity towards Avicel and was most active towards soluble substrates such as CM-cellulose (CMC) and beta-glucan. Maximal activity was observed between pH values of 5 and 6 and temperatures of 95 degrees C (CM-cellulase) and 85 degrees C (Avicelase). Cellobiose, glucose and minor amounts of cellotriose were observed as end-products of Avicel degradation. The CelA-encoding gene was isolated from genomic DNA of 'A. thermophilum' by PCR and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The celA gene encodes a protein of 1711 amino acids (190 kDa) starting with the sequence found at the N-terminus of CelA purified from 'A. thermophilum'. Sequence analysis revealed a multidomain structure consisting of two distinct catalytic domains homologous to glycosyl hydrolase families 9 and 48 and three domains homologous to family III cellulose-binding domain linked by Pro-Thr-Ser-rich regions. The enzyme is most closely related to CelA of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (sequence identities of 96 and 97% were found for the N- and C-terminal catalytic domains, respectively). Endoglucanase CelZ of Clostridium stercorarium shows 70.4% sequence identity to the N-terminal family 9 domain and exoglucanase CelY from the same organism has 69.2% amino acid identity with the C-terminal family 48 domain. Consistent with this similarity on the primary structure level, the 90 kDa truncated derivative CelA' containing the N-terminal half of CelA exhibited endoglucanase activity and bound to microcrystalline cellulose. Due to the significantly enhanced Avicelase activity of full-length CelA, exoglucanase activity may be ascribed to the C-terminal family 48 catalytic domain.	0
Title: Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster: new insights into the biosynthesis of aminocoumarin antibiotics Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin was cloned by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces roseochromogenes DS 12.976 with two heterologous probes from the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis revealed 27 ORFs with striking similarity to the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin and coumermycin A(1). Inactivation of a putative aldolase gene, cloR, by in-frame deletion led to the abolishment of the production of clorobiocin. Feeding of the mutant with 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Ring A of clorobiocin) restored clorobiocin production. Here, it is suggested that the formation of Ring A of clorobiocin may proceed via a retro-aldol reaction catalysed by CloR, i.e. by a mechanism different from the previously elucidated benzoic acid biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces maritimus. A comparison of the gene clusters for clorobiocin, novobiocin and coumermycin A(1) showed that the structural differences between the three antibiotics were reflected remarkably well by differences in the organization of their respective biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Comprehensive analysis of antibody recognition in convalescent humans from highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of protective antibody recognition against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 in humans is critical for the development of effective therapies and vaccines. Here we report the crystal structure of three H5-specific human monoclonal antibodies bound to the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA) with distinct epitope specificities, neutralization potencies and breadth. A structural and functional analysis of these epitopes combined with those reported elsewhere identifies four major vulnerable sites on the globular head of H5N1 HA. Chimeric and vulnerable site-specific mutant pseudoviruses are generated to delineate broad neutralization specificities of convalescent sera from two individuals who recovered from the infection with H5N1 virus. Our results show that the four vulnerable sites on the globular head rather than the stem region are the major neutralizing targets, suggesting that during natural H5N1 infection neutralizing antibodies against the globular head work in concert to provide protective antibody-mediated immunity.	0
Title: Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes Abstract: Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host-guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure-function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft-like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft-like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less-methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.	0
Title: A Link between Linearmycin Biosynthesis and Extracellular Vesicle Genesis Connects Specialized Metabolism and Bacterial Membrane Physiology Abstract: Specialized metabolites support bacterial competitive fitness as antibiotics, signals, pigments, and metal scavengers. Little is known about how specialized metabolites are processed and trafficked for their diverse competitive functions. Linearmycins A and B are linear polyketides with antifungal and antibacterial activity but are colony-localized in imaging mass spectrometry of Streptomyces sp. Mg1 (S. sp. Mg1). To decipher a connection between colony localization and antibiotic activity, we identified the linearmycin gene cluster and investigated linearmycin production and distribution by S. sp. Mg1. Our results uncover a large family of variant linearmycins with limited solubility in aqueous solution. We hypothesized that extracellular vesicles may traffic the lipid-like linearmycins. We found that vesicles isolated from culture supernatants contained linearmycins. Surprisingly, abolishing production of linearmycins in S. sp. Mg1 also diminished extracellular vesicle production. Our results reveal integration of linearmycin biosynthesis with production of extracellular vesicles, suggesting a deep connection between specialized metabolism and bacterial membrane physiology.	1
Title: Probing the probes: fitness factors for small molecule tools Abstract: Chemical probes for interrogating biological processes are of considerable current interest. Cell permeable small molecule tools have a major role in facilitating the functional annotation of the human genome, understanding both physiological and pathological processes, and validating new molecular targets. To be valuable, chemical tools must satisfy necessary criteria and recent publications have suggested objective guidelines for what makes a useful chemical probe. Although recognizing that such guidelines may be valuable, we caution against overly restrictive rules that may stifle innovation in favor of a "fit-for-purpose" approach. Reviewing the literature and providing examples from the cancer field, we recommend a series of "fitness factors" to be considered when assessing chemical probes. We hope this will encourage innovative chemical biology research while minimizing the generation of poor quality and misleading biological data, thus increasing understanding of the particular biological area, to the benefit of basic research and drug discovery.	0
Title: In vitro reconstitution of indolmycin biosynthesis reveals the molecular basis of oxazolinone assembly Abstract: The bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor indolmycin features a unique oxazolinone heterocycle whose biogenetic origins have remained obscure for over 50 years. Here we identify and characterize the indolmycin biosynthetic pathway, using systematic in vivo gene inactivation, in vitro biochemical assays, and total enzymatic synthesis. Our work reveals that a phenylacetate-CoA ligase-like enzyme Ind3 catalyzes an unusual ATP-dependent condensation of indolmycenic acid and dehydroarginine, driving oxazolinone ring assembly. We find that Ind6, which also has chaperone-like properties, acts as a gatekeeper to direct the outcome of this reaction. With Ind6 present, the normal pathway ensues. Without Ind6, the pathway derails to an unusual shunt product. Our work reveals the complete pathway for indolmycin formation and sets the stage for using genetic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate indolmycin derivatives as potential therapeutic agents.	1
Title: Identification of the Colicin V Bacteriocin Gene Cluster by Functional Screening of a Human Microbiome Metagenomic Library Abstract: The forces that shape human microbial ecology are complex. It is likely that human microbiota, similarly to other microbiomes, use antibiotics as one way to establish an ecological niche. In this study, we use functional metagenomics to identify human microbial gene clusters that encode for antibiotic functions. Screening of a metagenomic library prepared from a healthy patient stool sample led to the identification of a family of clones with inserts that are 99% identical to a region of a virulence plasmid found in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli. Characterization of the metagenomic DNA sequence identified a colicin V biosynthetic cluster as being responsible for the observed antibiotic effect of the metagenomic clone against E. coli. This study presents a scalable method to recover antibiotic gene clusters from humans using functional metagenomics and highlights a strategy to study bacteriocins in the human microbiome which can provide a resource for therapeutic discovery.	1
Title: Multiple site-selective insertions of noncanonical amino acids into sequence-repetitive polypeptides Abstract: A simple and efficient method is described for the introduction of noncanonical amino acids at multiple, defined sites within recombinant polypeptide sequences. Escherichia coli MRA30, a bacterial host strain with attenuated activity of release factor 1 (RF1), was assessed for its ability to support incorporation of a diverse range of noncanonical amino acids in response to multiple encoded amber (TAG) codons within genes derived from superfolder GFP and an elastin-mimetic protein polymer. Suppression efficiency and protein yield depended on the identity of the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair and the noncanonical amino acid. Elastin-mimetic protein polymers were prepared in which noncanonical amino acid derivatives were incorporated at up to 22 specific sites within the polypeptide sequence with high substitution efficiency. The identities and positions of the variant residues were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the full-length polypeptides and proteolytic cleavage fragments from thermolysin digestion. The data suggest that this multisite suppression approach permits the preparation of protein-based materials in which novel chemical functionalities can be introduced at precisely defined positions within the polypeptide sequence.	0
Title: Biotechnological potential and initial characterization of two novel sesquiterpene synthases from Basidiomycota Coniophora puteana for heterologous production of δ-cadinol Abstract: Background:                       Terpene synthases are versatile catalysts in all domains of life, catalyzing the formation of an enormous variety of different terpenoid secondary metabolites. Due to their diverse bioactive properties, terpenoids are of great interest as innovative ingredients in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Recent advances in genome sequencing have led to the discovery of numerous terpene synthases, in particular in Basidiomycota like the wood rotting fungus Coniophora puteana, which further enhances the scope for the manufacture of terpenes for industrial purposes.                  Results:                       In this study we describe the identification of two novel (+)-δ-cadinol synthases from C. puteana, Copu5 and Copu9. The sesquiterpene (+)-δ-cadinol was previously shown to exhibit cytotoxic activity therefore having an application as possible, new, and sustainably sourced anti-tumor agent. In an Escherichia coli strain, optimized for sesquiterpene production, titers of 225 mg l-1 and 395 mg l-1, respectively, could be achieved. Remarkably, both enzymes share the same product profile thereby representing the first two terpene synthases from Basidiomycota with identical product profiles. We solved the crystal structure of Copu9 in its closed conformation, for the first time providing molecular details of sesquiterpene synthase from Basidiomycota. Based on the Copu9 structure, we conducted structure-based mutagenesis of amino acid residues lining the active site, thereby altering the product profile. Interestingly, the mutagenesis study also revealed that despite the conserved product profiles of Copu5 and Copu9 different conformational changes may accompany the catalytic cycle of the two enzymes. This observation suggests that the involvement of tertiary structure elements in the reaction mechanism(s) employed by terpene synthases may be more complex than commonly expected.                  Conclusion:                       The presented product selectivity and titers of Copu5 and Copu9 may pave the way towards a sustainable, biotechnological production of the potentially new bioactive (+)-δ-cadinol. Furthermore, Copu5 and Copu9 may serve as model systems for further mechanistic studies of terpenoid catalysis.	1
Title: New Rimocidin/CE-108 Derivatives Obtained by a Crotonyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase Gene Disruption in Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108: Substrates for the Polyene Carboxamide Synthase PcsA Abstract: The rimJ gene, which codes for a crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, lies within the biosynthetic gene cluster for two polyketides belonging to the polyene macrolide group (CE-108 and rimocidin) produced by Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108. Disruption of rimJ by insertional inactivation gave rise to a recombinant strain overproducing new polyene derivatives besides the parental CE-108 (2a) and rimocidin (4a). The structure elucidation of one of them, CE-108D (3a), confirmed the incorporation of an alternative extender unit for elongation step 13. Other compounds were also overproduced in the fermentation broth of rimJ disruptant. The new compounds are in vivo substrates for the previously described polyene carboxamide synthase PcsA. The rimJ disruptant strain, constitutively expressing the pcsA gene, allowed the overproduction of CE-108E (3b), the corresponding carboxamide derivative of CE-108D (3a), with improved pharmacological properties.	1
Title: Antifungal hydrogels Abstract: Fungi are increasingly identified as major pathogens in bloodstream infections, often involving indwelling devices. Materials with antifungal properties may provide an important deterrent to these infections. Here we describe amphogel, a dextran-based hydrogel into which amphotericin B is adsorbed. Amphogel kills fungi within 2 h of contact and can be reused for at least 53 days without losing its effectiveness against Candida albicans. The antifungal material is biocompatible in vivo and does not cause hemolysis in human blood. Amphogel inoculated with C. albicans and implanted in mice prevents fungal infection. Amphogel also mitigates fungal biofilm formation. An antifungal matrix with these properties could be used to coat a variety of medical devices such as catheters as well as industrial surfaces.	0
Title: New insights into the bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor CBR703 as a starting point for optimization as an anti-infective agent Abstract: CBR703 was reported to inhibit bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and biofilm formation, considering it to be a good candidate for further optimization. While synthesized derivatives of CBR703 did not result in more-active RNAP inhibitors, we observed promising antibacterial activities. These again correlated with a significant cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Furthermore, we suspect the promising effects on biofilm formation to be artifacts. Consequently, this class of compounds can be considered unattractive as antibacterial agents.	0
Title: Mitogen-regulated Ca2+ current of T lymphocytes is activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores Abstract: Stimulated influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane of T lymphocytes is an essential triggering signal for T-cell activation by antigen. Regulation of the T-cell Ca2+ conductance is not understood; conflicting evidence supports direct activation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or by a signal generated by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. We have used the perforated-patch recording technique to compare the biophysical properties of Ca2+ currents activated by T-cell receptor stimulation and by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor that depletes intracellular stores without generating IP3. Both currents are blocked by Ni2+, are inwardly rectifying, are highly Ca(2+)-selective, and exhibit voltage-independent gating with a unitary chord conductance of approximately 24 fS in isotonic Ca2+. Fluctuation analysis suggests that the underlying Ca2+ transporter is a channel rather than an iron carrier. Thus, in terms of ion permeation, gating, and unitary conductance, the Ca2+ current activated by thapsigargin is indistinguishable from the elicited by crosslinking of T-cell receptors. Moreover, the unitary Ca2+ conductance is > 100-fold smaller than that of previously described IP3-gated, Ca(2+)-permeable channels in T cells [Kuno, M. & Gardner, P. (1987) Nature (London) 326, 301-304]. These results demonstrate that mitogen-activated Ca2+ influx is controlled by the state of intracellular Ca2+ stores rather than by the direct action of IP3 on Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane.	0
Title: Host-Guest Tethered DNA Transducer: ATP Fueled Release of a Protein Inhibitor from Cucurbit[7]uril Abstract: Host-guest complexes are emerging as powerful components in functional systems with applications ranging from materials to biomedicine. In particular, CB7 based host-guest complexes have received much attention for the controlled release of drugs due to the remarkable ability of CB7 toward binding input molecules in water with high affinity leading to displacement of CB7 from included pharmacophores (or from drug loaded porous particles). However, the release of bound guests from CB7 in response to endogenous biological molecules remains limited since the input biomolecule needs to have the appropriate chemical structure to bind tightly into the CB7 cavity. Herein we describe a synthetic transducer based on self-assembling DNA-small molecule chimeras (DCs) that is capable of converting a chosen biological input, adenosine triphosphate (ATP; that does not directly bind to the CB7 host), into functional displacement of a protein inhibitor that is bound within the CB7 host. Our system-which features the first example of a covalent CB-DNA conjugate-is highly modular and can be adapted to enable responsiveness to other biologically/clinically relevant stimuli via its split DNA aptamer architecture.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression and Biochemical Analysis Reveal a Schizokinen-Based Siderophore Pathway in Leptolyngbya (Cyanobacteria) Abstract: Siderophores are low molecular weight iron-chelating molecules that many organisms secrete to scavenge ferric iron from the environment. While cyanobacteria inhabit a wide range of environments with poor iron availability, only two siderophore families have been characterized from this phylum. Herein, we sought to investigate siderophore production in the marine genus, Leptolyngbya. A 12 open reading frame (14.5 kb) putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster, identified in the genome of Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 7376, was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Under iron-limiting conditions, expression strains harboring the first seven genes (lidA to lidF), produced a potent siderophore, which was subsequently identified via UPLC-MS/MS and NMR as schizokinen. The enzymes encoded by the remaining genes (lidG1 to lidG5) did not appear to be active in E. coli, therefore their function could not be determined. Bioinformatic analysis revealed gene clusters with high homology to lidA to lidF in phylogenetically and biogeographically diverse cyanobacteria, suggesting that schizokinen-based siderophore production is widespread in this phylum. Siderophore yields in E. coli expression strains were significantly higher than those achieved by Leptolyngbya, highlighting the potential of this platform for producing siderophores of industrial value. IMPORTANCE Iron availability limits the growth of many microorganisms, particularly those residing in high nutrient-low chlorophyll aquatic environments. Therefore, characterizing iron acquisition pathways in phytoplankton is essential for understanding nutrient cycling in our oceans. The results of this study suggest that Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 7376, and many other cyanobacteria, use schizokinen-based iron chelators (siderophores) to scavenge iron from the environment. We have shown that these pathways are amenable to heterologous expression in E. coli, which expands the limited arsenal of known cyanobacterial siderophores and is advantageous for the downstream overproduction of relevant siderophores of ecological and industrial value.	1
Title: Protein tyrosine O-glycosylation--a rather unexplored prokaryotic glycosylation system Abstract: Glycosylation is a frequent and heterogeneous posttranslational protein modification occurring in all domains of life. While protein N-glycosylation at asparagine and O-glycosylation at serine, threonine or hydroxyproline residues have been studied in great detail, only few data are available on O-glycosidic attachment of glycans to the amino acid tyrosine. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a bacterial protein tyrosine O-glycosylation system. In the Gram-positive, mesophilic bacterium Paenibacillus alvei CCM 2051(T), a polysaccharide consisting of [-->3)-beta-d-Galp-(1[alpha-d-Glcp-(1-->6)] -->4)-beta-d-ManpNAc-(1-->] repeating units is O-glycosidically linked via an adaptor with the structure -[GroA-2-->OPO(2)-->4-beta-d-ManpNAc-(1-->4)] -->3)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-d-Galp-(1--> to specific tyrosine residues of the S-layer protein SpaA. A +AH4-24.3-kb S-layer glycosylation (slg) gene cluster encodes the information necessary for the biosynthesis of this glycan chain within 18 open reading frames (ORF). The corresponding translation products are involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated monosaccharides, assembly and export as well as in the transfer of the completed polysaccharide chain to the S-layer target protein. All ORFs of the cluster, except those encoding the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis enzymes and the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter integral transmembrane proteins, were disrupted by the insertion of the mobile group II intron Ll.LtrB, and S-layer glycoproteins produced in mutant backgrounds were analyzed by mass spectrometry. There is evidence that the glycan chain is synthesized in a process comparable to the ABC-transporter-dependent pathway of the lipopolysaccharide O-polysaccharide biosynthesis. Furthermore, with the protein WsfB, we have identified an O-oligosaccharyl:protein transferase required for the formation of the covalent beta-d-Gal-->Tyr linkage between the glycan chain and the S-layer protein.	1
Title: Epoxyquinone formation catalyzed by a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase involved in biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aromatic polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin (ACT) in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) carries a pair of genes, actVA-ORF5 and actVB, that encode a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO). Our previous studies have demonstrated that the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system functions as a quinone-forming C-6 oxygenase in ACT biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that this enzyme system exhibits an additional oxygenation activity with dihydrokalafungin (DHK), a proposed intermediate in the ACT biosynthetic pathway, and generates two reaction products. These compounds were revealed to be monooxygenated derivatives of kalafungin, which is spontaneously formed through oxidative lactonization of DHK. Their absolute structures were elucidated from their NMR spectroscopic data and by computer modeling and X-ray crystallography as (5S,14R)-epoxykalafungin and (5R,14S)-epoxykalafungin, demonstrating an additional epoxyquinone-forming activity of the ActVA-ORF5/ActVB system in vitro.	1
Title: The principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1 located in V3 of gp120 forms a 12-residue loop by internal hydrophobic interactions Abstract: The interactions of the peptide RP135a (RKSI-RIQRGPGRAFVT), corresponding to residues 311-326 of gp120 of HIV-1IIIB, with the anti-gp120 HIV-1IIIB neutralizing antibody 0.5 beta were studied by NMR. The NOESY difference spectra measured using specifically deuterated derivatives of the peptide show exclusively the interactions of the deuterated residues both within the bound peptide and with the Fab fragment of the antibody. These measurements reveal hydrophobic interactions within the bound peptide between Ile-4, Ile-6 and Val-15 that create a 12-residue loop with these residues at the base and the conserved GPGR sequence at its top.	0
Title: Redox Modifications in the Biosynthesis of Alchivemycin A Enable the Formation of Its Key Pharmacophore Abstract: Redox enzymes play a critical role in transforming nascent scaffolds into structurally complex and biologically active natural products. Alchivemycin A (AVM, 1) is a highly oxidized polycyclic compound with potent antimicrobial activity and features a rare 2H-tetrahydro-4,6-dioxo-1,2-oxazine (TDO) ring system. The scaffold of AVM has previously been shown to be biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) pathway. In this study, we present a postassembly secondary metabolic network involving six redox enzymes that leads to AVM formation. We characterize this complex redox network using in vivo gene deletions, in vitro biochemical assays, and one-pot enzymatic total synthesis. Importantly, we show that an FAD-dependent monooxygenase catalyzes oxygen insertion into an amide bond to form the key TDO ring in AVM, an unprecedented function of flavoenzymes. We also show that the TDO ring is essential to the antimicrobial activity of AVM, likely through targeting the β-subunit of RNA polymerase. As further evidence, we show that AvmK, a β-subunit of RNA synthase, can confer self-resistance to AVM via target modification. Our findings expand the repertoire of functions of flavoenzymes and provide insight into antimicrobial and biocatalyst development based on AVM.	1
Title: Activatable Singlet Oxygen Generation from Lipid Hydroperoxide Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis is a widely practiced strategy for cancer therapy. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of the spatial-temporal control of ROS generation, the meticulous participation of light, photosensitizer, and oxygen greatly hinders the broad application of PDT as a first-line cancer treatment option. An activatable system has been developed that enables tumor-specific singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) generation for cancer therapy, based on a Fenton-like reaction between linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAHP) tethered on iron oxide nanoparticles (IO NPs) and the released iron(II) ions from IO NPs under acidic-pH condition. The IO-LAHP NPs are able to induce efficient apoptotic cancer cell death both in vitro and in vivo through tumor-specific 1 O2 generation and subsequent ROS mediated mechanism. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of modulating biochemical reactions as a ROS source to exert cancer death.	0
Title: Asymmetric ATP hydrolysis cycle of the heterodimeric multidrug ABC transport complex TmrAB from Thermus thermophilus Abstract: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems translocate a wide range of solutes across cellular membranes. The thermophilic gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, a model organism for structural genomics and systems biology, discloses ∼46 ABC proteins, which are largely uncharacterized. Here, we functionally analyzed the first two and only ABC half-transporters of the hyperthermophilic bacterium, TmrA and TmrB. The ABC system mediates uptake of the drug Hoechst 33342 in inside-out oriented vesicles that is inhibited by verapamil. TmrA and TmrB form a stable heterodimeric complex hydrolyzing ATP with a K(m) of 0.9 mm and k(cat) of 9 s(-1) at 68 °C. Two nucleotides can be trapped in the heterodimeric ABC complex either by vanadate or by mutation inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Nucleotide trapping requires permissive temperatures, at which a conformational ATP switch is possible. We further demonstrate that the canonic glutamate 523 of TmrA is essential for rapid conversion of the ATP/ATP-bound complex into its ADP/ATP state, whereas the corresponding aspartate in TmrB (Asp-500) has only a regulatory role. Notably, exchange of this single noncanonic residue into a catalytic glutamate cannot rescue the function of the E523Q/D500E complex, implicating a built-in asymmetry of the complex. However, slow ATP hydrolysis in the newly generated canonic site (D500E) strictly depends on the formation of a posthydrolysis state in the consensus site, indicating an allosteric coupling of both active sites.	0
Title: Natural abundance solid-state carbon NMR studies of photosynthetic reaction centers with photoinduced polarization Abstract: Solid-state NMR spectra of natural abundance 13C in reaction centers from photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides R-26 was measured. When the quinone acceptors were removed and continuous visible illumination of the sample was provided, exceptionally strong nuclear spin polarization was observed in NMR lines with chemical shifts resembling those of the aromatic carbons in bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin. The observation of spin polarized 15N nuclei in bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin was previously demonstrated with nonspecifically 15N-labeled reaction centers. Both the carbon and the nitrogen NMR studies indicate that the polarization is developed on species that carry unpaired electrons in the early electron transfer steps, including the bacteriochlorophyll dimer donor P860 and probably the bacteriopheophytin acceptor. I. Both enhanced-absorptive and emissive polarization were seen in the carbon spectrum; most lines were absorptive but the methine carbons of the porphyrin ring (alpha, beta, gamma, ) exhibited emissive polarization. The change in the sign of the hyperfine coupling at these sites indicates the existence of nodes in the spin density distribution on the tetrapyrrole cofactors flanking each methine carbon bridge.	0
Title: Enzyme-Instructed Self-Assembly of Small D-Peptides as a Multiple-Step Process for Selectively Killing Cancer Cells Abstract: Selective inhibition of cancer cells remains a challenge in chemotherapy. Here we report the molecular and cellular validation of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) as a multiple step process for selectively killing cancer cells that overexpress alkaline phosphatases (ALPs). We design and synthesize two kinds of D-tetrapeptide containing one or two phosphotyrosine residues and with the N-terminal capped by a naphthyl group. Upon enzymatic dephosphorylation, these D-tetrapeptides turn into self-assembling molecules to form nanofibers in water. Incubating these D-tetrapeptides with several cancer cell lines and one normal cell line, the unphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides are innocuous to all the cell lines, the mono- and diphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides selectively inhibit the cancer cells, but not the normal cell. The monophosphorylated D-tetrapeptides exhibit more potent inhibitory activity than the diphosphorylated D-tetrapeptides do; the cancer cell lines express higher level of ALPs are more susceptible to inhibition by the phosphorylated D-tetrapeptides; the precursors of D-tetrapeptides that possess higher self-assembling abilities exhibit higher inhibitory activities. These results confirm the important role of enzymatic reaction and self-assembly. Using uncompetitive inhibitors of ALPs and fluorescent D-tetrapeptides, we delineate that the enzyme catalyzed dephosphorylation and the self-assembly steps, together, result in the localization of the nanofibers of D-tetrapeptides for killing the cancer cells. We find that the cell death modality likely associates with the cell type and prove the interactions between nanofibers and the death receptors. This work illustrates a paradigm-shifting and biomimetic approach and contributes useful molecular insights for the development of spatiotemporal defined supramolecular processes/assemblies as potential anticancer therapeutics.	0
Title: Identification of a hormogonium polysaccharide-specific gene set conserved in filamentous cyanobacteria Abstract: Cyanobacteria comprise a phylum defined by the capacity for oxygenic photosynthesis. Members of this phylum are frequently motile as well. Strains that display gliding or twitching motility across semisolid surfaces are powered by a conserved type IV pilus system (T4P). Among the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, motility is usually confined to specialized filaments known as hormogonia, and requires the deposition of an associated hormogonium polysaccharide (HPS). The genes involved in assembly and export of HPS are largely undefined, and it has been hypothesized that HPS exits the outer membrane via an atypical T4P-driven mechanism. Here, several novel hps loci, primarily encoding glycosyl transferases, are identified. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the majority of these genes are essential for both motility and production of HPS. Notably, most mutant strains accumulate wild-type cellular levels of the major pilin PilA, but not extracellular PilA, indicating dysregulation of the T4P motors, and, therefore, a regulatory interaction between HPS assembly and T4P activity. A co-occurrence analysis of Hps orthologs among cyanobacteria identified an extended set of putative Hps proteins comprising most components of a Wzx/Wzy-type polysaccharide synthesis and export system. This implies that HPS may be secreted through a more canonical pathway, rather than a T4P-mediated mechanism.	0
Title: Formation of the aureothin tetrahydrofuran ring by a bifunctional cytochrome p450 monooxygenase Abstract: The polyketide antibiotic aureothin, produced by Streptomyces thioluteus, is equipped with a rare exomethylene-tetrahydrofuran moiety. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that AurH, a bifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is required and sufficient for the stereoselective synthesis of the furan ring, involving the subsequent formation of two new C-O bonds.	1
Title: Bacteria-mediated bisphenol A degradation Abstract: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an important monomer in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, food cans, and other daily used chemicals. Daily and worldwide usage of BPA and BPA-contained products led to its ubiquitous distribution in water, sediment/soil, and atmosphere. Moreover, BPA has been identified as an environmental endocrine disruptor for its estrogenic and genotoxic activity. Thus, BPA contamination in the environment is an increasingly worldwide concern, and methods to efficiently remove BPA from the environment are urgently recommended. Although many factors affect the fate of BPA in the environment, BPA degradation is mainly depended on the metabolism of bacteria. Many BPA-degrading bacteria have been identified from water, sediment/soil, and wastewater treatment plants. Metabolic pathways of BPA degradation in specific bacterial strains were proposed, based on the metabolic intermediates detected during the degradation process. In this review, the BPA-degrading bacteria were summarized, and the (proposed) BPA degradation pathway mediated by bacteria were referred.	0
Title: Structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery of therapeutics for cocaine overdose and addiction Abstract: (-)-Cocaine is a widely abused drug and there is currently no available anti-cocaine therapeutic. Promising agents, such as anti-cocaine catalytic antibodies and high-activity mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), for therapeutic treatment of cocaine overdose have been developed through structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery. In particular, a unique computational design strategy based on the modeling and simulation of the rate-determining transition state has been developed and used to design and discover desirable high-activity mutants of BChE. One of the discovered high-activity mutants of BChE has a approximately 456-fold improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine. The encouraging outcome of the structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery effort demonstrates that the unique computational design approach based on transition state modeling and simulation is promising for rational enzyme redesign and drug discovery. The general approach of the structure-and-mechanism-based design and discovery may be used to design high-activity mutants of any enzyme or catalytic antibody.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of the Unusual Terreazepine Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Reveals a Promising Approach for Identifying New Chemical Scaffolds Abstract: Advances in genome sequencing have revitalized natural product discovery efforts, revealing the untapped biosynthetic potential of fungi. While the volume of genomic data continues to expand, discovery efforts are slowed due to the time-consuming nature of experiments required to characterize new molecules. To direct efforts toward uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters most likely to encode novel chemical scaffolds, we took advantage of comparative metabolomics and heterologous gene expression using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs). By linking mass spectral profiles with structural clues provided by FAC-encoded gene clusters, we targeted a compound originating from an unusual gene cluster containing an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). With this approach, we isolate and characterize R and S forms of the new molecule terreazepine, which contains a novel chemical scaffold resulting from cyclization of the IDO-supplied kynurenine. The discovery of terreazepine illustrates that FAC-based approaches targeting unusual biosynthetic machinery provide a promising avenue forward for targeted discovery of novel scaffolds and their biosynthetic enzymes, and it also represents another example of a biosynthetic gene cluster "repurposing" a primary metabolic enzyme to diversify its secondary metabolite arsenal.IMPORTANCE Here, we provide evidence that Aspergillus terreus encodes a biosynthetic gene cluster containing a repurposed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) dedicated to secondary metabolite synthesis. The discovery of this neofunctionalized IDO not only enabled discovery of a new compound with an unusual chemical scaffold but also provided insight into the numerous strategies fungi employ for diversifying and protecting themselves against secondary metabolites. The observations in this study set the stage for further in-depth studies into the function of duplicated IDOs present in fungal biosynthetic gene clusters and presents a strategy for accessing the biosynthetic potential of gene clusters containing duplicated primary metabolic genes.	1
Title: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, produced by Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. I. Taxonomy, production, isolation, physico-chemical properties and biological activities Abstract: Benastatins have been isolated as part of a program designed to find microorganism-produced inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase from Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. They were purified by chromatography of reversed-phase silica gel, silica gel and Capcell Pak C18 (HPLC) followed by solvent extraction and then isolated as yellow powders. Benastatins A and B have the molecular formulae, C30H28O7 and C30H30O7, respectively. They were competitive with 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene as the substrate, and the inhibition constants (Ki) of benastatins A and B were 5.0 x 10(-6) and 3.7 x 10(-6), respectively.	1
Title: Detection of the emerging Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O26:H11/H- sequence type 29 (ST29) clone in human patients and healthy cattle in Switzerland Abstract: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O26:H11/H(-) strains showing the characteristics of the emerging human-pathogenic ST29 clone (stx2a(+) only, eae(+), plasmid gene profile hlyA(+) etpD(+)) were detected from human patients and healthy cattle, indicating a possible reservoir. Sheep also appear to shed strains related to the new pathogenic clone O26:H11/H(-) (ST29, stx1a(+) only, eae(+), plasmid gene profile hlyA(+) etpD(+)).	0
Title: Evolution of metabolic diversity in polyketide-derived pyrones: using the non-colinear aureothin assembly line as a model system Abstract: Polyketide-derived pyrones are structurally diverse secondary metabolites that are represented in all three kingdoms of life and are endowed with various biological functions. The aureothin family of Streptomyces metabolites was chosen as a model to study the factors governing structural diversity and the evolutionary processes involved. This review highlights recent insights into the non-colinear aureothin and neoaureothin modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS), aromatic starter unit biosynthesis, polyketide tailoring reactions, and a non-enzymatic polyene splicing cascade. Pyrone biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants is compared. Finally, various strategies to increase metabolic diversity of aureothin derivatives through mutasynthesis, pathway engineering, and biotransformation are presented. The unusual aureothin and neoaureothin assembly lines thus not only represent a model for PKS evolution, but provided important insights into non-canonical enzymatic processes that could be employed for the production of antitumor and antifungal agents.	1
Title: Molecular Basis for Stellatic Acid Biosynthesis: A Genome Mining Approach for Discovery of Sesterterpene Synthases Abstract: The search for a new sesterterpene synthase in the genome of Emericella variecolor, which reportedly produces diverse sesterterpenoids, is described. One gene product (a chimeric protein with prenyltransferase and terpene cyclase domains) led to the synthesis of a novel tricyclic sesterterpene, stellata-2,6,19-triene (1), from DMAPP and IPP, and the hydrocarbon was further transformed into stellatic acid (2) by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded by the gene adjacent to the sesterterpene synthase gene.	1
Title: Identification of marneral synthase, which is critical for growth and development in Arabidopsis Abstract: Plants produce structurally diverse triterpenoids, which are important for their life and survival. Most triterpenoids and sterols share a common biosynthetic intermediate, 2,3-oxidosqualene (OS), which is cyclized by 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC). To investigate the role of an OSC, marneral synthase 1 (MRN1), in planta, we characterized a Arabidopsis mrn1 knock-out mutant displaying round-shaped leaves, late flowering, and delayed embryogenesis. Reduced growth of mrn1 was caused by inhibition of cell expansion and elongation. Marnerol, a reduced form of marneral, was detected in Arabidopsis overexpressing MRN1, but not in the wild type or mrn1. Alterations in the levels of sterols and triterpenols and defects in membrane integrity and permeability were observed in the mrn1. In addition, GUS expression, under the control of the MRN1 gene promoter, was specifically detected in shoot and root apical meristems, which are responsible for primary growth, and the mRNA expression of Arabidopsis clade II OSCs was preferentially observed in roots and siliques containing developing seeds. The eGFP:MRN1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in tobacco protoplasts. Taken together, this report provides evidence that the unusual triterpenoid pathway via marneral synthase is important for the growth and development of Arabidopsis.	1
Title: Decoupling mutations in the D-channel of the aa(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides suggest that a continuous hydrogen-bonded chain of waters is essential for proton pumping Abstract: The aa(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides utilizes two proton-input channels to provide all the protons for chemistry (water formation) and proton pumping. The D-channel is responsible for the uptake of all pumped protons, four protons per O(2). Several substitutions of either N139 or N207, near the entrance of the D-channel, were previously reported to decouple the proton pump from oxidase activity. In this work, the characteristics of additional mutations in this region of the protein (N139, N207, N121, and S142) are determined to elucidate the mechanism of decoupling. With the exception of the substitution of a large, hydrophobic residue (N139L), all the mutations of N139 resulted in an enzyme with high oxidase activity but with a severely diminished proton pumping stoichiometry. Whereas N207D was previously shown to be decoupled, N207A and N207T exhibit nearly wild-type behavior. The new data display a pattern. Small, nonionizable substitutions of N139 or N121 result in decoupling of the proton pump but maintain high turnover rates. These residues are directly hydrogen bonded to two water molecules (Water6574 and Water6584) that are part of the single-file chain of water molecules within the D-channel leading to E286 at the top of the channel. The data suggest that the integrity of this water chain within the D-channel is critical for rapid proton transfer. The mechanism of decoupling is most likely due to the slowing of the rate of proton delivery below a threshold that is required for protonation of the putative proton loading site. Protons delivered outside this time window are delivered to the active site where they are consumed in the formation of water. The rate of proton delivery required to protonate the pump site must be significantly faster than the rate of delivery of protons to the catalytic site. For this reason, mutations can result in decoupling of the proton pump without slowing the catalytic turnover by the enzyme.	0
Title: Formal synthesis of (+/-)-platensimycin Abstract: [reaction: see text] Reductive alkylation of 5-methoxy-1-tetralone (6) with 2,3-dibromopropene gave an equilibrium mixture of bicyclic diones 7 (51%) and 8 (35%). Radical cyclization of 7 afforded tricyclic dione 5 (84%), which was reduced, cyclized, and dehydrated to give tetracyclic alkene 13 in 63% yield. Allylic oxidation of 13 with SeO2 and activated MnO2 afforded enone 2 in 85% yield, thereby completing a short formal synthesis of (+/-)-platensimycin.	0
Title: A molecular genetic map and electrophoretic karyotype of the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus sativus Abstract: A molecular genetic map was constructed and an electrophoretic karyotype was resolved for Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch of barley and wheat. The genetic map consists of 27 linkage groups with 97 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 31 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, two polymerase chain reaction amplified markers, the mating type locus (CsMAT), and a gene (VHv1) conditioning high virulence on barley cv. Bowman. These linkage groups covered a map distance of 849 cM. The virulence gene VHv1 cosegregated with six AFLP markers and was mapped on one of the major linkage groups. Fifteen chromosome-sized DNAs were resolved in C. sativus isolates ND93-1 and ND9OPr with contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis combined with telomere probe analysis of comigrating chromosome-sized DNAs. The chromosome sizes ranged from 1.25 to 3.80 Mbp, and the genome size of the fungus was estimated to be approximately 33 Mbp. By hybridizing genetically mapped RFLP and AFLP markers to CHEF blots, 25 of the 27 linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes. The barley-specific virulence locus VHv1 was localized on a chromosome of 2.80 Mbp from isolate ND9OPr in the CHEF gel. The total map length of the fungus was estimated to be at least 1,329 cM based on the map distance covered by the linked markers and the estimated gaps. Therefore, the physical to genetic distance ratio is approximately 25 kb/cM. Construction of a high-resolution map around target loci will facilitate the cloning of the genes conferring virulence and other characters in C. sativus by a map-based cloning strategy.	0
Title: The Aspergillus nidulans bimC4 mutation provides an excellent tool for identification of kinesin-14 inhibitors Abstract: Centrosome amplification is a hallmark of many types of cancer cells, and clustering of multiple centrosomes is critical for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Human kinesin-14 HSET/KFIC1 is essential for centrosome clustering, and its inhibition leads to the specific killing of cancer cells with extra centrosomes. Since kinesin-14 motor domains are conserved evolutionarily, we conceived a strategy of obtaining kinesin-14 inhibitors using Aspergillus nidulans, based on the previous result that loss of the kinesin-14 KlpA rescues the non-viability of the bimC4 kinesin-5 mutant at 42 °C. However, it was unclear whether alteration of BimC or any other non-KlpA protein would be a major factor reversing the lethality of the bimC4 mutant. Here we performed a genome-wide screen for bimC4 suppressors and obtained fifteen suppressor strains. None of the suppressor mutations maps to bimC. The vast majority of them contain mutations in the klpA gene, most of which are missense mutations affecting the C-terminal motor domain. Our study confirms that the bimC4 mutant is suitable for a cell-based screen for chemical inhibitors of kinesin-14. Since the selection is based on enhanced growth rather than diminished growth, cytotoxic compounds can be excluded.	0
Title: Identification of the coumermycin A(1) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) was cloned by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 with heterologous probes from a dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene, involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis, and from the aminocoumarin resistance gyrase gene gyrB(r). Sequence analysis of a 30.8-kb region upstream of gyrB(r) revealed the presence of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs). Fifteen of the identified ORFs showed, on average, 84% identity to corresponding ORFs in the biosynthetic gene cluster of novobiocin, another aminocoumarin antibiotic. Possible functions of 17 ORFs in the biosynthesis of coumermycin A(1) could be assigned by comparison with sequences in GenBank. Experimental proof for the function of the identified gene cluster was provided by an insertional gene inactivation experiment, which resulted in an abolishment of coumermycin A(1) production.	1
Title: Identification and Proposed Relative and Absolute Configurations of Niphimycins C-E from the Marine-Derived Streptomyces sp. IMB7-145 by Genomic Analysis Abstract: Analysis of the whole genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. IMB7-145 revealed the presence of seven type I polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene clusters, one of which was highly homologous to the biosynthetic gene cluster of azalomycin F. Detailed bioinformatic analysis of the modular organization of the PKS gene suggested that this gene is responsible for niphimycin biosynthesis. Guided by genomic analysis, a large-scale cultivation ultimately led to the discovery and characterization of four new niphimycin congeners, namely, niphimycins C-E (1-3) and 17-O-methylniphimycin (4). The configurations of most stereocenters of niphimycins have not been determined to date. In the present study, the relative configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, including J-based analysis and the CNMR database method. Further, the full absolute configurations of niphimycins were completely proposed for the first time based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis of the ketoreductase and enoylreductase domains for hydroxy- and methyl-bearing stereocenters. Compounds 1, 3, 4, and niphimycin Iα (5) showed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (MIC: 8-64 μg/mL), as well as cytotoxicity against the human HeLa cancer cell line (IC50: 3.0-9.0 μM). In addition, compounds 1 and 5 displayed significant activity against several Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates (MIC: 4-32 μg/mL).	1
Title: Complete microbial degradation of both enantiomers of the chiral herbicide mecoprop [(RS)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid] in an enantioselective manner by Sphingomonas herbicidovorans sp. nov Abstract: Sphingomonas herbicidovorans MH (previously designated Flavobacterium sp. strain MH) was able to utilize the chiral herbicide (RS)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid (mecoprop) as the sole carbon and energy source. When strain MH was offered racemic mecoprop as the growth substrate, it could degrade both the (R) and the (S) enantiomer to completion, as shown by biomass formation, substrate consumption, and stoichiometric chloride release. However, the (S) enantiomer disappeared much faster from the culture medium than the (R) enantiomer. These results suggest the involvement of specific enzymes for the degradation of each enantiomer. This view was substantiated by the fact that resting cells of strain MH grown on (S)-mecoprop were able to degrade the (S) but not the (R) enantiomer of mecoprop. Accordingly, resting cells of strain MH grown on (R)-mecoprop preferentially metabolized the (R) enantiomer. Nevertheless, such cells could transform (S)-mecoprop at low rates. Oxygen uptake rates with resting cells confirmed the above view, as oxygen consumption was strongly dependent on the growth substrate. Cells grown on (R)-mecoprop showed oxygen uptake rates more than two times higher upon incubation with the (R) than upon incubation with the (S) enantiomer and vice versa.	0
Title: Designed Conformation and Fluorescence Properties of Self-Assembled Phenazine-Cored Platinum(II) Metallacycles Abstract: A series of platinum(II) metallacycles were prepared via the coordination-driven self-assembly of a phenazine-cored dipyridyl donor with a 90° Pt(II) acceptor and various dicarboxylate donors in a 1:1:2 ratio. While the metallacycles display similar absorption profiles, they exhibit a trend of blue-shifted fluorescence emission with the decrease in the bite angles between the carboxylate building blocks. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies as well as a computational approach were conducted, revealing that the difference in the degree of constraint imposed on the excited-state planarization of the phenazine core within these metallacycles results in their distinct photophysical behaviors. As such, a small initial difference in the dicarboxylate building blocks is amplified into distinct photophysical properties of the metallacycles, which is reminiscent of the efficient functional tuning observed in natural systems. In addition to the pre-assembly approach, the photophysical properties of a metallacycle can also be modulated using a post-assembly modification to the dicarboxylate building block, suggesting another strategy for functional tuning. This research illustrated the potential of coordination-driven self-assembly for the preparation of materials with precisely tailored functionalities at the molecular level.	0
Title: Transcriptomic and proteomic approach for understanding the molecular basis of adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to wine fermentation Abstract: Throughout alcoholic fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have to cope with several stress conditions that could affect their growth and viability. In addition, the metabolic activity of yeast cells during this process leads to the production of secondary compounds that contribute to the organoleptic properties of the resulting wine. Commercial strains have been selected during the last decades for inoculation into the must to carry out the alcoholic fermentation on the basis of physiological traits, but little is known about the molecular basis of the fermentative behavior of these strains. In this work, we present the first transcriptomic and proteomic comparison between two commercial strains with different fermentative behaviors. Our results indicate that some physiological differences between the fermentative behaviors of these two strains could be related to differences in the mRNA and protein profiles. In this sense, at the level of gene expression, we have found differences related to carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen catabolite repression, and response to stimuli, among other factors. In addition, we have detected a relative increase in the abundance of proteins involved in stress responses (the heat shock protein Hsp26p, for instance) and in fermentation (in particular, the major cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6p) in the strain with better behavior during vinification. Moreover, in the case of the other strain, higher levels of enzymes required for sulfur metabolism (Cys4p, Hom6p, and Met22p) are observed, which could be related to the production of particular organoleptic compounds or to detoxification processes.	0
Title: Evolution of structural diversity of trichothecenes, a family of toxins produced by plant pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi Abstract: Trichothecenes are a family of terpenoid toxins produced by multiple genera of fungi, including plant and insect pathogens. Some trichothecenes produced by the fungus Fusarium are among the mycotoxins of greatest concern to food and feed safety because of their toxicity and frequent occurrence in cereal crops, and trichothecene production contributes to pathogenesis of some Fusarium species on plants. Collectively, fungi produce over 150 trichothecene analogs: i.e., molecules that share the same core structure but differ in patterns of substituents attached to the core structure. Here, we carried out genomic, phylogenetic, gene-function, and analytical chemistry studies of strains from nine fungal genera to identify genetic variation responsible for trichothecene structural diversity and to gain insight into evolutionary processes that have contributed to the variation. The results indicate that structural diversity has resulted from gain, loss, and functional changes of trichothecene biosynthetic (TRI) genes. The results also indicate that the presence of some substituents has arisen independently in different fungi by gain of different genes with the same function. Variation in TRI gene duplication and number of TRI loci was also observed among the fungi examined, but there was no evidence that such genetic differences have contributed to trichothecene structural variation. We also inferred ancestral states of the TRI cluster and trichothecene biosynthetic pathway, and proposed scenarios for changes in trichothecene structures during divergence of TRI cluster homologs. Together, our findings provide insight into evolutionary processes responsible for structural diversification of toxins produced by pathogenic fungi.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster for geldanamycin production in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 3602 Abstract: We illustrate the use of a PCR-based method by which the genomic DNA of a microorganism can be rapidly queried for the presence of type I modular polyketide synthase genes to clone and characterize, by sequence analysis and gene disruption, a major portion of the geldanamycin production gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus NRRL 3602.	1
Title: Allosteric pathways in tetrahydrofolate sensing riboswitch with dynamics correlation network Abstract: Riboswitches are cis-acting genetic control elements. Due to their fundamental importance in bacteria gene regulation, they have been proposed as antibacterial drug targets. Tetrahydrofolate (THF) is an essential cofactor of one-carbon transfer reactions and downregulates the expression of downstream genes. However, information on how to transfer from the binding site of THF to the expression platform is still unavailable. Herein, a nucleotide/nucleotide dynamics correlation network based on an all-atom molecular dynamic simulation was used to reveal the regulation mechanism of a THF-sensing riboswitch. Shortest pathway analysis based on the network illustrates that there is an allosteric pathway through the P2 helix to the pseudoknot, then to the P1 helix in the THF-riboswitch. Thus the hypothesis of "THF-binding induced allosteric switching" was proposed and evaluated using THF and pseudoknot weakened experiments. Furthermore, a possible allosteric pathway of C30-C31-G33-A34-G35-G36-G37-A38-G48-G47-U46-A90-U91-C92-G93-C94-G95-C96 was identified and confirmed through the perturbation of the network. The proposed allosteric mechanism and the underlying allosteric pathway provide fundamental insights for the regulation of THF sensing riboswitches.	0
Title: Promoting Molecular Exchange on Rare-Earth Oxycarbonate Surfaces to Catalyze the Water-Gas Shift Reaction Abstract: It is highly desirable to fabricate an accessible catalyst surface that can efficiently activate reactants and desorb products to promote the local surface reaction equilibrium in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, rare-earth oxycarbonates (Ln2O2CO3, where Ln = La and Sm), which have molecular-exchangeable (H2O and CO2) surface structures according to the ordered layered arrangement of Ln2O22+ and CO32- ions, are unearthed. On this basis, a series of Ln2O2CO3-supported Cu catalysts are prepared through the deposition precipitation method, which provides excellent catalytic activity and stability for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Density functional theory calculations combined with systematic experimental characterizations verify that H2O spontaneously dissociates on the surface of Ln2O2CO3 to form hydroxyl by eliminating the carbonate through the release of CO2. This interchange efficiently promotes the WGS reaction equilibrium shift on the local surface and prevents the carbonate accumulation from hindering the active sites. The discovery of the unique layered structure provides a so-called "self-cleaning" active surface for the WGS reaction and opens new perspectives about the application of rare-earth oxycarbonate nanomaterials in C1 chemistry.	0
Title: Promiscuous binding at the crossroads of numerous cancer pathways: insight from the binding of glutaminase interacting protein with glutaminase L Abstract: The glutaminase interacting protein (GIP) is composed of a single PDZ domain that interacts with a growing list of partner proteins, including glutaminase L, that are involved in a number of cell signaling and cancer pathways. Therefore, GIP makes a good target for structure-based drug design. Here, we report the solution structures of both free GIP and GIP bound to the C-terminal peptide analogue of glutaminase L. This is the first reported nuclear magnetic resonance structure of GIP in a complex with one of its binding partners. Our analysis of both free GIP and GIP in a complex with the glutaminase L peptide provides important insights into how a promiscuous binding domain can have affinity for multiple binding partners. Through a detailed chemical shift perturbation analysis and backbone dynamics studies, we demonstrate here that the binding of the glutaminase L peptide to GIP is an allosteric event. Taken together, the insights reported here lay the groundwork for the future development of a specific inhibitor for GIP.	0
Title: Enediyne antitumor antibiotic maduropeptin biosynthesis featuring a C-methyltransferase that acts on a CoA-tethered aromatic substrate Abstract: The enediyne antitumor antibiotic maduropeptin (MDP) is produced by Actinomadura madurae ATCC 39144. The biosynthetic pathway for the 3,6-dimethylsalicylic acid moiety of the MDP chromophore is proposed to be comprised of four enzymes: MdpB, MdpB1, MdpB2, and MdpB3. Based on the previously characterized biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety of neocarzinostatin (NCS), we expected a biosynthetic pathway featuring carboxylic acid activation by the MdpB2 CoA ligase immediately before its coupling to an enediyne core intermediate. Surprisingly, the MDP aromatic acid biosynthetic pathway employs an unusual logic in which MdpB2-catalyzed CoA activation occurs before MdpB1-catalyzed C-methylation, demonstrating that MdpB1 is apparently unique in its ability to C-methylate a CoA-tethered aromatic acid. MdpB2 is a promiscuous CoA ligase capable of activating a variety of salicylic acid analogues, a property that could be potentially exploited to engineer MDP analogues.	1
Title: Clustered genes involved in cyclopiazonic acid production are next to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in Aspergillus flavus Abstract: Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), an indole-tetramic acid mycotoxin, is produced by many species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. In addition to CPA Aspergillus flavus produces polyketide-derived carcinogenic aflatoxins. Aflatoxin biosynthesis genes form a gene cluster in a subtelomeric region. Isolates of A. flavus lacking aflatoxin production due to the loss of the entire aflatoxin gene cluster and portions of the subtelomeric region are often unable to produce CPA, which suggests a physical link of genes involved in CPA biosynthesis to the aflatoxin gene cluster. Examining the subtelomeric region in A. flavus isolates of different chemotypes revealed a region possibly associated with CPA production. Disruption of three of the four genes present in this region predicted to encode a monoamine oxidase, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase, and a hybrid polyketide non-ribosomal peptide synthase abolished CPA production in an aflatoxigenic A. flavus strain. Therefore, some of the CPA biosynthesis genes are organized in a mini-gene cluster that is next to the aflatoxin gene cluster in A. flavus.	1
Title: Fumonisin production in the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides: genetic basis of naturally occurring chemical variation Abstract: Fumonisins are polyketide-derived mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Previous analyses identified naturally occurring variants of the fungus that are deficient in fumonisin C-10 hydroxylation or that do not produce any fumonisins. In the current study, gene deletion and genetic complementation analyses localized the C-10 hydroxylation deficiency to a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster. Sequence analysis indicated that the hydroxylation deficiency resulted from a single nucleotide insertion that caused a frame shift in the coding region of the gene. Genetic complementation localized the fumonisin-nonproduction phenotype to the polyketide synthase gene in the FUM cluster, and sequence analysis indicated that the nonproduction phenotype resulted from a nucleotide substitution, which introduced a premature stop codon in the coding region. These results provide the first direct evidence that altered fumonisin production phenotypes of naturally occurring F. verticillioides variants can result from single point mutations in the FUM cluster.	1
Title: Polysaccharide biosynthesis locus required for virulence of Bacteroides fragilis Abstract: Bacteroides fragilis, though only a minor component of the human intestinal commensal flora, is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from intra-abdominal abscesses. B. fragilis 9343 expresses at least three capsular polysaccharides-polysaccharide A (PS A), PS B, and PS C. Purified PS A and PS B have been tested in animal models and are both able to induce the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses. Mutants unable to synthesize PS B or PS C still facilitate abscess formation at levels comparable to those of wild-type 9343. To determine the contribution of PS A to abscess formation in the context of the intact organism, the PS A biosynthesis region was cloned, sequenced, and deleted from 9343 to produce a PS A-negative mutant. Animal experiments demonstrate that the abscess-inducing capability of 9343 is severely attenuated when the organism cannot synthesize PS A, despite continued synthesis of the other capsular polysaccharides. The PS A of 9343 contains an unusual free amino sugar that is essential for abscess formation by this polymer. PCR analysis of the PS A biosynthesis loci of 50 B. fragilis isolates indicates that regions flanking each side of this locus are conserved in all strains. The downstream conserved region includes two terminal PS A biosynthesis genes that homology-based analyses predict are involved in the synthesis and transfer of the free amino sugar of PS A. Conservation of these genes suggests that this sugar is present in the PS A of all serotypes and may explain the abscessogenic nature of B. fragilis.	1
Title: Direct amplification of nodD from community DNA reveals the genetic diversity of Rhizobium leguminosarum in soil Abstract: Sequences of nodD, a gene found only in rhizobia, were amplified from total community DNA isolated from a pasture soil. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used, Y5 and Y6, match nodD from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii, R. leguminosarum biovar viciae and Sinorhizobium meliloti. The PCR product was cloned and yielded 68 clones that were identified by restriction pattern as derived from biovar trifolii [11 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types] and 15 clones identified as viciae (seven RFLP types). These identifications were confirmed by sequencing. There were no clones related to S. meliloti nodD. For comparison, 122 strains were isolated from nodules of white clover (Trifolium repens) growing at the field site, and 134 from nodules on trap plants of T. repens inoculated with the soil. The nodule isolates were of four nodD RFLP types, with 77% being of a single type. All four of these patterns were also found among the clones from soil DNA, and the same type was the most abundant, although it made up only 34% of the trifolii-like clones. We conclude that clover selects specific genotypes from the available soil population, and that R. leguminosarum biovar trifolii was approximately five times more abundant than biovar viciae in this pasture soil, whereas S. meliloti was rare.	0
Title: Characterization of the locus of genes encoding enzymes producing heptadepsipeptide micropeptin in the unicellular cyanobacterium Microcystis Abstract: The gene cluster involved in producing the cyclic heptadepsipeptide micropeptin was cloned from the genome of the unicellular cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa K-139. Sequencing revealed four genes encoding non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that are highly similar to the gene cluster involved in cyanopeptolins biosynthesis. According to predictions based on the non-ribosomal consensus code, the order of the mcnABCE NPRS modules was well consistent with that of the biosynthetic assembly of cyclic peptides. The biochemical analysis of a McnB(K-139) adenylation domain and the knock-out of mcnC in a micropeptin-producing strain, M. viridis S-70, revealed that the mcn gene clusters were responsible for the production of heptadepsipeptide micropeptins. A detailed comparison of nucleotide sequences also showed that the regions between the mcnC and mcnE genes of M. aeruginosa K-139 retained short stretches of DNA homologous to halogenase genes involved in the synthesis of halogenated cyclic peptides of the cyanopeptolin class including anabaenopeptilides. This suggests that the mcn clusters of M. aeruginosa K-139 have lost the halogenase genes during evolution. Finally, a comparative bioinformatics analysis of the congenial gene cluster for depsipetide biosynthesis suggested the diversification and propagation of the NRPS genes in cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Antitumor protein-containing polysaccharides from a Chinese mushroom Fengweigu or Houbitake, Pleurotus sajor-caju (Fr.) Sings Abstract: Protein-containing polysaccharides extracted from fruiting bodies of a Chinese fungus named Feng Wei Gu, were fractionated and purified, and their antitumor activities were tested, out of which the following active fractions were obtained. FIo-a: A protein-containing xyloglucan, MW 280,000, polysaccharide: protein = 76:24 (w/w), polysaccharide consisting of Man:Gal:Xyl:Glc = 2:12:42:42 (molar ratio). [alpha]D23 + 25.3 degrees. FA-2: A protein-containing mannogalactan, MW 120,000, polysaccharide: protein = 76:16 (w/w), consisting of Xyl:Man:Gal = 9:35:56 (molar ratio), [alpha]D23 + 98.5 degrees. FII-1: A Protein-containing xylan (62:21 w/w). MW 200,000, [alpha]D23 + 8.7 degrees.

FIII-2a: A protein-containing xyloglucan, MW 70,000, polysaccharide:protein = 69:3 (w/w), polysaccharide consisting of Xyl:Glc = 36:62 (molar ratio). [alpha]D23 + 38.6 degrees.	0
Title: Albicidin pathotoxin produced by Xanthomonas albilineans is encoded by three large PKS and NRPS genes present in a gene cluster also containing several putative modifying, regulatory, and resistance genes Abstract: Xanthomonas albilineans, which causes leaf scald disease of sugarcane, produces a highly potent pathotoxin called albicidin. We report here sequencing and homology analysis of the major gene cluster, XALB1 (55,839 bp), and a second, smaller region, XALB2 (2,986 bp), involved in albicidin biosynthesis. XALB1 contains 20 open reading frames, including i) three large genes with a modular architecture characteristic of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) and ii) several putative modifying, regulatory, and resistance genes. Sequencing and complementation studies of six albicidin-defective mutants enabled us to confirm the involvement of the three PKS and NRPS genes encoded by XALB1 in albicidin production. XALB2 contains only one gene that is required for post-translational activation of PKS and NRPS enzymes, confirming the involvement of these enzymes in albicidin biosynthesis. In silico analysis of these three PKS or NRPS enzymes allowed us to propose a model for the albicidin backbone assembly and to gain insight into the structural features of this pathotoxin. This is the first description of a complete mixed PKS-NRPS gene cluster for toxin production in the genus Xanthomonas.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid moieties of furanonaphthoquinone I and endophenazine A in Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 Abstract: Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 produces the polyketide-isoprenoid compound furanonaphthoquinone I (FNQ I) and isoprenylated phenazines, predominantly endophenazine A. However, the recently identified biosynthetic gene cluster for these compounds only contains a single gene for a mevalonate pathway enzyme, that is, a putative mevalonate kinase gene. This is in strong contrast to all Streptomyces strains examined so far, where all six genes encoding the mevalonate pathway enzymes are clustered in a single operon of 6.8 kb and, thus, raised the question about the biosynthetic origin of the isoprenoid moieties of FNQ I and endophenazine A. In this study, we investigated the incorporation of [13C2]acetate and [2-13C]glycerol into FNQ I and endophenazine A. The results unequivocally prove that the isoprenoid building blocks of both compounds are predominantly formed via the mevalonate pathway (approximately 80%) but that the MEP pathway (approximately 20%) contributes to the biosynthesis of these molecules, too. In actinomycetes, this is the first experimentally proven example of the utilization of both biosynthetic routes for the formation of one single secondary metabolite. The incorporation pattern of [2-13C]glycerol was consistent with a "reverse" prenyl transfer, that is, with the formation of a C-C bond from C-3 of GPP to the polyketide nucleus of FNQ I.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and Mechanism of Action of the Cell Wall Targeting Antibiotic Hypeptin Abstract: Hypeptin is a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic produced by Lysobacter sp. K5869, isolated from an environmental sample by the iChip technology, dedicated to the cultivation of previously uncultured microorganisms. Hypeptin shares structural features with teixobactin and exhibits potent activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive pathogens. Using comprehensive in vivo and in vitro analyses, we show that hypeptin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to multiple undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-containing biosynthesis intermediates, forming a stoichiometric 2:1 complex. Resistance to hypeptin did not readily develop in vitro. Analysis of the hypeptin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) supported a model for the synthesis of the octapeptide. Within the BGC, two hydroxylases were identified and characterized, responsible for the stereoselective β-hydroxylation of four building blocks when bound to peptidyl carrier proteins. In vitro hydroxylation assays corroborate the biosynthetic hypothesis and lead to the proposal of a refined structure for hypeptin.	1
Title: A gene cluster from a marine Streptomyces encoding the biosynthesis of the aromatic spiroketal polyketide griseorhodin A Abstract: The telomerase inhibitor griseorhodin A is probably the most heavily oxidized bacterial polyketide known and features a unique epoxyspiroketal moiety crucial for its activity. To gain insight into which tailoring enzymes generate this pharmacophore, we have cloned and fully sequenced the griseorhodin biosynthesis gene cluster. Among other unusual features, this aromatic polyketide synthase (PKS) system encodes an unprecedented number of functionally diverse oxidoreductases, which are involved in the oxidative modification of a polyaromatic tridecaketide precursor by cleavage of three carbon-carbon bonds. The cluster was highly unstable on a variety of shuttle plasmids but could finally be functionally expressed in its entirety in Streptomyces lividans using a novel integrative cosmid vector. The availability of the tailoring system now opens up the possibility of engineering nonnatural biosynthetic pathways yielding novel pharmacologically active analogs with a similar pharmacophore.	1
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. I. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-(O-substituted)-7 beta-[D-alpha-amino-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: The synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 7 beta-[D-alpha-amino-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]cephalosporins (1) with various O-substituents at the C-3 position of a cephalosporin nucleus are described. Of these, the cephalosporins (1b-1e) having an alkoxycarbonylmethoxy group at the C-3 position showed good oral absorption in rats as well as potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of salt-sensitive mutants of the moderately halophilic bacterium Salinivibrio costicola subsp. yaniae Abstract: Salinivibrio costicola subsp. yaniae is a moderately halophilic bacterium which can grow over a wide range of salinity. In response to external osmotic stress (1-3 M NaCl), S. costicola subsp. yaniae can accumulate ectoine, glycine betaine, and glutamate as compatible solutes. We used suicide plasmids pSUP101 to introduce transposon Tn1732 into S. costicola subsp. yaniae via Escherichia coli SM10 mediated by conjugation. One Tn1732-induced mutant, MU1, which was very sensitive to the external salt concentration, was isolated. Mutant MU1 did not grow above 1.5 M NaCl and did not synthesize ectoine, but accumulated Ngamma-acetyldiaminobutyrate, an ectoine precursor, as confirmed by (1)H-NMR analysis. From these data, we concluded that ectoine performs a key role in osmotic adaptation towards high salinity environments in strain S. costicola subsp. yaniae.	0
Title: An eight residue fragment of an acyl carrier protein suffices for post-translational introduction of fluorescent pantetheinyl arms in protein modification in vitro and in vivo Abstract: Genetically encoded tags for tracking a given protein continue to be of great interest in a multitude of in vitro and in vivo contexts. Acyl carrier proteins, both free-standing and as embedded 80-100 residue domains, contain a specific serine side chain that undergoes post-translational pantetheinylation from CoASH as donor substrate. We have previously used phage display methods to select a 12 residue fragment that retains recognition for modification by the Escherichia coli phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) AcpS. In this work, we have used (15)N-HSQC based NMR titration experiments of a 12-residue peptide substrate with AcpS to identify six specifically interacting residues (S3, L4, D5, M6, W9, and L11) without the formation of any notable secondary structure. Synthesis of a corresponding octapeptide containing 5 of the 6 interacting residues generated a minimal fragment capable of efficient post-translational phosphopantetheinylation. Genetic insertion of this eight residue coding sequence into the proteins sonic hedgehog and transferrin receptor enabled good in vitro and in vivo PPTase-mediated modification by a series of fluorescent CoAs, leading to a set of fluorescent proteins with a peptide tag minimally perturbant to protein folds.	0
Title: Duck PIAS2 Promotes H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus Replication Through Its SUMO E3 Ligase Activity Abstract: The protein inhibitor of the activated STAT2 (PIAS2) has been implicated in many cellular processes and can also regulate viral replication in mammals. However, the role of PIAS2 in the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 replication in ducks is still unclear. Through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay, we identified that duck PIAS2 (duPIAS2) was one protein that interacted with the nucleoprotein (NP) from the H5N1 HPAIV strain of DK212. Through confocal microscopy images and Co-IP assay, we confirmed NP could interact with duPIAS2. Overexpression of duPIAS2 in primary duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells was shown to promote DK212 replication, and knockdown of duPIAS2 could repress DK212 replication. We further found duPIAS2 could promote NP SUMOylation through duck SUMO1 (duSUMO1), and the potential SUMOylation sites of NP were at lysines 7, 48, and 87. Furthermore, duPIAS2 promoted the replication of DK212, here relying on the activity of its SUMO E3 ligase. Duck SENP1 (duSENP1), a deSUMOylation enzyme, could repress NP SUMOylation and also inhibit DK212 replication. Together, we identified duPIAS2 could interact with NP and that duPIAS2 promoted H5N1 HPAIV replication, which might be related to NP SUMOylation.	0

Title: Macedocin, a food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 Abstract: Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a strain isolated from Greek Kasseri cheese, produces a food-grade lantibiotic named macedocin. Macedocin has a molecular mass of 2,794.76 +/- 0.42 Da, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 22 amino acid residues that correspond with the amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics SA-FF22 and SA-M49, both of which were isolated from the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Macedocin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, as well as several food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium tyrobutyricum. It displays a bactericidal effect towards the most sensitive indicator strain, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei LMG 13558(T), while the producer strain itself displays autoinhibition when it is grown under conditions that do not favor bacteriocin production. Macedocin is active at pHs between 4.0 and 9.0, and it retains activity even after incubation for 20 min at 121 degrees C with 1 atm of overpressure. Inhibition of macedocin by proteolytic enzymes is variable.	1
Title: Antiviral compounds discovered by virtual screening of small-molecule libraries against dengue virus E protein Abstract: Infection by the mosquito-borne dengue virus causes dengue fever and the sometimes fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. The increasing number of dengue infections per year suggests that the virus is becoming more virulent and its transmission is expanding. Nevertheless, no effective treatment for dengue infection currently exists. In a search for antiviral agents effective against dengue virus, we investigated the potential of targeting a structural protein site rather than an enzymatic one. Using this approach, we now report the discovery of a small molecule ligand that inhibits viral growth. Our results also provide the first evidence that the binding site, a pocket located at the hinge between domains 1 and 2 of the envelope protein (E protein) on the virus surface, is a valid target for antiviral therapy. Ligand candidates were identified from libraries of approximately 142,000 compounds using a computational high-throughput screening protocol targeting this pocket of the E protein. Cell-based assays were conducted on 23 top-ranked compounds. Among four with good antiviral activity profiles, the compound P02 was found to inhibit viral reproduction at micromolar concentrations. Using saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy, we also show that the compound binds virus and competes for binding E protein with the known ligand N-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. Together, the results are consistent with an inhibition mechanism against maturation or host-cell entry mediated by ligand binding to the E-protein pocket. P02 is a promising lead compound for future development of an effective treatment against dengue virus and related flaviviruses.	0
Title: Unconventional origin and hybrid system for construction of pyrrolopyrrole moiety in kosinostatin biosynthesis Abstract: Kosinostatin (KST), an antitumor antibiotic, features a pyrrolopyrrole moiety spirally jointed to a five-membered ring of an anthraquinone framework glycosylated with a γ-branched octose. By a combination of in silico analysis, genetic characterization, biochemical assay, and precursor feeding experiments, a biosynthetic pathway for KST was proposed, which revealed (1) the pyrrolopyrrole moiety originates from nicotinic acid and ribose, (2) the bicyclic amidine is constructed by a process similar to the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, and (3) a discrete adenylation enzyme and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) are responsible for producing a PCP-tethered building block parallel to type II polyketide synthase (PKS) rather than for the PKS priming step by providing the starter unit. These findings provide an opportunity to further explore the inexplicable enzymatic logic that governs the formation of pyrrolopyrrole moiety and the spirocyclic skeleton.	1
Title: Genome-scale analysis of the genes that contribute to Burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm formation identifies a crucial exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is an important public health threat due to limited therapeutic options for treatment. Efforts to improve therapeutics for B. pseudomallei infections are dependent on the need to understand the role of B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and its contribution to antibiotic tolerance and persistence as these are bacterial traits that prevent effective therapy. In order to reveal the genes that regulate and/or contribute to B. pseudomallei 1026b biofilm formation, we screened a sequence defined two-allele transposon library and identified 118 transposon insertion mutants that were deficient in biofilm formation. These mutants include transposon insertions in genes predicted to encode flagella, fimbriae, transcriptional regulators, polysaccharides, and hypothetical proteins. Polysaccharides are key constituents of biofilms and B. pseudomallei has the capacity to produce a diversity of polysaccharides, thus there is a critical need to link these biosynthetic genes with the polysaccharides they produce to better understand their biological role during infection. An allelic exchange deletion mutant of the entire B. pseudomallei biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic cluster was decreased in biofilm formation and produced a smooth colony morphology suggestive of the loss of exopolysaccharide production. Conversely, deletion of the previously defined capsule I polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster increased biofilm formation. Bioinformatics analyses combined with immunoblot analysis and glycosyl composition studies of the partially purified exopolysaccharide indicate that the biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide is neither cepacian nor the previously described acidic exopolysaccharide. The biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide described here is also specific to the B. pseudomallei complex of bacteria. Since this novel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster is retained in B. mallei, it is predicted to have a role in colonization and infection of the host. These findings will facilitate further advances in understanding the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and improve diagnostics and therapeutic treatment strategies.	1
Title: A single nucleotide exchange in the wzy gene is responsible for the semirough O6 lipopolysaccharide phenotype and serum sensitivity of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 Abstract: Structural analysis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from semirough, serum-sensitive Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (DSM 6601, serotype O6:K5:H1) revealed that this strain's LPS contains a bisphosphorylated hexaacyl lipid A and a tetradecasaccharide consisting of one E. coli O6 antigen repeating unit attached to the R1-type core. Configuration of the GlcNAc glycosidic linkage between O-antigen oligosaccharide and core (beta) differs from that interlinking the repeating units in the E. coli O6 antigen polysaccharide (alpha). The wa(*) and wb(*) gene clusters of strain Nissle 1917, required for LPS core and O6 repeating unit biosyntheses, were subcloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence of the wa(*) determinant (11.8 kb) shows 97% identity to other R1 core type-specific wa(*) gene clusters. The DNA sequence of the wb(*) gene cluster (11 kb) exhibits no homology to known DNA sequences except manC and manB. Comparison of the genetic structures of the wb(*)(O6) (wb(*) from serotype O6) determinants of strain Nissle 1917 and of smooth and serum-resistant uropathogenic E. coli O6 strain 536 demonstrated that the putative open reading frame encoding the O-antigen polymerase Wzy of strain Nissle 1917 was truncated due to a point mutation. Complementation with a functional wzy copy of E. coli strain 536 confirmed that the semirough phenotype of strain Nissle 1917 is due to the nonfunctional wzy gene. Expression of a functional wzy gene in E. coli strain Nissle 1917 increased its ability to withstand antibacterial defense mechanisms of blood serum. These results underline the importance of LPS for serum resistance or sensitivity of E. coli.	1
Title: A novel New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase variant, NDM-14, isolated in a Chinese Hospital possesses increased enzymatic activity against carbapenems Abstract: A novel New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) variant, NDM-14, was identified in clinical isolate Acinetobacter lwoffii JN49-1, which was recovered from an intensive care unit patient at a local hospital in China. NDM-14, which differs from other existing enzymes by an amino acid substitution at position 130 (Asp130Gly), possesses enzymatic activity toward carbapenems that is greater than that of NDM-1. Kinetic data indicate that NDM-14 has a higher affinity for imipenem and meropenem.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of abscisic acid in fungi: identification of a sesquiterpene cyclase as the key enzyme in Botrytis cinerea Abstract: While abscisic acid (ABA) is known as a hormone produced by plants through the carotenoid pathway, a small number of phytopathogenic fungi are also able to produce this sesquiterpene but they use a distinct pathway that starts with the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into 2Z,4E-α-ionylideneethane which is then subjected to several oxidation steps. To identify the sesquiterpene cyclase (STC) responsible for the biosynthesis of ABA in fungi, we conducted a genomic approach in Botrytis cinerea. The genome of the ABA-overproducing strain ATCC58025 was fully sequenced and five STC-coding genes were identified. Among them, Bcstc5 exhibits an expression profile concomitant with ABA production. Gene inactivation, complementation and chemical analysis demonstrated that BcStc5/BcAba5 is the key enzyme responsible for the key step of ABA biosynthesis in fungi. Unlike what is observed for most of the fungal secondary metabolism genes, the key enzyme-coding gene Bcstc5/Bcaba5 is not clustered with the other biosynthetic genes, i.e., Bcaba1 to Bcaba4 that are responsible for the oxidative transformation of 2Z,4E-α-ionylideneethane. Finally, our study revealed that the presence of the Bcaba genes among Botrytis species is rare and that the majority of them do not possess the ability to produce ABA.	1
Title: Dudomycins: New Secondary Metabolites Produced After Heterologous Expression of an Nrps Cluster from Streptomyces albus ssp. Chlorinus Nrrl B-24108 Abstract: Since the 1950s, natural products of bacterial origin were systematically developed to be used as drugs with a wide range of medical applications. The available treatment options for many diseases are still not satisfying, wherefore, the discovery of new structures has not lost any of its importance. Beyond the great variety of already isolated and characterized metabolites, Streptomycetes still harbor uninvestigated gene clusters whose products can be accessed using heterologous expression in host organisms. This works presents the discovery of a set of structurally novel secondary metabolites, dudomycins A to D, through the expression of a cryptic NRPS cluster from Streptomyces albus ssp. Chlorinus NRRL B-24108 in the heterologous host strain Streptomyces albus Del14. A minimal set of genes, required for the production of dudomycins, was defined through gene inactivation experiments. This paper also proposes a model for dudomycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Activity of four cephalosporin antibiotics in vitro against bovine udder pathogens and pathogenic bacteria isolated from newborn calves Abstract: The in vitro activity of chephaloridine, cephalexin, cefatrizine (BL-S640), and cephapirin (BL-P-1322) was evaluated by the serial dilution method against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine udders and neonatal calf diseases. Cephapirin showed the comparatively greatest activity against the most common streptococcal species associated with bovine mastitis, whereas cephaloridine exhibited the best activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Cefatrizine was more active than the other cephalosporins against the gram-negative bacteria studied. In general, the minimal bactericidal concentration of each cephalosporin was two- to fourfold lower than the comparative value reported in the literature against the same type of pathogen of human origin.	0
Title: Autoregulation of ZEB2 expression for zearalenone production in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: Several Fusarium species produce the polyketide mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA), a causative agent of hyperestrogenic syndrome in animals that is often found in F. graminearum-infected cereals in temperate regions. The ZEA biosynthetic cluster genes PKS4, PKS13, ZEB1 and ZEB2 encode a reducing polyketide synthase, a non-reducing polyketide synthase, an isoamyl alcohol oxidase and a transcription factor respectively. In this study, the production of two isoforms (ZEB2L and ZEB2S) from the ZEB2 gene in F. graminearum via an alternative promoter was characterized. ZEB2L contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus, whereas ZEB2S is an N-terminally truncated form of ZEB2L that lacks the bZIP domain. Interestingly, ZEA triggers the induction of both ZEB2L and ZEB2S transcription. ZEB2L and ZEB2S interact with each other to form a heterodimer that regulates ZEA production by reducing the binding affinity of ZEB2L for the ZEB2L gene promoter. Our study provides insight into the autoregulation of ZEB2 expression by alternative promoter usage and a feedback loop during ZEA production; this regulatory mechanism is similar to that observed in higher eukaryotes.	1
Title: Kinetics and nucleotide specificity of a surface cAMP binding site in Dictyostelium discoideum, which is not down-regulated by cAMP Abstract: Dictyostelium cells exhibit four types of kinetically distinct surface cAMP binding sites, the AH, AL, BS, and BSS sites, which are down-regulated during persistent stimulation with cAMP. Although most cAMP-induced responses are subject to desensitization during constant stimulation, some responses, notably the induction of post-aggregative gene expression, require persistent cAMP stimulation. The kinetics and specificity of residual cAMP-binding activity in cells treated for 4 h with micromolar cAMP were investigated. It was found that around 4000 rapidly dissociating binding sites per cell with an affinity of about 300 nM are retained after down-regulation. The nucleotide specificity of the remaining sites was very similar, but not completely identical to the AH, AL and B sites, suggesting that these sites belong to the same class of cell surface cAMP receptors and may be utilized to mediate responses requiring continuous cAMP stimulation.	0
Title: Products of RNA polymerases in HeLa cell nuclei Abstract: RNA polymerase activities in intact HeLa cell nuclei have been examined and compared to activities investigated in previous studies of the purified enzymes. The RNA synthesized by the mammalian polymerases while still in nuclei is identified. The polymerases are tentatively identified by location, sensitivity to alpha-amanitin, and response to manganese and altered ionic strength. Polymerase I is located in the nucleolus and labels partially complete precursor molecules of ribosomal RNA. Polymerases II and III are in the nucleoplasm and both label giant nuclear heterogeneous RNA.	0
Title: Genome mining of the Streptomyces avermitilis genome and development of genome-minimized hosts for heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: To date, several actinomycete genomes have been completed and annotated. Among them, Streptomyces microorganisms are of major pharmaceutical interest because they are a rich source of numerous secondary metabolites. S. avermitilis is an industrial microorganism used for the production of an anthelmintic agent, avermectin, which is a commercially important antiparasitic agent in human and veterinary medicine, and agricultural pesticides. Genome analysis of S. avermitilis provides significant information for not only industrial applications but also understanding the features of this genus. On genome mining of S. avermitilis, the microorganism has been found to harbor at least 38 secondary metabolic gene clusters and 46 insertion sequence (IS)-like sequences on the genome, which have not been searched so far. A significant use of the genome data of Streptomyces microorganisms is the construction of a versatile host for heterologous expression of exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters by genetic engineering. Since S. avermitilis is used as an industrial microorganism, the microorganism is already optimized for the efficient supply of primary metabolic precursors and biochemical energy to support multistep biosynthesis. The feasibility of large-deletion mutants of S. avermitilis has been confirmed by heterologous expression of more than 20 exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of the bactericidal activities of sutezolid (PNU-100480) and its major metabolite against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis in ex vivo whole-blood cultures of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis Abstract: Sutezolid (PNU-100480 [U-480]) is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial being developed for the treatment of tuberculosis. An active sulfoxide metabolite (PNU-101603 [U-603]), which reaches concentrations in plasma several times those of the parent, has been reported to drive the killing of extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis by sutezolid in hollow-fiber culture. However, the relative contributions of the parent and metabolite against intracellular M. tuberculosis in vivo are not fully understood. The relationships between the plasma concentrations of U-480 and U-603 and intracellular whole-blood bactericidal activity (WBA) in ex vivo cultures were examined using a direct competitive population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic 4-parameter sigmoid model. The data set included 690 PK determinations and 345 WBA determinations from 50 tuberculosis patients enrolled in a phase 2a sutezolid trial. The model parameters were solved iteratively. The median U-603/U-480 concentration ratio was 7.1 (range, 1 to 28). The apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of U-603 for intracellular M. tuberculosis was 17-fold greater than that of U-480 (90% confidence interval [CI], 9.9- to 53-fold). Model parameters were used to simulate in vivo activity after oral dosing with sutezolid at 600 mg twice a day (BID) and 1,200 mg once a day (QD). Divided dosing resulted in greater cumulative activity (-0.269 log10 per day; 90% CI, -0.237 to -0.293 log10 per day) than single daily dosing (-0.186 log10 per day; 90% CI, -0.160 to -0.208 log10 per day). U-480 accounted for 84% and 78% of the activity for BID and QD dosing, respectively, despite the higher concentrations of U-603. Killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis by orally administered sutezolid is mainly due to the activity of the parent compound. Taken together with the findings of other studies in the hollow-fiber model, these findings suggest that sutezolid and its metabolite act on different mycobacterial subpopulations.	0
Title: Glutamic acid promotes monacolin K production and monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster expression in Monascus Abstract: This study investigated the effects of glutamic acid on production of monacolin K and expression of the monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster. When Monascus M1 was grown in glutamic medium instead of in the original medium, monacolin K production increased from 48.4 to 215.4 mg l-1, monacolin K production increased by 3.5 times. Glutamic acid enhanced monacolin K production by upregulating the expression of mokB-mokI; on day 8, the expression level of mokA tended to decrease by Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction. Our findings demonstrated that mokA was not a key gene responsible for the quantity of monacolin K production in the presence of glutamic acid. Observation of Monascus mycelium morphology using Scanning Electron Microscope showed glutamic acid significantly increased the content of Monascus mycelium, altered the permeability of Monascus mycelium, enhanced secretion of monacolin K from the cell, and reduced the monacolin K content in Monascus mycelium, thereby enhancing monacolin K production.	1
Title: Yin Yang 1 sustains biosynthetic demands during brain development in a stage-specific manner Abstract: The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) plays an important role in human disease. It is often overexpressed in cancers and mutations can lead to a congenital haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms and neurological dysfunctions, consistent with a role in brain development. Here, we show that Yy1 controls murine cerebral cortex development in a stage-dependent manner. By regulating a wide range of metabolic pathways and protein translation, Yy1 maintains proliferation and survival of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at early stages of brain development. Despite its constitutive expression, however, the dependence on Yy1 declines over the course of corticogenesis. This is associated with decreasing importance of processes controlled by Yy1 during development, as reflected by diminished protein synthesis rates at later developmental stages. Thus, our study unravels a novel role for Yy1 as a stage-dependent regulator of brain development and shows that biosynthetic demands of NPCs dynamically change throughout development.	0
Title: Difficidin and bacilysin produced by plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are efficient in controlling fire blight disease Abstract: Representatives of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were shown to possess biocontrol activity against fire blight, a serious disease of orchard trees caused by Erwinia amylovora. Genome analysis of B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 identified gene clusters responsible for synthesis of several polyketide compounds with antibacterial action. We show here that the antibacterial polyketides difficidin and to a minor extent bacillaene act efficiently against E. amylovora. Surprisingly, a mutant strain blocked in the production of difficidin (CH8 Deltadfn) inhibited growth of E. amylovora and suppressed fire blight disease nearly in the same range as the wild type. In addition, a sfp mutant (CH3 Deltasfp) unable to synthesize non-ribosomally lipopeptides and polyketides did still suppress growth of E. amylovora, suggesting that besides action of polyketides another antagonistic principle exist. A double mutant (RS06 Deltasfp Deltabac) devoid in polyketide and bacilysin synthesis was unable to suppress growth of E. amylovora indicating that the additional inhibitory effect is due to production of bacilysin, a dipeptide whose synthesis does not depend on Sfp. We propose to use B. amyloliquefaciens strains with enhanced synthesis of difficidin and/or bacilysin for development of biocontrol agents efficient against fire blight disease.	1
Title: Exploring the mechanism of lipid transfer during biosynthesis of the acidic lipopeptide antibiotic CDA Abstract: The non-ribosomally synthesized lipodepsipeptide CDA belongs to the group of acidic lipopeptide antibiotics, whose members feature a fatty acid side chain that strongly affects their antimicrobial activity. This study elucidates the N-acylation of the N-terminal serine in the CDA peptide chain. This reaction is referred to as lipoinitiation and is shown to be catalyzed by the dissected starter C domain found at the N-terminus of Cda-PSI. The recombinantly produced C domain specifically interacts with 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl-S-ACP and catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acid moiety onto the amino group of PCP-bound serine with high selectivity for both carrier protein bound substrates at the donor and acceptor site.	1
Title: Plant terpenoid metabolism co-opts a component of the cell wall biosynthesis machinery Abstract: Glycosylation is one of the most prevalent molecular modifications in nature. Single or multiple sugars can decorate a wide range of acceptors from proteins to lipids, cell wall glycans and small molecules, dramatically affecting their activity. Here, we discovered that by 'hijacking' an enzyme of the cellulose synthesis machinery involved in cell wall assembly, plants evolved cellulose synthase-like enzymes (Csls) and acquired the capacity to glucuronidate specialized metabolites, that is, triterpenoid saponins. Apparently, endoplasmic reticulum-membrane localization of Csls and of other pathway proteins was part of evolving a new glycosyltransferase function, as plant metabolite glycosyltransferases typically act in the cytosol. Discovery of glucuronic acid transferases across several plant orders uncovered the long-pursued enzymatic reaction in the production of a low-calorie sweetener from licorice roots. Our work opens the way for engineering potent saponins through microbial fermentation and plant-based systems.	1
Title: Benzoyl ester formation in Aspergillus ustus by hijacking the polyketide acyl intermediates with alcohols Abstract: Accumulation of two benzoyl esters in Aspergillus ustus after feeding with alcohols was reported 30 years ago. To the best of our knowledge, the biosynthesis for these esters has not been elucidated prior to this study. Here, we demonstrate that these compounds are artifical products of the phenethyl polyketide ustethylin A biosynthestic pathway. In addition, four aditional benzoyl esters with different methylation levels were also isolated and identified as shunt products. Feeding experiments provided evidence that the enzyme-bound polyketide acyl intermediates are hijacked by externally fed MeOH or EtOH, leading to the formation of the benzoyl esters.	0
Title: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, produced by Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. II. Structure determination of benastatins A and B Abstract: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, have been isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. By X-ray crystallography, benastatin A was determined to be 8,13-dihydro-1,7,9,11-tetrahydroxy-13-dimethyl-8-oxo-3-pentyl- benzo[a]naphthacene-2-carboxylic acid. The structure of benastatin B was elucidated by NMR studies.	1
Title: Characterization of Heronamide Biosynthesis Reveals a Tailoring Hydroxylase and Indicates Migrated Double Bonds Abstract: Heronamides belong to a growing family of β-amino acid polyketide macrolactams (βPMs) with an unsaturated side chain. The biosynthetic gene cluster for heronamide F was identified from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. The involvement of the gene cluster in heronamide biosynthesis was confirmed by the functional characterization of the P450 enzyme HerO as an 8-hydroxylase for tailoring heronamide biosynthesis. The presence of migrated double bonds in the conjugated diene-containing side chain of heronamides was confirmed by feeding experiments with labeled small carboxylic acid molecules. This study is the first demonstration of migrated double bonds in βPMs with an unsaturated side chain.	1
Title: Loss of elongation factor P disrupts bacterial outer membrane integrity Abstract: Elongation factor P (EF-P) is posttranslationally modified at a conserved lysyl residue by the coordinated action of two enzymes, PoxA and YjeK. We have previously established the importance of this modification in Salmonella stress resistance. Here we report that, like poxA and yjeK mutants, Salmonella strains lacking EF-P display increased susceptibility to hypoosmotic conditions, antibiotics, and detergents and enhanced resistance to the compound S-nitrosoglutathione. The susceptibility phenotypes are largely explained by the enhanced membrane permeability of the efp mutant, which exhibits increased uptake of the hydrophobic dye 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN). Analysis of the membrane proteomes of wild-type and efp mutant Salmonella strains reveals few changes, including the prominent overexpression of a single porin, KdgM, in the efp mutant outer membrane. Removal of KdgM in the efp mutant background ameliorates the detergent, antibiotic, and osmosensitivity phenotypes and restores wild-type permeability to NPN. Our data support a role for EF-P in the translational regulation of a limited number of proteins that, when perturbed, renders the cell susceptible to stress by the adventitious overexpression of an outer membrane porin.	0
Title: Characterization of cryptic prophages (monocins) in Listeria and sequence analysis of a holin/endolysin gene Abstract: Monocins in Listeria were induced by UV-irradiation of liquid cultures, and defective phage particles were purified from the lysates. Electron microscopy showed flexible, non-contractile bacteriophage-tail-like particles, consisting of specific proteins of molecular mass 20-45 kDa and pI 4.6-6.7. These particles were able to lyse listerial cells. DNA sequence homologies between chromosomal DNA of monocin-producing strains and labelled Listeria phage DNAs were inferred from DNA/DNA hybridizations, suggesting that most of the prophage DNA is still present in the listerial chromosome. An endolysin gene cpl2438 was cloned from listerial chromosomal DNA and was identified by its expression of lytic activity against Listeria cells in a bioassay. The gene consists of 864 nt encoding a protein of 287 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 32975 Da (CPL2438). This is in good agreement with the size of a protein observed in SDS-PAGE after overexpression of the lytic protein in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a putative holin gene (hol2438, 291 nt) upstream of cpl2438 was determined after PCR-amplification of listerial DNA and it shows typical features common to the holin gene family. Expression of the encoded protein (HOL2438, 95 aa, 10.1 kDa) in E. coli was found to be lethal for the host cells. The results underline the close relationship between monocins and intact Listeria bacteriophages, indicating that monocins are incompletely assembled phage particles derived from cryptic prophages of Listeria, probably including the phage lysin.	0
Title: Mesenchymal-mode migration assay and antimetastatic drug screening with high-throughput microfluidic channel networks Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that activated mesenchymal migration is a key process of the metastatic cascade. Cancer cells usually gain such migratory capability through an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Herein we present a high-throughput microfluidic device with 3120 microchambers to specifically monitor mesenchymal migration. Through imaging of the whole chip and statistical analysis, we can evaluate the two key factors of velocity and percentage related to cell migratory capacity at different cell densities in culture. We also used the device to screen antimetastatic drugs for their inhibition of mesenchymal migration and prevention of metastatic malignancy. This device will provide an excellent platform for biologists to gain a better understanding of cancer metastasis.	0
Title: Challenges and opportunities for natural product discovery, production, and engineering in native producers versus heterologous hosts Abstract: Recent advances and emerging technologies for metabolic pathway engineering and synthetic biology have transformed the field of natural product discovery, production, and engineering. Despite these advancements, there remain many challenges in understanding how biosynthetic gene clusters are silenced or activated, including changes in the transcription of key biosynthetic and regulatory genes. This knowledge gap is highlighted by the success and failed attempts of manipulating regulatory genes within biosynthetic gene clusters in both native producers and heterologous hosts. These complexities make the choice of native producers versus heterologous hosts, fermentation medium, and supply of precursors crucial factors in achieving the production of the target natural products and engineering designer analogs. Nature continues to serve as inspiration for filling the knowledge gaps and developing new research strategies. By exploiting the evolutionary power of nature, alternative producers, with the desired genetic amenability and higher titers of the target natural products, and new strains, harboring gene clusters that encode evolutionary optimized congeners of the targeted natural product scaffolds, can be discovered. These newly identified strains can serve as an outstanding biotechnology platform for the engineered production of sufficient quantities of the target natural products and their analogs, enabling biosynthetic studies and potential therapeutic applications. These challenges and opportunities are showcased herein using fredericamycin, iso-migrastatin, platencin and platensimycin, the enediynes of C-1027, tiancimycin, and yangpumicin, and the leinamycin family of natural products.	0
Title: Regulatory cascade and biological activity of Beauveria bassiana oosporein that limits bacterial growth after host death Abstract: The regulatory network and biological functions of the fungal secondary metabolite oosporein have remained obscure. Beauveria bassiana has evolved the ability to parasitize insects and outcompete microbial challengers for assimilation of host nutrients. A novel zinc finger transcription factor, BbSmr1 (B. bassiana secondary metabolite regulator 1), was identified in a screen for oosporein overproduction. Deletion of Bbsmr1 resulted in up-regulation of the oosporein biosynthetic gene cluster (OpS genes) and constitutive oosporein production. Oosporein production was abolished in double mutants of Bbsmr1 and a second transcription factor, OpS3, within the oosporein gene cluster (ΔBbsmr1ΔOpS3), indicating that BbSmr1 acts as a negative regulator of OpS3 expression. Real-time quantitative PCR and a GFP promoter fusion construct of OpS1, the oosporein polyketide synthase, indicated that OpS1 is expressed mainly in insect cadavers at 24-48 h after death. Bacterial colony analysis in B. bassiana-infected insect hosts revealed increasing counts until host death, with a dramatic decrease (∼90%) after death that correlated with oosporein production. In vitro studies verified the inhibitory activity of oosporein against bacteria derived from insect cadavers. These results suggest that oosporein acts as an antimicrobial compound to limit microbial competition on B. bassiana-killed hosts, allowing the fungus to maximally use host nutrients to grow and sporulate on infected cadavers.	1
Title: PDZ-Reactive Peptide Activates Ephrin-B Reverse Signaling and Inhibits Neuronal Chemotaxis Abstract: Intracellular reactions on nonenzymatic proteins that activate cellular signals are rarely found. We report one example here that a designed peptide derivative undergoes a nucleophilic reaction specifically with a cytosolic PDZ protein inside cells. This reaction led to the activation of ephrin-B reverse signaling, which subsequently inhibited SDF-1 induced neuronal chemotaxis of human neuroblastoma cells and mouse cerebellar granule neurons. Our work provides direct evidence that PDZ-RGS3 bridges ephrin-B reverse signaling and SDF-1 induced G protein signaling for the first time.	0
Title: Selecting the highest of three binomial probabilities Abstract: A sequential elimination procedure for selecting the highest probability in binomial trials, proposed by Levin and Robbins [Levin, B. & Robbins, H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4663-4666], is examined further in the special case of trials involving three probabilities. A conjectured inequality relating ratios of selection probabilities to odds ratios is shown to hold only under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. Weaker conjectured inequalities involving the probability of correct selection are shown to hold without restriction.	0
Title: A Regulatory Cysteine Residue Mediates Reversible Inactivation of NAD+-Dependent Aldehyde Dehydrogenases to Promote Oxidative Stress Response Abstract: Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a large family of enzymes that oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids. All ALDHs have a conserved catalytic cysteine residue but different cofactor preferences for NAD+ or NADP+. We discovered a CC motif composed of the catalytic and an adjacent cysteine, which are prone to disulfide bond formation under oxidative stress. This facilitates rapid detection of and response to oxidants, as well as protects the catalytic cysteine from overoxidation into irreversible products. In ALDHs, the CC motif only exists in NAD+-dependent ones, which leads to selective inhibition of NAD+-dependent ALDHs under oxidative stress, diverting carbon sources to the NADPH producing ALDHs. This alleviates the oxidative stress and promotes cell survival. Our findings revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for ALDHs that functions in the oxidative stress response. Many enzymes with catalytic cysteine residues have proximal cysteine, suggesting that such a regulatory mechanism may be general.	0
Title: Esterase SeE of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi is a novel nonspecific carboxylic ester hydrolase Abstract: Extracellular carboxylic ester hydrolases are produced by many bacterial pathogens and have been shown recently to be important for virulence of some pathogens. However, these hydrolases are poorly characterized in enzymatic activity. This study prepared and characterized the secreted ester hydrolase of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi (designated SeE for S. equi esterase). SeE hydrolyzes ethyl acetate, acetylsalicylic acid, and tributyrin but not ethyl butyrate. This substrate specificity pattern does not match those of the three conventional types of nonspecific carboxylic ester hydrolases (carboxylesterases, arylesterases, and acetylesterases). To determine whether SeE has lipase activity, a number of triglycerides and vinyl esters were tested in SeE-catalyzed hydrolysis. SeE does not hydrolyze triglycerides and vinyl esters of long-chain carboxylic acids nor display interfacial activation, indicating that SeE is not a lipase. Like the conventional carboxylesterases, SeE is inhibited by di-isopropylfluorophosphate. These findings indicate that SeE is a novel carboxylesterase with optimal activity for acetyl esters.	0
Title: Xenortide Biosynthesis by Entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus nematophila Abstract: The biosynthesis gene cluster of the xenortides and a new derivative, xenortide D, which is produced in only trace amounts, was identified in Xenorhabdus nematophila. The structure of xenortide D was elucidated using a combination of labeling experiments followed by MS analysis and was confirmed by synthesis. Bioactivity tests revealed a weak activity of tryptamine-carrying xenortides against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei.	1
Title: Drivers of metabolic diversification: how dynamic genomic neighbourhoods generate new biosynthetic pathways in the Brassicaceae Abstract: Plants produce an array of specialized metabolites with important ecological functions. The mechanisms underpinning the evolution of new biosynthetic pathways are not well-understood. Here, we exploit available genome sequence resources to investigate triterpene biosynthesis across the Brassicaceae. Oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) catalyze the first committed step in triterpene biosynthesis. Systematic analysis of 13 sequenced Brassicaceae genomes was performed to identify all OSC genes. The genome neighbourhoods (GNs) around a total of 163 OSC genes were investigated to identify Pfam domains significantly enriched in these regions. All-vs-all comparisons of OSC neighbourhoods and phylogenomic analysis were used to investigate the sequence similarity and evolutionary relationships of the numerous candidate triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) observed. Functional analysis of three representative BGCs was carried out and their triterpene pathway products were elucidated. Our results indicate that plant genomes are remarkably plastic, and that dynamic GNs generate new biosynthetic pathways in different Brassicaceae lineages by shuffling the genes encoding a core palette of triterpene-diversifying enzymes, presumably in response to strong environmental selection pressure. These results illuminate a genomic basis for diversification of plant-specialized metabolism through natural combinatorics of enzyme families, which can be mimicked using synthetic biology to engineer diverse bioactive molecules.	1
Title: Characterization of Giant Modular PKSs Provides Insight into Genetic Mechanism for Structural Diversification of Aminopolyol Polyketides Abstract: Polyketides form many clinically valuable compounds. However, manipulation of their biosynthesis remains highly challenging. An understanding of gene cluster evolution provides a rationale for reprogramming of the biosynthetic machinery. Herein, we report characterization of giant modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) responsible for the production of aminopolyol polyketides. Heterologous expression of over 150 kbp polyketide gene clusters successfully afforded their products, whose stereochemistry was established by taking advantage of bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of highly homologous but functionally diverse domains from the giant PKSs demonstrated the evolutionary mechanism for structural diversification of polyketides. The gene clusters characterized herein, together with their evolutionary insights, are promising genetic building blocks for de novo production of unnatural polyketides.	1
Title: Unprecedented [5.5.5.6]Dioxafenestrane Ring Construction in Fungal Insecticidal Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis Abstract: Fenestranes, a specific class of natural products, contain four fused rings that share a central quaternary carbon atom. The fungal natural product penifulvin A (1) is a potent insecticidal sesquiterpene that features the [5.5.5.6]dioxafenestrane ring. Although the chemical synthesis of 1 has been achieved recently, the enzymes catalysing the cyclization and oxidation of FPP to 1 remain unknown. In this work, we identified a concise pathway that uses only three enzymes to produce 1. A new sesquiterpene cyclase (PeniA) generates the angular triquinane scaffold silphinene (6). A cytochrome P450 (PeniB) and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (PeniC) catalyse a series of oxidation reactions to transform 6 into 1, including oxidation of the C15 methyl group to a carboxylate moiety, oxidative coupling of the C15 carboxylate and the C1-C2 olefin to form a γ-lactone, and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form a δ-lactone. Our results demonstrate the highly concise and efficient ways in which fungal biosynthetic pathways can generate complex sesquiterpene scaffolds.	1
Title: A seventeen kilodaltons peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase of the cyclosporin-producer Tolypocladium inflatum is sensitive to cyclosporin A Abstract: A peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was purified to homogeneity about 24-fold from the cyclosporin-producing fungus Tolypocladium inflatum. The molecular mass of the enzyme was in the range of 17 kdaltons. Remarkably, the enzyme could be inhibited by cyclosporin A in the nanomolar range as has been shown for numerous other cyclophilins from eukaryotic organisms. This indicates, that Tolypocladium inflatum must possess a self protection system in order to survive in the presence of cyclosporin.	0
Title: Effects of transcriptional mode on promoter substitution and tandem engineering for the production of epothilones in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Promoter optimization is an economical and effective approach to overexpress heterologous genes and improve the biosynthesis of valuable products. In this study, we swapped the original promoter of the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster in Myxococcus xanthus with two endogenous strong promoters P pilA and P groEL1 , respectively, which, however, decreased the epothilone production ability. The transcriptional abilities by the two promoters were found to be bloomed in the growth stage but markedly decreased after the growth, whereas the original promoter P epo functioned majorly after the exponential growth stage. Tandem repeat engineering on the original promoter P epo remarkably increased epothilone production. The tandem promoter exerted similar expressional pattern as P epo did in M. xanthus. We demonstrated that differential transcriptional modes markedly affected the efficiency of promoters in controlling the gene expressions for the production of the secondary metabolite epothilones. Our study provides an insight into exploiting powerful promoters to produce valuable secondary metabolites, especially in host with limited known promoters.	0
Title: Metaproteomics reveals potential mechanisms by which dietary resistant starch supplementation attenuates chronic kidney disease progression in rats Abstract: Background:                       Resistant starch is a prebiotic metabolized by the gut bacteria. It has been shown to attenuate chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in rats. Previous studies employed taxonomic analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling. Here we expand these studies by metaproteomics, gaining new insight into the host-microbiome interaction.                  Methods:                       Differences between cecum contents in CKD rats fed a diet containing resistant starch with those fed a diet containing digestible starch were examined by comparative metaproteomics analysis. Taxonomic information was obtained using unique protein sequences. Our methodology results in quantitative data covering both host and bacterial proteins.                  Results:                       5,834 proteins were quantified, with 947 proteins originating from the host organism. Taxonomic information derived from metaproteomics data surpassed previous 16S RNA analysis, and reached species resolutions for moderately abundant taxonomic groups. In particular, the Ruminococcaceae family becomes well resolved-with butyrate producers and amylolytic species such as R. bromii clearly visible and significantly higher while fibrolytic species such as R. flavefaciens are significantly lower with resistant starch feeding. The observed changes in protein patterns are consistent with fiber-associated improvement in CKD phenotype. Several known host CKD-associated proteins and biomarkers of impaired kidney function were significantly reduced with resistant starch supplementation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008845.                  Conclusions:                       Metaproteomics analysis of cecum contents of CKD rats with and without resistant starch supplementation reveals changes within gut microbiota at unprecedented resolution, providing both functional and taxonomic information. Proteins and organisms differentially abundant with RS supplementation point toward a shift from mucin degraders to butyrate producers.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of lycosantalonol, a cis-prenyl derived diterpenoid Abstract: Terpenoid natural products are generally derived from isoprenyl diphosphate precursors with trans double-bond configuration, and no diterpenoid derived from the cisoid precursor (Z,Z,Z)-nerylneryl diphosphate (1) has yet been identified. Here further investigation of a terpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster from tomato is reported, which resulted in identification of a biosynthetic pathway from 1, in a pathway featuring a number of interesting transformations. Compound 1 is first cyclized to a tricyclene core ring structure analogous to that found in α-santalene, with the resulting diterpene termed here lycosantalene (2). Quantum chemical calculations indicate a role for the diphosphate anion coproduct in this cyclization reaction. Subsequently, the internal cis double bond of the neryl side chain in 2 is then further transformed to an α-hydroxy ketone moiety via an epoxide intermediate (3). Oxygen labeling studies indicate 3 undergoes oxidative conversion to lycosantalonol (4). Thus, in addition to elucidating the cisoid origins of 4, this work has further provided mechanistic insight into the interesting transformations required for its production.	0
Title: Use of the kojA promoter, involved in kojic acid biosynthesis, for polyketide production in Aspergillus oryzae: implications for long-term production Abstract: Background:                       Aspergillus oryzae, a useful industrial filamentous fungus, produces limited varieties of secondary metabolites, such as kojic acid. Thus, for the production of valuable secondary metabolites by genetic engineering, the species is considered a clean host, enabling easy purification from cultured cells. A. oryzae has been evaluated for secondary metabolite production utilizing strong constitutive promoters of genes responsible for primary metabolism. However, secondary metabolites are typically produced by residual nutrition after microbial cells grow to the stationary phase and primary metabolism slows. We focused on a promoter of the secondary metabolism gene kojA, a component of the kojic acid biosynthetic gene cluster, for the production of other secondary metabolites by A. oryzae.                  Results:                       A kojA disruptant that does not produce kojic acid was utilized as a host strain for production. Using this host strain, a mutant that expressed a polyketide synthase gene involved in polyketide secondary metabolite production under the kojA gene promoter was constructed. Then, polyketide production and polyketide synthase gene expression were observed every 24 h in liquid culture. From days 0 to 10 of culture, the polyketide was continuously produced, and the synthase gene expression was maintained. Therefore, the kojA promoter was activated, and it enabled the continuous production of polyketide for 10 days.                  Conclusions:                       The combined use of the kojA gene promoter and a kojA disruptant proved useful for the continuous production of a polyketide secondary metabolite in A. oryzae. These findings suggest that this combination can be applied to other secondary metabolites for long-term production.	1
Title: Phototemtide A, a Cyclic Lipopeptide Heterologously Expressed from Photorhabdus temperata Meg1, Shows Selective Antiprotozoal Activity Abstract: A new cyclic lipopeptide, phototemtide A (1), was isolated from Escherichia coli expressing the biosynthetic gene cluster pttABC from Photorhabdus temperata Meg1. The structure of 1 was elucidated by HR-ESI-MS and NMR experiments. The absolute configurations of amino acids and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid in 1 were determined by using the advanced Marfey's method and comparison after total synthesis of 1, respectively. Additionally, three new minor derivatives, phototemtides B-D (2-4), were identified by detailed HPLC-MS analysis. Phototemtide A (1) showed weak antiprotozoal activity against Plasmodium falciparum, with an IC50 value of 9.8 μm. The biosynthesis of phototemtides A-D (1-4) was also proposed.	0
Title: Neuronal store-operated calcium entry pathway as a novel therapeutic target for Huntington's disease treatment Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion within Huntingtin (Htt) protein. In the phenotypic screen we identified a class of quinazoline-derived compounds that delayed a progression of a motor phenotype in transgenic Drosophila HD flies. We found that the store-operated calcium (Ca(2+)) entry (SOC) pathway activity is enhanced in neuronal cells expressing mutant Htt and that the identified compounds inhibit SOC pathway in HD neurons. The same compounds exerted neuroprotective effects in glutamate-toxicity assays with YAC128 medium spiny neurons primary cultures. We demonstrated a key role of TRPC1 channels in supporting SOC pathway in HD neurons. We concluded that the TRPC1-mediated neuronal SOC pathway constitutes a novel target for HD treatment and that the identified compounds represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for treatment of HD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.	0
Title: Selective Transformation of Nickel-Bound Formate to CO or C-C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali-Metal Ions Abstract: The complexes [LtBu Ni(OCO-κ2 O,C)]M3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBu NiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3 )2 ], feature a NiII -CO2 2- core surrounded by Lewis-acidic cations (M+ ) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3 SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni-OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+ , the {[K3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 }+ shell around the Ni-CO2 2- entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3 )2 ] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBu NiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBu NiI (μ-OOCH)NiI LtBu ]K and [LtBu Ni(C2 O4 )NiLtBu ]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2 C-CO2 -CO2 ]4- ) ligands.	0
Title: Identification of the gene cluster involved in muraymycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30471 Abstract: Muraymycin, a potent translocase I inhibitor with clinical potential, is produced by Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30471. The structure of muraymycin is highly unusual and contains the hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl moiety (epicapreomycidine) and an ureido bond. Here we report the identification of the muraymycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30471. Sequencing analysis of a 43.4-kb contiguous region revealed 33 ORFs, 26 of which were proposed to be involved in muraymycin biosynthesis. Independent targeted inactivation of mur16 and mur17 directly abolished muraymycin production, demonstrating the role of the genes essential for muraymycin biosynthesis. These data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for muraymycin biosynthesis, and lay a foundation for the generation of muraymycin derivatives with enhanced bioactivity via the strategies of combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of unique lanthionine synthetases reveals new mechanistic and evolutionary insights Abstract: Lantibiotic synthetases are remarkable biocatalysts generating conformationally constrained peptides with a variety of biological activities by repeatedly utilizing two simple posttranslational modification reactions: dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and intramolecular addition of Cys thiols to the resulting dehydro amino acids. Since previously reported lantibiotic synthetases show no apparent homology with any other known protein families, the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origin of these enzymes are unknown. In this study, we present a novel class of lanthionine synthetases, termed LanL, that consist of three distinct catalytic domains and demonstrate in vitro enzyme activity of a family member from Streptomyces venezuelae. Analysis of individually expressed and purified domains shows that LanL enzymes install dehydroamino acids via phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by a protein kinase domain and subsequent elimination of the phosphate by a phosphoSer/Thr lyase domain. The latter has sequence homology with the phosphothreonine lyases found in various pathogenic bacteria that inactivate host mitogen activated protein kinases. A LanC-like cyclase domain then catalyzes the addition of Cys residues to the dehydro amino acids to form the characteristic thioether rings. We propose that LanL enzymes have evolved from stand-alone protein Ser/Thr kinases, phosphoSer/Thr lyases, and enzymes catalyzing thiol alkylation. We also demonstrate that the genes for all three pathways to lanthionine-containing peptides are widespread in Nature. Given the remarkable efficiency of formation of lanthionine-containing polycyclic peptides and the latter's high degree of specificity for their cognate cellular targets, it is perhaps not surprising that (at least) three distinct families of polypeptide sequences have evolved to access this structurally and functionally diverse class of compounds.	1
Title: Identifying the roles of amino acids, alcohols and 1,2-diamines as mediators in coupling of haloarenes to arenes Abstract: Coupling of haloarenes to arenes has been facilitated by a diverse range of organic additives in the presence of KO(t)Bu or NaO(t)Bu since the first report in 2008. Very recently, we showed that the reactivity of some of these additives (e.g., compounds 6 and 7) could be explained by the formation of organic electron donors in situ, but the role of other additives was not addressed. The simplest of these, alcohols, including 1,2-diols, 1,2-diamines, and amino acids are the most intriguing, and we now report experiments that support their roles as precursors of organic electron donors, underlining the importance of this mode of initiation in these coupling reactions.	0
Title: Structure, bioactivity, and resistance mechanism of streptomonomicin, an unusual lasso Peptide from an understudied halophilic actinomycete Abstract: Natural products are the most historically significant source of compounds for drug development. However, unacceptably high rates of compound rediscovery associated with large-scale screening of common microbial producers have resulted in the abandonment of many natural product drug discovery efforts, despite the increasing prevalence of clinically problematic antibiotic resistance. Screening of underexplored taxa represents one strategy to avoid rediscovery. Herein we report the discovery, isolation, and structural elucidation of streptomonomicin (STM), an antibiotic lasso peptide from Streptomonospora alba, and report the genome for its producing organism. STM-resistant clones of Bacillus anthracis harbor mutations to walR, the gene encoding a response regulator for the only known widely distributed and essential two-component signal transduction system in Firmicutes. To the best of our knowledge, Streptomonospora had been hitherto biosynthetically and genetically uncharacterized, with STM being the first reported compound from the genus. Our results demonstrate that understudied microbes remain fruitful reservoirs for the rapid discovery of novel, bioactive natural products.	1
Title: A small-molecule inducer of PDX1 expression identified by high-throughput screening Abstract: Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), a member of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor family, is a key transcription factor important for both pancreas development and mature β cell function. The ectopic overexpression of Pdx1, Neurog3, and MafA in mice reprograms acinar cells to insulin-producing cells. We developed a quantitative PCR-based gene expression assay to screen more than 60,000 compounds for expression of each of these genes in the human PANC-1 ductal carcinoma cell line. We identified BRD7552, which upregulated PDX1 expression in both primary human islets and ductal cells, and induced epigenetic changes in the PDX1 promoter consistent with transcriptional activation. Prolonged compound treatment induced both insulin mRNA and protein and also enhanced insulin expression induced by the three-gene combination. These results provide a proof of principle for identifying small molecules that induce expression of transcription factors to control cellular reprogramming.	0
Title: The fission yeast COP9/signalosome is involved in cullin modification by ubiquitin-related Ned8p Abstract: Background:                       The function of the fission yeast cullins Pcu1p and Pcu4p requires modification by the ubiquitin-related peptide Ned8p. A recent report by Lyapina et al. shows that the COP9/signalosome (CSN), a multifunctional eight subunit complex, regulates Ned8p modification of Pcu1p. Disruption of caa1/csn1, which encodes subunit 1 of the putative S. pombe CSN, results in accumulation of Pcu1p exclusively in the modified form. However, it remained unclear whether this reflects global control of all cullins by the entire CSN complex.                  Results:                       We demonstrate that multiple CSN subunits control Ned8p modification of Pcu3p, another fission yeast cullin, which, in complex with the RING domain protein Pip1p, forms a ubiquitin ligase that functions in cellular stress response. Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p on Lys 729 and accumulates exclusively in the neddylated form in cells lacking the CSN subunits 1, 3, 4, and 5. These CSN subunits co-elute with Pcu3p in gel filtration fractions corresponding to approximately 550 kDa and specifically bind both native and Ned8p-modified Pcu3p in vivo. While CSN does not influence the subcellular localization of Pcu3p, Pcu3p-associated in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity is stimulated in the absence of CSN.                  Conclusions:                       Taken together, our data suggest that CSN is a global regulator of Ned8p modification of multiple cullins and potentially other proteins involved in cellular regulation.	0
Title: The phenoptosis problem: what is causing the death of an organism? Lessons from acute kidney injury Abstract: Programmed execution of various cells and intracellular structures is hypothesized to be not the only example of elimination of biological systems - the general mechanism can also involve programmed execution of organs and organisms. Modern rating of programmed cell death mechanisms includes 13 mechanistic types. As for some types, the mechanism of actuation and manifestation of cell execution has been basically elucidated, while the causes and intermediate steps of the process of fatal failure of organs and organisms remain unknown. The analysis of deaths resulting from a sudden heart arrest or multiple organ failure and other acute and chronic pathologies leads to the conclusion of a special role of mitochondria and oxidative stress activating the immune system. Possible mechanisms of mitochondria-mediated induction of the signaling cascades involved in organ failure and death of the organism are discussed. These mechanisms include generation of reactive oxygen species and damage-associated molecular patterns in mitochondria. Some examples of renal failure-induced deaths are presented with mechanisms and settings determined by some hypothetical super system rather than by the kidneys themselves. This system plays the key role in the process of physiological senescence and termination of an organism. The facts presented suggest that it is the immune system involved in mitochondrial signaling that can act as the system responsible for the organism's death.	0
Title: Molecular insights into the biosynthesis of guadinomine: a type III secretion system inhibitor Abstract: Guadinomines are a recently discovered family of anti-infective compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. K01-0509 with a novel mode of action. With an IC(50) of 14 nM, guadinomine B is the most potent known inhibitor of the type III secretion system (TTSS) of Gram-negative bacteria. TTSS activity is required for the virulence of many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli , Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., Chlamydia spp., Vibrio spp., and Pseudomonas spp. The guadinomine (gdn) biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned and sequenced and includes 26 open reading frames spanning 51.2 kb. It encodes a chimeric multimodular polyketide synthase, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, along with enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the unusual aminomalonyl-acyl carrier protein extender unit and the signature carbamoylated cyclic guanidine. Its identity was established by targeted disruption of the gene cluster as well as by heterologous expression and analysis of key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. Identifying the guadinomine gene cluster provides critical insight into the biosynthesis of these scarce but potentially important natural products.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of a macrocyclic peptide containing an unprecedented lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink Abstract: Streptococcal bacteria use peptide signals as a means of intraspecies communication. These peptides can contain unusual post-translational modifications, providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of nature's chemical and biosynthetic repertoires. Here, we have combined tools from natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology to elucidate the structure and biosynthesis of streptide, a streptococcal macrocyclic peptide. We show that streptide bears an unprecedented post-translational modification involving a covalent linkage between two unactivated carbons within the side chains of lysine and tryptophan. The biosynthesis of streptide was addressed by genetic and biochemical studies. The former implicated a new SPASM-domain-containing radical SAM enzyme StrB, while the latter revealed that StrB contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters and installs the unusual lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink in a single step. By intramolecularly stitching together the side chains of lysine and tryptophan, StrB provides a new route for biosynthesizing macrocyclic peptides.	1
Title: Precursor-directed biosynthesis of catechol compounds in Acinetobacter bouvetii DSM 14964 Abstract: Genome mining for VibH homologs reveals several species of Acinetobacter with a gene cluster that putatively encodes the biosynthesis of catechol siderophores with an amine core. A. bouvetii DSM 14964 produces three novel biscatechol siderophores: propanochelin (1), butanochelin (2), and pentanochelin (3). This strain has a relaxed specificity for the amine substrate, allowing for the biosynthesis of a variety of non-natural siderophore analogs by precursor directed biosynthesis. Of potential synthetic utility, A. bouvetii DSM 14964 condenses 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHB) to allylamine and propargylamine, producing catecholic compounds which bind iron(iii) and may be further modified via thiol-ene or azide-alkyne click chemistry.	1
Title: Two new major subunits in the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum: xyloglucanase Xgh74A and endoxylanase Xyn10D Abstract: The structure and enzymic activity of xyloglucanase Xgh74A and endoxylanase Xyn10D, components in the cellulosomes of cellulose-grown Clostridium thermocellum, were determined. Xyn10D is a thermostable endo-1,4-beta-xylanase with a module composition identical to Xyn10C (CBM22-GH10-Doc). It hydrolyses xylan and mixed-linkage 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan with a temperature optimum of 80 degrees C. Xyloglucanase Xgh74A contains a catalytic module of GHF74 in addition to a C-terminal dockerin module. It hydrolyses every fourth beta-1,4-glucan bond in the xyloglucan backbone, thus producing decorated cellotetraose units. Its low activity on CMC and lack of activity on amorphous cellulose indicates recognition of the xylosidic side chains present in xyloglucan, which is readily hydrolysed (295 U mg(-1)). The pattern of the hydrolysis products from tamarind xyloglucan resembles that of other GHF74 xyloglucan endoglucanases. The data indicate that Xgh74A and Xyn10D contribute to the in vivo degradation of the hemicelluloses xyloglucan and xylan by the cellulosome of C. thermocellum. Xgh74A is the first xyloglucanase identified in C. thermocellum and the only enzyme in the cellulosome that hydrolyses tamarind xyloglucan.	0
Title: 3-O-Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate Enhances Tau Interaction and Cellular Uptake Abstract: Prion-like transcellular spreading of tau in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is mediated by tau binding to cell surface heparan sulfate (HS). However, the structural determinants for tau-HS interaction are not well understood. Microarray and SPR assays of structurally defined HS oligosaccharides show that a rare 3-O-sulfation (3-O-S) of HS significantly enhances tau binding. In Hs3st1-/- (HS 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 knockout) cells, reduced 3-O-S levels of HS diminished both cell surface binding and internalization of tau. In a cell culture, the addition of a 3-O-S HS 12-mer reduced both tau cell surface binding and cellular uptake. NMR titrations mapped 3-O-S binding sites to the microtubule binding repeat 2 (R2) and proline-rich region 2 (PRR2) of tau. Tau is only the seventh protein currently known to recognize HS 3-O-sulfation. Our work demonstrates that this rare 3-O-sulfation enhances tau-HS binding and likely the transcellular spread of tau, providing a novel target for disease-modifying treatment of AD and other tauopathies.	0
Title: Adherence to host extracellular matrix and serum components by Enterococcus faecium isolates of diverse origin Abstract: Enterococcus faecium has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections over the last two decades. We recently demonstrated collagen type I (CI) as a common adherence target for some E. faecium isolates and a significant correlation was found to exist between acm-mediated CI adherence and clinical origin. Here, we evaluated 60 diverse E. faecium isolates for their adherence to up to 15 immobilized host extracellular matrix and serum components. Adherence phenotypes were most commonly observed to fibronectin (Fn) (20% of the 60 isolates), fibrinogen (17%) and laminin (Ln) (13%), while only one or two of the isolates adhered to collagen type V (CV), transferrin or lactoferrin and none to the other host components tested. Adherence to Fn and Ln was almost exclusively restricted to clinical isolates, especially the endocarditis-enriched nosocomial genogroup clonal complex 17 (CC17). Thus, the ability to adhere to Fn and Ln, in addition to CI, may have contributed to the emergence and adaptation of E. faecium, in particular CC17, as a nosocomial pathogen.	0
Title: Correction to: Biodegradation of naphthenic acids: identification of Rhodococcus opacus R7 genes as molecular markers for environmental monitoring and their application in slurry microcosms Abstract: The published online version contains mistake in the author list for the author "M.

Title: Biosynthesis and regulation of grisemycin, a new member of the linaridin family of ribosomally synthesized peptides produced by Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350 Abstract: Our recent identification and genetic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for production of the ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide cypemycin revealed a new class of peptide natural products, the linaridins. Here we describe the identification and characterization of grisemycin, a linaridin produced by a previously unidentified gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that grisemycin possesses at least three of the modifications found in cypemycin, as well as an analogous leader peptidase cleavage site. Expression of putative grisemycin biosynthetic genes in a Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) derivative, combined with deletion of the gene encoding the grisemycin precursor peptide, confirmed the identity of the grisemycin gene cluster. Both grisemycin and cypemycin depend on the transcriptional activator AdpA for wild-type levels of production.	1
Title: Camporidines A and B: Antimetastatic and Anti-inflammatory Polyketide Alkaloids from a Gut Bacterium of Camponotus kiusiuensis Abstract: Chemical studies of gut bacteria of the carpenter ant Camponotus kiusiuensis led to the discovery of two new alkaloids, camporidines A and B (1 and 2), from Streptomyces sp. STA1. The structures of 1 and 2 were established as new polyketide alkaloids bearing a piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic system based on NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analysis. The relative configurations of the camporidines were determined by their 1H-1H NOESY/ROESY and 1D NOE NMR correlations. The experimental ECD spectra of 1 and 2 were compared with their calculated ECD spectra to assign their absolute configurations. Camporidine A (1) displayed antimetastatic activity by suppression of cell invasion against the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and showed an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the camporidines was identified, and the biosynthetic pathway of the camporidines was proposed based on bioinformatic analysis of the full genome of Streptomyces sp. STA1. Camporidines A and B (1 and 2) could be biosynthesized by a modular type I PKS containing an acyl transferase domain that accepts an unusual extender unit, which becomes the (C1'-C6') hexyl side chain. The post-PKS modification enzymes were predicted to perform an amination and an oxidation along with spontaneous Schiff base formation and generate the unique piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic framework.	1
Title: Identification of genes encoding two-component lantibiotic production in Staphylococcus aureus C55 and other phage group II S. aureus strains and demonstration of an association with the exfoliative toxin B gene Abstract: The production of exfoliative toxin B (ET-B), but not ET-A, was shown to be specifically associated with production of a highly conserved two-component lantibiotic peptide system in phage group II Staphylococcus aureus. Two previously studied but incompletely characterized S. aureus bacteriocins, staphylococcins C55 and BacR1, were found to be members of this lantibiotic system, and considerable homology was also found with the two-component Lactococcus lactis bacteriocin, lacticin 3147. sacalphaA and sacbetaA, the structural genes of the lantibiotics staphylococcins C55alpha and C55beta and two putative lantibiotic processing genes, sacM1 and sacT, were localized together with the ET-B structural gene to a single 32-kb plasmid in strain C55. Irreversible loss of both ET-B and two-component lantibiotic production occurs during laboratory passage of ET-B-positive S. aureus strains, particularly at elevated temperatures.	1
Title: The N-terminus of the Begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (BV1) determines virulence or avirulence in Phaseolus vulgaris Abstract: The BV1 gene of the bipartite Begomovirus genome encodes a nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) that is also an avirulence determinant in common bean. The function of the NSP of two common bean-infecting bipartite begomoviruses, Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) and Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV), was investigated using a series of hybrid DNA-B components expressing chimeric BDMV and BGYMV NSP, and genotypes of the two major common bean gene pools: Andean (cv. Topcrop) and Middle American (cvs. Alpine and UI 114). BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG4 (BDMV DNA-B expressing the BGYMV NSP) and HBDBG9 (BDMV DNA-B expressing a chimeric NSP with the N-terminal 1 to 42 amino acids from BGYMV) overcame the BDMV resistance of UI 114. This established that the BDMV NSP is an avirulence determinant in UI 114, and mapped the domain involved in this response to the N-terminus, which is a variable surface-exposed region. BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG10, expressing a chimeric NSP with amino acids 43 to 92 from BGYMV, was not infectious, revealing an essential virus-specific domain. In the BGYMV background, the BDMV NSP was a virulence factor in the Andean cv. Topcrop, whereas it was an avirulence factor in the Middle American cultivars, particularly in the absence of the BGYMV NSP. The capsid protein (CP) also played a gene pool-specific role in viral infectivity; it was dispensable for infectivity in the Andean cv. Topcrop, but was required for infectivity of BDMV, BGYMV, and certain hybrid viruses in the Middle American cultivars. Redundancy of the CP and NSP, which are nuclear proteins involved directly or indirectly in viral movement, provides a masking effect that may allow the virus to avoid host defense responses.	0
Title: Immunological relationships among some species of extremely halophilic bacteria Abstract: Rabbits were immunized with four strains of halobacteria, Halobacterium halobium NRL, H. halobium R-1, H. salinarium NRL-9, and H. cutirubrum NRL-10, that had been fixed with formaldehyde. The antisera obtained detected the presence of an antigen common to the Halobacterium genus and, after absorption, detected three distinct antigenic groups within the Halobacterium genus. A fourth group was agglutinated only by unabsorbed sera.	0
Title: Azetidine-Bearing Non-Ribosomal Peptides, Bonnevillamides D and E, Isolated from a Carrion Beetle-Associated Actinomycete Abstract: Two new nonribosomal peptides, bonnevillamides D and E (1 and 2), have been discovered in Streptomyces sp. UTZ13 isolated from the carrion beetle, Nicrophorus concolor. Combinational analysis of the UV, MS, and NMR spectroscopic data revealed that their planar structures were comprised of dichlorinated linear peptides containing nonproteinogenic amino acid residues, such as 4-methylazetidinecarboxylic acid and 4-O-acetyl-5-methylproline. The configurations of bonnevillamides D and E (1 and 2) were determined based on ROESY correlations, the advanced Marfey's method, phenylglycine methyl ester derivatization, molecular modeling, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic pathway of bonnevillamides D and E has been proposed using bioinformatic analysis of the whole-genome sequence data of Streptomyces sp. UTZ13. Their biological activity toward the aggregation of amyloid-β, which is one of the key pathogenic proteins in Alzheimer's disease, was evaluated using a thioflavin T assay and gel electrophoresis. Bonnevillamides D and E reversed the fibril formation by inducing the monomerization of amyloid-β aggregates.	1
Title: Meta-omic characterization of the marine invertebrate microbial consortium that produces the chemotherapeutic natural product ET-743 Abstract: In many macroorganisms, the ultimate source of potent biologically active natural products has remained elusive due to an inability to identify and culture the producing symbiotic microorganisms. As a model system for developing a meta-omic approach to identify and characterize natural product pathways from invertebrate-derived microbial consortia, we chose to investigate the ET-743 (Yondelis) biosynthetic pathway. This molecule is an approved anticancer agent obtained in low abundance (10(-4)-10(-5) % w/w) from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata and is generated in suitable quantities for clinical use by a lengthy semisynthetic process. On the basis of structural similarities to three bacterial secondary metabolites, we hypothesized that ET-743 is the product of a marine bacterial symbiont. Using metagenomic sequencing of total DNA from the tunicate/microbial consortium, we targeted and assembled a 35 kb contig containing 25 genes that comprise the core of the NRPS biosynthetic pathway for this valuable anticancer agent. Rigorous sequence analysis based on codon usage of two large unlinked contigs suggests that Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis produces the ET-743 metabolite. Subsequent metaproteomic analysis confirmed expression of three key biosynthetic proteins. Moreover, the predicted activity of an enzyme for assembly of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core of ET-743 was verified in vitro. This work provides a foundation for direct production of the drug and new analogues through metabolic engineering. We expect that the interdisciplinary approach described is applicable to diverse host-symbiont systems that generate valuable natural products for drug discovery and development.	1
Title: Natural combinatorial biosynthesis involving two clusters for the synthesis of three pyrrolamides in Streptomyces netropsis Abstract: The pyrrolamides constitute a small family of secondary metabolites that are known for their ability to bind noncovalently to the DNA minor groove with some sequence specificity. To date, only a single pyrrolamide biosynthetic gene cluster has been reported, directing the synthesis of congocidine (netropsin) in Streptomyces ambofaciens. In this study, we improve our understanding of pyrrolamide biosynthesis through the identification and characterization of the gene cluster responsible for the production of distamycin in Streptomyces netropsis DSM40846. We discover that the strain produces two other pyrrolamides, the well-characterized congocidine and a congocidine/distamycin hybrid that we named disgocidine. S. netropsis DSM40846 genome analysis led to the identification of two distinct pyrrolamide-like biosynthetic gene clusters. We show here that these two clusters are reciprocally dependent for the production of the three pyrrolamide molecules. Furthermore, based on detailed functional analysis of these clusters, we propose a biosynthetic route to congocidine and distamycin and an updated model for pyrrolamide assembly. The synthesis of disgocidine, the distamycin/congocidine hybrid, appears to constitute the first example of "natural combinatorial biosynthesis" between two related biosynthetic pathways. Finally, we analyze the genomic context of the two biosynthetic gene clusters and suggest that the presently interdependent clusters result from the coevolution of two ancestral independent pyrrolamide gene clusters.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Tropolones in Streptomyces spp.: Interweaving Biosynthesis and Degradation of Phenylacetic Acid and Hydroxylations on the Tropone Ring Abstract: Tropolonoids are important natural products that contain a unique seven-membered aromatic tropolone core and exhibit remarkable biological activities. 3,7-Dihydroxytropolone (DHT) isolated from Streptomyces species is a multiply hydroxylated tropolone exhibiting antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral activities. In this study, we determined the DHT biosynthetic pathway by heterologous expression, gene deletion, and biotransformation. Nine trl genes and some of the aerobic phenylacetic acid degradation pathway genes (paa) located outside the trl biosynthetic gene cluster are required for the heterologous production of DHT. The trlA gene encodes a single-domain protein homologous to the C-terminal enoyl coenzyme A (enoyl-CoA) hydratase domain of PaaZ. TrlA truncates the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway and redirects it toward the formation of heptacyclic intermediates. TrlB is a 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase homolog. TrlH is an unusual bifunctional protein bearing an N-terminal prephenate dehydratase domain and a C-terminal chorismate mutase domain. TrlB and TrlH enhanced de novo biosynthesis of phenylpyruvate, thereby providing abundant precursor for the prolific production of DHT in Streptomyces spp. Six seven-membered carbocyclic compounds were identified from the trlC, trlD, trlE, and trlF deletion mutants. Four of these chemicals, including 1,4,6-cycloheptatriene-1-carboxylic acid, tropone, tropolone, and 7-hydroxytropolone, were verified as key biosynthetic intermediates. TrlF is required for the conversion of 1,4,6-cycloheptatriene-1-carboxylic acid into tropone. The monooxygenases TrlE and TrlCD catalyze the regioselective hydroxylations of tropone to produce DHT. This study reveals a natural association of anabolism of chorismate and phenylpyruvate, catabolism of phenylacetic acid, and biosynthesis of tropolones in Streptomyces spp.IMPORTANCE Tropolonoids are promising drug lead compounds because of the versatile bioactivities attributed to their highly oxidized seven-membered aromatic ring scaffolds. Our present study provides clear insight into the biosynthesis of 3,7-dihydroxytropolone (DHT) through the identification of key genes responsible for the formation and modification of the seven-membered aromatic core. We also reveal the intrinsic mechanism of elevated production of DHT and related tropolonoids in Streptomyces spp. The study on DHT biosynthesis in Streptomyces exhibits a good example of antibiotic production in which both anabolic and catabolic pathways of primary metabolism are interwoven into the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, our study sets the stage for metabolic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway for natural tropolonoid products and provides alternative synthetic biology tools for engineering novel tropolonoids.	1
Title: Lacticin 3147--biosynthesis, molecular analysis, immunity, bioengineering and applications Abstract: The continuing problem of the emergence of multidrug resistance in pathogens has resulted in renewed efforts to identify novel antimicrobials that could be used in clinical settings. Lantibiotics are bacterially produced gene encoded antimicrobial peptides which have been the focus of extensive investigation in recent years because of their broad spectrum of activity. Lantibiotics (lanthionine-containing antibiotics), which have traditionally been regarded as antimicrobials for use in food or veterinary medicine, may provide at least part of the solution to these problems. Lacticin 3147 is a two peptide lantibiotic (consisting of the peptides Ltnα and Ltnβ) which is active at low concentrations against many pathogens. It has been the subject of extensive research, which has generated significant insights into the mechanisms of lacticin 3147 biosynthesis, immunity, structure function relationships and the consequences of molecular bioengineering. The merits of employing lacticin 3147 to control spoilage microbes as well as its potential in the elimination of food, human and veterinary pathogens have also been highlighted. Here we review the knowledge which has been gained with respect to lacticin 3147 since its discovery in 1995.	1
Title: Genes specific for the biosynthesis of clavam metabolites antipodal to clavulanic acid are clustered with the gene for clavaminate synthase 1 in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Portions of the Streptomyces clavuligerus chromosome flanking cas1, which encodes the clavaminate synthase 1 isoenzyme (CAS1), have been cloned and sequenced. Mutants of S. clavuligerus disrupted in cvm1, the open reading frame located immediately upstream of cas1, were constructed by a gene replacement procedure. Similar techniques were used to generate S. clavuligerus mutants carrying a deletion that encompassed portions of the two open reading frames, cvm4 and cvm5, located directly downstream of cas1. Both classes of mutants still produced clavulanic acid and cephamycin C but lost the ability to synthesize the antipodal clavam metabolites clavam-2-carboxylate, 2-hydroxymethyl-clavam, and 2-alanylclavam. These results suggested that cas1 is clustered with genes essential and specific for clavam metabolite biosynthesis. When a cas1 mutant of S. clavuligerus was constructed by gene replacement, it produced lower levels of both clavulanic acid and most of the antipodal clavams except for 2-alanylclavam. However, a double mutant of S. clavuligerus disrupted in both cas1 and cas2 produced neither clavulanic acid nor any of the antipodal clavams, including 2-alanylclavam. This outcome was consistent with the contribution of both CAS1 and CAS2 to a common pool of clavaminic acid that is shunted toward clavulanic acid and clavam metabolite biosynthesis.	1
Title: Nonribosomal biosynthesis of vancomycin-type antibiotics: a heptapeptide backbone and eight peptide synthetase modules Abstract: During analysis of the recently identified gene cluster for the glycopeptide antibiotic balhimycin, produced by Amycolatopsis mediterranei DSM 5908, novel genes were identified and characterized in detail. The gene products of four of the identified genes (bpsA, bpsB, bpsC and bpsD) are nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs); one (Orf1-protein) shows similarities to small proteins associated with several NRPSs without an assigned function. BpsA and BpsB are composed of three modules each (modules 1-6), BpsC of one module (module 7) and BpsD of a minimal module (module 8). Thus, the balhimycin gene cluster encodes eight modules, whereas its biosynthetic product is a heptapeptide. Non-producing mutants were created by a gene disruption of bpsB, an in-frame deletion of bpsC and a gene replacement of bpsD. After establishment of a gene complementation system for Amycolatopsis strains, the replacement mutant of bpsD was complemented, demonstrating for the first time that BpsD, encoding the eighth module, is indeed involved in balhimycin biosynthesis. After feeding with beta-hydroxytyrosine the capability of the bpsD mutant to produce balhimycin was restored, demonstrating the participation of BpsD in the biosynthesis of this amino acid. The specificity of four of the eight adenylation domains was determined by ATP/PP(i) exchange assays: modules 4 and 5 activated L-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, module 6 activated beta-hydroxytyrosine and module 7 activated L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, which is in accordance with the sequence of the non-proteogenic amino acids 4 to 7 of the balhimycin backbone.	1
Title: Total synthesis of (+)-SCH 351448 Abstract: A convergent synthesis of (+)-SCH 351448 (1), a monosodium salt of a C(2)-symmetric macrodiolide, is described. Our approach is based on a [4 + 2] annulation with a chiral allyl silane (anti-5c) to assemble the pyran subunits. Homodimerization was carried out in a stepwise fashion; initial esterification at C29' followed by macrocyclization at C29 afforded the desired macrodiolide.	0
Title: Sequence analysis and molecular characterization of genes required for the biosynthesis of type 1 capsular polysaccharide in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: We previously cloned a 19.4-kb DNA region containing a cluster of genes affecting type 1 capsule production from Staphylococcus aureus M. Subcloning experiments showed that these capsule (cap) genes are localized in a 14.6-kb region. Sequencing analysis of the 14.6-kb fragment revealed 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Using complementation tests, we have mapped a collection of Cap- mutations in 10 of the 13 ORFs, indicating that these 10 genes are involved in capsule biosynthesis. The requirement for the remaining three ORFs in the synthesis of the capsule was demonstrated by constructing site-specific mutations corresponding to each of the three ORFs. Using an Escherichia coli S30 in vitro transcription-translation system, we clearly identified 7 of the 13 proteins predicted from the ORFs. Homology search between the predicted proteins and those in the data bank showed very high homology (52.3% identity) between capL and vipA, moderate homology (29% identity) between capI and vipB, and limited homology (21.8% identity) between capM and vipC. The vipA, vipB, and vipC genes have been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of Salmonella typhi Vi antigen, a homopolymer polysaccharide consisting of N-acetylgalactosamino uronic acid, which is also one of the components of the staphylococcal type 1 capsule. The homology between these sets of genes therefore suggests that capL, capI, and capM may be involved in the biosynthesis of amino sugar, N-acetylgalactosamino uronic acid. In addition, the search showed that CapG aligned well with the consensus sequence of a family of acetyltransferases from various prokaryotic organisms, suggesting that CapG may be an acetyltransferase. Using the isogenic Cap- and Cap+ strains constructed in this study, we have confirmed that type 1 capsule is an important virulence factor in a mouse lethality test.	1
Title: stcS, a putative P-450 monooxygenase, is required for the conversion of versicolorin A to sterigmatocystin in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Sterigmatocystin (ST) and aflatoxin are carcinogenic end point metabolites derived from the same biochemical pathway, which is found in several Aspergillus spp. Recently, an ST gene cluster, containing approximately 25 distinct genes that are each proposed to function specifically in ST biosynthesis, has been identified in Aspergillus nidulans. Each of these structural genes is named stc (sterigmatocystin) followed by a consecutive letter of the alphabet. We have previously described stcU (formerly verA) as encoding a keto-reductase required for the conversion of versicolorin A to ST. We now describe a second A. nidulans gene, stcS (formerly verB), that is located within 2 kb of stcU in the ST gene cluster. An stcS-disrupted strain of A. nidulans, TSS17, was unable to produce ST and converted ST/aflatoxin precursors to versicolorin A rather than ST, indicating that stcS functions at the same point in the pathway as stcU. Genomic sequence analysis of stcS shows that it encodes a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and constitutes a novel P-450 family, CYP59. Assuming that StcU activity mimics that of similar P-450s, it is likely that StcU catalyzes one of the proposed oxidation steps necessary to convert versicolorin A to ST. These results constitute the first genetic proof that the conversion of versicolorin A to ST requires more than one enzymatic activity.	1
Title: Investigation of Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP)-like Peptide Cyclase and Hydrolase in Surugamide Non-ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis Abstract: Non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) are biosynthesized on non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) complexes, of which a C-terminal releasing domain commonly offloads the products. Interestingly, a dedicated releasing domain is absent in surugamides (SGM) NRPS, which directs the biosynthesis of cyclic octapeptides, SGM-A to -E, and the linear decapeptide, SGM-F. Here, we confirmed that surE is essential for the production of SGMs via genetic experiments. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme, SurE, can generate the main products SGM-A and -F from the corresponding SNAC substrates, indicating that SurE is a standalone thioesterase-like enzyme. SurE also displays considerable substrate plasticity with expanded ring or different amino acid compositions to produce different cyclopeptides, highlighting the potential of chemoenzymatic applications. Site-directed mutagenesis allowed identification of the key residues of SurE. Finally, bioinformatics analysis suggested that SurE homologs are widely distributed in bacteria, suggesting a general mechanism of NRP release in Nature.	0
Title: Elucidation of gibberellin biosynthesis in bacteria reveals convergent evolution Abstract: Gibberellins (GAs) are crucial phytohormones involved in many aspects of plant growth and development, including plant-microbe interactions, which has led to GA production by plant-associated fungi and bacteria as well. While the GA biosynthetic pathways in plants and fungi have been elucidated and found to have arisen independently through convergent evolution, little has been uncovered about GA biosynthesis in bacteria. Some nitrogen-fixing, symbiotic, legume-associated rhizobia, including Bradyrhizobium japonicum-the symbiont of soybean-and Sinorhizobium fredii-a broad-host-nodulating species-contain a putative GA biosynthetic operon, or gene cluster. Through functional characterization of five unknown genes, we demonstrate that this operon encodes the enzymes necessary to produce GA9, thereby elucidating bacterial GA biosynthesis. The distinct nature of these enzymes indicates that bacteria have independently evolved a third biosynthetic pathway for GA production. Furthermore, our results also reveal a central biochemical logic that is followed in all three convergently evolved GA biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Pseudomonas-Derived Butenolides Abstract: Butenolides are well-known signaling molecules in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we describe a novel class of butenolides isolated from a Gram-negative Pseudomonas strain, the styrolides. Structure elucidation was aided by the total synthesis of styrolide A. Transposon mutagenesis enabled us to identify the styrolide biosynthetic gene cluster, and by using a homology search, we discovered the related and previously unknown acaterin biosynthetic gene cluster in another Pseudomonas species. Mutagenesis, heterologous expression, and identification of key shunt and intermediate products were crucial to propose a biosynthetic pathway for both Pseudomonas-derived butenolides. Comparative transcriptomics suggests a link between styrolide formation and the regulatory networks of the bacterium.	1
Title: The complete genome sequence of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the Gram-positive bacteria. Its genome of 4,214,810 base pairs comprises 4,100 protein-coding genes. Of these protein-coding genes, 53% are represented once, while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication, the largest family containing 77 putative ATP-binding transport proteins. In addition, a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources, including many plant-derived molecules. The identification of five signal peptidase genes, as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus, is important given the capacity of Bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes. Many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, that are more typically associated with Streptomyces species. The genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages, indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer, in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis.	1
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa antimetabolite L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid Abstract: L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB) is a potent antibiotic and toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using a novel biochemical assay combined with site-directed mutagenesis in strain PAO1, we have identified a five-gene cluster specifying AMB biosynthesis, probably involving a thiotemplate mechanism. Overexpression of this cluster in strain PA7, a natural AMB-negative isolate, led to AMB overproduction.	1
Title: Microbe Profile: Euglena gracilis: photogenic, flexible and hardy Abstract: Euglena gracilis is a unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotic flagellate of the Discoba supergroup, which also encompasses Kinetoplastida and Diplonema. Plastids have green algal origin and are secondarily acquired. The nuclear genome is extremely large and many genes suggest multiple endosymbiotic/gene transfer events, i.e. derivation from prokaryotes of various lineages. E. gracilis is remarkably robust and can proliferate in environments contaminated with heavy metals and acids. Extraordinary metabolic plasticity and a mixotrophic lifestyle confers an ability to thrive in a broad range of environments, as well as facilitating production of many novel metabolites, making Euglena of considerable biotechnological importance.	0
Title: Cloning and identification of the Frigocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces griseus strain NTK 97 Abstract: Frigocyclinone is a novel antibiotic with antibacterial and anticancer activities. It is produced by both Antarctica-derived Streptomyces griseus NTK 97 and marine sponge-associated Streptomyces sp. M7_15. Here, we first report the biosynthetic gene cluster of frigocyclinone in the S. griseus NTK 97. The frigocyclinone gene cluster spans a DNA region of 33-kb which consists of 30 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding minimal type II polyketide synthase, aromatase and cyclase, redox tailoring enzymes, sugar biosynthesis-related enzymes, C-glycosyltransferase, a resistance protein, and three regulatory proteins. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, a biosynthetic pathway for frigocyclinone was proposed. Second, to verify the cloned gene cluster, CRISPR-Cpf1 mediated gene disruption was conducted. Mutant with the disruption of beta-ketoacyl synthase encoding gene frig20 fully loses the ability of producing frigocyclinone, while inactivating the glycosyltransferase gene frig1 leads to the production of key intermediate of anti-MRSA anthraquinone tetrangomycin.	1
Title: Discovering chemical modifiers of oncogene-regulated hematopoietic differentiation Abstract: It has been proposed that inhibitors of an oncogene's effects on multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation may change the properties of the leukemic stem cells and complement the clinical use of cytotoxic drugs. Using zebrafish, we developed a robust in vivo hematopoietic differentiation assay that reflects the activity of the oncogene AML1-ETO. Screening for modifiers of AML1-ETO-mediated hematopoietic dysregulation uncovered unexpected roles of COX-2- and beta-catenin-dependent pathways in AML1-ETO function. This approach may open doors for developing therapeutics targeting oncogene function within leukemic stem cells.	0
Title: Quantum interferometric visibility as a witness of general relativistic proper time Abstract: Current attempts to probe general relativistic effects in quantum mechanics focus on precision measurements of phase shifts in matter-wave interferometry. Yet, phase shifts can always be explained as arising because of an Aharonov-Bohm effect, where a particle in a flat space-time is subject to an effective potential. Here we propose a quantum effect that cannot be explained without the general relativistic notion of proper time. We consider interference of a 'clock'-a particle with evolving internal degrees of freedom-that will not only display a phase shift, but also reduce the visibility of the interference pattern. According to general relativity, proper time flows at different rates in different regions of space-time. Therefore, because of quantum complementarity, the visibility will drop to the extent to which the path information becomes available from reading out the proper time from the 'clock'. Such a gravitationally induced decoherence would provide the first test of the genuine general relativistic notion of proper time in quantum mechanics.	0
Title: A linear nonribosomal octapeptide from Fusarium graminearum facilitates cell-to-cell invasion of wheat Abstract: Fusarium graminearum is a destructive wheat pathogen. No fully resistant cultivars are available. Knowledge concerning the molecular weapons of F. graminearum to achieve infection remains limited. Here, we report that deletion of the putative secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster fg3_54 compromises the pathogen's ability to infect wheat through cell-to-cell penetration. Ectopic expression of fgm4, a pathway-specific bANK-like regulatory gene, activates the transcription of the fg3_54 cluster in vitro. We identify a linear, C- terminally reduced and D-amino acid residue-rich octapeptide, fusaoctaxin A, as the product of the two nonribosomal peptide synthetases encoded by fg3_54. Chemically-synthesized fusaoctaxin A restores cell-to-cell invasiveness in fg3_54-deleted F. graminearum, and enables colonization of wheat coleoptiles by two Fusarium strains that lack the fg3_54 homolog and are nonpathogenic to wheat. In conclusion, our results identify fusaoctaxin A as a virulence factor required for cell-to-cell invasion of wheat by F. graminearum.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster for hatomarubigin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. strain 2238-SVT4 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. strain 2238-SVT4 produces hatomarubigins A, B, C, and D, which belong to the angucycline family. Among them, hatomarubigin D has a unique dimeric structure with a methylene linkage. PCR using aromatase and cyclase gene-specific primers identified the hrb gene cluster for angucycline biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. 2238-SVT4. The cluster consisted of 30 open reading frames, including those for the minimal polyketide synthase, ketoreductase, aromatase, cyclase, O-methyltransferase, oxidoreductase, and oxygenase genes. Expression of a part of the gene cluster containing hrbR1 to hrbX in Streptomyces lividans TK23 resulted in the production of hatomarubigins A, B, and C. Hatomarubigin D was obtained from the conversion of hatomarubigin C by a purified enzyme encoded by hrbY, among the remaining genes.	1
Title: Engineering robust microorganisms for organic acid production Abstract: Organic acids are an important class of compounds that can be produced by microbial conversion of renewable feedstocks and have huge demands and broad applications in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. An economically viable fermentation process for production of organic acids requires robust microbial cell factories with excellent tolerance to low pH conditions, high concentrations of organic acids, and lignocellulosic inhibitors. In this review, we summarize various strategies to engineer robust microorganisms for organic acid production and highlight their applications in a few recent examples.	0
Title: Attachment of cell-binding ligands to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides enables cytosolic translocation of complexed siRNA Abstract: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as nona-arginine (9R), poorly translocate siRNA into cells. Our studies demonstrate that attaching 9R to ligands that bind cell surface receptors quantitatively increases siRNA uptake and importantly, allows functional delivery of complexed siRNA. The mechanism involved accumulation of ligand-9R:siRNA microparticles on the cell membrane, which induced transient membrane inversion at the site of ligand-9R binding and rapid siRNA translocation into the cytoplasm. siRNA release also occurred late after endocytosis when the ligand was attached to the L isoform of 9R, but not the protease-resistant 9DR, prolonging mRNA knockdown. This critically depended on endosomal proteolytic activity, implying that partial CPP degradation is required for endosome-to-cytosol translocation. The data demonstrate that ligand attachment renders simple polycationic CPPs effective for siRNA delivery by restoring their intrinsic property of translocation.	0
Title: Structural analysis of a non-ribosomal halogenated cyclic peptide and its putative operon from Microcystis: implications for evolution of cyanopeptolins Abstract: The structure of the major peptide produced by Microcystis cf. wesenbergii NIVA-CYA 172/5, the halogenated heptapeptide cyanopeptolin-984, was determined using LC/MS/MS. A gene cluster encoding a peptide synthetase putatively producing a cyanopeptolin was cloned from the same strain and sequenced. The cluster consists of four genes encoding peptide synthetases and one gene encoding a halogenase. Two additional ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction were found in the 5' flanking sequence; one of these encodes an ABC transporter. The overall organization of the cyanopeptolin synthetase operon (mcn) resembles a previously analysed anabaenopeptilide synthetase operon (apd) from Anabaena strain 90. Phylogenetic analyses of the individual domains from Mcn, Apd and other cyanobacterial peptide synthetases showed clustering of the adenylation domains according to function irrespective of operon origin - indicating strong functional constraints across peptide synthetases. In contrast, the condensation and thiolation domains to a large extent grouped according to operon affiliation or position in the respective operons. Phylogenetic analyses of condensation domains indicated that N-terminal domains and domains that condense L-amino acids and D-amino acids, respectively, form three separate groups. Although recombination events are likely to be involved in the evolution of mcn, no clear evidence of genetic recombination between the two cyanopeptolin gene clusters was found. Within the genus Microcystis, microcystin and cyanopeptolin synthetases have an evolutionary history of genomic coexistence. However, the data indicated that the two classes of peptide synthetase gene clusters have evolved independently.	1
Title: Saturation mutagenesis of TsrA Ala4 unveils a highly mutable residue of thiostrepton A Abstract: Thiopeptides are post-translationally processed macrocyclic peptide metabolites, characterized by extensive backbone and side chain modifications that include a six-membered nitrogeneous ring, thiazol(in)e/oxazol(in)e rings, and dehydrated amino acid residues. Thiostrepton A, one of the more structurally complex and well-studied thiopeptides, contains a second macrocycle bearing a quinaldic acid moiety. Antibacterial, antimalarial, and anticancer properties have been described for thiostrepton A and other thiopeptides, although the molecular details for binding the cellular target in each case are not fully elaborated. We previously demonstrated that a mutation of the TsrA core peptide, Ala4Gly, supported the successful production of the corresponding thiostrepton variant. To more thoroughly probe the thiostrepton biosynthetic machinery's tolerance toward structural variation at the fourth position of the TsrA core peptide, we report here the saturation mutagenesis of this residue using a fosmid-dependent biosynthetic engineering method and the isolation of 16 thiostrepton analogues. Several types of side chain substitutions at the fourth position of TsrA, including those that introduce polar or branched hydrophobic residues are accepted, albeit with varied preferences. In contrast, proline and amino acid residues inherently charged at physiological pH are not well-tolerated at the queried site by the thiostrepton biosynthetic system. These newly generated thiostrepton analogues were assessed for their antibacterial activities and abilities to inhibit the proteolytic functions of the eukaryotic 20S proteasome. We demonstrate that the identity of the fourth amino acid residue in the thiostrepton scaffold is not critical for either ribosome or proteasome inhibition.	0
Title: Isolation and biochemical characterization of a novel lantibiotic mutacin from Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Certain members of the indigenous biota of humans produce antimicrobial substances called bacteriocins, which inhibit other bacteria, including members of their own species. One of these substances, mutacin, is made by Streptococcus mutans, a member of the oral biota. Mutacin inhibits other mutans streptococci as well as many gram-positive exogenous pathogens. Here, we report for the first time the purification and partial biochemical characterization of a lanthionine-containing mutacin peptide from S. mutants T8. The biologically active peptide was isolated from the broth cultures by ultrafiltration and differential precipitation. The final mutacin preparation was homogeneous as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A molecular mass of the peptide was estimated by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy to be 3,244.64 +/- 1.15 Da. Its amino acid composition indicates the presence of lanthionine and likely beta-methyllanthionine in a total of about 25 amino acids. Because alpha,beta-unsaturated amino acids, the precursors of lanthionine residues, are often found in lantibiotics, we carried out the addition reaction of the mutacin with N-(methyl)mercaptoacetamide. The subsequent electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of two reaction products with M(r)s of 3,350.45 and 3,456.0. These are interpreted as the mutacin molecule with the addition of one and two molecules of reagent to the unsaturated amino acids, respectively. Sequencing of the peptide revealed an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Asn-Arg-Trp-Trp-Gln-Gly-Val-Val.	1
Title: Auroramycin: A Potent Antibiotic from Streptomyces roseosporus by CRISPR-Cas9 Activation Abstract: Silent biosynthetic gene clusters represent a potentially rich source of new bioactive compounds. We report the discovery, characterization, and biosynthesis of a novel doubly glycosylated 24-membered polyene macrolactam from a silent biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces roseosporus by using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene cluster activation strategy. Structural characterization of this polyketide, named auroramycin, revealed a rare isobutyrylmalonyl extender unit and a unique pair of amino sugars. Relative and absolute stereochemistry were determined by using a combination of spectroscopic analyses, chemical derivatization, and computational analysis. The activated gene cluster for auroramycin production was also verified by transcriptional analyses and gene deletions. Finally, auroramycin exhibited potent anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) activity towards clinical drug-resistant isolates.	1
Title: M2@C79N (M = Y, Tb): isolation and characterization of stable endohedral metallofullerenes exhibiting M-M bonding interactions inside aza[80]fullerene cages Abstract: Y2@C79N and Tb2@C79N have been prepared by conducting the Kratschmer-Huffman electric-arc process under 20 Torr of N2 and 280 Torr of He with metal oxide-doped graphite rods. These new heterofullerenes were separated from the resulting mixture of empty cage fullerenes and endohedral fullerenes by chemical separation and a two-stage chromatographic process. Crystallographic data for Tb2@C79N x Ni(OEP) x 2 C6H6 demonstrate the presence of an 80-atom cage with idealized I(h) symmetry and two, widely separated Tb atoms inside with a Tb-Tb separation of 3.9020(10) A for the major terbium sites. The EPR spectrum of the odd-electron Y2@C79N indicates that the spin density largely resides on the two equivalent yttrium ions. Computational studies on Y2@C79N suggest that the nitrogen atom resides at a 665 ring junction in the equator on the fullerene cage and that the unpaired electron is localized in a bonding orbital between the two yttrium ions of this stable radical. Thus, the Tb-Tb bond length of the single-electron bond is an exceedingly long metal-metal bond.	0
Title: Identification and functional analysis of the aspergillic acid gene cluster in Aspergillus flavus Abstract: Aspergillus flavus can colonize important food staples and produce aflatoxins, a group of toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites. Previous in silico analysis of the A. flavus genome revealed 56 gene clusters predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. A. flavus secondary metabolites produced during infection of maize seed are of particular interest, especially with respect to their roles in the biology of the fungus. A predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene, designated asaC (AFLA_023020), present in the uncharacterized A. flavus secondary metabolite gene cluster 11 was previously shown to be expressed during the earliest stages of maize kernel infection. Cluster 11 is composed of six additional genes encoding a number of putative decorating enzymes as well as a transporter and transcription factor. We generated knock-out mutants of the seven predicted cluster 11 genes. LC-MS analysis of extracts from knockout mutants of these genes showed that they were responsible for the synthesis of the previously characterized antimicrobial mycotoxin aspergillic acid. Extracts of the asaC mutant showed no production of aspergillic acid or its precursors. Knockout of the cluster 11 P450 oxidoreductase afforded a pyrazinone metabolite, the aspergillic acid precursor deoxyaspergillic acid. The formation of hydroxyaspergillic acid was abolished in a desaturase/hydroxylase mutant. The hydroxamic acid functional group in aspergillic acid allows the molecule to bind to iron resulting in the production of a red pigment in A. flavus identified previously as ferriaspergillin. A reduction of aflatoxin B1 and cyclopiazonic acid that correlated with reduced fungal growth was observed in maize kernel infection assays when aspergillic acid biosynthesis in A. flavus is halted.	1
Title: Food-Poisoning Bacteria Employ a Citrate Synthase and a Type II NRPS To Synthesize Bolaamphiphilic Lipopeptide Antibiotics* Abstract: Mining the genome of the food-spoiling bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pv. cocovenenans revealed five nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, including an orphan gene locus (bol). Gene inactivation and metabolic profiling linked the bol gene cluster to novel bolaamphiphilic lipopeptides with antimycobacterial activity. A combination of chemical analysis and bioinformatics elucidated the structures of bolagladin A and B, lipocyclopeptides featuring an unusual dehydro-β-alanine enamide linker fused to an unprecedented tricarboxylic fatty acid tail. Through a series of targeted gene deletions, we proved the involvement of a designated citrate synthase (CS), priming ketosynthases III (KS III), a type II NRPS, including a novel desaturase for enamide formation, and a multimodular NRPS in generating the cyclopeptide. Network analyses revealed the evolutionary origin of the CS and identified cryptic CS/NRPS gene loci in various bacterial genomes.	1
Title: Mechanistic understanding of Pyrococcus horikoshii Dph2, a [4Fe-4S] enzyme required for diphthamide biosynthesis Abstract: Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin, is a unique posttranslational modification on eukaryotic and archaeal translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). The proposed biosynthesis of diphthamide involves three steps and we have recently found that in Pyrococcus horikoshii (P. horikoshii), the first step uses an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent [4Fe-4S] enzyme, PhDph2, to catalyze the formation of a C-C bond. Crystal structure shows that PhDph2 is a homodimer and each monomer contains three conserved cysteine residues that can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the reduced state, the [4Fe-4S] cluster can provide one electron to reductively cleave the bound SAM molecule. However, different from classical radical SAM family of enzymes, biochemical evidence suggest that a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is generated in PhDph2. Here we present evidence supporting that the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical does not undergo hydrogen abstraction reaction, which is observed for the deoxyadenosyl radical in classical radical SAM enzymes. Instead, the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is added to the imidazole ring in the pathway towards the formation of the product. Furthermore, our data suggest that the chemistry requires only one [4Fe-4S] cluster to be present in the PhDph2 dimer.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the orthosomycin antibiotic avilamycin A: deductions from the molecular analysis of the avi biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and production of new antibiotics Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the producer of avilamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a heptasaccharide side chain and a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the avilamycin A biosynthesis is of major interest as this information might set the direction for the development of new antimicrobial agents.                  Results:                       A 60-kb section of the S. viridochromogenes Tü57 chromosome containing genes involved in avilamycin biosynthesis was sequenced. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 54 open reading frames. Based on the putative function of the gene products a model for avilamycin biosynthesis is proposed. Inactivation of aviG4 and aviH, encoding a methyltransferase and a halogenase, respectively, prevented the mutant strains from producing the complete dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety resulting in the accumulation of new antibiotics named gavibamycins.                  Conclusions:                       The avilamycin A biosynthetic gene cluster represents an interesting system to study the formation and attachment of unusual deoxysugars. Several enzymes putatively responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. Two genes encoding enzymes involved in post-PKS tailoring reactions were deleted allowing the production of new analogues of avilamycin A.	1
Title: RP-1776, a novel cyclic peptide produced by Streptomyces sp., inhibits the binding of PDGF to the extracellular domain of its receptor Abstract: RP-1776, a novel cyclic peptide, was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. KY11784. RP-1776 selectively inhibited the binding of PDGF BB to the extracellular domain of the PDGF beta-receptor with an IC50 value of 11 +/- 6 microM. Detailed binding experiments suggested that RP-1776 directly interacts with PDGF BB. RP-1776 inhibited the phosphorylation of the PDGF beta-receptor induced by PDGF BB. These results suggested that RP-1776 antagonizes the signaling of PDGF BB probably through the inhibition of PDGF BB binding to the PDGF beta-receptor.	1
